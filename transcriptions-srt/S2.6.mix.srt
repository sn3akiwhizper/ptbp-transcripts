00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,180
Hello, my ever-present fan base.

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:06,200
It's your time jumping, dimension bumping,

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,480
grease pumping baby wolf the dog.

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,080
And I'm here to slurp up all the information of the worlds

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,200
and regurgitate it back into all y'all's mouths

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,520
like the baby birds y'all are.

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,660
Chirp, chirp, my hungry little chickadees.

8
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:27,460
Mama Wolf is bringing that good slop fresh out of her gullet.

9
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:28,440
Oh yeah.

10
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:33,440
We're also live from 694.2 PTBP or something, I guess.

11
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,740
And now speaking of sustenance,

12
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:40,180
this week's Howlin' with Wolf is from at Bagel Boy,

13
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:43,840
who tweeted about the show and tagged at Pretending Pod,

14
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,360
which is the third quickest way to make wolf salivate.

15
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,240
Bagel Boy writes, howdy wolf.

16
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,820
Just wanted to send some good vibes your way

17
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,960
and to tell you to stay greasy.

18
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,480
I'm new to the big city

19
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,880
and although everything right now is new and unfamiliar,

20
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm glad I got good old wolf to grace my hearing holes.

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,040
The city seems nice so far.

22
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,360
Aside from the fact that I've been mugged

23
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,560
four damn times this week,

24
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,160
I haven't seen a single damn police officer

25
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,520
since I got here.

26
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,160
Though I'll admit it does make me oddly feel

27
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:23,360
like I'm right back home in sleepy, quiet contention.

28
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,960
Anywho, keep up the good work over there

29
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,600
and I'll keep on tuning in over here.

30
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,360
Oh, and stay safe out here in the concrete jungle.

31
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,680
I wouldn't want to see my good friend wolf

32
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,760
on the evening news.

33
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:40,240
Thanks for writing into the show, boy of bagels.

34
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,960
I'm glad we got some listeners buzzing in

35
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,840
from old sleepy and quiet contention.

36
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,480
Never anything exciting or dimension altering

37
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,040
ever happened over there.

38
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,880
No sir, redo.

39
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,260
Nothing to see over there, that's for dang sure.

40
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,200
Ha, ha, ha.

41
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,920
If you want to write up something for your wolf to howl,

42
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,120
tag at pretending pod on Twitter or Instagram,

43
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,720
tag pretending to be people on Facebook,

44
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,360
or write up a five star review

45
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,580
on the podcast app of your choice.

46
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:16,000
Screenshot that stunning missive

47
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,720
and get it in front of old wolfy's eye holes

48
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,100
so I can say, hey, thanks.

49
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,880
Now raise your hands in the air

50
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,760
if you support this show on Patreon.

51
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,400
Wave them around, get weird with it.

52
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,920
Fuck everybody else because you, my delicious listener,

53
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,000
are keeping the proverbial lights metaphorically on

54
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,240
in this quote unquote studio.

55
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:45,640
In the ephemeral words of Dame Alyssa Arnett Elliott,

56
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,440
get your freak on.

57
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,840
In the words of Cal Colorado,

58
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,320
blah, blah, whatever, something about the news.

59
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:57,020
Last time, the field team for the City Action News

60
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:02,000
began in a familiar place, the CAN Conference Room.

61
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,200
But without Ty Frailand at the head of the table,

62
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,280
lead anchor Isabel Acaya took on the role

63
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,920
of handing out assignments and sent Cal Colorado and co

64
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:17,120
off on a wild goose chase to a mysterious drop pen

65
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,120
for exclusive coverage of a secret town

66
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,560
run by the Godel Company.

67
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,440
They were joined by Stevie, a production assistant

68
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,880
with a wall of dark wavy hair that covered all of her face

69
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,880
except a pierced bottom lip.

70
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:35,840
And the four members of City Action News drove and drove

71
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,040
further and further off the grid.

72
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,840
All the road signs told them to turn back,

73
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,560
but they carried on until the CAN van

74
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,240
approached a perspective engulfing wall

75
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,780
made of tree-lined vines and kudzu,

76
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:53,060
taking us now to the other side of this foresty facade,

77
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:57,420
this biennial barrier, the dam of detritus.

78
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:02,420
It's Altagirl with My Life is Great and It's All My Fault.

79
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,700
It's all my fault

80
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:10,700
Cause my life is great

81
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,700
And it's all mine

82
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:24,780
Cause my life is great

83
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,780
And it's all my fault

84
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,780
Were you at his house that said that?

85
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,780
I didn't say it was disgusting, but I was like

86
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:42,780
Well, you meant it

87
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:43,780
You are

88
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:44,780
I don't think it's disgusting.

89
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:48,780
I think it's thoroughly emasculating

90
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,780
Do you feel emasculating when I burp you?

91
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,780
To be burped like a baby

92
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,780
Well, so I don't think about being emasculating

93
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:00,780
because I don't think in terms like that, you know?

94
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:03,780
I don't feel like a father when I do it, if that helps

95
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,780
When I think of myself, I don't really think of myself

96
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:09,780
Yeah, you're more like a sexually dominant, like

97
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:10,780
Always

98
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:13,780
I don't really ever think of myself as a man

99
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:17,780
I'm like a boy that has to shave

100
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,780
I don't have a beard

101
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:20,780
Do you have to shave?

102
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,780
I thought you were saying, I don't have to

103
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,780
No, I don't have a beard, but I have to shave

104
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,780
Dude, literally, I shaved this morning

105
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:33,780
Yesterday at Ethan's house, Jake Herron was over there

106
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:34,780
and he's like

107
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,780
Shout out to Jake's Vegan Burgers

108
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:37,780
Are we recording?

109
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:38,780
I had the taco meat tonight

110
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:39,780
Oh, nice

111
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:40,780
Jake was on season one of the podcast

112
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,780
and on our Patreon

113
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,780
I hung out with Jake last night

114
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:47,780
Go listen to the, we were fighting the devil in Hawaii

115
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:48,780
or something

116
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,780
Yeah, a church group fighting the devil in Hawaii

117
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:54,780
He was like, dude, Luke, I've never seen you with facial hair

118
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,780
and I'm like, yeah, it's a mistake

119
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,780
I don't have facial hair

120
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:02,780
and this is something that I don't know that I've brought up

121
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:05,780
with you guys before, but I follow a Reddit

122
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:08,780
about what I have and they say, tell your friends

123
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:11,780
Have you ever noticed me picking at my face?

124
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:12,780
No

125
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:17,780
I have trichotillomania, which I pull my hair out

126
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:20,780
and it's like, I enjoy doing that

127
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,780
but it's like, you shouldn't do that

128
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:23,780
Specifically your face?

129
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:26,780
I should probably stop pulling hair out of your face, too

130
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,780
Wait, but the subreddit says that you should

131
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:31,780
tell all your friends

132
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,780
It's a callback from the last episode

133
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,780
It is, that's not make damn sure, is it?

134
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,780
No, I mean, it's by taking it

135
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,780
I know it's taking back Sunday, I just don't know

136
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,780
Anyway, some people it's like on their head

137
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,780
Some people it's like random parts of the body

138
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:48,780
So when I grow my facial hair out, it's only here and here

139
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:52,780
and it's because I literally just pick all the hair out of my cheeks

140
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:55,780
and I'm trying really hard to stop it

141
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:57,780
So if you see me doing that, tell me not to

142
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,780
So is it like a support group on Reddit kind of thing?

143
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:03,780
Yeah, it's like a join this so that you can think about doing it

144
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:04,780
so you stop doing it

145
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:05,780
Interesting

146
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:06,780
Should we get a spray bottle?

147
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,780
Yeah, just spray me when I do it

148
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:14,780
Literally, I can grow hair on my cheeks

149
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,780
Also, if you look at my middle fingernail

150
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:17,780
Did you just do it?

151
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:18,780
It's literally like

152
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,780
Luke, don't

153
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:24,780
It's like worn down because I pick like that

154
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:29,780
My thumb and middle fingernails have like indents

155
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:34,780
Is there a support group for grown adults who need to be burped like babies on Reddit?

156
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:38,780
See, that's a thing that I don't want to give up

157
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,780
And hey, here's the thing

158
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:44,780
And I'm not far enough, it's not a fetish yet

159
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:46,780
Luke, you let me know when it is

160
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:47,780
Yeah

161
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:48,780
But

162
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:49,780
Dude

163
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,780
I don't know, hopefully this isn't recorded

164
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:52,780
Or maybe it is

165
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,780
Maybe it is and you're out there and you have trichotillomania

166
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,780
It is recorded, is that okay?

167
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:00,780
That's fine because literally I would love to grow a beard

168
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:07,780
And the only thing stopping me from doing that is me picking the hairs out of my face

169
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,780
Just so you guys know

170
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,780
Spray me, baby

171
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:17,780
If we hit a certain Patreon goal, we're gonna get Luke a Hannibal Lecter mask

172
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:18,780
So he can't touch his face

173
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:23,780
I think it'd be more to just like glue oven mitts on my hands for a while

174
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:24,780
So I can't do it

175
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:25,780
Glue them

176
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:26,780
Glue them on me

177
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:27,780
Why not both?

178
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,780
Fuck day

179
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:32,780
Glue oven mitts to my face like a Hannibal Lecter

180
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:38,780
And then all your hair gets ripped out when we take it off

181
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:40,780
Solved

182
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:42,780
Look how long his beard was

183
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:49,780
And then I was gonna make like a ripping your pubes joke out but that's a real thing

184
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,780
Yeah, ouchie, ouchie

185
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:52,780
Ouchie, ouchie

186
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:53,780
So

187
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:56,780
We saw some cool shit at the end of the last episode

188
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,780
It was like fucking cool, dude

189
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:06,780
What do you remember? What is the vision in your mind of what you saw at the end of the last episode?

190
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:13,780
Crazy ravine where no ravine should be behind a crazy wall where no wall should be

191
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:21,780
With a train where no train should be leading over a gigantic fucking bridge where no bridge should be

192
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:22,780
Well said

193
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:31,780
During our break I was just like googling Blaine the Mono which is like the scary train from the Dark Tower series

194
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,780
Okay

195
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:36,780
I've got three opened up here, scroll through them, but that's what I was imagining

196
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:39,780
Oh, duh, these look like evil trains, dudes

197
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,780
Yeah, straight up evil trains, bro

198
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,780
Train one had kind of tentacles or something underneath it

199
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:44,780
Well

200
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:45,780
No tentacles on this one

201
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:51,780
I didn't think there were but it seems Cthulhu-y to have tentacles

202
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:52,780
Cthulhu-onian

203
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:53,780
But also

204
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:54,780
Cthulhu-onian

205
00:09:54,780 --> 00:10:01,780
If you guys haven't listened to, I say listened to the Dark Tower series because I read the first book and the last book

206
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,780
And I listened to all the rest of them

207
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:07,780
Listen to the Dark Tower series, it's really good

208
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:09,780
If you like Delta Green, holy shit, bro

209
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:12,780
If you like Delta Green, don't fucking listen to the Dark Tower

210
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,780
Listen to Pretending to Be People

211
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,780
Season one

212
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,780
Scary, very scary

213
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:25,780
Also, his name is Blaine the Mono because Blaine the Train I guess is too stupid

214
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:30,780
It all seems pretty stupid

215
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:35,780
I don't know, you do a bunch of coke and write a whole series

216
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:36,780
Okay

217
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:38,780
Challenge accepted, yeah

218
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:43,780
No, like the little faces on the train are so dumb

219
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,780
Like the mean eyes

220
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,780
None of those are like

221
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:50,780
I'm Blaine the Mono, don't call me Blaine the Train

222
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:51,780
I'm evil

223
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,780
That's why I'm angry

224
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:57,780
Everybody keeps calling me Blaine the Train

225
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:01,780
Um, the train I guess isn't sentient though

226
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:04,780
No, it's pretty simple looking

227
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:05,780
Aw, damn

228
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,780
Oh, I thought you meant Blaine

229
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,780
Oh, Blaine is sentient for sure, bro

230
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:12,780
He's definitely sentient

231
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:20,780
I wanted to clarify, is this bridge that is extending outward from us across the ravine, first of all?

232
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:21,780
Yes

233
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:24,780
And you said 100 meters long, does that mean we can see the other side?

234
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:25,780
Yes

235
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:26,780
Okay, what's on the other side?

236
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,780
The same thing that's on your side

237
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:29,780
Which is?

238
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:30,780
A train station and a wall

239
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,780
A train station and a wall

240
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:33,780
And a wall

241
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:34,780
Fuck that

242
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,780
That's creepy

243
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:39,780
And so the fog is all settled in the ravine below us

244
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,780
You said a deep foggy ravine

245
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,780
Yep, the fog is settled in the ravine below you

246
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:44,780
Cool

247
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:50,780
I need everyone to roll grip, as this is a deeply unnatural sight

248
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:54,780
I pass a 20 out of 75

249
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,780
If you fail, you're just going to lose one grip

250
00:11:56,780 --> 00:12:01,780
I was going to say, I pass enough that I don't even have to look up what mine is

251
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:02,780
3

252
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:03,780
Rolled a 3

253
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,780
I rolled an 87, which is a failure

254
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:06,780
Which is a failure

255
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:13,780
So you're going to lose one grip, and with that, as you guys are looking around this area, Cal is...

256
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:20,780
You don't know this about me, or maybe you do, but I happen to be an avid student of local geography

257
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,780
And this ravine should not be here

258
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,780
This ravine can't be here

259
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:27,780
Well, I mean, we're looking right at it, dude, it's right there

260
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:30,780
I know it's here, but it shouldn't be

261
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,780
Are you getting this? Are you getting shots of this?

262
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:33,780
Beck definitely is

263
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:40,780
We're 87 minutes away from my home, and there could be one, I don't know

264
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:46,780
This ravine would be a national park, if it was natural

265
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:50,780
Does it look natural, or is it smooth walled or something weird?

266
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:57,780
Go ahead and roll if you have any sort of science, or I'll take intelligence at a negative 20

267
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:59,780
Any of us, or him?

268
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:00,780
Any of you

269
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:06,780
Oh my god, at a negative 20, that makes my intelligence 50?

270
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:07,780
I got a 51

271
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,780
Oh, I can roll on intelligence?

272
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:13,780
Mine is 20, yeah

273
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:16,780
Oh, I pass with flying freaking colors, bro

274
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:19,780
At a negative 20, I'm also a 50, and I rolled a 50

275
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:23,780
Nice, we got a success there, and we got a success from Julius Summers

276
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:26,780
Julius Summers is the only one who really notices

277
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:29,780
And I only say that because Cal Colorado is dealing with

278
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:41,780
Yeah, loss of grip, and on top of the loss of grip, just the itchiest face, hands, and arms that he's felt since he was a boy

279
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:42,780
Not to touch my face

280
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,780
Oh, you fell face forward, sir

281
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:45,780
Critical fail

282
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,780
I didn't realize that Cal's money maker was

283
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:50,780
Oh, it's gonna be a time frame situation at this point

284
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:56,780
With the crit fail, I think all your clothes came off real quick, you rolled around in it, and then they all flew back on

285
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:57,780
Yeah

286
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:01,780
Yeah, no, you are working on a time crunch to your face not being camera ready

287
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:04,780
Stevie, do you have any concealer? Do you have any

288
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:08,780
Yeah, and she's right on it, and she's getting into her makeup bag and coming at your face

289
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:12,780
Stevie, you're practically a Marvin, you don't know what that means, but

290
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:17,780
Julius feels deeply insulted by that comment

291
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:24,780
Julius is far too busy staring at the deeply unnatural sides of this rock

292
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:34,780
You can't quite put your finger on it, but it's nothing that you've ever seen before, this is not a natural occurrence, I need you to roll grip

293
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:35,780
Haha

294
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:39,780
And yeah, I like what Joe said earlier, let's say it's really smooth

295
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:40,780
Yeah

296
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:41,780
Cool, I like that

297
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,780
I'm unaffected with a five

298
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:51,780
Amazing, so you know that this is not normal, it may not have ever happened before, but

299
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:54,780
No, not but, but so

300
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,780
It's a kick ass

301
00:14:56,780 --> 00:15:08,780
Julius pulls his phone out, goes to TikTok, thinks it's the perfect time for the calzone

302
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:11,780
Cal, could you stand next

303
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:14,780
It's much better Mr. Colorado now, it's much better

304
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:21,780
Julius points his phone at Cal and looks at his phone to see like how good he looks on his screen

305
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:22,780
Sure

306
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:23,780
Does it look good

307
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:24,780
Yes

308
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:25,780
Is he made up

309
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:26,780
Yeah and honestly it's

310
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:27,780
Maybe you slide over to a filter

311
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,780
Oh for sure, yeah

312
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:37,780
Well one of the things that Julius did on the way here was, because he didn't have to drive, was make a can filter

313
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:40,780
Specifically made for Cal, Colorado

314
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:41,780
A calcan?

315
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:45,780
The calcan, the calcam for the calzone

316
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,780
The calcam for the calzone

317
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,780
The calcam for the calzone

318
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:53,780
And it perfectly matches his skin tone or something

319
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:58,780
No, it's just like any blemishes or anything are kind of like smoothed over a little bit

320
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:10,780
Okay so you need to get this poison oak faced, elderly, older statesman of anchors to dance like a monkey for your TikTok

321
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:12,780
While he's just lost grip

322
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:15,780
We are not dancing for this calzone

323
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:18,780
Look at where we are, this is insane dude

324
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,780
I'm saying this to the DM

325
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:26,780
Cal

326
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:27,780
Julius

327
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:30,780
Get next to the edge and we're gonna do a calzone

328
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,780
You want me to go on right now?

329
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:33,780
You want me to be on?

330
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:36,780
Well you don't have to be on, we can practice it, it's a TikTok

331
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:39,780
You can practice a TikTok?

332
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,780
We don't even have to record the first time

333
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:46,780
I've spent 30 years on air living on the razor jads of live TV

334
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,780
Have you ever thought about acting?

335
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:50,780
I'm mostly thinking about itching

336
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:53,780
Well they're from what I've heard one and the same

337
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,780
I'll make a note of that

338
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:58,780
Right now I'm acting very hard

339
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:04,780
Well then let's not make you act too hard

340
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:10,780
And he just starts recording just video that way he can upload it to TikTok later

341
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:14,780
I'm here in front of an unholy monstrosity

342
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:19,780
The god old corporation in their avarice has torn a trench into mother earth

343
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:20,780
Make it fun

344
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,780
It's very deep and broad

345
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,780
Like the dance that you're gonna do

346
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:33,780
Cal just looks at the camera and like bewilderment and confusion

347
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:37,780
Who could dance at a moment like this?

348
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:38,780
Not this reporter

349
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:41,780
Julius cuts it off right after like not this reporter

350
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:44,780
And he's like okay, perfect, I got this

351
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:49,780
And then he just starts editing the can talk together

352
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:54,780
Hey man, we have like TikTok quotas or whatever

353
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,780
But like maybe we wait to post that

354
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:59,780
My uncle told me to do TikToks

355
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,780
Yeah, for sure

356
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:07,780
I just don't know if like we like we're kind of in the middle of like figuring out what this is

357
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:11,780
Like what if it's like, you know a nuclear test site

358
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,780
We don't want people like rushing out here to see it

359
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,780
Understandable

360
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:19,780
He continues editing the TikTok

361
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:23,780
Cool man, I'm glad you heard me

362
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:28,780
Beck, anytime you want to talk to me, I'm here to listen

363
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:30,780
That means a lot dude, thanks

364
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:33,780
Yeah, and then he finishes editing the TikTok

365
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,780
And he doesn't post it, but he sends it to his uncle

366
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,780
Interesting

367
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:44,780
So looking at this simple train car in this simple train station

368
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,780
All seemingly made out of steel

369
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:49,780
All built for this one single car

370
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:55,780
You see that there are lockers adjacent on the exterior wall of the station

371
00:18:55,780 --> 00:19:00,780
And above it the sign of course says, welcome to Grover's Gorge

372
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:06,780
Founded by Frank Godel in 1945 by necessity not choice

373
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:12,780
I know it was founded by Frank Godel, but what if it was founded by Grover from Sesame Street

374
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,780
Let's just all take a moment to imagine that

375
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,780
I actually saw that What If episode

376
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,780
Is What If a show?

377
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,780
Are you thinking of What Would You Do?

378
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,780
What If with John Quiñones

379
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,780
With John Quiñones

380
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,780
What?

381
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,780
What Would You Do with John Quiñones?

382
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,780
John Quiñones

383
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,780
Yeah, Quiñones

384
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:38,780
Quiñones

385
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:40,780
You've never seen What Would You Do?

386
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,780
The whole premise of the show is like

387
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:46,780
We get actors to do really shitty things in public

388
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:49,780
And then we see what the public does

389
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,780
What Would You Do?

390
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:54,780
What would you do if a guy beat up a little kid?

391
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,780
What would you do if he was at home

392
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,780
Sixteen seasons

393
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,780
February 26, 2008, the present

394
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,780
I've never even heard of this show

395
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,780
The thing that kills me, Thomas, is that you're not alone in that

396
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,780
There's a lot of people who haven't seen it

397
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:07,780
But for some reason

398
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:08,780
I've seen like every episode

399
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,780
Everybody on the show that ends up being on the show

400
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:13,780
They go, oh my god, it's John Quiñones

401
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:16,780
As if they all know him and he's a big celebrity

402
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,780
It was created by Chris Whipple

403
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:20,780
Which is a very fun name

404
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:21,780
That is a very fun name

405
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:22,780
Chris Whipple

406
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,780
Not a fun show, really, though

407
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:25,780
Zach, I don't want to harp on this ravine

408
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,780
But I just realized we didn't ask what was down left or right

409
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:30,780
Like, how far can we see? How far does this ravine go?

410
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:33,780
So you can actually even really see how deep the ravine is

411
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,780
Or how far left or right it is

412
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,780
Because it's so foggy

413
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:39,780
You can see to the other side

414
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,780
That a hundred meters across

415
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:44,780
But the fog is just filling up this ravine

416
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,780
And then the fog kind of

417
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:52,780
Takes over the land far down on the left and far down on the right

418
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:55,780
So you can't even see the end of these walls

419
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:57,780
Of massive plant life

420
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:00,780
If there were another bridge like the one we're looking at

421
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:01,780
Would you be able to see it?

422
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:02,780
If there was one

423
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,780
You would be able to see it

424
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:07,780
If it was within about a hundred meters of you on either side

425
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:09,780
Okay, and we don't see anything

426
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:13,780
Beck, could I borrow a mic clip?

427
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,780
Sure, of course, dude

428
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:18,780
Hey, Stevie, would you grab a mic clip out of there?

429
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:19,780
Yeah, of course, yeah

430
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:20,780
Here you go, sir

431
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,780
Julius grabs the mic clip

432
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:25,780
And he shows it to Beck

433
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:28,780
He's like, can you get audio from this?

434
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,780
Yeah, oh yeah, for sure

435
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:31,780
Hang on a second

436
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:33,780
He wires it up to the receiver

437
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:36,780
Could you do it unwired?

438
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:37,780
Do what unwired?

439
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:40,780
Bluetooth, perhaps?

440
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,780
What are you getting at, man?

441
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:43,780
I'm gonna throw it

442
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,780
Oh no, we can't afford to lose a whole mic, dude

443
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:49,780
This is your first serious error as a producer

444
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:52,780
The network will not be pleased to hear about how you wanted to use their equipment

445
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:55,780
And unfortunately, Beck and I are duty bound to report it

446
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,780
I will say Beck did

447
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:01,780
Beck did say we have so many of those

448
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,780
Yeah, it's for like, you know, miking up people

449
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:06,780
But like, we're not gonna like toss them over ravines

450
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:09,780
Sometimes you have to interview a group of school children

451
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:10,780
Or perhaps a church choir

452
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:13,780
Can I roll to see if this is Bluetooth or wired?

453
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,780
It's wired for sure

454
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,780
Wired for sound

455
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:21,780
So yeah, Julius throws the mic with the mic clip over the side

456
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:24,780
But then it just like six feet later stops

457
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,780
Cause it's wired in

458
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,780
What can you hear, Julius?

459
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,780
Not what I want to do

460
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:34,780
And Stevie's walking up and noticing your headphones

461
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:37,780
Beck and she's like, Mr. Wilder, those are some sweet cans

462
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:39,780
Dude, thanks!

463
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:40,780
And I knuckle, Stevie

464
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:41,780
Knuckle

465
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:44,780
Cal Colorado gets like a chill down his spine

466
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,780
As if he's heard that voice from someone else in a past life

467
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,780
Another faithful

468
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,780
That was smart, I am smart

469
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:58,780
Hey, Julius, like if you're trying to like get a sense of like the depth here

470
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:00,780
We could just do the old fashion way

471
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:01,780
And Beck finds a rock

472
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,780
Dosses it over the edge to listen for the sound

473
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,780
And you listen

474
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,780
And you listen

475
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:09,780
And you listen

476
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:13,780
As if you threw a rock off of a cliff

477
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:16,780
9.82 meters per second squared, right?

478
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:17,780
Uh huh

479
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:19,780
You're asking the right people

480
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:23,780
Down about somewhere like 836 feet

481
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:26,780
Like basically 80 stories

482
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,780
And then you hear just

483
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:31,780
Of a rock hitting water

484
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:33,780
It sounds like it's about 80 stories down

485
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,780
Uh, there's water down there

486
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,780
I don't even think we'd be able to hear that

487
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,780
No, but once I started talking

488
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:43,780
I was like, well, fuck

489
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:44,780
No, I heard it

490
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:45,780
Cause the mic

491
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:46,780
I know I heard it

492
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:47,780
The mic's hanging over the edge there

493
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:48,780
And I picked it up on my headphones

494
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,780
Good work, Julius

495
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:55,780
On this simple single train car

496
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:57,780
You see two steel doors

497
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:58,780
One toward the rear

498
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:00,780
One toward the front

499
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:02,780
And they both slide open

500
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,780
Without obstructing the large lettering

501
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:07,780
Laid out under the train car's windows

502
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,780
It says

503
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:14,780
My uncle didn't tell me

504
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:16,780
That this is what we would be looking at

505
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:19,780
But I think if we go in

506
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:22,780
I can impress my uncle

507
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:23,780
If I recall correctly

508
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,780
Your uncle didn't tell you anything

509
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:27,780
You haven't been in contact with him

510
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:28,780
Julius goes in

511
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:30,780
And acts like he doesn't hear this

512
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:32,780
Given that assignment by

513
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,780
Julius walks right into the train

514
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:35,780
The woman who took my job

515
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:37,780
And actively

516
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:39,780
Actively doesn't hear this

517
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,780
Looking out over the bridge

518
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,780
Is it also enveloped in fog

519
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,780
Or can we see, like, the center clearly

520
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:47,780
You can see the center of the bridge clearly

521
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:49,780
Is there anything distinguishing, like

522
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,780
This is a Thomas question, not a Cal question

523
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:52,780
Okay

524
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:53,780
This is a Zach answer

525
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:56,780
Does it look like a train is blinking out of existence

526
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:57,780
In the middle of the bridge or something

527
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,780
Like there's evidence of, like, cartoonish

528
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:00,780
Burn patterns or something

529
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:02,780
If Thomas is asking no

530
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:03,780
Cal's looking at the center of the bridge

531
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,780
It doesn't look like anything weird

532
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,780
Is gonna happen in the middle

533
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:10,780
I think if we get in this train

534
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:12,780
We'll just pass uneventfully

535
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:13,780
To the other station

536
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:15,780
Perhaps that's where this gate is

537
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,780
Julius walks into the train

538
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,780
And finds the snack cart

539
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:21,780
Stevie's, uh

540
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:22,780
Gathering up all the equipment

541
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,780
And dragging it up into the back

542
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:26,780
And the seating in this train car

543
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:28,780
Is similar to the types of train cars

544
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:30,780
That have a narrow aisle

545
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,780
Running down the middle of the car

546
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:34,780
With two seats on either side

547
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:35,780
Oh you mean

548
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:37,780
All trains

549
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:39,780
So with five rows

550
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:41,780
There's enough space here

551
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:42,780
For

552
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:48,780
Magic

553
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:49,780
20 passengers

554
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:50,780
Oh

555
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:52,780
Sitting

556
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:53,780
20 sitting passengers

557
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:55,780
Magical schooler

558
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:56,780
There are some cabinets

559
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:58,780
In which Julius finds

560
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:00,780
Some light refreshments

561
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:01,780
Energy drink

562
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:02,780
Energy drink

563
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:03,780
And pretzels

564
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:05,780
I like to think that energy drink

565
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:07,780
Is made by the Godel Corporation

566
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:09,780
Is just a plain, like, aluminum

567
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:11,780
Unpainted can with energy drink

568
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:13,780
Painted in the same green

569
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:14,780
That, like, the

570
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:16,780
That was on the wall outside

571
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:17,780
It's perfect

572
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,780
And yeah, you find some energy drinks

573
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:20,780
There

574
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,780
And there are large windows

575
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,780
On either side of this steel train car

576
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:26,780
Which kind of looks like a giant can of energy drink

577
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:28,780
Which does

578
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:30,780
And the lettering is green

579
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:31,780
So it matches

580
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:32,780
Is this the can tram?

581
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:33,780
This is the can tram

582
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:34,780
Fuck yeah

583
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:36,780
Cal steps on and says

584
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:37,780
Now it's the cal tram

585
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:39,780
And there's TV screens

586
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:41,780
Mounted in both the front and the rear

587
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:43,780
The modern flat screens

588
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,780
Flicker to life

589
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:46,780
As you all enter

590
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:47,780
And you see a blank

591
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:49,780
White sound stage

592
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:50,780
With a white stool

593
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:51,780
On the screens

594
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:53,780
Oh if your stool is white

595
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,780
You should probably get that checked out

596
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:56,780
Yeah, definitely

597
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:57,780
Like some like

598
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,780
Sun dried dog poop

599
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:00,780
Yeah, that's

600
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:01,780
That is not natural

601
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:02,780
You don't see much of that

602
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:03,780
You said stool

603
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:04,780
So we thought

604
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:05,780
Poop, white poop

605
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:07,780
A man walks into frame

606
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:08,780
Sits on the stool

607
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:09,780
Oh no

608
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:11,780
Stool, you said it again

609
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:14,780
And smiles

610
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:15,780
Joe, when he says stool

611
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,780
What do you think of?

612
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,780
No, I think of a seat with four legs

613
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:22,780
What are you guys?

614
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:25,780
Oh, I think a big poopy

615
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:26,780
Actually, stool

616
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:27,780
It's medical

617
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,780
I think of a very gross poopy

618
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:31,780
When we start calling it stool

619
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,780
There's a reason it's been collected

620
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:34,780
And it can't be good

621
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:36,780
A man walks into the frame

622
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,780
Sits on the stool

623
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:41,780
And smiles at the viewer

624
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:42,780
Well hello there

625
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:44,780
Cal says hello

626
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:46,780
I'm Fred Godel

627
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:47,780
And you see the Fred Godel

628
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,780
He's a soft looking man

629
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:50,780
In his later 60s

630
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:52,780
With a loose plumpness

631
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:53,780
And glasses

632
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,780
That consistently look like

633
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,780
They're about to fall off of his nose

634
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,780
With black pants and shoes

635
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:00,780
Fred's green shirt

636
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:03,780
Is the only pop of color in the shot

637
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:05,780
Welcome to Godel's Gate

638
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:07,780
To Grover's Gorge

639
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:09,780
I'm overjoyed that you're here to join me

640
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:11,780
On a tour of the future

641
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:13,780
Before we begin

642
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:16,780
Please leave all outside food and beverages

643
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:18,780
In the complimentary lockers

644
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,780
On the outside of this here

645
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:23,780
Simple steel single train car sized train station

646
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:26,780
Fred Godel points his finger into the air

647
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,780
And a purple light comes on

648
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:31,780
This one means there's still

649
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:34,780
Outside food or beverages in the car

650
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,780
He moves his hand a bit over

651
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,780
And a green light comes on

652
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:40,780
This one means you're good to go

653
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:43,780
So which light stays on?

654
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:44,780
Definitely the purple

655
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:46,780
With Stevie's huge bag of awesome snacks

656
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:47,780
Yeah

657
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:50,780
And Stevie kind of looks at the screen

658
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:52,780
With this like anger

659
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:54,780
As she goes down to the bag

660
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:56,780
And is like ugh

661
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:58,780
Guys I think I got to get rid of all these snacks

662
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:00,780
I'm sorry the cooler

663
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,780
But did you finish the coke in that energy drink

664
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:03,780
That I brought you?

665
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:04,780
Yeah but hang on a sec

666
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:06,780
And Beck is getting into her bag

667
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:07,780
And finding energy drinks

668
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,780
And is chugging

669
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:11,780
Like at least one if you guys want to get in on this

670
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:12,780
Julius does not

671
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:14,780
I've got a thought

672
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:16,780
Maybe leave one of those for last

673
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:18,780
And see if the light stays purple

674
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:20,780
Yeah of course Cal

675
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:22,780
Let me just get

676
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:24,780
Topped up here real quick

677
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:25,780
Hang on

678
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:27,780
Do you need to be burped?

679
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:29,780
While this is happening

680
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:31,780
Julius is going to wander up there

681
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:33,780
And see if he can't just like

682
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:35,780
Turn the light off or something

683
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:37,780
Yeah it's just kind of these like

684
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,780
Colored bulbs over the top

685
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,780
Of where the light is

686
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,780
And just the bulb on the outside

687
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:45,780
Is the coloration that's making it

688
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:47,780
So Julius's hand

689
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,780
Over the light doesn't

690
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:51,780
As Julius puts his hand

691
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,780
Over the purple light

692
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:55,780
His hand kind of turns

693
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:56,780
Purplish

694
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:57,780
Right like

695
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:58,780
I'm not saying that it's going to change

696
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:00,780
I'm saying like just if it's covered up

697
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:01,780
Like

698
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:03,780
There's nobody else on the train right?

699
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,780
They're not going to know

700
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:07,780
But the train knows Julius

701
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:10,780
Exactly

702
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:11,780
Julius

703
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,780
Continues to hold his hand over the light

704
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:14,780
Just to see

705
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:15,780
It's not doing anything

706
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:16,780
Still doesn't

707
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:18,780
I let Stevie go ahead and finish

708
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:20,780
Putting the bag outside the train car

709
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:21,780
Whatever she was doing

710
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:22,780
I've gotten my fill

711
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:23,780
And we are keeping one

712
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,780
Energy drink with us to see

713
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:26,780
Okay so

714
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:28,780
I got rid of all of the snacks and drinks

715
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:30,780
That we brought except for

716
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:32,780
And she flicks a finger

717
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:33,780
At the one in Beck's hand

718
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:35,780
And then we look to the light

719
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:37,780
And the light is still purple

720
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:39,780
We actually got rid of

721
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:41,780
All the drinks

722
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:42,780
And then he

723
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:44,780
And then he looks at the light

724
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:50,780
Are you trying to fool the light with a lie?

725
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:52,780
Julius looks at you and goes

726
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:53,780
No

727
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:55,780
As he nods his head up and down

728
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:01,780
I don't know what kind of detection system

729
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:03,780
They have for this outside food or drink

730
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:06,780
But I don't think it's based on your word

731
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:11,780
Have you ever been in an autonomous train

732
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:14,780
That knows whether you have a drink or not?

733
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:16,780
No but I've been on a roller coaster

734
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:17,780
And they just ask you there

735
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:20,780
But this light seems more insistent

736
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:22,780
Exactly

737
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:23,780
Now that you mentioned it Cal

738
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:25,780
How do they know though?

739
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:26,780
Like

740
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:28,780
And then Beck wants to see if there's a camera

741
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:30,780
Or anything in here that he can spot

742
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:33,780
Every single part of this wall is cameras and sensors

743
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:36,780
Yeah go ahead and roll search

744
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:38,780
Or you can roll computer science

745
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:41,780
I got a 48

746
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:43,780
Which is good for my computer science

747
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:45,780
So you know where to look

748
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,780
Which is behind this kind of like

749
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,780
Black sheen plastic

750
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:50,780
The top middle

751
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:52,780
The front of this train cabin

752
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:53,780
Above the TV

753
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:54,780
Sheen

754
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:55,780
Very ethical corporation

755
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:59,780
And you see if you walk real close up to it

756
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:01,780
You see that there's a

757
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:03,780
A red blinking light on it

758
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:05,780
Did anyone else succeed?

759
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:06,780
I did succeed at search

760
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:07,780
Bro

761
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:09,780
Yeah so the two of you noticed

762
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:11,780
That there are sensors of some sort

763
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:13,780
On the doors

764
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:14,780
And the entrances

765
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:16,780
On the front and back

766
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:18,780
Entrances of this train car

767
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:19,780
What do you see there Beck?

768
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:20,780
Yeah I guess like

769
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:21,780
Smile dudes

770
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:22,780
We're on candid camera

771
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:24,780
And I'm no tech wizard like you

772
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:26,780
But it appears to be

773
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:28,780
There are some sensors on this door

774
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:29,780
Food sensors

775
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:30,780
Cal

776
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:32,780
Dude

777
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:33,780
Good work

778
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:34,780
You're right man

779
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:35,780
Those are sensors

780
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:38,780
You're getting the hang of this tech stuff my man

781
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:39,780
Cal is like

782
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:41,780
Openly blushing a little bit behind the makeup

783
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:43,780
It might just be the flush of like a

784
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:44,780
Poison oaked face

785
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:48,780
But he really like

786
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:49,780
Nothing gets his old heart

787
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:51,780
Glatter than a young person saying

788
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:54,780
He did something right with technology

789
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:57,780
Julius takes his hands off the light

790
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:59,780
And he walks up to Beck

791
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:03,780
And Beck I think

792
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:04,780
If you want that

793
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:05,780
You better drink it

794
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:07,780
Dude waste not want not

795
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,780
Wow he drank that really fast

796
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:13,780
Beck is wired

797
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:17,780
That was the sound of Joe actually drinking an energy drink

798
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:20,780
Did Beck have his camera recording already?

799
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:21,780
Oh yeah

800
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:22,780
Oh yeah

801
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:23,780
It hasn't stopped

802
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:25,780
After his third energy drink in three minutes

803
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:26,780
He's a little wired and just like

804
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:29,780
Pointed his camera right at the camera

805
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:30,780
I see you

806
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:33,780
The watcher sees the watchman man

807
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:35,780
So

808
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,780
You can play that game

809
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:38,780
Train go

810
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:41,780
Well so we've now downed the can

811
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:42,780
And I guess I'll throw the can out the door

812
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:45,780
As soon as the can flies out the door

813
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:46,780
I say train go

814
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:49,780
Zach asks you all a question

815
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:53,780
In the same way that you guys ask me these kinds of questions

816
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:57,780
Did you try to sneak any additional food or bev?

817
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:58,780
We're not going to pull out like

818
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:00,780
Oh by the way I still

819
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:04,780
Actually I had peanuts in your pocket and your light's fucking dumb

820
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:05,780
Idiot

821
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:07,780
You didn't

822
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:10,780
I didn't say Simon said didn't have any food

823
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:13,780
So Simon says the light turns green

824
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:15,780
The door shuts

825
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:17,780
Hey guys I do have like six hamburgers in my pocket

826
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:20,780
Oh yeah I've got a bunch of wet lasagna

827
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:23,780
Just leaking down from my hand pockets

828
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:25,780
Dude I have to pee and poop

829
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:29,780
As the simple steel train car begins making its way down the track

830
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:32,780
It does so at a quick clip

831
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:39,780
The flat screens show an animation that follows along with a serious voiceover

832
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:42,780
In 1945

833
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:47,780
The world defeated men with evil in their hearts

834
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:49,780
Later that year

835
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:53,780
Evil itself was extinguished

836
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:55,780
Out of the windows

837
00:34:56,780 --> 00:35:00,780
You see a palm sweat inducing drop

838
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:03,780
As the velocity of this train

839
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:07,780
Has whipped up enough of this fog

840
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:10,780
That it's moving up out of the ravine

841
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:12,780
And towards the clouds

842
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:16,780
And you can see deep 836 feet down

843
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:19,780
Almost 80 stories which would make this

844
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:23,780
The 21st tallest bridge in the world

845
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:27,780
The only thing that kept Frank Godel fighting those years

846
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:30,780
Was the thought of coming back home

847
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:32,780
And marrying his sweetheart

848
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:37,780
But Frank, freshly back from stamping out evil overseas

849
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:41,780
Returned only to find evil at his doorstep

850
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:43,780
Threatening his future

851
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:46,780
Looking back at the cliffside you just stood at

852
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:52,780
You can all see just how smooth and strange this wall face is

853
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:55,780
Like nothing you've ever seen before

854
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:58,780
The fight between Frank Godel and this evil

855
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:03,780
Lasted for 13 hours and 56 minutes

856
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:09,780
And the final blow to defeat evil caused this massive crevice

857
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:13,780
Frank fought the fucking ball-rog?

858
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:15,780
On the left hand side of the train

859
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:20,780
The fog in this absurdly deep canyon clears out even more

860
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:22,780
And you see a church building

861
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,780
Still mostly intact

862
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:27,780
But completely upside down

863
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:32,780
Awkwardly stabilized by jutting rocks from both sides

864
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:36,780
The steeple reaches out for the water below

865
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:39,780
But the house of God is well stuck

866
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:44,780
Frank Godel stood tall and victorious after this contest

867
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:46,780
You can see on your left hand side

868
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:48,780
The church did not

869
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:53,780
In its place, the Godel Company cared for Grover's Gorge

870
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:58,780
And kept its residents fed, clothed, housed and safe

871
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:01,780
The screen quickly cuts back to Fred Godel

872
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:05,780
Sitting in his green shirt on his white stool

873
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:08,780
And the Godel Company has continued that practice

874
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:11,780
Into these modern times

875
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:14,780
So open your heart, open your eyes

876
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:16,780
And open your mind

877
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:21,780
Let me show you a future without hunger, without pain

878
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:24,780
Welcome to Grover's Gorge

879
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:33,780
Holy shit dude, this is dope as fuck

880
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:36,780
Oh damn

881
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:40,780
And as the simple steel train car stops, you're on the other side

882
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:44,780
Strangely, it feels identical

883
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:47,780
That's not so strange, you look exactly the same

884
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:52,780
That's right, if everyone could roll heavy machinery, architecture, or search

885
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:53,780
Whichever you'd like

886
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:55,780
I passed search with a 14

887
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:57,780
I also passed search with a 19

888
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:00,780
Whatever it is, I passed it with a teen something

889
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:02,780
Uh, what were you rolling on?

890
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:03,780
Search

891
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:05,780
Okay, so you all rolled search, so

892
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:07,780
It was heavy machinery and what was the other one?

893
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:09,780
Heavy machinery, architecture, or search

894
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:10,780
Gotcha, yep

895
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:12,780
Which I only have one of those

896
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:14,780
So with the success there, you kind of match up

897
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:17,780
Where the door was on the original side

898
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:20,780
Like how far away it was from the station

899
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:25,780
And you can pretty quickly make your way over and find the door through the plant matter

900
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:27,780
On this side as well

901
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:30,780
And there's so much plant matter growing on the door

902
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:35,780
However, it seems to wrap itself in a way in which you can open this door

903
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:39,780
Without needing to like, cut through any of this shit

904
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:43,780
Can I, now that you mentioned the overgrowth, can I retroactively real quick mention

905
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:48,780
Looking around in the train to see its level of decrepitness

906
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:52,780
Like, was it dusty even, or was it feeling brand new in there?

907
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:55,780
How did, I mean like the whole setup really, the station, the lockers

908
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:58,780
Clean, sterile, spartan

909
00:38:58,780 --> 00:38:59,780
But like, maintained?

910
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:06,780
Simply due to its cleanliness, you would assume that it is wiped down a decent amount

911
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:07,780
Yeah, okay

912
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:10,780
Used much, or?

913
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:13,780
Used much much?

914
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:14,780
Okay, let me rephrase

915
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:18,780
Without a heavy machinery roll, you're gonna be hard pressed to figure that one out

916
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:20,780
Okay, I don't have any in that, so I won't do it

917
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:23,780
But we rolled search successfully, you

918
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:25,780
Yeah, you rolled to find the door

919
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:29,780
Is there like a path that's been followed through this

920
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:34,780
Or does it seem like we might be one of the few that have used this station?

921
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:37,780
There is not a well-trod path here

922
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:40,780
I tricked him, I tricked him

923
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:44,780
I didn't have any heavy machinery, but I got him to tell me with

924
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:48,780
You used logic in a good way, I like that, good job Luke

925
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:49,780
Can I get a pointy look?

926
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:50,780
Do you have luck already?

927
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:51,780
Nah, I have luck already

928
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:52,780
Okay, nevermind

929
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:53,780
Joe, you can't have any

930
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:54,780
Damn it

931
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:59,780
God damn, I drank all those energy drinks there dude

932
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:03,780
With all that being said, I would like to open the Spongebob door

933
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:06,780
And emerge from the other side

934
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,780
Yeah, you guys pack up all your shit and kind of

935
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:12,780
Who lives in a church in the bottom of the ravine?

936
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:16,780
Frankie Godall

937
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:19,780
Battled evil for 13 hours did he

938
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:23,780
Frankie Godall

939
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:26,780
Were there lockers on the other side also?

940
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:29,780
Cause the lockers at the first side was to kind of leave our shit in

941
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:31,780
Yeah, that's a great fucking question

942
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:34,780
There are lockers on this side, it is exactly identical

943
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:35,780
Aw, lame

944
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:36,780
Aw, dip

945
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:38,780
We should have looked in those lockers back there and seen if they were something

946
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:40,780
I mean Stevie did, she put the food in the lockers right?

947
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:41,780
Oh yeah

948
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:43,780
Stevie, did you see anything in those lockers?

949
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:45,780
Oh, I didn't open up a bunch of them

950
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:49,780
I just kind of opened up one and she holds up a key

951
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:54,780
There was already keys in them so I just locked it and I guess this is our key

952
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:57,780
Why don't you like check if it works on one of these over here?

953
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:02,780
And then she walks over and she's holding up a key that is number 5

954
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:07,780
And she's like, oh these are alphabetical on this side it looks like

955
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:08,780
Oh cool

956
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:10,780
Try F

957
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:11,780
Wait, E

958
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:12,780
Try L7

959
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:13,780
Try E

960
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:17,780
She walks up and there are keys in all of the doors on this side

961
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:18,780
Drats

962
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:19,780
Except for

963
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:21,780
There's keys in all of the doors?

964
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:26,780
There's keys in all of the lockers so they're all ready to be used except for one

965
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:28,780
The A locker is locked

966
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:30,780
Stevie, will you try that one real quick?

967
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:31,780
Yeah I guess

968
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:34,780
And she tries to put her key into it and it just kind of jams

969
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:35,780
She's like, ah it doesn't fit

970
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:36,780
Interesting

971
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:38,780
This is so fucking cool

972
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:39,780
I want to open B

973
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:41,780
You open B, it is empty

974
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:42,780
C, D, E

975
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:43,780
Empty, empty, empty

976
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:44,780
Z

977
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:45,780
There's only 20

978
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:47,780
I put my pocket lasagna in B

979
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:50,780
You almost had me for a second

980
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:54,780
What happens as I open up the hatch

981
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:58,780
Oh okay I thought you were going to say the 20th letter of the alphabet

982
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:00,780
No that's obviously 6

983
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:08,780
You guys head on over and Stevie's kind of pack mewling all of your gear over to where this door is

984
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:14,780
And she's like, alright I've got the key here in my pocket so don't let me forget it

985
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:17,780
Stevie, don't forget the key in your pocket

986
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:28,780
Oh sorry guys, Luke just shits pants

987
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:32,780
That was Julius opening up the hatch

988
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:36,780
It opens in the exact same way, this time it opens in toward you

989
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:42,780
And on the other side of this enormous and lush impediment

990
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:46,780
Is a vast opening with plenty to unpack

991
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:53,780
You're looking at a sprawling town park straight out of the 1950's idea of the future

992
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:59,780
Perfectly manicured trees like enormous emerald cake pops

993
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:03,780
Lying a colorful synthetic walkway

994
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:12,780
This slightly bouncy comfortable sidewalk would take you all the way around this gigantic green area ahead of you

995
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:16,780
It's like a big square and the path is a big square going around it

996
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:20,780
And on the far side of this green space

997
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:24,780
Maybe about 255 meters away or so

998
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:30,780
So really far, these people are really tiny, you see tiny people in the distance

999
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:34,780
People wearing like yellow and green uniforms

1000
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:41,780
And from all the way across this park, so monumental that they're clear from here

1001
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:44,780
There are two statues of men

1002
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:48,780
Each about 26.3 meters tall

1003
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:51,780
Made of green rock

1004
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:55,780
And they stand tall in front of a gorgeous building

1005
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:59,780
Seemingly made of glass and grass

1006
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:02,780
Or ass

1007
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:06,780
There might be ass making it, nobody rides the Godel train for free

1008
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:10,780
So it's a big square, you're on one side, the statues are on the other

1009
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:14,780
There's a massive square park green space in the middle

1010
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:17,780
The trees outline the green space

1011
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:23,780
And on the side that you're on, behind you, there's just this enormous wall of plant life

1012
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:25,780
You can go left or right

1013
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:26,780
To follow the path

1014
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:27,780
To follow the path

1015
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:33,780
And you would assume that based on what you can see in the park that it would lead you in a big square around

1016
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:37,780
Is there what's in the middle? Is it just green space? Literally just green space?

1017
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:45,780
Yep, it's a lot of places where people are playing, people are hanging out, picnicking, throwing frisbees

1018
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:48,780
Are they all wearing green or yellow uniforms?

1019
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:53,780
They're all wearing some sort of green or yellow flair on their clothing

1020
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:57,780
You said the pathway was synthetic, colorful, and bouncy?

1021
00:44:57,780 --> 00:44:59,780
Yeah, I did say that

1022
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:00,780
Fuck yeah

1023
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:06,780
Cal puts a foot out on it and then gives a few steps out and starts springing a little bit on it

1024
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:11,780
Yeah, it looks like even Cal could go for a jog and it wouldn't hurt his knees

1025
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:13,780
I haven't felt like this in years

1026
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:16,780
Everyone roll grip

1027
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:22,780
You are in a completely, seemingly unnatural to you location

1028
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:28,780
I failed, 86, Cal starts to think, I haven't felt like this in years

1029
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:36,780
As the other two pass, you're both just looking at, is that okay?

1030
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:39,780
He stops bouncing on the pathway

1031
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:42,780
Stevie, is anything okay?

1032
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:44,780
This is weird, huh?

1033
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:48,780
This is weird, huh? Beck, you're filming, right?

1034
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:54,780
Beck is not only filming, but he's zooming in to try and see if there's anything on the closest uniform

1035
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:56,780
If there's any kind of logos or names or anything

1036
00:45:56,780 --> 00:46:00,780
Yeah, so no logos, everyone seems to be wearing a name tag

1037
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:02,780
Does it look like anybody's noticed us?

1038
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:07,780
As you're now looking at the people who are walking, people are walking on this pathway

1039
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:13,780
And they're all kind of side-eyeing you as they're passing, but no one has approached

1040
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:19,780
You see that everyone is wearing nice clothes, they're like very well made

1041
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:27,780
Everyone who is walking on the pathway is wearing grey-scale joggers and athleisure

1042
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:30,780
But then with a flare of green or a flare of yellow

1043
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:35,780
And everyone who's sitting nicely casually, having a picnic, is dressed

1044
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:39,780
Everyone's sitting nicely

1045
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:43,780
That's the call and response I used when I taught children in Korea

1046
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:46,780
Everyone's sitting nicely

1047
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:48,780
I was gonna say they're all in Oakland Acor

1048
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:49,780
Green and yellow

1049
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:52,780
Oh yeah, so it's either green or yellow

1050
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:56,780
No one is wearing both that you've seen so far, but everyone is wearing something

1051
00:46:56,780 --> 00:47:02,780
The people who are sitting at like picnics, the men are wearing like nice black shorts

1052
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:05,780
With a green or a yellow polo

1053
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:09,780
The women are wearing like a green or a yellow sundress

1054
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:12,780
The people who are playing a sport of any kind are

1055
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:16,780
Everyone is wearing clothes that are specifically built for what they're doing

1056
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:21,780
And everyone has like nice, what you would call like upper shelf athleisure

1057
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:23,780
Uh, Cal?

1058
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:24,780
Julius

1059
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:25,780
You're a pro, right?

1060
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:26,780
Julius, I am the pro

1061
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:30,780
Beck, from what I know, you're a pro?

1062
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:31,780
Yeah dude

1063
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:33,780
Let's find out where we are

1064
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:37,780
We're in Grover's Gorge, the secret Godel company town

1065
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:40,780
Hidden behind a giant mysterious ravine

1066
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:43,780
That apparently Frank Godel created in a fight with evil itself

1067
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:47,780
Julius has already stopped listening and he's going to find somebody to interview

1068
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:50,780
But Cal is nodding vehemently while rolling on Cal

1069
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:52,780
Did you call me Ba-Cal?

1070
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:54,780
Ma-Cal? What did I say?

1071
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:55,780
You said Ma-Cal

1072
00:47:55,780 --> 00:47:58,780
Rolling on Ba-Beck, Ba-Beck, Ba-Beck

1073
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:04,780
The way you were saying that sounded so perfectly angry that Beck instinctively was filming you as you said it

1074
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:05,780
We're standing here

1075
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:06,780
I've always just had this voice

1076
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:09,780
Julius just walks up to the first person he sees and says

1077
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:11,780
Uh, would you like to be on TV?

1078
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:16,780
Yeah, you look up across this absolutely gorgeous, like stunning park

1079
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:22,780
So just like clean and glimmering in the sunshine

1080
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:29,780
And there's a woman who's mid-twenties, blonde ponytail bobbing up and down as she's jogging

1081
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:34,780
Wearing her like lovely, there are no apples in sight

1082
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:36,780
She's not bobbing for apples

1083
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:40,780
But her ponytail is bobbing up and down as she's jogging

1084
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:41,780
For apples?

1085
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:42,780
Towards you

1086
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:45,780
Are you glad?

1087
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:49,780
Yeah, it would have been sad if he didn't do it again

1088
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:56,780
And she kind of like slows her jog as she's kind of approaching you with a quizzical smile on her face

1089
00:48:56,780 --> 00:48:59,780
Confused, but also curious

1090
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:04,780
Cal like kind of turns to face her and reaches out his hand and like puts on a big broad smile and says

1091
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:07,780
Cal Colorado, City Action News

1092
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:09,780
May we have a moment of your time?

1093
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:12,780
Oh yes, of course, yeah, absolutely

1094
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:13,780
And she puts out her hand and says

1095
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:16,780
Jennifer, it's extremely nice to meet you, welcome

1096
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:19,780
Welcome to Grover's Gorge, I see that you're not from here

1097
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:24,780
No Jennifer, we're not, we've come here to learn more about your fine town

1098
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:27,780
Well welcome, welcome all, again I'm Jennifer and she puts out her hand

1099
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:28,780
Speck and Julius

1100
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:31,780
Hi Beck, hi Julius, and what's your name?

1101
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:33,780
And Stevie puts out their hand and

1102
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:34,780
Stevie

1103
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:36,780
Yeah, it's nice to meet you Stevie

1104
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:40,780
I mean, is this your first time I would assume at Grover's Gorge?

1105
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:42,780
Yeah, never made it out here before

1106
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:48,780
Welcome, welcome, welcome, oh the Godel Company has treated us so well, woo

1107
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:50,780
Go GEs

1108
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:53,780
That's actually what brought us out here

1109
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:57,780
Could we ask you a few questions about the Godel Company and the gorge?

1110
00:49:57,780 --> 00:50:04,780
Yeah, absolutely, absolutely, I mean I'm in the middle of a jog, do you mind if I run in place?

1111
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:09,780
Yeah, I mean I don't, unfortunately that doesn't play on the camera

1112
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:14,780
And she's running in place like, and she's doing high knees now and she's like high knees, high knees, high knees

1113
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:21,780
Beck is getting into the camera bag to get out of lapel mic and he's trying to attach it to her and it's kind of difficult because she's jumping up and down in place

1114
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:26,780
Uh oh, hey, could you maybe just hang on for just a sec, let me get this attached

1115
00:50:26,780 --> 00:50:32,780
She slows her roll a little bit, stares you straight into the eyes and is like, I'm doing calf raises

1116
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:38,780
Yeah, you are, those are good calf raises, can I have you like say and spell your name for me real quick?

1117
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:43,780
Yeah, it's Jennifer, J-E-N-N-I-F-E-R, Jennifer

1118
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:45,780
And what's that last name?

1119
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:47,780
Um, Lang

1120
00:50:54,780 --> 00:51:00,780
She gets kind of a quizzical look on her face and she's like, can we actually not do a last name, it's just Jennifer

1121
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:04,780
Yeah, that's fine, it's just how we're going to credit you on the news, I just wanted to make sure that we get it accurate

1122
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:10,780
Jennifer from Grover's Gorge, uh, Godel Company, uh, G-E, woo

1123
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:14,780
Jennifer from Grover's Gorge, Godel Corporation, G-E

1124
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:18,780
The Godel Company, gotta get it right, T-C-G, woo, T-G-C, woo

1125
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:23,780
Gotta get it right, The Godel Company, Jennifer, how long have you worked for The Godel Company?

1126
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:27,780
Well, worked I guess, um, you know, a few years now, but

1127
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:29,780
And how long have you lived in Grover's Gorge?

1128
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:36,780
Oh, I've lived here since I was born, born and raised, Grover's Gorge, woo, go G-E's, woo, hungry for points

1129
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:39,780
Did you always hope to work for The Godel Company?

1130
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:44,780
Sure, yeah, I guess hope is a weird word, I knew I was going to work for The Godel Company

1131
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:45,780
What do you mean?

1132
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:49,780
Well, I was born here and raised here and everyone works for The Godel Company here in Grover's Gorge

1133
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:53,780
No one grows up to leave and become a doctor or an astronaut?

1134
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:58,780
Oh, I guess, yeah, if people want to leave they can, but I knew I was going to stay, I like it here

1135
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:00,780
Has anyone to your knowledge ever left?

1136
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:01,780
Yeah

1137
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:02,780
Many people?

1138
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:06,780
Mmm, like, not a ton, maybe like two or three a year maybe?

1139
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:12,780
I see, and Jennifer, you've enthusiastically shouted G-E a couple of times

1140
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:13,780
Woo, go G-E's!

1141
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:15,780
Yes, go G-E's

1142
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:16,780
Thanks for asking about that

1143
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:18,780
What is G-E?

1144
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:23,780
Oh, that means I'm a great employee, woo, go G-E's, hungry for points, woo

1145
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:28,780
I'm a G-E of TGC, I'm a G-E TGC

1146
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:33,780
Yes, yes, Jennifer, hungry for points, what are these points?

1147
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:36,780
Forget about it, cuh, I gotta have my points

1148
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:40,780
Like I said, we hungry, trying to get these points

1149
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:46,780
Cal is like desperately looking to Beck and Julius and he's like, is that a TikTok thing?

1150
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:49,780
I mean, not that I know of, it could be new

1151
00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:50,780
Looks at Julius

1152
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:52,780
Julius shakes his head, he doesn't know

1153
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:55,780
Jennifer, is that a TikTok thing?

1154
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:57,780
Oh, I don't think so

1155
00:52:57,780 --> 00:52:59,780
Asked and answered

1156
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:03,780
Ask if there's any B-E's, bad employees

1157
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:07,780
Jennifer, perhaps a difficult subject

1158
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:08,780
Mmm

1159
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:09,780
You are a great employee

1160
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:11,780
Yeah, I am, ha

1161
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:13,780
Are there any bad employees?

1162
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:16,780
Oh, I see what you did there, no

1163
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:19,780
None of the people who left were bad employees

1164
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:21,780
Oh, no, they just left

1165
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:29,780
Everyone performs adequately at their job, no one is ever fired or let go or disciplined in any way

1166
00:53:29,780 --> 00:53:33,780
Well, no, I don't see why they would be, no, no, no, everyone works like

1167
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:42,780
We have a really good job here and a really good life here, so I don't see why anyone would not want to work well

1168
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:43,780
Does that make sense?

1169
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:45,780
That makes sense to Cal

1170
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:53,780
And now the corner of each of your eyes, all of your eyes, each and every one of them, you all see

1171
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:56,780
How did you know about all my eyes?

1172
00:53:56,780 --> 00:54:00,780
I read your character sheet

1173
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:03,780
Goals, get rid of all these eyes

1174
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:05,780
Get rid of all these fucking eyes

1175
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:08,780
I didn't fill out my eye, uh

1176
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:13,780
Oh, dude, if you don't put at least two, you're fucked

1177
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:14,780
Too late now, baby

1178
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:16,780
Out of the corner of your eyes, you

1179
00:54:16,780 --> 00:54:20,780
That's a compelling story, the blind television producer who can never see his own segments

1180
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:24,780
But still longs to struggle in the industry, or succeed in the industry

1181
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:26,780
Longs to struggle in the industry

1182
00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:29,780
Does struggle in the industry, longs to succeed

1183
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:32,780
My taste is so good, though, that I can

1184
00:54:32,780 --> 00:54:35,780
Oh, yeah, you're actual

1185
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:37,780
My taste is with my tongue

1186
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:41,780
I thought you meant you had like Daredevil vision, but for reality television

1187
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:43,780
No, I can taste anything

1188
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:49,780
Your taste is great, and so is your vision, which means that you can see out of the corner of your eye

1189
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:50,780
All of them?

1190
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:52,780
A jackalope

1191
00:54:52,780 --> 00:54:55,780
Wait, is a jackalope the rabbit with antlers?

1192
00:54:55,780 --> 00:54:57,780
It's the mythical creature with antlers, yeah

1193
00:54:57,780 --> 00:54:59,780
It's a rabbit with antlers

1194
00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:00,780
A rabbit with antlers

1195
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:03,780
And it's got a yellow ribbon tied around its head

1196
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:04,780
Around its head?

1197
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:05,780
Yeah, like

1198
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:06,780
Around its antlers, or?

1199
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:07,780
Yeah

1200
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:09,780
Cal's jaw drops

1201
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:12,780
Julius immediately starts filming it on his phone

1202
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:15,780
Beck whips around to it and says out loud

1203
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:17,780
You guys got a jackalope?

1204
00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:24,780
Jennifer, what is that?

1205
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:53,780
Are we recording?

1206
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:55,780
The people love this

1207
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:56,780
They love what?

1208
00:55:56,780 --> 00:55:59,780
They love the roid talk

1209
00:55:59,780 --> 00:56:01,780
You just said what now?

1210
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:04,780
I have my first Aldi hemorrhoid

1211
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:06,780
No, it doesn't hurt, it's fine

1212
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:08,780
It's just a firm little guy

1213
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:09,780
I need 30 seconds of silence

1214
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:10,780
Fun little guy

1215
00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:12,780
Firm

1216
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:18,780
He's just a, hey, you should get to know him

1217
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:19,780
He's just a fun little guy

1218
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:20,780
He's just a silly little guy

1219
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:21,780
He's just popping out to say hello

1220
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:23,780
He's a lot like you, Zach

1221
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:26,780
Bald little head poking out of your asshole

1222
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:33,780
And it's all my fault

1223
00:56:40,780 --> 00:56:43,780
Thanks for watching!
