1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,800
You are tuned in to 694.2 PTPP here in the idyllic town of Contention.

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:16,200
It's your oral doula, Wolf the Dog, here to guide you through this warmer than usual December 4th.

3
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:26,200
We are supported today by a dear friend who is making a deliciously positive impact in some place called Springfield, Missouri.

4
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,600
Jake's Vegan Burgers.

5
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,800
Now y'all know Wolf the Dog loves to get his grub on.

6
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:41,800
Well, Jake sent us a few samples over and I've never had meat that wasn't meat that tasted so much like meat.

7
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:50,600
You can find Jake's Burgers and Taco Meat at Mama Jean's, Jake's Patty Melt and Quinoa Sausage Bowl at Druff's,

8
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:58,000
Jake's Breakfast Sausage at Gailey's and Jake's Italian Sausage at Piccolo in Nixa.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:09,400
Whether you are vegan, vegetarian or just plain hungry, follow him at Jake's Underscore Vegan Underscore Burgers on Instagram.

10
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:19,400
Y'all been on that Instagram before, seen a whole lot of pictures of dogs on there, saw some people taking pictures of sandwiches and whatnot.

11
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:23,600
And now y'all know that shit's wild to your old buddy Wolf.

12
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,800
And speaking of some wild shit, it's news time my babies.

13
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:37,800
John Lee and Don D. Bettymore gave us a glimpse into the accident that propelled John into a life of civic duty.

14
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:49,200
They were chased by a couple of giant, gaunt, suited men that seemed to vanish when the pair of Bettymores came across John's nemesis, Large Eddie.

15
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:56,600
Now Large Eddie was roughing up Don's car in the parking lot and Don wasn't taken too kindly to it.

16
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:08,600
The altercation ended with a deliriously concussed John Lee Bettymore seeing his second cousin father figure scorch Large Eddie's fist with only his hand.

17
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:17,000
Back in the current timeline, the officers went to the First Church of Condention, which was hosting a lunch for anyone who needed it.

18
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,800
The lunch was made by the pastor's wife and children and served by the youth group.

19
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:34,400
The officers, well, mostly Keith, broke into Pastor Adam Kane's office, stole the motorcycle helmet he bought from Old Mildred Mitchell's booth at Forgotten Treasures,

20
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:41,600
and learned that he is working on legislation to allow motorcyclists to ride without helmets.

21
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:51,400
Motorcycles are death traps, so roll down the windows of your full wheeled transportation and turn it up. It's Kudzu with no backbone.

22
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,200
I think they're just called D-Pants.

23
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,000
D-Pants?

24
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,800
Something like that.

25
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,600
What do you have, though?

26
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,800
E-Pants. They're one better.

27
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,200
Yep. Exactly.

28
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,600
One closer to the end.

29
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,800
Okay, what are we doing?

30
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:26,000
All right, everybody, we've got Luke here playing Keith Vigna.

31
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,600
True.

32
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:31,800
And this week we have a special guest. We have our friend Jake sitting in.

33
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,600
Hi.

34
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:41,800
He's playing Ferguson Beans, the brother of the child Keith Beans.

35
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:52,600
And we're going to do a flashback to the childhood of a young seven-year-old Keith Beans and a nine-year-old Ferguson Beans.

36
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,600
So let's hop right into it.

37
00:03:54,600 --> 00:04:01,000
The home of William and Lena Beans was a beautiful estate that sat just outside of contention.

38
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:08,400
The grounds were sprawling and filled with well-kept gardens and ponds and bridges and statues.

39
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,400
There were multiple buildings on the land.

40
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,200
The Beans' home was the largest and most grand.

41
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:20,200
There was a separate housing facility for the staff.

42
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:26,400
And there was also a small office building where William spent most of his days and nights working on his projects.

43
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,800
This was one of those days.

44
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:32,200
William was off in his shop and Lena was in her room on the phone.

45
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:37,600
Keith and Ferguson are having breakfast in a massive pristine kitchen.

46
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,200
The sunlight shining in through the windows on a beautiful day.

47
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,600
And what do these young boys look like?

48
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,600
Keith, if you want to kick it off.

49
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:49,600
I look a lot like Keith Vigna just 22 years younger.

50
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,200
Are you still wearing weird pants?

51
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:55,600
My pants are Ferguson's old pants, so they are a little big on me.

52
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,600
Yeah, I've pretty much had big pants my whole life.

53
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,600
Other than that, I look, you know, just like a normal boy.

54
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,400
A young boy?

55
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,000
A young boy, Keith.

56
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,600
Young Keith.

57
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,400
Pre-Vigna Keith.

58
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,600
Picture of Keith.

59
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,600
Go back to the first episode and listen to how I describe myself.

60
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,600
And then make it smaller.

61
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,600
That's a good tactic.

62
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:19,600
And Ferguson, what does young Ferguson look like?

63
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,600
Ferguson is beautiful.

64
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,600
He's just kind of like, you kind of want to describe him as a handsome boy.

65
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,600
But that seems weird.

66
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:33,600
Yeah, just almost like some kind of alien or something where you're just like, whoa.

67
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,600
Right.

68
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,600
This country has a problem with sexualizing young alien boys.

69
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,600
Right.

70
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,600
Is it a boy that you go to jail over?

71
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,600
No.

72
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,600
No.

73
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,600
He's just like, you know, like the golden child, I think is kind of how I think.

74
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,600
And you know, already very tall.

75
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,600
Too skinny.

76
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,600
Like a very skinny kid.

77
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,600
Okay.

78
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,600
Awesome.

79
00:05:54,600 --> 00:06:01,600
The beans chef Helga has been told repeatedly that Fergie is to be served first.

80
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,600
But we see her hand a plate of eggs Benedict to both children at the same time.

81
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:13,600
Oh, what are you going to do with your day today?

82
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,600
More of the cops and robbers and king of the hill nonsense, I presume.

83
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,600
What?

84
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,600
That's right.

85
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,600
The chef, the lady chef who made your food for you.

86
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,600
She's just asking what you're going to do with your day.

87
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,600
Helga.

88
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,600
Yes, Helga.

89
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,600
She says, sorry, my voice.

90
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,600
There's something weird in my voice.

91
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,600
No, you sound great, Helga.

92
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,600
It's good to see you and thank you for breakfast.

93
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,600
It'll fuel us for our games today.

94
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,600
Yeah.

95
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,600
Eggs Benedict are a particularly difficult dish to make.

96
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,600
And we just wanted to tell you that we really appreciate it.

97
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,600
Did I get the Hollandaise sauce right?

98
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,600
Nailed it.

99
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,600
Oh, that's so sweet of you to say.

100
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,600
Yum.

101
00:06:54,600 --> 00:07:00,600
And you guys slam down your breakfast.

102
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,600
She says, well, it's time to change into your playing clothes.

103
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,600
And yes, my favorite playing clothes.

104
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,600
He only has like one pair of clothes.

105
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,600
So I'd say it's the same clothes.

106
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,600
Ferguson's got these like beautiful threads.

107
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,600
Ferguson, I would imagine has like a walk-in closet.

108
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:27,600
And a lot of like sometimes he just likes to wear the frilled like ruffled collars, like

109
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,600
which is not period appropriate.

110
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:33,600
Hey, can I, can I try one of your shirts on Ferguson?

111
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:37,600
It may look a little big on you, but you're welcome to.

112
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,600
Thank you.

113
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,600
And I go and I pick out a Bulls jersey.

114
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,600
Yeah.

115
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:47,600
That checks out, uh, out of, out of my several walk-in closets.

116
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,600
He's very, you know, vain.

117
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,600
And one of them's just for sports jerseys.

118
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,600
Yeah.

119
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,600
But today is play.

120
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:00,600
So, you know, Ferguson probably was a little confused by your selection of a sports clothes

121
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:04,600
for a play time, but he pardons the insanity.

122
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,600
That's awfully kind of you.

123
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,600
Uh, so what is Ferguson wearing to play?

124
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,600
Probably some linens.

125
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,600
Some loose fitting linens.

126
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,600
Yeah.

127
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,600
Fresh, fresh linens that have never been worn before.

128
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:21,600
Uh, because if they ever get stains on them, they're immediately discarded.

129
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,600
Amazing.

130
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,600
Okay.

131
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:28,600
So you guys walk out of the front door of the house into the, uh, the sprawling estate.

132
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:34,600
Ahead of you is a massive fountain and the circle drive that comes right in front of

133
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,600
the home.

134
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,600
And you can see the different buildings on the land that your father owns.

135
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,600
And what do you guys, uh, what do you guys want to do?

136
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,600
Where do you guys want to run off to?

137
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,600
The sun is shining high.

138
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,600
It's what a game day for play day.

139
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,600
I go out to the fountain and I, I get a little handful of water and I splash Ferguson with

140
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,600
it.

141
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:58,600
I'd imagine that upon receiving the splash, Ferguson is, uh, admiring some of the statues

142
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:03,600
in the works of the masters and, um, does not immediately react to the splash because

143
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,600
it's so engrossed.

144
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:09,600
But, uh, upon realizing that this was intended to be an offense committed by the younger

145
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,600
brother, probably shoots him a look.

146
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,600
I snicker and I head back to the fountain to do it again.

147
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,600
Keith, please.

148
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,600
This is, this is not my preferred method of playing.

149
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,600
What do you want to do then?

150
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,600
You're boring.

151
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,600
I'm not boring.

152
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,600
I'm just deep in thought.

153
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,600
About what?

154
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:31,600
And I splash him against this beautiful Pieta in front of us that we've been blessed with.

155
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,600
Look, that one has a wiener.

156
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,600
Yes, wieners are funny.

157
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:40,600
And that one's got boobs and I go up and I act like I'm going to squeeze one of the statues

158
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,600
boobs.

159
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,600
Give it a honk.

160
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,600
Make like a clown honk noise.

161
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,600
Ferguson laughs at that.

162
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,600
You guys look over as this is happening and you're both giggling and you look over and

163
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:55,600
there's just like an old, old woman who's a servant for your father who's just staring

164
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,600
at you, shaking your head as she walks away.

165
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,600
What do you want to do?

166
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,600
These statues are boring.

167
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,600
Well, we've, uh, we've had a good run of cops and robbers lately.

168
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,600
Perhaps we should continue that.

169
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,600
Can I be the robber this time?

170
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,600
I knew you were going to say that.

171
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:14,600
So, and immediately Ferguson, you were looking at Keith and you see that he has this like

172
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:19,600
black bandit cloth wrapped around his eyes, like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles with the

173
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,600
little eye holes cut out and he's wearing a all black and white striped shirt with black

174
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:29,600
pants and he's holding two bags that just have big dollar signs on them.

175
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:36,600
Fergus, uh, coyly smiles and removes from hidden in a pocket a, uh, blue English style

176
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:42,600
bobby cap and gives it a little flick and it goes from being folded up into a thing

177
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,600
and places it on his head.

178
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,600
And Keith, when you look at your older brother, you see him as this hat is placed upon his

179
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:53,600
head in full officer regalia.

180
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,600
He's got a look in his eyes that says the law's coming all over you.

181
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,600
Coming for a naughty boy.

182
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,600
I reach into one of my bag, my money bags and I get a fistful of coins out and I throw

183
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,600
it down on the ground in front of him to, you know, make him lose his balance when he

184
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,600
runs after me.

185
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,600
Fergus looks at the coins in horror and says, these are my coins, Keith.

186
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,600
And I throw another handful and I run away.

187
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,600
I just run into the yard and I go bang bang.

188
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,600
Ferguson is annoyed that his brother's stolen his coin collection and use them as a weapon

189
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,600
against him, but he's patient and begins to collect the coins.

190
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,600
You'll never catch me, copper!

191
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:40,600
So Ferguson, as you are chasing this Keith robber about the property, you guys come across

192
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,600
this building.

193
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,600
It's got Ivy crawling all up along the sides and you know this to be your father's workshop

194
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:51,600
where you guys aren't supposed to hang out by, but Keith is running and trying to hide

195
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,600
around the backside because I think maybe he knows that you won't go there.

196
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,600
Around the backside of the workshop that was forbidden to us by our father?

197
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,600
Correct.

198
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,600
Oh, okay.

199
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,600
I think that probably, I mean, how far away?

200
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,600
What's the distance between us?

201
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,600
Between you and Keith?

202
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,600
20 yards.

203
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,600
Okay.

204
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,600
I probably would imagine that Ferguson would be doing a kind of a loud whisper sort of

205
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,600
thing.

206
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,600
Hey, Keith.

207
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,600
Keith, get out of there.

208
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,600
Get on it.

209
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,600
Get on out of there, you goof.

210
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,600
My name is not Keith, I'm...

211
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,600
Fuck.

212
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,600
I thought you were going to say the gingerbread man for sure.

213
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,600
I'm not Keith, I'm the gingerbread man.

214
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,600
I'm the gingerbread man.

215
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,600
I'm not Keith, I'm Ricky the robber.

216
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,600
All right, fine, Ricky the robber.

217
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,600
You still got to get on out of there.

218
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,600
We're not supposed to be there.

219
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,600
I'm not that easy to catch, copper.

220
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:49,600
Yeah, but I mean, this is also not like, this is outside of playtime.

221
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,600
I don't understand what you're talking about, policeman.

222
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:56,600
As you guys are having this conversation, you hear something that you've only heard maybe

223
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:01,600
once before in your lives, and it was when you were much, much younger, but you hear

224
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:07,600
these alarms going off all over the entire estate, and it's just like this, wow, wow,

225
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,600
wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.

226
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:16,600
And you know that that means that there are intruders on the property, and as you're looking

227
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:22,600
about, you actually see security is like breaking out into different formations all over the

228
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,600
property.

229
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,600
You probably see two or three guys coming in your direction, in your general direction,

230
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:35,600
and as they're running toward you, you see three figures that you can't make out what

231
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,600
they look like, but they are almost landing.

232
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,600
You think that it looks like they're landing on the ground near you, however, you didn't

233
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:52,600
actually see them in the air, and these things are massive, gaunt humanoids in these black

234
00:13:52,600 --> 00:14:00,600
suits with translucent skin, and as you're being picked up by security and running away,

235
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,600
these things are being put down by the security guards.

236
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:10,600
The guns are firing all around you, the alarms are still going off, and your father is nowhere

237
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:17,600
to be seen, but security is all over the entire place as you guys are tucked back into the

238
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:25,600
home where it is safe, and later that night, your dad comes in, William Beans, and he sits

239
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:34,600
you both down, and he says, boys, what happened today was the reason for all of the security

240
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:39,600
and the alarms that we have on the estate.

241
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:45,600
Ferguson, you know that my top priority is to keep you safe, and I will do everything

242
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:51,600
that I can in order to make sure that you stay safe.

243
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,600
Thank you.

244
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,600
Thank you.

245
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,600
I want you to come with me, and he stands up, and he reaches out his hand toward you.

246
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:03,600
Ferguson kind of looks over to Keith, and a small tear is running down my eye and my

247
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,600
face reaches out to take his father's hand.

248
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:12,600
And William walks out of the room with you, and you guys go outside, and Keith, no one's

249
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:19,600
really around, so you can either go back into your room, or you can follow them and kind

250
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,600
of like hide.

251
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,600
Did you guys go outside?

252
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,600
Yeah, they're leaving the house.

253
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,600
I'm going to go to a window and see where they go.

254
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,600
Okay.

255
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:31,600
They're walking toward the office with the ivy climbing the walls where William works,

256
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,600
that you've never been in before, and neither is Ferguson, to your knowledge.

257
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:42,600
I'm going to go quickly change into some of Ferguson's all black clothes and sneak and

258
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,600
try to hide and follow and see what happens.

259
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,600
Okay.

260
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:50,600
So as you make your way there, you would eventually come to a spot in the wood on the property,

261
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:56,600
maybe behind a well-sculpted bush or a nice tree.

262
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,600
Why did you make that face when I said well-sculpted bush?

263
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,600
I was thinking of a statue with pubic hair on it.

264
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,600
With good pubic hair?

265
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,600
Yeah.

266
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,600
I think that, yeah, it was like a bait and switch.

267
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,600
Okay, that's fair.

268
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:15,600
And as you're hiding, you're within earshot of your father and your older brother, and

269
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:22,600
William comes out of the door of the office and he takes a knee and looks at you, Ferguson,

270
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,600
and he's holding something.

271
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,600
It's a watch.

272
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:35,600
Ferguson, I don't know how much longer I'll be around, and I had hoped that I would be

273
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:42,600
the one who would be able to fulfill the prophecy, but it is not me.

274
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,600
It is you.

275
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:48,600
You are the anointed.

276
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:53,600
When the time is right, you must go back and save the world.

277
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,600
And he puts this watch around your wrist, and it's way too big for you.

278
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,600
Yeah, probably pretty heavy too.

279
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,600
And it doesn't have anything on the face of it.

280
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:11,600
And, Keith, when you see it go around Ferguson's wrist, something on his face changes, and

281
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,600
he looks kind of different.

282
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:18,600
And then William says to Ferguson, it will fit when the time is right.

283
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,600
Is that because it's a watch?

284
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,600
The time?

285
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,600
When the time is right?

286
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,600
It was awful, but it was so good.

287
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,600
We're all standing up by the cruisers at this point.

288
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,600
Should we do anything with this helmet right now, or should we just head on to the mill

289
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,600
with it in tow?

290
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,600
I think we should head with it, because I'm not going to put it on my head.

291
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,600
Should we go lock it up?

292
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,600
Let's lock it up and let's put it in evidence.

293
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:00,600
Do we have all the other artifacts locked up somewhere?

294
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,600
Let's do that now.

295
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,600
Let's put them all in the same spot.

296
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,600
Maybe not all in the same spot.

297
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,600
What if they activate?

298
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,600
Are you talking about a Megazord situation?

299
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,600
Yeah, exactly.

300
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,600
You're the weirdest nerd sometimes.

301
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,600
Where do you get this stuff from?

302
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,600
I thought you were just like Wheel of Fortune.

303
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,600
Power Rangers is on Saturday mornings when I wake up.

304
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,600
Only if you turn the TV on.

305
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,600
Do we have like lockers, like little lockers at the PD probably?

306
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,600
Yeah.

307
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,600
Let's put them each in their own separate locker.

308
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,600
Okay.

309
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,600
Lock them up.

310
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,600
Put them something a little, yeah, or maybe more secure.

311
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,600
I don't know.

312
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,600
It's a locker at a police department.

313
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,600
I mean, our evidence room probably has...

314
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,600
Individual.

315
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,600
Individual.

316
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,600
Yeah.

317
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,600
We can do that.

318
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:50,600
Okay, so you have now put, well, in order, let's say the camera, the gun, the radio,

319
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:56,600
and the helmet all in four separate lockers within the evidence room of the police station.

320
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:00,600
Yeah, and when they get close to each other, do we notice anything funny, like tubes glowing

321
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,600
or lights changing?

322
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,600
You don't.

323
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,600
Okay.

324
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,600
However...

325
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,600
Drew dies.

326
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:10,600
However, Drew's dead now.

327
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:14,600
Does it smell like radioactivity in here?

328
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,600
A real ozone-y smell.

329
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,600
Yeah.

330
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,600
Did somebody spray some like hairspray or something?

331
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,600
Not to throw a wrench into things real quick, but what did we ever do with that silver

332
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,600
ball that we found?

333
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,600
Did we get it sent off somewhere?

334
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,600
No.

335
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:32,600
It is in John Lee Pettymore's inventory, like on his body.

336
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,600
In my character inventory.

337
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,600
Yeah.

338
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:40,600
Is there anything else that you guys have acquired throughout the campaign so far that

339
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:45,600
you would like to put in these lockers, or is it just these four main items?

340
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,600
Just the four main items.

341
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,600
I think just those four, yeah.

342
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,600
Let's keep that bag with us.

343
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,600
Yeah, because that could be useful.

344
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,600
You think?

345
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:54,600
Yeah, because if we got rid of something quick, there's no reason to hold onto it.

346
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,600
For sure.

347
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,600
Who's got the bag?

348
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,600
Who got the bag?

349
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,600
I got the bag.

350
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,600
Yeah, you got the bag.

351
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,600
Clark's got the bag.

352
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,600
Clark's got the bag.

353
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:08,600
When you were looking at all four of the items that you put into the lockers at the

354
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:12,600
police station, you would notice that they all have the red light showing, except for

355
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,600
the camera, which has the green light showing.

356
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,600
Okay.

357
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,600
Duly noted.

358
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,600
Perfect.

359
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,600
Oh, shit.

360
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,600
I don't want to mess with it right now.

361
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,600
I'd like to mess with it just a little bit.

362
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,600
Okay.

363
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:29,600
When we have all those items together, I want to try to move the objects around in different

364
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:34,600
orders in relation to each other and just see if that changes the lights at all.

365
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,600
Okay.

366
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,600
That takes some time.

367
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:40,480
I mean, one of the objects is a pretty heavy radio, so maybe you move the items around

368
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,920
it or you move all of them, whatever, either way.

369
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:47,320
It takes some time, but you would notice that the lights don't change.

370
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,720
The camera is green.

371
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:54,400
The radio, the gun, and the helmet are all red light showing.

372
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,400
What happened the last time we took a picture?

373
00:20:55,400 --> 00:21:00,200
Last time the camera turned green was in front of a weird spot, right?

374
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,600
It was back at Splashylvania.

375
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,280
Yeah, and it had a picture of the guy in the...

376
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,280
In the stocks.

377
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,280
In the stocks.

378
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,280
I think we should take a picture.

379
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,280
I think we should, too.

380
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,680
Wait, if you look through the lens, can you see anything through it that's out of the

381
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,680
ordinary?

382
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,680
Is there a viewfinder?

383
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,680
There is.

384
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,280
Do I see a spooky thing through the...

385
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,280
Okay.

386
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,280
You never have.

387
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,280
Take a picture.

388
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,880
I'm pretty nervous, but let's go take a picture outside.

389
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:27,640
What if I put the helmet on and put the radio on my shoulder like a boombox and I held the

390
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,760
gun and you took a picture of me like that?

391
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,760
That'd be cool, huh?

392
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,760
No way.

393
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,760
No.

394
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,760
No?

395
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,760
No.

396
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,760
No.

397
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,760
Okay.

398
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,760
No.

399
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,760
Okay, that's fine.

400
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,760
Well...

401
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,760
Come on.

402
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,760
I can put it on my...

403
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,760
I got an Instagram recently.

404
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,760
I can put it on there.

405
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,960
We know the camera is the only one with a green light right now, so let's see what it does

406
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,400
and then we'll go from there.

407
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,400
Sure.

408
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,400
All right.

409
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,400
Has the light been on this whole time?

410
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:56,080
You mean it's been on the whole time we've been talking about it?

411
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,640
It hasn't been sitting in evidence with a green light on, has it?

412
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:03,320
I've called for a couple rules that would have alerted you to the fact that it has a

413
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:08,160
green light, but taking it out and putting it somewhere, you would obviously recognize

414
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,240
that there's a green light on it.

415
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,000
It is currently December 4th.

416
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,480
It was last used the night of December 2nd.

417
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:21,400
I thought you were prepping us because this photo was going to warp us through time.

418
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:26,520
Just so you know, it's December 4th now, and when you wake up, it's November 8th.

419
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:30,960
Okay, I take a picture of Keith.

420
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,960
I'm outside.

421
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,400
I'm doing two thumbs up.

422
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:39,680
No, I got my gun in one hand and I'm doing a thumbs up in the other, and I say to John,

423
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:43,080
hey, if this does take a picture of me, I'm going to take it.

424
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,080
You guys should follow me.

425
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:50,160
I'm Keith0911 on Instagram, and then I make sure the safety's on and it's not, so I turn

426
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:54,120
the safety on with my gun, and I'm like, take my picture, click.

427
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:59,920
There is an extremely bright flash that is almost blinding, and as each of your visions

428
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:06,600
come back into focus, you see a piece of paper being smoothly printed out of the bottom of

429
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,480
this camera.

430
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,960
Everyone roll Sanity.

431
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,960
Fail.

432
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,960
Fail.

433
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,960
Fail.

434
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,960
Beautiful.

435
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,960
I rolled a 95.

436
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:23,440
Okay, one at a time, go ahead and roll a D4 for how much Sanity you lose.

437
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,440
Let's start with John and go around.

438
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,440
I didn't leave a D4 out.

439
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,440
That's four.

440
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,440
Four, yeah.

441
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,080
Can I see your D4?

442
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,520
You might want to use a different one, but yeah.

443
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,520
Three.

444
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,520
Three.

445
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,520
Holy shit, that's a chunk.

446
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,520
Four.

447
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,520
Oh, fuck.

448
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,520
I got a four also.

449
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:45,080
John Lee Pettymore loses four Sanity, Keith Vigno loses three Sanity, and Clark Bishop

450
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,520
loses four Sanity.

451
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,400
I am at my breaking point.

452
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,520
What is everybody at now?

453
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,040
I'm at 30, my breaking point is 30.

454
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,840
I'm at 36, and my breaking point is 32.

455
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:58,000
I'm at 37, with my breaking point at 31.

456
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
La-dee-da.

457
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:05,800
All right, Keith, we will discuss your next disorder in between sessions, but for now...

458
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:10,320
You've got a crippling fear of getting your picture taken right after you got your first

459
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,880
Instagram account.

460
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,960
Oh no!

461
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,520
Every time I get a like, I just break down.

462
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,200
My social media presence is crippled.

463
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:23,180
You all gather around to look at the picture that prints out from the bottom of this camera,

464
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:28,860
and you see a picture that shows two men in a room made of darkness.

465
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:33,560
You can barely make out the two figures in the picture, thanks to the light from a small

466
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:37,860
candle, also made out of a substance without color.

467
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:43,760
The candle is sitting on a table made of the same unbelievably black texture, and of the

468
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:49,280
two men, one is a slender, muscular man in a black t-shirt, revealing tribal tattoo sleeves

469
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:53,040
on both arms going down to his hands and fingertips.

470
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:58,720
He is kneeling before another man who looks like a no-bullshit John Wayne-style cowboy.

471
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:03,500
This man seems to be aware of the picture being taken, holding his hand up to block

472
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:07,040
his face from the camera's flash and sight.

473
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:12,200
On John Lee Pettymore's hands, you see that inky black substance, and it's dripping onto

474
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,580
the ground from the camera and the picture.

475
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:20,400
It's pooling on the ground, and you can swear it's moving, but when you blink, the substance

476
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,880
is gone.

477
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:28,680
John's hands are clean, and he's holding this odd device, and this even odder picture.

478
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,280
Fuck that.

479
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:40,240
John still feels like there's goo on his- he is freaking out a little bit.

480
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,240
Cool cool cool.

481
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:46,880
Also, if I could get an alertness roll from both Keith and Clark.

482
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,640
I fail.

483
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,640
I pass.

484
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,640
43 out of 70.

485
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:55,800
Okay, if Thomas and Luke could leave the room just for a quick second, I'm going to keep

486
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,960
the recording going.

487
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,720
If you guys just want to dip out on the other side of the door, and la la la.

488
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:10,700
Okay, so Clark, when you saw that inky black liquid dripping all over the camera and picture

489
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:16,780
in John's hands, you looked up, and saw that exact same substance oozing out of John Lee

490
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:22,820
Pettymore's eyes, his nose, his mouth, and his ears.

491
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,540
Even still?

492
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:27,340
As soon as you blink, the substance is gone.

493
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:35,780
Okay, so would you guys like to do anything, or would you like to just get the camera-

494
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:38,940
By the way, the camera, the light is now red again.

495
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:42,580
Do you fellas recognize anybody in that picture there?

496
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:44,580
Can I roll?

497
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:45,580
I don't, do I?

498
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:47,860
Tribal Tats looks pretty cool.

499
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:50,580
Tribal Tats and Contingent would like stick out, right?

500
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:51,580
Is this John Wayne?

501
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:53,580
That guy looks like John Wayne.

502
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,180
Is that guy John- no, but he does.

503
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:57,820
He looks like an actual cowboy.

504
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:58,820
That's kind of silly.

505
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:04,100
Out of character, have any cowboys been part of this at all?

506
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:07,380
Yeah, everyone in Contingent is a cowboy.

507
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,700
We're all cowboys.

508
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:12,140
Yeah, this is the 1840s.

509
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:15,900
Where's your hen at?

510
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,620
Would any of us recognize somebody with tribal tattoos?

511
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,340
Yeah, do we know these people?

512
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:24,300
Yeah, would any of us recognize the guy with tribal tattoos, because that would stick out

513
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,300
in contention.

514
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,300
No.

515
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:29,040
Yeah, I don't know any of these folks here.

516
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,820
It's like he knew you were taking a picture, though.

517
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:34,020
He's got his hand right in front of the flash.

518
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:39,980
This might seem a little nuts, but it seems like, well it's not exactly a portal, but

519
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,360
something came through.

520
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,080
This is some kind of gateway.

521
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:48,700
So the last picture this camera took- Or a look into another dimension, another place.

522
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:53,180
It could be the now, but it could also be like it's spitting out old pictures.

523
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:56,980
So the pictures that we've seen that this camera's taken, the last one was a guy in

524
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,260
stocks.

525
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:03,240
One was, was it people in front of like a black building in like old timey clothes?

526
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:08,480
That's the pictures we found on- Right, that one wasn't one that we took, but it was found

527
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,480
with the camera.

528
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,480
Yeah.

529
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,480
What was her name?

530
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,000
That was in Julie Maxwell's car.

531
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,880
Was that the only other picture that we found over there too with her?

532
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:18,840
I think that is the only one that I think John found.

533
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:22,600
Hey y'all, if you'll remember, that man in the picture was John Peters.

534
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,600
In the stocks?

535
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,600
In the stocks.

536
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,600
Oh, that's right.

537
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,600
Oh, that's right.

538
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,600
That's right.

539
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,160
I don't know what that means, but that is just some information to ponder over.

540
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,760
Anybody gotta hit the restroom before we go?

541
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,280
This is Joe real fast.

542
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,560
Did we, we still don't know anything about where he is, right?

543
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,560
John Peters?

544
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,560
I don't think so.

545
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,560
We haven't answered any questions.

546
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,520
If we do know, I would like to be reminded.

547
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,520
Okay.

548
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,520
Oh, shit.

549
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:48,840
Um, so Billy Harrison, who was part of the team, as far as we understand, they were just

550
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,560
looking for that bag, right?

551
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,560
Uh, sorta.

552
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:54,880
I think didn't the, I think the FBI agents mentioned John, John Peters to me.

553
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,880
Right.

554
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,880
But the reason they wanted to get to him was because they had the bag.

555
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,880
You're right.

556
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,880
You're right.

557
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,880
You're right.

558
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:07,560
Maybe John was involved in whatever they were, this, this organization, this phone number.

559
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,700
Maybe John was a part of that.

560
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:09,800
They were working together.

561
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,320
Maybe John brought all this stuff here.

562
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,320
Maybe got out of here.

563
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,360
A rogue agent or something.

564
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,360
What was he betting on?

565
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,480
I mean, I think something got out of hand.

566
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,480
MMA fights or something.

567
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,920
Oh, I forgot all about that, Keith.

568
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:22,920
He was betting on fights.

569
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:23,920
It seemed like.

570
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,360
Fights or was it races?

571
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,360
We figured out one of them was an MMA fighter.

572
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,360
One of the names.

573
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,360
Oh, that's right.

574
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,200
He had a whole list of funny fighter names.

575
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,680
His name was Oz Mayhem Wolf.

576
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,680
Ah-woo.

577
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,680
Ah-woo.

578
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:43,480
And they were all versus-ing like the world crusher or something like that.

579
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,480
Yeah.

580
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,480
What was it?

581
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,480
Squaring off against.

582
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,480
How about that?

583
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,480
Instead of versus-ing.

584
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,480
Thank you.

585
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,600
They were all squaring off against planet juggernaut.

586
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,600
Planet juggernaut.

587
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,920
I was close with the world crusher.

588
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,920
Yeah.

589
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,920
Juggernaut.

590
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,200
I barely knew her not.

591
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,040
Also, a quick reminder.

592
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,900
Just about things that you've already seen.

593
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:10,760
The Fonzie woman at the hotel motel said that Marvin sent them to contention to find out

594
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:15,360
what happened to Jermaine Glass and Alfred Glass when they came to collect money from

595
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,360
John Peters.

596
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,360
Okay.

597
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,000
Only Alfred came back and he's a blubbering idiot now.

598
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,260
He won't shut up about some gun.

599
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:24,980
He sounded like a lunatic and Jermaine is missing.

600
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:25,980
So here's what I'm thinking.

601
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:29,380
The Glass dudes are associated with the mobster guy.

602
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:35,440
John Peters probably bet on these fights and lost and they are like sharks coming to get

603
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,440
money from them.

604
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,440
Well, yeah.

605
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,440
Yeah.

606
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,440
Did we already think that?

607
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,740
That's just- I think that's what he just said.

608
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:43,740
Yeah.

609
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:44,740
You know what?

610
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:46,940
I think I can fit that in my mouth and clean it up.

611
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:49,740
Will you describe- Give him the light bulb.

612
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:50,740
Give him the light bulb.

613
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:51,740
Dude.

614
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:52,740
Oh yeah.

615
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:53,740
That's a good gangster thing.

616
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:54,740
Put this in your mouth.

617
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,460
Will you describe the picture as we hold it now?

618
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:00,860
Imagine the unlucky idiot who figured that out for the first time.

619
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:01,860
Yeah.

620
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:05,500
That would be so awful.

621
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,500
So much pain.

622
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,940
Let's saw shit.

623
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:12,520
As you look at the picture now, you see the same thing.

624
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:18,180
So it's a darkly lit room, a table made of that nothingness, a candle made of that nothingness.

625
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:19,780
The room is made of nothingness.

626
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:23,940
A substance without color, an unbelievably black texture.

627
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,020
There are two men.

628
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:27,020
We've seen almost everything made out of this stuff.

629
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:30,980
It's also- Tribal guy is standing- The tribal guy's kneeling before another man.

630
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:31,980
I'm sorry.

631
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:32,980
Okay.

632
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:33,980
So he's kneeling, the John Wayne guy is standing.

633
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:34,980
Yes.

634
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:35,980
Yes.

635
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:37,660
And we don't get a clear view of his face because of his hand?

636
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:38,660
Correct.

637
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:39,660
All right.

638
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:45,020
I mean- Let's stick this with the other pictures and try to figure it out later, but I think

639
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:46,380
we should head off to the mill.

640
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,380
I agree.

641
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,380
Sounds- Yeah.

642
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:51,180
A mystery for- Next Tuesday.

643
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:58,220
Hey, also, I don't want to do this, but just to make the thing better, I did cocaine and

644
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:00,680
you said it would only last for a few hours, so.

645
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:03,060
So you feel like hot, sweet garbage.

646
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:05,260
Also, it is 1 p.m. now.

647
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:06,260
Okay.

648
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:09,540
Hey guys, I got to go pee real quick before we head out to the mill.

649
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:11,660
I'll be right back.

650
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:12,660
Okay.

651
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:13,660
Thanks for telling us.

652
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:14,940
I go to the bathroom and I rip a line of cocaine.

653
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:17,060
Go ahead and roll a D6 for me.

654
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,260
Rip a line of cocaine.

655
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,260
It's a four.

656
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:21,700
You're good for four more hours.

657
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,140
You're good until 5 p.m.

658
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:24,140
Cool.

659
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,140
You are coked up to the gills.

660
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,140
Hell yeah, baby.

661
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:27,140
You are coked.

662
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:30,820
You did a fat line in the bathroom of the police station.

663
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:36,100
I walk out of the bathroom with my smartphone in my hand and it's playing-

664
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:38,100
Keith, were you doing coke in there?

665
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:40,460
Hold on, let me- That's cute.

666
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:43,660
Let me explain to you how you see me before you ask me.

667
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:48,100
Well, we just see you with all that- You just came out of the bathroom without any time

668
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,100
passing.

669
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,780
Yeah, you didn't flush.

670
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:55,460
I walk out of the bathroom like maybe 15 seconds after I enter the bathroom.

671
00:32:55,460 --> 00:33:00,380
I've got my phone out up to my ear and it's playing Life's Been Good by Joe Walsh and

672
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:03,300
I'm like banging my head to the guitar riff.

673
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:05,420
Okay, yeah, I'm good to go now.

674
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:08,180
Okay.

675
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:09,180
All right.

676
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:10,700
Thanks for telling us.

677
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:13,220
Okay, so you guys are heading off to the mill?

678
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:14,220
I think that's what we want to do.

679
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:15,780
Can I ride with one of you guys?

680
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:17,500
I just kind of want to like jam.

681
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:18,660
I'll ride with Clark then.

682
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:19,660
Sorry, Clark.

683
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:20,660
Yeah, Clark.

684
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:21,660
Okay, cool.

685
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:23,060
Yeah, we're going to have a good time on the way up there, dude.

686
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:25,380
It's going to be a really good time.

687
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,540
I just don't feel like driving right now.

688
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:30,020
I think it would be safer if the two of us were right up there together, you know?

689
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,020
Okay, yeah, yeah.

690
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,500
I'm already walking out the door.

691
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:36,260
Okay, so John, are you driving separately as well?

692
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:40,660
Okay, so you guys begin driving off to the mill.

693
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:50,300
As you take the main drag in contention north up to the highway to head toward the city,

694
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:52,420
Zach is just puking off Mike.

695
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:55,380
Our DM is literally vomiting with excitement.

696
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:57,940
He's looking like Ramona right now.

697
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:58,940
Meow.

698
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:01,580
I really want some fried rice.

699
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:09,060
About halfway in between downtown and the highway, you go over a overpass that leads

700
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:10,260
over the creek.

701
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:14,900
It's actually, you would know, it's the same creek that runs behind the first church of

702
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:15,900
contention.

703
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:19,460
In fact, as you take the main drag, looking to your right on the other side of the creek,

704
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:22,820
you can see the back of the first church of contention.

705
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:29,420
Going over that bridge, that overpass, you do see lots of animals in the water at this

706
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:31,400
juncture as well.

707
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,700
This is a different place?

708
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:34,700
Yes, different part of the same creek.

709
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:36,780
Hey, I call out over the radio.

710
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:42,060
Hey, you know, this is just a thought, and we'll have to wait to look into it, but maybe

711
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:48,740
having a cat mind, or a person mind in a cat body, we'll find her cat husband because he'll

712
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:51,300
be the only goddamn cat that's not in that creek.

713
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,300
Oh my God.

714
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,300
That could be.

715
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,300
Good job.

716
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,660
Is he letting Vigna use your radio?

717
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:57,660
No.

718
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:02,540
If I had seen him going for my radio, I would have smacked his hand.

719
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:04,100
He's definitely doing coke, right?

720
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,100
Over.

721
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,100
Yes, I am.

722
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,100
He says yes he is.

723
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,100
Over.

724
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,100
Yeah, I heard.

725
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,100
Over.

726
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,100
Keith, you're doing coke?

727
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,100
I mean, not right now.

728
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:13,100
I did it.

729
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,100
Why are you doing coke?

730
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,100
Why my hand?

731
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,740
Because I don't feel very good without it.

732
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,580
We could have got you a cup of coffee.

733
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:20,580
I know.

734
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:25,300
Well, the powers that be told me that that wouldn't work.

735
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,520
The powers that be?

736
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,520
Just go with it, man.

737
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,020
I don't, you know.

738
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:30,280
Are you hearing voices, Keith?

739
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:33,340
The more you talk about it, the more nervous I'm going to get.

740
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,340
Let's just roll with it.

741
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,720
Just act like I'm normal.

742
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:37,340
I am normal.

743
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:42,460
Are you going to be at the top of your game if shit goes down?

744
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:45,840
If I wasn't on coke, I wouldn't be at the top of my game.

745
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,520
I would not be able to function.

746
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,520
I'll tell you that.

747
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,520
Alright.

748
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,520
That's why I went to...

749
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,880
Keith, we're going to talk about your dependency later.

750
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,880
I'm not dependent.

751
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,880
I'm just, it's useful for me right now.

752
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:57,040
That's the definition of dependency if the top of your game is with it.

753
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:00,600
Well, it doesn't seem to have caused any problems yet.

754
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,600
Let's just go.

755
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,600
Why are you guys talking about...

756
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,600
Just make sure it's that way.

757
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,600
You usually don't care this much about me.

758
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:09,360
Keith, it's not that I don't care.

759
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,360
What is it then?

760
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:14,480
It's that I don't care a whole lot.

761
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:21,480
Well, thanks for the pep talk.

762
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:24,800
I crawl over the console into the backseat.

763
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,800
Well, no, it's a cop car.

764
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,800
I can't do that.

765
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,800
I attempt to and then I remember where I am.

766
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:33,200
You just bang your forehead on the cage.

767
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,200
I just want you to know...

768
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,800
Life's been good to me so far.

769
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,800
Keith!

770
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,800
Keith!

771
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:46,800
You had your hands on the call button this whole time.

772
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,800
To the mail, to the mail, to the mail, mail, mail.

773
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,800
Okay, cool.

774
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:54,680
So real quick, the three of you are almost to the highway.

775
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,880
John or Clark, who is ahead?

776
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:57,880
Who is behind?

777
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:03,200
I threw my lights on and sped a decent way ahead of them after the whole radio conversation.

778
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,200
Okay, fair enough.

779
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:08,200
Go ahead and, John, make me an alertness check.

780
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,200
Six!

781
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,200
I finally passed one of those.

782
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:15,320
You see the sky ahead of you begin to swirl.

783
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:20,280
About thirty feet above the ground, a flat oval begins to form.

784
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:26,760
The sky around it spirals like cloth, making folds as it gathers in bunches in certain

785
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:29,320
places in the sky.

786
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:36,240
The oval is black, but a technicolor energy is erupting from its darkness, and then the

787
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:40,640
sky is just as it was, but something is falling.

788
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,640
Roll sand.

789
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,640
Fail.

790
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:46,640
Alright, go ahead and roll a D4 for me.

791
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,800
God damn it, four again.

792
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:54,800
That puts you at your breaking point!

793
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:59,120
John Lee Pettymore is at 32 sanity, and his breaking point is 32.

794
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,680
I'm broke, y'all.

795
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,400
We're going crazy together, brother.

796
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,840
I'm not crazy.

797
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:10,800
John Lee Pettymore, the windshield of your vehicle is smashed in, and tiny shards of

798
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,680
glass immediately cover everything around you.

799
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:21,000
Slumped across your dashboard is the lifeless body of a grown man, and blood is splattered

800
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,480
everywhere.

801
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,480
Roll sanity.

802
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:26,760
Oh hell, what the hell, what the shit?

803
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:31,600
That's not the craziest thing I've ever seen, I guess.

804
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,360
You lose one more sanity, so you're down at 31.

805
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:37,640
Now real quick, Clark, I need you to roll a drive check.

806
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,560
Oh shit.

807
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:42,000
Pretty important drive check.

808
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,800
I fail.

809
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:49,960
I got a 78 on a 15.

810
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:56,840
You slam on your brakes as this body from a technicolor rip in the sky slams into your

811
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,120
windshield.

812
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:04,200
You instantly feel another violent impact, this time from behind, as Clark plows into

813
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,720
your cruiser.

814
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:09,620
You lose control of the vehicle and swerve into oncoming traffic.

815
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:15,800
You hear the sound of a horn blaring, and you vaguely remember the sight of a minivan

816
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:22,240
driving in the oncoming lane before this chaos of disorienting glass and blood and pain.

817
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:27,560
You see a flash of color fly by out of the corner of your eye and then, as your car finally

818
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:34,840
jerks to a stop, you hear a deafening crash, and the rumble of fire.

819
00:39:45,800 --> 00:40:05,720
How am I the only one trying to pull over How can you have enough drowning out of the
