1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,700
Howdy-do, my wolf pups.

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:06,500
It's your rootin' tootin' DJ Wolf the dog.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,660
Emphasis on the tootin'.

4
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:11,500
I have horrible bowel issues.

5
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,780
Please send some tootin' medicine

6
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:17,560
into the interdimensional hallways, I wonder.

7
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:22,360
But I will not let my passive massive gas emissions

8
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,400
ruin this transmission,

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:29,400
which is broadcastin' live from 694.2 PTBP.

10
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,080
I think I smell somethin' funky.

11
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,720
We must have a new Howlin' with Wolf.

12
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,440
This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Mason

13
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,960
in Orlando, Florida, who tweeted about the show

14
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,320
and tagged that pretending pod,

15
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,100
a thing you will also do the next time

16
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,740
you are on the Twitter.

17
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:55,120
Mason writes, the Yatil Arts Foundation

18
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,700
would like to invite you for a one-night-only performance

19
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,580
of the show that everyone is talkin' about,

20
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:04,460
Leroy and Juwan.

21
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:09,220
Join classically trained performers like Liberty Siegel,

22
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:13,900
Isa Al-Barsoumi, and Craig O'Doul

23
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:18,540
as they transport you to the magical realm of Carcosa

24
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,620
through the unforgettable songs

25
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:25,620
and legendary choreography of the 1895 classic.

26
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,780
Tickets are goin' fast,

27
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,200
so hurry to your local performin' arts center.

28
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,620
If you see the yellow sign, you're in the right place.

29
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:39,460
Huh, well, Mason, I think I'm gonna have to start

30
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:41,700
gettin' my producer to start proofin'

31
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,020
some of these Howlin' with Wolfses,

32
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,900
because some of y'all just send the wildest shit

33
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,020
and it truly does scare me.

34
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:52,100
Mason, I hope your weird performin' arts thing

35
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,060
is fun and not creepy.

36
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,400
It better not be creepy and weird, Mason.

37
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,180
If you wanna write up somethin' for your wolf to howl,

38
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,020
tag at PretendingPod on the internet

39
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:05,980
or write a five-star review on Apple Podcasts

40
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,560
and let us know about it.

41
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,780
If you wanna find Scott on Twitter

42
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,860
or hang out with the cast and other listeners on Discord

43
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,260
or listen to some of Justin's incredible score,

44
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:20,000
then friendship ended with Zelda,

45
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,480
now Link is my best friend,

46
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,000
and all the Links are in the show notes.

47
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,480
And what does Link say when he meets one of a set

48
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,640
of explicit or understood regulations

49
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,840
or principles governing conduct

50
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,600
within a particular activity or sphere?

51
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,320
Hi, rule.

52
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:45,160
Fuck Ganondorf Dragmire, it's time for the news.

53
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:49,260
Last time, Elden Ring ended up dancin' with a woman

54
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:53,060
whose mind was already owned by some force greater

55
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:57,000
than Elden had ever met, such force that Chequers,

56
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,040
Elden's leader, had to pull out smell insults

57
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,680
to bring the psychic back to reality.

58
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,980
Lafayette J. Honeycutt teased his own invention

59
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:09,900
as he and his man, Harvey Brewer,

60
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,380
climbed up a frozen ladder to the top of the tower

61
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:18,040
adorned with Cicero Mordaunt's strange aerial antennae.

62
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,480
While up there, Harvey saw somethin' indescribable

63
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,580
flyin' through the winter storm and toward the house.

64
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:27,840
But at the very end of the last episode,

65
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,640
Elden Ring basically pledged allegiance

66
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,760
to this unimaginable power that has taken hold

67
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,960
of the guests here, and when Chequers brought him back again

68
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:41,560
the changed psychic stared into the pitch black eyes

69
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,240
of Reverend Nye, who winked.

70
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,520
If that doesn't give you shivers,

71
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,520
then you need to release the tension

72
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,520
in your jaw and shoulders.

73
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,800
Here, maybe this'll help.

74
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,740
It's Isabelle Crane with Hollow.

75
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:02,480
I didn't know a body could be hollow

76
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,200
before its blood ran cold.

77
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,200
I didn't know that the wind could sew

78
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:21,200
through tissue and faggot bone.

79
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:28,200
You were hollow when you spoke to me.

80
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:36,200
Hollow when you sang.

81
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:44,200
I thought you might be starvin'

82
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:51,200
so I gave you everything.

83
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,200
Who would like to recount what happened last time?

84
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,200
Oh shit, welcome to pretending to be people!

85
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,200
Psychic attack, psychic attack, psychic attack!

86
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:09,200
If it's dark, look in the window and there's a face there.

87
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:13,200
If you're stoned right now and it's dark outside,

88
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,200
don't look in the window.

89
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:19,200
Nightmare, nightmare, nightmare.

90
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:23,200
There's not someone in your closet you don't have to check.

91
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,200
But there is somebody in the backseat of your car.

92
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,200
Oh!

93
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,200
That's why the car behind you keeps flashing their brides.

94
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,200
Oh no.

95
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,200
Listen to podcasts while driving, cut this bit.

96
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,200
No!

97
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,200
Put in honking noises.

98
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,200
Yeah, put in sirens.

99
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,200
Sirens.

100
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,200
Oh my god, that happened to me the other day.

101
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,200
It made me so angry and it was another actual play.

102
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,200
That wasn't fun for me.

103
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,200
It scared me.

104
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,200
I don't like cops.

105
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,200
Alright, so...

106
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,200
Yeah, in the words of John Lennon,

107
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:58,200
Get a job, cop!

108
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:04,200
And we are here in the pretending to be people episode

109
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,200
with a special guest named Scott Dormerd.

110
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,200
Scott, thank you for joining us once again.

111
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,200
Oh, my pleasure, gents. My pleasure.

112
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,200
How do you think it's going so far?

113
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:17,200
It's accelerating nicely and I am looking forward to doing horrible things to all of you.

114
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,200
Nice!

115
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,200
Yeah, we're gonna die.

116
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:23,200
Our bodies are ready.

117
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:28,200
Hey, Zach, big thanks for taking that huge luck hit for me in the last one.

118
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,200
I'm a team player.

119
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,200
What are you at now?

120
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,200
I am down to two.

121
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,200
No, I'm just kidding. I have 51.

122
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,200
Oh, shit.

123
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,200
After all that?

124
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,200
You'll be fine.

125
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,200
You had mad luck.

126
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,200
Okay.

127
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,200
Yeah, 65 luck.

128
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,200
Wow.

129
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,200
You won't need luck for anything else in this scenario.

130
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:51,200
I'm at 32 right now, so I could still survive an atomic blast, but just barely.

131
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,200
I would have been at 32 if you hadn't taken it for me.

132
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,200
Oh, well, you're welcome, my dear sir.

133
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,200
I'm still sitting pretty at 65.

134
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,200
You need to start doing more crazy shit.

135
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,200
I'm currently wrecking alien technology.

136
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,200
I think I'm gonna start having to use some luck.

137
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:09,200
So, yeah, last time we left off, you guys were in the tower.

138
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,200
Destroying.

139
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:14,200
We had discovered the secret of Mordent's Tower thanks to Zach's luck sacrifice,

140
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:19,200
and the secret was it was set up to receive some kind of alien transmissions.

141
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,200
Or send, I think.

142
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,200
Send, okay, yes.

143
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:27,200
Possibly some sort of psychic thing, encouraging people to enjoy the invention.

144
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:33,200
Yeah, meanwhile, Checkers is chatting it up with an heiress to a fortune.

145
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,200
A real Greg over there.

146
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,200
I'm pulling a Greg, and then...

147
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,200
Succession reference.

148
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,200
Yeah, the senator still haven't talked to him.

149
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,200
Have yet to talk to the senator from Vermont.

150
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:53,200
I doubt that we'll be able to get to a psychic attack, psychic attack on him, because...

151
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,200
Why, Zach?

152
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,200
Well, Elden Ring, which is my full name.

153
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,200
Use it or lose it.

154
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:03,200
He's like, losing is an option. Please, please, lose it.

155
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,200
I think it's a really fun joke.

156
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,200
Scott, what would you have my name be?

157
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,200
I mean, literally anything else.

158
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,200
All right, I'll be literally anything else.

159
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,200
He's now Link from Zelda.

160
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:29,200
When we go back and listen to this, every time Elden Ring is said, it's just Scott introducing himself.

161
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,200
It's like, yeah, I'm Scott Dorward.

162
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:38,200
Every time Elden Ring is said, it's replaced with, it's a me.

163
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,200
It's a me.

164
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,200
Or you could just call me Kief, since that's like...

165
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:48,200
Yeah, we can spoil maybe at this point that your character is inspired by Kief from The Righteous Gemstones.

166
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:55,200
If you have been hitting some character moments with that in mind that have made Joe and I almost wet our pants.

167
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,200
It's been a really fun experience.

168
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,200
I'm happy to have such a delightful cult leader to be playing alongside,

169
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:10,200
as well as a crew of two that no one should outdo the brewer and whichever name you're going by.

170
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,200
Dave Ellington!

171
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,200
Dave Ellington, isn't that a pretty good fake name?

172
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,200
It's fucking great.

173
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,200
David Ellington, or is he just Birth Dave?

174
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,200
Oh yeah, I am going by David Ellington.

175
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,200
Yeah, it's very familiar for you two to call me Dave.

176
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:34,200
But where we really ended off is that Elden Ring here reached into the depths of part of your mind,

177
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,200
specifically Margaret Payne, the philanthropist,

178
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:45,200
reached into her mind and was met once again with a voice that basically enlisted Elden Ring

179
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,200
to make sure that the partygoers know that nothing should go off without a hitch this evening,

180
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:54,200
that Mardant's new invention should be well received,

181
00:09:54,200 --> 00:10:00,200
and that everyone should know it's going to change the world, you know.

182
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:10,200
And so, then he comes to and sees the fucking religion man with black eyes.

183
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,200
Did you forget the word reverent?

184
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,200
Yeah.

185
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,200
The fucking religion man.

186
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,200
But yeah, then you looked at Checkers and said,

187
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:26,200
Are you excited for Mardant's new invention? It's going to change the world, you know.

188
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,200
See, isn't that a great Keef, everybody?

189
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,200
Doing Keef from the Righteous Gemstones.

190
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,200
When he says that to Checkers, immediately he's-

191
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,200
Psychic attack! Psychic attack! Psychic attack!

192
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,200
Are you really attacking him?

193
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,200
Okay.

194
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,200
Isn't that how I would put it in your head?

195
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,200
Yeah, it kinda is. You know what? You said you wouldn't.

196
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,200
I did say that.

197
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,200
And you meant it, but now you have no choice.

198
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,200
I really don't.

199
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,200
Okay, so is it a power contest?

200
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,200
Scott, is this cool?

201
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:01,200
If you're both happy with this, I am absolutely ecstatic.

202
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,200
I'm fine with it, yeah.

203
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,200
Oh shit.

204
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:10,200
I succeeded with a 38 on a 90, and I got a 31.

205
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:14,200
And what is Checkers' power?

206
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,200
90 as well.

207
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,200
Oh god, so you're both tied.

208
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,200
We're in a minelock!

209
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,200
Yeah, I mean, normally it goes to the person with the higher power,

210
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,200
but you've both got the same power.

211
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:33,200
So I'm happy, I think, to treat this as a stalemate, so yes.

212
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,200
Checkers can feel, yeah, for some reason,

213
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,200
Eldin has turned against you, it seems.

214
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,200
He is trying to implant these thoughts in your head.

215
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,200
But at the same time, he has at least implanted some of them

216
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:53,200
so that perhaps you can feel that he really wants you to go out there

217
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:59,200
and convince everyone else at the party that Mordin's adventure

218
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,200
is going to change the world, you know?

219
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,200
Yeah, so I can feel that he's done this to me.

220
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,200
Eldin Ring starts crying.

221
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,200
Eldin!

222
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,200
Eldin, what is the invention?

223
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,200
It's going to change the world, you know?

224
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,200
Checkers starts backing up a little bit,

225
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,200
and he wants to get the fuck out of this room.

226
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,200
He doesn't want to be around psychic attacks.

227
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,200
Checkers!

228
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,200
Yeah, Checkers runs out the front.

229
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,200
It's going to change the world, you know?

230
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,200
He runs out the front into the snow.

231
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,200
How far away is the tower from me right now?

232
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,200
A couple of minutes walk.

233
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,200
Yeah, you can see the outline of it.

234
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:45,200
It's quite dark out here now, and there is really quite heavy snow.

235
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,200
If you're looking around just trying to get your bearings there in the snow,

236
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,200
you can give me a spot to hit and roll.

237
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,200
There you are.

238
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,200
No, I mean, you can remember roughly where you came from,

239
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,200
but you can't even make out the outline of the tower now.

240
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:05,200
There's a few feet of snow, it seems, that have fallen since you've been in there.

241
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:10,200
The cars are partly buried under the snow now,

242
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:14,200
and you can't even see any footprints out here now.

243
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,200
It's all been covered up.

244
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,200
Yeah, since I didn't grab my coat or anything, I'm cold already,

245
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,200
and Checkers is thinking, I just need to get inside,

246
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,200
but not around all the crazy people that are in there.

247
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,200
He remembers when he got poked in the eye by his pencil

248
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,200
that they were passing a tower,

249
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:38,200
so he wants to go in the direction that he thinks the tower is.

250
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:43,200
Well, seeing as you're doing this blind, let's have a luck roll.

251
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,200
Pass. 17.

252
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,200
Fuck yeah.

253
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:51,200
So, yeah, even though you can't see the tower,

254
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:56,200
you make your way through the whipping snow,

255
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:03,200
and you do eventually find yourself at the base of this structure.

256
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,200
You can make out the general shape of it now that you're underneath it,

257
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:10,200
but the visibility has dropped almost nothing now.

258
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:15,200
He reaches out to the rungs of the ladder,

259
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,200
and he's like, oh, I think there might be ice on this,

260
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,200
so he gives it a little lick, and yeah, sure enough.

261
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,200
It tastes cold.

262
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,200
Sure enough, it tastes like cold, and there is ice on it,

263
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:30,200
but he's going to try to carefully make his way up

264
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,200
because he's freezing cold right now,

265
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,200
so he just wants to get inside somewhere.

266
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,200
Yeah, you make your way out.

267
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,200
It is not a pleasant climb.

268
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:42,200
Every rung is now more and more slippery as you're going up,

269
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:46,200
and the wind is pulling at your clothing a couple of times.

270
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:50,200
You're really having to hold on tight to stop yourself being blown off,

271
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:54,200
but somehow you do make it up to this trapdoor,

272
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,200
and from the other side of the trapdoor,

273
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,200
you can hear the sound of things being smashed.

274
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:06,200
Yeah, intense clanging and genteel screams

275
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:09,200
and the grunts of a brute.

276
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:13,200
Yeah, that terrifies Checkers,

277
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:18,200
but he's freezing cold, and the only option is climbing back down this,

278
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,200
and he's not going to do that, so he...

279
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:25,200
I think you might recognize this Lafayette in the screens.

280
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,200
As I'm trying to decide whether I climb back down

281
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:32,200
to get away from this scary sound, I hear him say something.

282
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,200
I'm like, oh, I think that's the scientist,

283
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,200
and I pop in.

284
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:41,200
We comically stop in mid-motion of our smashing and see him standing there.

285
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,200
Oh, Checkers.

286
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,200
Fellas?

287
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,200
Enjoying the party?

288
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,200
Harvey, have you thought any more about that pamphlet I gave you?

289
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,200
I haven't got a chance to read it yet.

290
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,200
We're kind of busy here.

291
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,200
You can read, though, right?

292
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,200
Of course.

293
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,200
Okay, great.

294
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,200
Checkers, be a lad and grab something blunt and heavy

295
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,200
and start smashing all of this, would you?

296
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,200
I'm going to look around.

297
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,200
That's a fail on my spot hidden, so I'm going to grab...

298
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,200
What's something shitty that would be up here?

299
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,200
Just kick something, Checkers.

300
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,200
I don't know, just smash, smash, Checkers, smash.

301
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,200
I start using my fists and feet to...

302
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:23,200
I'm not really sure what I'm doing, but there's a big guy.

303
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,200
There's these two guys and a really big one telling me to do this.

304
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,200
I'm just going to do it.

305
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:35,200
Did you see two guys in tuxedos just kicking weird science machinery?

306
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,200
This is what the liberal elite do at parties.

307
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:44,200
Yeah, I'm going to start smashing stuff, but also there's a lot of cool gadget-looking shit here,

308
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:48,200
so I'm going to start flipping switches while I'm punching buttons and stuff.

309
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:53,200
Okay, yeah, flipping switches doesn't really do much at the moment because...

310
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,200
Yeah, there's no power.

311
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,200
Yeah, we smashed it up good.

312
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:01,200
Did anything happen when we smashed the big bulb?

313
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,200
It broke.

314
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,200
Nice!

315
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,200
Cool, I bet that was loud.

316
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,200
I bet it was like...

317
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,200
Checkers is starting to really get into it.

318
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:17,200
He hasn't really had an outlet for his frustration in a while,

319
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:21,200
so in his coked-up brain, he's like, yeah, fuck this place,

320
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,200
and he pulls out a lighter.

321
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,200
He's going to try to just set something on fire.

322
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,200
Oh, that's the spirit, boyo.

323
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,200
Can you give me a luck roll, please?

324
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,200
Scott did say earlier that the flaming tower could fall and you guys could all live.

325
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,200
Yeah, 25 on a 32.

326
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,200
So you two managed to start a couple of small fires,

327
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,200
but at the moment, they haven't gone completely out of control.

328
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,200
Perfect.

329
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,200
You set an attainable goal and you achieved that goal.

330
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:56,200
Yeah, as I continue kicking the stuff in here and I look at Harvey,

331
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,200
I'm like, look, and just point at one of the fires.

332
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,200
Harvey looks over and is surprised how into it you've gotten,

333
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,200
but then notices the fire.

334
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,200
Whoa, buddy, maybe too much there.

335
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,200
We're still up here. If this thing goes up, we gotta go down.

336
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,200
Yeah, fuck this place.

337
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,200
The fire is slowly spreading.

338
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,200
It's caught onto some of the insulation of the wiring

339
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:23,200
and there's a bit of thick black smoke that is now pooling into the air,

340
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,200
but it's not out of control yet.

341
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,200
Lafayette, he sees that. He's taking a break.

342
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:34,200
He's taking a heavy breather, and he thinks it's hilarious that...

343
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,200
I keep wanting to call you Chuckles.

344
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,200
You surely can.

345
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,200
Chuckles, I think it's hilarious what you've done in this tower,

346
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:48,200
but I do think we should probably get a move on pretty quickly now.

347
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,200
He takes a moment to look around,

348
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:55,200
and he wants to steal the most advanced thing, intact thing he can,

349
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,200
like an antenna, maybe the most alien-looking deal.

350
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:02,200
He's like, fuck you, Cicero, I'll burn your tower down

351
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,200
and I'm going to reverse-engineer your technology.

352
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:10,200
The really alien-looking antennae are actually on the outside of the tower.

353
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,200
I mean, you've smashed the place up.

354
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:16,200
You could open up a window and lean out and try to unscrew one of them,

355
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:22,200
but the wind is really high at the moment, so this is not without risk.

356
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,200
Harvey?

357
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,200
Hey, boy, Harvey, would you please lean out the window there

358
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,200
and grab me one of those antennae before this place burns to the ground?

359
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,200
Harvey's just going to do a smash with a fist through a window

360
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,200
and try and reach out and grab ahold of the nearest antennae

361
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,200
and just yank as hard as he can.

362
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:50,200
I'd say give me a combined strength and luck roll

363
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:54,200
to see whether you can do this without destroying the antenna

364
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:58,200
and without cutting your arms to shreds on the broken window.

365
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:04,200
I rolled a 71. My strength is 90, but my luck is only 65.

366
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,200
Okay, so that is a failure.

367
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,200
So I think what that means is, yes, you've punched through the window.

368
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,200
You've managed to wrench this antennae away.

369
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,200
I mean, you've got bits of it in your hand,

370
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,200
but you have cut your arm in the process.

371
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:24,200
I'll say that you take only one hit point of damage from this,

372
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:28,200
but there is blood that is now running down your hand,

373
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,200
or at least running down your arm,

374
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,200
and your hand's getting a bit sticky and slick from it.

375
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,200
It might occur to you that this is perhaps suboptimal

376
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,200
for your climb down again.

377
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,200
Can I attempt a first aid roll on him real quick?

378
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,200
I mean, you can try.

379
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,200
It'll take you a bit of time to bind the wound,

380
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,200
and that fire is beginning to spray.

381
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,200
If you want to take the time out in the burning building

382
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,200
to bind the wound up, you certainly can.

383
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,200
At the very least, it'll be entertaining.

384
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,200
When Checkers sees this happening and sees him cut,

385
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:08,200
with his 1% in medicine, he holds his lighter up.

386
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,200
Got to cauterize it.

387
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:16,200
No, why don't you hold off on the cauterization?

388
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,200
Lafayette is looking at the briefcase

389
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,200
that's never left his hand this whole time,

390
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,200
and he's looking at the flames, and he's like,

391
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,200
I think we should probably move it pretty quick.

392
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,200
He runs down the ladder without further consideration.

393
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,200
Oh, you're such a tease!

394
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,200
Well, seeing as you're doing this in a hurry now,

395
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,200
fleeing the burning cabin,

396
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,200
you're perhaps not getting the opportunity

397
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,200
to be quite as cautious as you were on the way up,

398
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,200
so I think this is where I start asking for rolls.

399
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,200
Okay.

400
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,200
I'll give you a choice as to whether to make a dex

401
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,200
or a climb roll, whichever is better,

402
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,200
but what I will say is that,

403
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:59,200
as Lafayette is carrying his suitcase,

404
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,200
I'm going to ask for a hard dig.

405
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:06,200
Well, my dex is 30, and I rolled a 36.

406
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,200
So you missed by 21 here.

407
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,200
You've got a number of rungs down,

408
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,200
but now that you're trying to get down fast,

409
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,200
these rungs are really quite slick,

410
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,200
and you realize that you're not going to be able to get down

411
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:27,200
before the flames start spreading to the actual structure

412
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,200
if you're carrying the suitcase.

413
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,200
Oh!

414
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,200
Well, then my only option is to open it,

415
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,200
strap on the jet pack inside.

416
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:39,200
Yes!

417
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,200
Bow, bow, bow, bow.

418
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,200
And rocket man away from the fucking conflagration.

419
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,200
Rocket man!

420
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,200
So you are trying to, while in, you know,

421
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,200
50 or 60 mile per hour winds,

422
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,200
on this icy ladder under a burning building,

423
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,200
you're trying to strap on a jet pack.

424
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,200
Well, when you put it like that, Scott.

425
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,200
Sounds simple, easy, and yeah, that's what he does.

426
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:10,200
His design is as ergonomic as it is brilliant.

427
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,200
Okay.

428
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,200
In which case, I think just for slipping this on in a big hurry,

429
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,200
let's just make this an ordinary Dex roll.

430
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,200
Okay.

431
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,200
Oh, you better fucking make it 26.

432
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,200
Yes!

433
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,200
On a 30.

434
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,200
Okay.

435
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,200
So yes, you can strap that on.

436
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,200
And what is your plan?

437
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,200
Are you just leaping into the wind from there,

438
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,200
or are you trying to just slow your descent?

439
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,200
What are you doing?

440
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,200
He licks a finger and holds it out and gauges, like,

441
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,200
before it gets, like, whipped away by the 50 mile an hour wind.

442
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,200
He says, it is cold.

443
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,200
Your finger tastes cold.

444
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,200
He gauges the direction of the wind and leaps off with it

445
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:58,200
and ignites the jet pack and tries to, you know,

446
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,200
he doesn't want to fight the storm.

447
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,200
He wants to rise with it into the air.

448
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,200
Riders on the storm.

449
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:11,200
So you are completely at the mercy of this jet pack.

450
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,200
So I think we'll come back to you in a moment.

451
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,200
Okay, perfect.

452
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,200
Fuck, yes, dude.

453
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,200
That was amazing.

454
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,200
But let's deal with the other two first.

455
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,200
So you're in this burning structure,

456
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:29,200
and you've just seen Lafayette down below you on the ladder

457
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,200
strap something onto his back and then just jump off the ladder.

458
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,200
Yeah, Lafayette is like, we gotta get out of here.

459
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,200
Deuces.

460
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,200
Can I assume that it's on fire enough that, like,

461
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,200
it's a pretty well lit...

462
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,200
It's well lit.

463
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,200
I'm well lit, bro.

464
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,200
Yeah, yeah.

465
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,200
I think the darkness is the least of your problems.

466
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:50,200
Yeah, so I see that happen, and I look around the room,

467
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:54,200
and I look at Harvey before we can even have the conversation

468
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,200
about who goes first.

469
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,200
I'm going down.

470
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,200
Harvey is standing there a bit odd watching the rocket pack

471
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,200
light up and start to take off, and he's,

472
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,200
the madman did it.

473
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,200
The madman did it.

474
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,200
It's working.

475
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,200
It's working.

476
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,200
Goodbye, Harvey.

477
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,200
As he watches wherever that starts to take him,

478
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,200
Harvey's going to start trying to get down the ladder also.

479
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,200
Yeah, as soon as I go down, I...

480
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,200
Get your ass down here.

481
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,200
We need you in the group.

482
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,200
Yeah.

483
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,200
Like, I can't lose a cult member.

484
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,200
Yeah.

485
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,200
So I think checkers, first of all,

486
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,200
let's have a dex roll from checkers to see how well you're

487
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,200
clambering down the ladder.

488
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,200
That's a 36 on a 50.

489
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,200
OK, so you're going down fine.

490
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,200
I mean, it's slow going because, again, you're having to,

491
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,200
every now and then, just hug onto the ladder for dear life

492
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,200
to stop being blown off.

493
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,200
But you are getting down without falling off, which is good.

494
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,200
On the other hand, Harvey and his wounded arm now,

495
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:59,200
I'm going to ask for a hard dex roll because of the injury.

496
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,200
It's a fail fail.

497
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,200
62 on a 50.

498
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,200
You're making your way down, but at the moment,

499
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,200
the blood's dripping down off your arm and your hand's slick.

500
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,200
Every now and then, because of the blood in your hand,

501
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,200
it's actually freezing.

502
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:17,200
I was going to say, I'm getting stuck to it every now and then.

503
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,200
And when you're pulling us away, you can feel skin coming

504
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:23,200
away as you're getting your hand free.

505
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,200
Who's hungry?

506
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,200
He's going to try and rip off his sleeve of that arm and try

507
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,200
and pull it down further so that he's not having the blood

508
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,200
contact with the rail.

509
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,200
I'll tell you what, let's be generous here.

510
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,200
Let's treat this as a push roll so there will be really bad

511
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,200
consequences if you fail.

512
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,200
But I'll say it because you're doing that.

513
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,200
This sounds more like brute strength than dexterity.

514
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,200
If you want to make a strength roll.

515
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,200
Yeah, I would like to do that.

516
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,200
You got this.

517
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:58,200
It's a 64 on a 90, so I pass, but not a hard pass.

518
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,200
No, this just needed to be a hard.

519
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,200
So yes, you do manage to tug it down.

520
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:08,200
I mean, that's not quite stopped the bleeding, but it

521
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:11,200
slowed it down enough that the blood isn't going to be quite

522
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,200
as much of an impediment.

523
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,200
So yeah, with that, you can clamp your way carefully and

524
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,200
painfully down to the ground.

525
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,200
Do I lose any hit points in the process?

526
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,200
Is it that kind of damage?

527
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,200
No, you lost the one before for slashing your arm up,

528
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,200
but that's it.

529
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,200
But the rest of it, I mean, it's largely cosmetic damage.

530
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:31,200
Your hand hurts a bit from endorsing a bit of the skin off

531
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:36,200
your palm and your fingertips, but yeah, that's just uncomfortable.

532
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,200
Oh, you got a bright future ahead of you though.

533
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,200
No fingertips.

534
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,200
You could do some stuff.

535
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,200
Crime.

536
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,200
Crime for sure.

537
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,200
Also in 1937, do they have that kind of forensics?

538
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,200
Google it.

539
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,200
Oh yeah.

540
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,200
Google it.

541
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:59,200
Yeah, fingerprint technology came in about 1900 and even

542
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,200
from the 1930s, they could do latent fingerprints off fabrics

543
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,200
and stuff like that.

544
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,200
I'm just saying this because I researched it for a different project.

545
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,200
No, that's awesome.

546
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,200
No, that's really cool.

547
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,200
It's nice to have someone knowledgeable on the podcast.

548
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,200
I guarantee I've Googled this before and then learned it and

549
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,200
then immediately forgot the information.

550
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,200
So that's not learning, is it?

551
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,200
I'll forget in a week's time, but I was just recording something

552
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,200
else two days back that required that knowledge, so nice.

553
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:32,200
So let's cut back to the inside of the manor where Mr.

554
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:37,200
Ring had been given a new mission in life.

555
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,200
It's going to change the world, you know?

556
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,200
While you're wandering around the crowd and I mean,

557
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,200
most of the people that you're telling that to are telling

558
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,200
the same G5 back.

559
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,200
He's stuck in the loop of the three guys.

560
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,200
Yeah, when we cut back, I'm the fourth in the acapella group.

561
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:57,200
It's going to change the world, you know?

562
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:02,200
It's going to change the world, you know?

563
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:08,200
It's going to change the world, you know?

564
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,200
Wait, I'm sorry.

565
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,200
Can we actually try this?

566
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,200
This is bullshit.

567
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,200
When he and my baby see more dense inventions.

568
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,200
This is dumb.

569
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,200
We can do this.

570
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,200
Yeah, we can do it.

571
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,200
No, we can't.

572
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,200
It's going to change the world.

573
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,200
It's going to change the world.

574
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,200
It's going to change the world.

575
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:34,200
It's going to change the world, you know?

576
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,200
Bubble, bubble down.

577
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,200
Well, you have your new theme song.

578
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,200
OK, that was good.

579
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,200
I just love to think that the swing band up on stage

580
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:47,200
is so taken with your number that they're actually joining in.

581
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,200
Yes.

582
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:55,200
They're waving us up.

583
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,200
God.

584
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,200
So are there people that I see who are not

585
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,200
under the same thrall that I'm under?

586
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,200
I mean, it's difficult to tell.

587
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,200
I mean, you're sort of sounding people out.

588
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,200
Totally.

589
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,200
It's through your call and response method.

590
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:14,200
But while you're doing this, Margaret Payne grabs your arm.

591
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,200
Money.

592
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,200
Oh, hi.

593
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,200
I'm sorry.

594
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,200
I don't know who else to ask,

595
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:24,200
but I'm getting more and more worried about Cicero.

596
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,200
How's he going to be able to change the world

597
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,200
with his invention?

598
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,200
And it is going to change the world, you know.

599
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,200
Oh, of course.

600
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,200
It's going to change the world, you know.

601
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,200
But how's he going to be able to change the world

602
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,200
with his invention if he isn't actually here?

603
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,200
Where is he?

604
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,200
I'm getting worried.

605
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,200
I mean, what, two hours into the party now?

606
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,200
He puts his hands on either side of her shoulders

607
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,200
and says, we must go find him.

608
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,200
We must.

609
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,200
We must.

610
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,200
We must.

611
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,200
Let's.

612
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,200
And she grabs you by the hand

613
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,200
and leads you out to the ballroom.

614
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,200
Perfect.

615
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,200
Quick question.

616
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,200
Like the people in the house,

617
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,200
are there like windows that they would be seeing,

618
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,200
like the fire?

619
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,200
Yeah.

620
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:09,200
And I mean, maybe, maybe if they weren't,

621
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,200
you know, so distracted by the party

622
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:15,200
and if it weren't so difficult to see it through

623
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,200
the really thick snowstorm that's going on outside,

624
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,200
they might've noticed.

625
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,200
But as it is at the moment, no.

626
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,200
As she's whisking him away, he's like,

627
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,200
I just lost my best friend, you know,

628
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:29,200
so it's nice to have someone new so quickly.

629
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,200
Oh, you poor thing, she says.

630
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,200
Puts a protective arm around your shoulder.

631
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,200
He nuzzles.

632
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,200
Unbeknownst to Elden Ring,

633
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,200
as Checkers is going down the ladder,

634
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:45,200
he's thinking, we could pivot, we could pivot.

635
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,200
You're thinking jet packs now.

636
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,200
No, he's thinking, he's like,

637
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,200
the cult can just be whatever his invention is.

638
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,200
Oh, nice.

639
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,200
Like, I don't care.

640
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,200
I don't believe in the bullshit I'm peddling.

641
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,200
Because today's going to change the world, you know.

642
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,200
Yeah, exactly.

643
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,200
Oh shit, he got Scott.

644
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:10,200
So, she says, I've had a look around downstairs,

645
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:13,200
and I haven't managed to find him yet.

646
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,200
I was going to check upstairs,

647
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:23,200
but I just, I wanted some company because, well.

648
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,200
I fear nothing in the physical realm.

649
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:31,200
Good, because, this is going to sound very strange,

650
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,200
but I saw one of the maids upstairs,

651
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,200
just in the glooms, I was heading upstairs,

652
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:41,200
and there was something very wrong with her.

653
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,200
Wrong how?

654
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,200
The way she was walking, she was hunched over,

655
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:50,200
and, oh, this is going to sound mad.

656
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,200
You can tell me, Margaret Payne.

657
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,200
It looked like she had too many legs.

658
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,200
I'm sorry, what did you just say, Margaret Payne?

659
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,200
She had too many legs.

660
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,200
She had two legs?

661
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,200
That's completely normal.

662
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,200
Too many legs.

663
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:05,200
Oh, too many, that is.

664
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,200
Oh, how, oh.

665
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,200
Yeah, that's a spooky name.

666
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,200
And he starts picturing a maid with multiple legs.

667
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:16,200
I think you triggered something in me.

668
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:21,200
Yeah, there's a lot of that online.

669
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,200
I'm thinking like the lusty Argonian maid.

670
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:27,200
I don't know what that is.

671
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,200
Do you have a book in Skyrim?

672
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,200
Okay, well, that's okay.

673
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:35,200
Sometimes we see things that don't look right,

674
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,200
and our brain rationalizes them

675
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,200
so that we can understand the physical realm

676
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,200
as it is in the spiritual.

677
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,200
You'll be okay.

678
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:48,200
Yes, of course, as you say, as you say.

679
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:51,200
And if this leggy maid gets anywhere near us,

680
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:56,200
I'll call into her brain to ward her away.

681
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,200
Yes, you do that, she says,

682
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:03,200
and pats you on the back of the hand.

683
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,200
And he kind of like, he does the thing where his fingers,

684
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,200
where he's got two fingers up on either hand,

685
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:12,200
and he's like putting them to his temples.

686
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:17,200
And he's going like, wee-oo, wee-oo, wee-oo, wee-oo, wee-oo.

687
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:20,200
Yeah, the two of you head up the stairs,

688
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:25,200
Margaret taking the lead, and the hallway up above,

689
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,200
I mean, there's a landing, first of all,

690
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,200
but there's a hallway that runs along for the landing

691
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,200
that goes down the main wing of the house.

692
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,200
Be careful, Margaret Payne.

693
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:36,200
I will go ahead and make sure the coast is clear.

694
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:39,200
Yes, yes, I'll be right behind you.

695
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,200
You can hold on to my shirt.

696
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:47,200
That's very generous of you, she says.

697
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,200
And he'll continue down the hall,

698
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,200
slow enough so that she doesn't fall behind,

699
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,200
you know, with the shirt holding.

700
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:58,200
It's the 30s, so people have fewer but nicer shirts.

701
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:01,200
So it is.

702
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,200
So you see, down the end of the corridor,

703
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:07,200
there's a set of double doors that look like they're

704
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,200
probably to the master bedroom,

705
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:13,200
and one of them is slightly ajar,

706
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,200
and you can see there's some light coming out of that.

707
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:19,200
You could give me a listen roll as well, if you want.

708
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,200
I'd love that.

709
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:23,200
I rolled a 73 over 50,

710
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:27,200
and I would not like to spend the luck,

711
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:32,200
but I would like to get on my hands and knees

712
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:36,200
and crawl at a brisk pace to try to get closer,

713
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,200
undetected, to listen better.

714
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:42,200
Okay, yeah, if you want to push the roll.

715
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,200
I would like to do that.

716
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,200
I think there's a good chance you might get caught

717
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,200
in the act then, because that looks a bit suspicious.

718
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,200
Oh, 25 on a 50. Hard success.

719
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,200
Okay.

720
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,200
Nice.

721
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,200
Then, yeah, you get down on your hands and knees,

722
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:02,200
and Margaret looks a bit confused by this

723
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:05,200
and then gets down on her hands and knees as well.

724
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:09,200
You form your little quadrupedal conga line down the corridor.

725
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,200
As you're passing by one of the doors,

726
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:17,200
you can hear what sounds like howling wind

727
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,200
from the other side of the door.

728
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,200
I mean, you've obviously heard some of the windows rattling

729
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:25,200
and there's the sound of wind outside,

730
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:29,200
but it sounds like maybe there's a window open in this room

731
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:33,200
and the wind's got in, the door itself is shaking.

732
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:37,200
Margaret Payne, the window in this room is open.

733
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,200
Well, that's unfortunate.

734
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,200
Shall we peek in together,

735
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,200
or would you like to continue to stay behind me?

736
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,200
I suppose we could.

737
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:49,200
I mean, that's Cicero's room up ahead, she says.

738
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,200
Do you think it's important that the window's open?

739
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,200
I don't know, Scott, is it?

740
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,200
Fucking DMs, man.

741
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,200
I turn back and I say,

742
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,200
well, he might not be in his room,

743
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,200
and if the window is open here,

744
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,200
it might lead us to learn more,

745
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:15,200
to be able to help him or find him,

746
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,200
so I think we should open up the door.

747
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:20,200
I think the brain of the house is behind the double doors.

748
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,200
And it's the bug brain from Starship Troopers,

749
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,200
and Neil Patrick Harris touches it and says,

750
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,200
it's afraid.

751
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,200
I'm doing my part.

752
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,200
That's also from that movie.

753
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,200
I haven't seen it.

754
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,200
So yeah, we're going to creep into the door.

755
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,200
I know, I haven't seen it.

756
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,200
Oh, you're going to love it.

757
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,200
You're going to creep into the room

758
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,200
while you heard the wind.

759
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,200
Yeah, still on hands and knees.

760
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,200
Nice.

761
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,200
Okay, so yeah, you open up the door

762
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,200
and there is a bit of resistance.

763
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:49,200
And yeah, as you push it open,

764
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,200
you realize, yeah, it is because there's wind

765
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,200
blowing in from outside.

766
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,200
There's also snow on the ground.

767
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:58,200
With the window open, snow has been coming in,

768
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,200
and there's a fair bit of it.

769
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,200
This looks like it's probably a guest bedroom.

770
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,200
It's made up as such.

771
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,200
I mean, it's certainly a bedroom

772
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,200
and there are sheets on the bed.

773
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,200
Everything's dark, however,

774
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,200
and you can only make out vague shapes of furniture

775
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,200
and the snow on the ground.

776
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,200
Don't worry about me, Margaret Payne.

777
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,200
My warmth is on the inside.

778
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,200
Good, she says.

779
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,200
It doesn't seem like anyone is in here,

780
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,200
so he's just going to kind of get up and pop around.

781
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,200
It's difficult to tell because it is dark.

782
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,200
Gotcha.

783
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,200
So he's going to whisper into the darkness,

784
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,200
is anyone cold?

785
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,200
And Margaret from behind, he says,

786
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,200
I'm a bit chilly.

787
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,200
Okay, forget my ignorance,

788
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:50,200
but in 1937, would you be able to just turn the lights on?

789
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,200
Yes.

790
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:55,200
Okay, that helps me going into more of this.

791
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:01,200
If no one responds to my query other than Margaret Payne,

792
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,200
Elden Ring stands up.

793
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,200
All right, well, if anyone is cold in here

794
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,200
and needs help, maybe closing the windows,

795
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:11,200
that would be good, but if not, I mean, Cicero,

796
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,200
if you're, okay, we're just going to,

797
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,200
bye, bye, I'm talking to no one.

798
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,200
He's, Margaret Payne, I'm speaking to no one,

799
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:21,200
and he heads back out into the hallway.

800
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,200
I mean, the only thing is,

801
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,200
you could give me a spot hidden role

802
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,200
to see whether you notice anything in the gloom.

803
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,200
Fail, 37 on a 25.

804
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:31,200
Cicero successfully hides in the corner.

805
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:36,200
I will use my 12 luck to make that a success.

806
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,200
As your eyes adjust to the gloom,

807
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,200
you can see that over by the window,

808
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:48,200
one of the things that you thought was snow

809
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:52,200
that had blown in, a mound of snow on the ground.

810
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,200
It's the cocaine that I've been looking for.

811
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:59,200
That's, yeah, that's not snow.

812
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:03,200
That is someone lying there very still.

813
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,200
Oh, whoops, I did not see you.

814
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,200
Are you cold?

815
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,200
You've got like a Mitch Hedberg.

816
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,200
I did not see you.

817
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:17,200
I am so sorry, I did not see you.

818
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,200
They don't move or they don't react.

819
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,200
Huh, all right.

820
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,200
Escalators cannot be broken.

821
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,200
And he's gonna, he's just gonna stare.

822
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,200
Temporarily?

823
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:34,200
At the body for a little bit.

824
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,200
Temporarily.

825
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:41,200
Sorry for the convenience, podcast listeners.

826
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,200
Margaret Payne, I'm going to approach this body.

827
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:47,200
Do you know anything about the first aid skills?

828
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,200
Not really.

829
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,200
Well, maybe if you didn't spend all of your money

830
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,200
paying other people to be good at helping others,

831
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:57,200
then you would know how to help someone yourself.

832
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:01,200
And he moves on to the body.

833
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:04,200
Very judgmental, she says.

834
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:07,200
You cut her pretty deep on that one.

835
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,200
Scott, weren't you the one talking about her lazy eye?

836
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:15,200
He's judgmental now.

837
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,200
That's a physical description.

838
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,200
He didn't apply any emotions to the eye.

839
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,200
Yeah, but he dragged her ass.

840
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,200
Thanks for coming back on the podcast, Scott.

841
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:31,200
Yeah, any time, I guess.

842
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,200
Any time, I guess.

843
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,200
So what's up with this body? I'm gonna poke it.

844
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,200
Okay, yeah, you creep forward.

845
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:46,200
In the gloom, you can make out that it does seem to be

846
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,200
the body of a young woman.

847
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:51,200
She just seems to be in her undergarments

848
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:54,200
lying there in the snow,

849
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:57,200
and you can see that there's blood

850
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,200
soaked into the snow around her head.

851
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,200
You should look her to see if she's cold.

852
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:04,200
I think that she's just crying.

853
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,200
Oh, my God.

854
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,200
This dead girl tastes cold.

855
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:13,200
To solve this mystery, I'm gonna need two things.

856
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:16,200
A hammer and a whole army.

857
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:21,200
So I'm not gonna lick the body.

858
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:26,200
I'm going to grab some cloth drapes

859
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:30,200
if I see anything around to just throw over the body immediately.

860
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:33,200
Yeah, I mean, there's bed linens

861
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,200
that you can easily grab and throw on her.

862
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,200
Margaret Payne, could you please close the window

863
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:41,200
while I connect with this lady intellectually?

864
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,200
Is that young woman dead?

865
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,200
Yeah, I think so. There's only one way to find out.

866
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,200
So I'm gonna...

867
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:49,200
Psychic attack! Psychic attack!

868
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:55,200
You took the words right out of my mouth.

869
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:58,200
Dude, if she's dead, you're gonna kick her ass.

870
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:01,200
I don't know how the psychic attack works,

871
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,200
but maybe you'll die.

872
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:06,200
You finally met someone you can beat.

873
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,200
God damn it, I thought you were supposed to feel cool

874
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:12,200
in Pulp Cathedral.

875
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,200
You're a loser.

876
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:18,200
Your character is the vessel through which this story

877
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:21,200
gets to feel very cool, but yeah,

878
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:25,200
you are whatever dark force is working through this home,

879
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,200
absolute bitch.

880
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:32,200
Yep, just gonna psychic attack this probably dead body

881
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:34,200
to see if she's still alive,

882
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,200
because I don't know anything about first aid.

883
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:39,200
Yeah, well, actually roll,

884
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,200
just in case you rolled a double zero.

885
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:44,200
I did not, I rolled a 42, thankfully.

886
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:47,200
Okay, yeah, she's dead.

887
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,200
There's nothing there to probe.

888
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,200
You just see a blue error screen.

889
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,200
Yeah, 404.

890
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,200
Margaret Payne.

891
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,200
Margaret Payne, there's nothing for us in this room.

892
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,200
But that young woman's dead.

893
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:02,200
Oh my god.

894
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:04,200
Now we really need to find Mordaunt.

895
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,200
Yeah, there's a murderer.

896
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,200
Maybe Cicero's in danger as well.

897
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,200
Oh my goodness.

898
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:10,200
We need to find Mordaunt now more than ever.

899
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:11,200
Let's go.

900
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:15,200
Yes, yes, and she scurries out of the room.

901
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:19,200
Do you think we should alert someone about the dead girl?

902
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:23,200
Only when we found Cicero Mordaunt.

903
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,200
That is our first priority.

904
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:28,200
Why was she in her undergarments?

905
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:32,200
Hopefully because she was warm.

906
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,200
Well, when you get hypothermia,

907
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:37,200
sometimes they find people have taken their clothes off.

908
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,200
Well, Margaret Payne,

909
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:42,200
sometimes when people are dying of hypothermia,

910
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:44,200
like she did in the cold,

911
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:47,200
they have a strange reaction that makes them take off their clothes.

912
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,200
It's science.

913
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:50,200
I'm not sure it's real.

914
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:54,200
Does hypothermia make you bleed from head wounds?

915
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:56,200
In rare occasions.

916
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:59,200
Such as this one.

917
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:05,200
If you die of hypothermia and fall and hit your head.

918
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:08,200
Oh, that's clearly what happened.

919
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:10,200
You should just go back to the party.

920
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,200
Sherlock Holmes says,

921
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:16,200
whatever isn't true is.

922
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:26,200
So, I think we're on the right path here.

923
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:29,200
Yes, I hope Cicero is alright.

924
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:33,200
His invention is going to change the world, you know.

925
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:37,200
I know, it's going to change the world, you know.

926
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:42,200
And they're just crying as they walk down the hall toward Mordhaupt's bedroom.

927
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:44,200
Holding each other.

928
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:48,200
You want to get on all fours again?

929
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:52,200
We can crawl if you want to.

930
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:54,200
We can leave that old corpse behind.

931
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:57,200
Because if the old corpse isn't necessary to the mission,

932
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,200
then it's no friend of mine.

933
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:07,200
Okay, so you crawl your way down the corridor towards Mordhaupt's room.

934
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:11,200
And, yeah, as I said, the door is slightly ajar.

935
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:13,200
You can see inside, obviously, the lights are on,

936
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,200
because that's where the lights are coming from.

937
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:19,200
Yeah, I doubt you've seen Mordhaupt's bedroom before,

938
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:23,200
but it's as tastelessly furnished as everything else.

939
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:26,200
It's got garish wallpaper,

940
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:31,200
a big four-poster bed with colorful drapes hanging from it.

941
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:35,200
And one of his inventions was to make the bed, like, rotate.

942
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:40,200
No, he's the first person to hang a mirror above the bed.

943
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:42,200
To do coke off of.

944
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:44,200
The rotisserie bed.

945
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:49,200
But it just fell off because of these shitty dimensions.

946
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:53,200
Well, he hasn't invented the anti-gravity coke mirror machine.

947
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:56,200
No one has.

948
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:59,200
It's a shame. It's our last great frontier.

949
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:06,200
But one thing you can see is over behind the bed, just poking out from it,

950
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:12,200
you can see a pair of men's feet wearing socks,

951
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:19,200
just sticking out as if someone's lying on the ground just behind the bed.

952
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:22,200
Hey, Mr. Mordaunt. Mr. Cicero Mordaunt.

953
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,200
Party time's gotta go smooth, right?

954
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:26,200
That's what's most important to religion, man.

955
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:29,200
So let's carry on and talk to you now.

956
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:33,200
You just hear a weak groan from the other side of the bed.

957
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,200
Help me.

958
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:38,200
Oh, time for those first aid skills, Margaret.

959
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:45,200
Margaret's on her feet and she scurries around the bed.

960
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:46,200
Are you following her?

961
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:47,200
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

962
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:52,200
As you go around, you can see that there is something else unusual in the room as well,

963
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:58,200
in that there's a big sort of freestanding wardrobe up against one wall.

964
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:02,200
And the doors are open, but you can see that there's light coming out of it.

965
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:09,200
And from somewhere apparently deep within it, you can hear what sounds like an electrical buzzing.

966
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:11,200
Wow, what a fascinating wardrobe.

967
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:14,200
Is Mordaunt okay, he says, as he's just staring into the light?

968
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:22,200
As you go around, you can see that Cicero is lying there in this long shag pile carpet.

969
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:28,200
He's wearing a silk dressing gown, garishly patterned.

970
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:29,200
He looks pale.

971
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:38,200
He's sweating profusely and his eyes, they've got deep rings under them and they seem quite sunken.

972
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:46,200
His hair is matted with sweat and they're lying just a couple of feet away from him.

973
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:54,200
You can see that there's a bottle that has got some kind of yellowish liquid in it.

974
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:59,200
And next to it, there's a fairly large hypodermic needle,

975
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:05,200
a glass hypodermic needle that's half full of the same liquid that's just lying on the ground.

976
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:10,200
And you can see his trembling fingers, they're reaching out towards the syringe.

977
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:12,200
Oh, wow. Hi.

978
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:15,200
Help me. Help me.

979
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:20,200
Mr. Cicero Mordaunt, it looks like you pre-gamed a little bit too hard for your party.

980
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:22,200
Need medicine.

981
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:24,200
Oh, yes, of course.

982
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:27,200
And I'll jam that fucker full of whatever's in this syringe.

983
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:32,200
Okay. Yeah. I mean, as you grab it and look for somewhere to inject him,

984
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:36,200
you can see that there are track marks and weeping wounds,

985
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:40,200
infected pus-filled wounds all down both of his arms.

986
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:42,200
Gross. Cauterize it.

987
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:49,200
But, I mean, it probably doesn't take you long to find a vein to stick this in.

988
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:53,200
All right. On the count of three, think about your favorite Bible verse, Mr. Mordaunt.

989
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:57,200
To overcome the spider's curse, simply quote a Bible verse.

990
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,200
What's your middle name? What's your favorite color?

991
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,200
And then he sticks them.

992
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:09,200
Almost immediately you can see he shudders and convulses a bit.

993
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:15,200
And then there's a deep sigh. Oh, that's much better.

994
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:18,200
Mr. Cicero Mordaunt, you have a lovely home here.

995
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:20,200
Thank you so much for inviting me to your party.

996
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:23,200
Yes, yes, of course, of course.

997
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:28,200
I have no idea who you are, but I can't have you thrown out yet.

998
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:32,200
Well, of course, because I'm here because your invention is going to change the world, you know.

999
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:33,200
It's what?

1000
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:37,200
Your invention. It's going to change the world, you know.

1001
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:43,200
I suppose it is, yes. I wouldn't have put it quite like that, but yes.

1002
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,200
What is it, by the way?

1003
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:48,200
Well, I'll show you when I unveil it all downstairs.

1004
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:51,200
I should have been downstairs a long time ago.

1005
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:53,200
Oh, Margaret, Margaret!

1006
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:59,200
He pushes himself up, grabbing hold of the side of the bed, and says,

1007
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:05,200
Oh, Margaret, it's good to see you. I wish it were under better circumstances.

1008
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:10,200
From the open wardrobe, you can hear that buzzing sound again.

1009
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:14,200
It sounds like it might be electrical sparking. It might not be.

1010
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:20,200
There's something about that sound that you can hear that, yeah, that's not electrical.

1011
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:25,200
It sounds maybe like a beehive.

1012
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:36,200
Cicero's just shaking. You can see his eyes are looking a bit clearer, though, and he's standing up unsteadily.

1013
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:41,200
There's a big vein down his forehead that is just pulsing violently.

1014
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,200
Should have stuck him there.

1015
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:44,200
Yeah, I think I found a better vein.

1016
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:49,200
Well, no, I'll let you two talk. You can catch up.

1017
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:56,200
Yes, yes. Well, I need to get ready. I need to get my invention ready.

1018
00:51:56,200 --> 00:52:01,200
But he looks over at Mr. Ring.

1019
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:09,200
Friend, you cannot tell anyone of what you've seen here. You do understand that...

1020
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:14,200
I promise not to tell anyone if you tell me what was in that syringe that I plunged you full of.

1021
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:22,200
It is a special serum I use to enhance my mental faculties. It gives me...

1022
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:24,200
Mordaunt's special sauce.

1023
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:30,200
Yes, I suppose he could call it that, if you were an idiot.

1024
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:37,200
Psychic attack! Psychic attack! Psychic attack!

1025
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:41,200
Are you psychic attacking me?

1026
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,200
Fuck yeah! Fuck this dude!

1027
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,200
Everything's gotta go off without a hitch.

1028
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:49,200
Including Mordaunt himself!

1029
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:54,200
In which case, yeah, give me a roll.

1030
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:56,200
41 on a 90, hard.

1031
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:59,200
Oh yeah, he actually failed.

1032
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:00,200
Fuck you!

1033
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:10,200
So, I mean, you get that sort of simultaneous feeling of looking at him, but also looking inside him, and you're reaching deep inside him.

1034
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:18,200
And yeah, there's none of this kind of protection or darkness or anything that you've seen in other people there.

1035
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:24,200
I mean, this is just an unprotected human psyche for you to do with as you will.

1036
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:35,200
He really digs his claws into this mind space and just tries to plant exactly what the religion man planted in his mind.

1037
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:38,200
He's just trying to be a vessel to pass on.

1038
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:43,200
He's not even trying to do it himself, he's trying to open up himself to Margaret.

1039
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:52,200
He's gonna use Margaret as a conduit to get to the thing on the other side so that it can push through him into Mordaunt.

1040
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:58,200
Oh, okay. Well, I mean, you're trying to do this, you're trying to make the connection to Margaret.

1041
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:05,200
But Margaret, the conscious part of your mind, you can hear that she actually sounds quite alarmed and frightened.

1042
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,200
I mean, you can hear her going,

1043
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:12,200
Cicero, are you alright? You're frightening me, Cicero, you're frightening me.

1044
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:14,200
At the same time, you can hear Cicero's voice saying,

1045
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:19,200
Yes, yes, I understand. Yes, it is going to change the world.

1046
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:23,200
It's going to change. Yes, yes, it's going to change the world.

1047
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:25,200
I must do as you will. I must do.

1048
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:36,200
And then there is this noise, a loud banging sound, a loud wet sound.

1049
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:43,200
And from the distant place you are within your own psyche, you can suddenly feel something warm and wet.

1050
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:46,200
Splashing all over you.

1051
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:49,200
Did I just pee?

1052
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:57,200
Almost immediately, you're broken out of the connection you had, and you can see Cicero standing there,

1053
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:02,200
just wavering backwards and forwards. The top of his head is largely missing.

1054
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:07,200
There's fragments of blood splattered all over the place.

1055
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:10,200
His mouth is just gawping open.

1056
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:14,200
And then he falls heavily down on the ground.

1057
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:18,200
Margaret Payne turns running, crying out.

1058
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:23,200
And from the open wardrobe, you can just hear this buzzing voice, screaming angrily,

1059
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:26,200
Release me!

1060
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:29,200
Let's cut over to...

1061
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:34,200
Oh my gosh.

1062
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:36,200
Holy shit.

1063
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:37,200
Wow.

1064
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:52,200
I didn't know a body could be hollow before its blood ran cold.

1065
00:55:52,200 --> 00:56:06,200
I didn't know that the wind could sew the tissue and faggot bone.

1066
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:12,200
You were hollow when you spoke to me.

1067
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:19,200
Hollow when you sang.

1068
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:34,200
I thought you might be starving, so I gave you everything.

1069
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:47,200
Thorns and rocks and devils glow, brides and dried red clay.

1070
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:57,200
Crocus blossoms in February and I live in May.

1071
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:07,200
Time between a mother's fingers and spit off of a bridge.

1072
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:16,200
Restless legs at 3pm while waiting for a fix.

1073
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:39,200
I thought you might be starving, so I gave you everything.

1074
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:49,200
I thought you might be starving, so I gave you everything.

1075
00:57:49,200 --> 00:58:03,200
So come back here and see what's left of me.

1076
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:13,200
Is this the wholesome girl you left in Missouri?

1077
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:24,200
My voice is nothing now but the howl of the wind.

1078
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:32,200
Come closer dear in my teeth, thread her in my jaw.

1079
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:48,200
Come closer dear in my teeth, thread her in my jaw.
