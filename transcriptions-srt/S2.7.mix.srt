1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
Welcome, brothers, sisters, and siblings.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,200
It's your ethereal pup god, Wolf the Dog.

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,400
Blessings to you all, my children.

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:19,600
And I'm hollerin' from the heavens and the hells at you live from 694.2 PTBP.

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,800
A station of radio.

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,700
It's definitely somewhere at some time.

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,200
You know how most companies exclude their employees for participating in drawings,

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,200
so they can't be accused of manipulating the outcome?

9
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,900
Apparently that's not the case here at 694.2 PTBP,

10
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:46,000
cuz this week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Joe Terry in Springfield, Missouri,

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,900
who tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending pod,

12
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,400
which is self-promotion when he does it,

13
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,600
but it's super fuckin' cool when y'all do it.

14
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,000
Joe Terry writes,

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,200
Hey, dog.

16
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:03,200
You know how companies exclude their employees from drawings?

17
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,400
I don't think they're doin' that here,

18
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,900
so I want you to say Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip

19
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,600
is an underrated Aaron Sorkin show that I wish more people saw.

20
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:19,100
Bradley Whitford and Matthew Perry turn in electric performances

21
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:24,100
as co-showrunners of a Saturday Night Live-type program.

22
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,000
It got one season.

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,600
I want more.

24
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,000
Love ya, dog.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Hope the slop is sloppy.

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,900
You will, Joe.

27
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,600
Sweet Joe.

28
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,800
I love you too, buddy.

29
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:42,100
One day we shall frolic in the slop together as one,

30
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,900
but you shall feed me your life force

31
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:50,000
so that I may continue to live on and grow in power.

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,300
Do not worry, dear sweet delicious Joe.

33
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:58,800
Do not tremble when the darkness fills your vision,

34
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,600
surrounding you,

35
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,000
when you feel fangs scraping along the back of your neck,

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,500
when all of your senses start to fail you

37
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:15,400
and you feel yourself slowly but surely dissolving from this time.

38
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,900
We will become one, Joe.

39
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:25,700
And you start to think maybe we always were.

40
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,500
Welcome back, Joe.

41
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,300
The links are in the damn show notes.

42
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,400
The news.

43
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,600
Last time, the City Action News field team

44
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,700
took a single simple steel train car

45
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,500
across an awe-inspiring bridge

46
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:45,300
that ran over an unnaturally smooth chasm

47
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:49,700
filled with fog and an upside-down church.

48
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:54,400
A pre-recorded Fred Godel from the TVs in the train car

49
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,400
welcomed them to Godel's Gate to Grover's Gorge.

50
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,500
Through the next Spongebob-y hatch door

51
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:07,300
was a town ripped from futuristic concept art of the 1950s.

52
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:12,700
The first thing Julius wanted in Grover's Gorge was an interview.

53
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:17,300
And while they talked to a great employee of the Godel Company,

54
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:20,300
a GE of the TGC,

55
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:25,500
they noticed hopping along the synthetic track they all stood on,

56
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,900
a jackalope,

57
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,800
taking you back to this mythical critter.

58
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,500
It's a whimsical tomb and it's time to get litter.

59
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:39,900
It's Alter Girl with My Life is Great and It's All My False.

60
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,900
And it's all my fault

61
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:48,900
Cause my life is great

62
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,900
And it's all mine

63
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,400
Cause my life is great

64
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,900
And it's all my fault

65
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:15,900
And it's all mine

66
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,100
Welcome back to Pretending to Be People.

67
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:22,000
You are now listening to what I think is probably episode 7.

68
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,400
Mr. Joe Terry, tell me what's a weird dream that you've had?

69
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:25,900
Ever?

70
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:26,900
Yeah.

71
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,700
What's like the weirdest dream that you've had?

72
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,200
I don't have a good answer to this.

73
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,300
Oh, I mean, there's one I've remembered for some reason since I was a kid.

74
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,100
Awesome.

75
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:37,900
I'm running down the hillside and it's like the Windows XP background,

76
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,800
like beautiful lush green hills and beautiful clouds,

77
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:47,500
and I'm leading an army of giant ants toward like a hole at the bottom of the ground.

78
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,300
Are you an ant?

79
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,000
I hope that's a prophet.

80
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,700
I'm like running fast.

81
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:54,100
I'm not an ant, no, but I'm like running fast and it's like joyous.

82
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,300
Like it's not scary or dangerous or anything.

83
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,300
We're like a stampede of giant ants running toward it.

84
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,700
It's like the most joyous dream I've ever heard of.

85
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,100
Yeah, that's so cool.

86
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,100
I don't know if that's weird though.

87
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,900
What do you guys remember from where we left off?

88
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:12,900
Where are we at?

89
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:13,800
What are we doing?

90
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,000
Are we in the normal world?

91
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,200
Are we just like hanging out at the news station?

92
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:17,700
No, man.

93
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,300
Are we in the city?

94
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:22,100
No, we're out on assignment and shit is not normal, Zach.

95
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,100
We're not in the city.

96
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,000
We're in Walmart country.

97
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,500
Where the shit is really real.

98
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:31,700
We're out in the boonies and we are in an impossible town that should not exist,

99
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,300
surrounded by impossible geography,

100
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:39,100
and we just saw a fucking Jackalope and news team is going to get some goddamn

101
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,000
answers for the people.

102
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,700
I can tell you that.

103
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:42,900
Awesome.

104
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,000
So, uh, Luke,

105
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,300
can you describe the landscape in which you are standing currently?

106
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,900
Yeah, Grover's Gorge.

107
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:51,300
Nice.

108
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:51,800
Got it.

109
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,400
Nailed it.

110
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,000
You can describe the city in one word.

111
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,500
I would say weird.

112
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,700
The landscape weird.

113
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,800
The people weird.

114
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:04,200
It's a huge space age city with bouncy colorful synthetic walkways.

115
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:04,700
Awesome.

116
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,500
Nice notes.

117
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,400
Very good notes.

118
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,400
Do you have luck right now?

119
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,500
Uh, I don't think so.

120
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:08,900
Actually.

121
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:09,700
You have luck now.

122
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:10,300
Oh, sweet.

123
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:10,800
Sick.

124
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,400
I like those.

125
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,100
I like those thorough notes.

126
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:14,700
There's two statues.

127
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,400
Joe's like,

128
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,500
what the fuck?

129
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,200
No, I was trying to find a clip.

130
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,200
Do you guys remember,

131
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:25,900
um,

132
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:30,000
Dave Coulier hosted a show that was kind of like America's home videos,

133
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,500
but it had a Jackalope.

134
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,300
Do you remember this?

135
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:36,200
You're thinking of Bob Saget hosting America's home videos.

136
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,900
Are you throwing us off because Thomas took good notes?

137
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:39,400
Oh shit.

138
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,200
No,

139
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,600
this is just his little tantrum.

140
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,000
I have no,

141
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,600
I have no recollection of this.

142
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,900
Coulier time.

143
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:47,700
Yeah.

144
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:47,900
Um,

145
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,500
I'm going to start taking notes once I use my point of luck.

146
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,300
Just when you thought it was safe to check the mailbox,

147
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,300
Jackalope 3,

148
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,600
tower came COD.

149
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,800
So Dave Coulier does the Jackalope's voice

150
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,100
and it's just a rabbit that they've tied horns to

151
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,200
and they do bits with it.

152
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,000
It's a real dead rabbit.

153
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It's like a taxidermy rabbit that they've attached horns to.

154
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
That's awesome.

155
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,100
Well,

156
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:14,600
the one that you guys are looking at here in Grover's Gorge is alive

157
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,200
and it is just kind of hopping on this synthetic walkway

158
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,600
that people are jogging and walking on.

159
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:20,900
Zach,

160
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,400
where is it between us and the massive square park?

161
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,200
Ooh,

162
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:24,700
nice.

163
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:28,700
I would say that it is in between you in the massive square park.

164
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:28,900
Oh,

165
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:31,000
you can't have more than just luck,

166
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,600
but I'd give it to you again.

167
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:32,900
Ooh,

168
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,100
I'd give it to you again.

169
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:34,200
Oh,

170
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:34,400
no,

171
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:34,600
no,

172
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,200
I just want,

173
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,100
I just want your praise.

174
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:40,600
And what's across that massive square park where people are hanging out

175
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:45,300
in either green or yellow tinted or accented uniforms.

176
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,600
What's on the other side of that park?

177
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,600
I bet Joe knows.

178
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,000
Is it two big statues?

179
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,300
It is two big statues.

180
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:51,600
Yeah,

181
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,500
they're about twenty six point three meters tall.

182
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,100
In fact,

183
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,400
and they're made of green rock.

184
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,800
I've already said that.

185
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,200
What's on the other side of the statue,

186
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:05,100
labs?

187
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:05,400
Yeah,

188
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:11,300
it's a building that is made of glass and marble.

189
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:15,300
It rhymes ass.

190
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,500
Brass.

191
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,700
Brass.

192
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,600
Grass.

193
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:22,000
Grass and ass.

194
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,500
Ass glass of grass.

195
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,200
Off to your left side from your current view,

196
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,900
you see housing,

197
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:30,500
beautiful,

198
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:30,900
beautiful,

199
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,200
gorgeous housing.

200
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,300
And then off to the right,

201
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:41,800
you can just barely make out some buildings that are poking over some perfectly cylindrical trees.

202
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,100
Beck,

203
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,000
what do you think that to the left is?

204
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
What would you say those buildings look like?

205
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,300
I don't know,

206
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:46,600
Zach,

207
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,000
what are they?

208
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:54,200
And you see a whole line of beautiful homes that are like beautiful suburban homes.

209
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,100
They're all unique to each other though.

210
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:04,300
They all have their own special flair to them and they're enough apart to where you think it wouldn't be an issue to like hear your neighbors or anything.

211
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,600
There's definitely privacy.

212
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,900
Do I get a vibe of like the decade that these are?

213
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:12,100
Space age was the word you used to describe this place.

214
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:15,000
And so those are to the west.

215
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,100
Those are to the west.

216
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,800
If you came from the south,

217
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,200
to the west,

218
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,200
to the west.

219
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,900
Headin' west like you're blowing Kanye.

220
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:23,300
Oh,

221
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,000
nice.

222
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,500
Childish Gambino line for you there.

223
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,800
They both like oohed and aahed.

224
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,300
You should have just said it was yours.

225
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,300
I thought it was yours.

226
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,600
I'm Donald Glover.

227
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,900
Donald Glover.

228
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:37,100
Oh,

229
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,400
dong lover?

230
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:38,600
Oh,

231
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,000
dong lover?

232
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,300
Dong lover.

233
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:40,600
Okay,

234
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,300
these statues,

235
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:44,900
how are their dongs?

236
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,500
From this distance,

237
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:58,100
you would assume you're not sure how big they are proportionally based because you're just too far away to make out the subtleties of these statues.

238
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:58,700
However,

239
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:05,400
you can assume based on the enormity of the statues that the dongs might have a similar weight to them.

240
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:05,800
Interesting.

241
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,800
The dongs weigh as much as the statues or at least a similar amount.

242
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,900
They've got dense dongs.

243
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,400
The dongs take up.

244
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,900
I feel like my words are being misunderstood here.

245
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:16,200
What?

246
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:16,500
No,

247
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:20,500
not deliberately.

248
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,000
So two giant dong statues.

249
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,900
Remind me what the statues look like.

250
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,100
They're big penises.

251
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:26,500
Men.

252
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,800
They are two men.

253
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,800
Are they doing anything?

254
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:35,900
One is standing with hands in his pockets and the other one is standing with hands kind of on his hips.

255
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:39,100
We're kind of familiar with what the more famous Godels look like.

256
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:39,900
Yeah.

257
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:40,700
Are these the Godels?

258
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:41,900
These are these the Godels.

259
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:47,300
The one with the hands on the hips is Frank Godel Grand Granddaddy Godel.

260
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:57,200
And the one playing pocket pool with his statue hog is Fred Godel who you saw in the video in the train on the way into Grover's Gorge.

261
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,400
Which is his son.

262
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,300
Which is his son.

263
00:10:59,300 --> 00:10:59,700
Yes,

264
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:08,500
and you would just know from general worldly knowledge that Fred Godel does have both a daughter and a son.

265
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:14,800
Fox and the Hound.

266
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,100
Yeah,

267
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:19,500
Fox and Faith Fox and Faith Godel.

268
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:19,800
F.

269
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,100
Yeah,

270
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,400
dude.

271
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,900
Some people do that.

272
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,000
Frank Godel.

273
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
This Frank Godel that did all the mythological fighting.

274
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,800
That is correct.

275
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,000
Yes,

276
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,200
according to the story told on the train.

277
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,900
Some people name their kids mostly like their sons like the same name.

278
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,000
It's fucking weird as hell,

279
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,500
dude.

280
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,600
Must be confusing.

281
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,600
I would never name an NPC with the same name as another NPC.

282
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:43,800
No,

283
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:48,500
you wouldn't ever do that.

284
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,400
So you guys are all standing on this.

285
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,000
It's kind of a bouncy pathway.

286
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,700
You're talking to Jennifer who is from here.

287
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:57,400
She's a GE.

288
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,600
She's a great employee.

289
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,800
She said for the Godel company here in Grover's Gorge.

290
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:06,800
She was born and raised here and has worked for the Godel company for a few years now.

291
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,500
She's in her like early to mid 20s.

292
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,900
And now the corner of your eyes,

293
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:21,000
you all noticed a Jackalope kind of hopping across this bouncy walkway that others are exercising and jogging on.

294
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,100
Some people are paying it a little bit of attention,

295
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:23,500
you know,

296
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:29,900
pointing at it going woo woo.

297
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:33,000
Classic reaction to an animal.

298
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,700
And you see that it has a yellow ribbon tied around its head around its antlers.

299
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,200
Cal says,

300
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:45,000
what the hell is even that?

301
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,700
Woo woo yeah go GE's hungry for points.

302
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:52,200
And she kind of like motions with her hand to a couple others

303
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:58,100
and they all kind of run around and make a circle around this Jackalope that's sitting on the ground

304
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,600
and they hold each other's hands and they go,

305
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,800
I'm a GE of TGC.

306
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,500
I'm a GE of TCG.

307
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:10,000
Hey, I'm a GE of TGC.

308
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,100
I'm a GE of TGC.

309
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:16,700
And then she kind of like laughs and Saunders back to you guys.

310
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,400
Well, so as as they're like doing that,

311
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:23,600
I'm Cal is like motioning back and Julius forward to like run up to the circle and get a shot.

312
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,500
Definitely doing that.

313
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:24,800
Yeah.

314
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:30,200
Yeah as they part do we see a real Jackalope or is there visibly like glue on its fucking head

315
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:37,400
or no, but you would notice that I yeah looks like these antlers are tied on with a yellow ribbon.

316
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:44,400
Seemingly the question I had was like when they're chanting the that stuff are you on purpose saying?

317
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,000
No, sorry.

318
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
That was my question also,

319
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,400
so we should always hear it as TGC.

320
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:48,700
Yeah.

321
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:52,200
Okay, my bad because you consistently were doing it the second time you were saying it.

322
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,700
So I thought you were saying oh my god.

323
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,800
That's because I typed it wrong.

324
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,100
No, it's because I'm an idiot.

325
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:12,100
Same thing I was like I was like we need to ask about what what is GTC.

326
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:15,100
I knew you were just fucking up.

327
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,800
Thank you Thomas.

328
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:23,800
Thanks for not reading into that look double luck.

329
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,700
I just can't take that back baby when I think of you.

330
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:31,100
I think of you like your freaking mastermind that has every single detail planned out.

331
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,300
So I'm like you're hiding something from us you fucker.

332
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:37,000
He's got you so fooled.

333
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:43,700
Julius is definitely recording on his phone like trying to get up as close to the Jackalope as possible.

334
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,300
Is it does it seem scared?

335
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,700
No, it does not seem scared.

336
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:50,700
It is very very calm Beck wouldn't want to break the circle,

337
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:54,300
but he would want to put his camera between the heads of two people to film directly down.

338
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,100
Do they react to me doing that at all?

339
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,100
No, not at all.

340
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:57,900
That's a great shot.

341
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:00,700
What are you guys?

342
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,000
What are you guys doing?

343
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,500
I've asked the people around the Jackalope.

344
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,400
Oh, hey, what's up?

345
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:07,900
Oh, hi.

346
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,000
Hey, how's it going?

347
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Uh, oh, yeah.

348
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,200
No, we're just celebrating our points.

349
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,600
Hey hungry for points.

350
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,500
Do you eat the Jackalope?

351
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:22,300
Oh, do you eat Jackalope?

352
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:26,600
No, rabbit stew.

353
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,600
I oh goodness.

354
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,500
No, I have you ever been to Charlie's next to the foundry.

355
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:36,100
They all kind of laugh at each other and are giggling amongst themselves and in unison.

356
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:39,200
They say we don't need to eat.

357
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:46,100
Uh, how does this Jackalope signify your points or why are you celebrating around it?

358
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,800
Why you are all wearing yellow?

359
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,400
Why is it got a yellow ribbon?

360
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,800
What?

361
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,200
What?

362
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,600
No, that's a great question.

363
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:55,800
Yeah.

364
00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:01,300
No, so the Jackalopes, they run free and they're not actually Jackalopes.

365
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:08,800
Yes, I noticed I thought there might be but then the last little part of me that believed in magic died.

366
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,300
That's so sad.

367
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:19,100
They all kind of laugh like we still have magic here and they kind of laugh some more and she's like earlier this morning.

368
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:32,400
We had a little contest where we let some rabbits run free and whoever could wrap their ribbon around the the rabbit's head and tie on the antlers to make a Jackalope got points.

369
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,700
I didn't tell you about the points.

370
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,000
The points is the best part.

371
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,400
Well, yeah, we asked but you never quite explained.

372
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,400
What do the points are in you?

373
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,700
Of course I get ahead of myself.

374
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:42,000
I'm just so excited and happy to be here.

375
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Well, Jennifer, we can certainly see that.

376
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,900
No, so I'm so hungry for points because when we get points we could win.

377
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,600
Win what?

378
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,300
Oh, the prize at the end of each quarter, there's a prize.

379
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,500
The fiscal quarter?

380
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,100
Yeah, of course.

381
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,100
What is the price?

382
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,900
Whether the GEs or the EEs win.

383
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:00,900
I'm sorry, EEs?

384
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,400
Yeah, excellent employees.

385
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,900
There's great employees, there's excellent employees.

386
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:13,300
Those are the green ones and she kind of points around and you see some people who are wearing the same like similar really nice kind of athleisure.

387
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:17,000
But their accents are green as opposed to yellow, which is what?

388
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,500
What does green sound like?

389
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,000
What?

390
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:19,800
It was a bad joke.

391
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,200
Their accents are green.

392
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,000
Like Ireland.

393
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:30,600
Excellent employees, are they somehow higher in rank or superior to the great employees?

394
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,300
Oh, no, it's just a different word that also means great.

395
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
It sort of means better than great.

396
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,600
Not around here, it doesn't.

397
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,300
Okay.

398
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,200
How are like teams chosen?

399
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:47,600
Oh, well, when you get hired, you just kind of become either a great employee or an excellent employee.

400
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,300
But do you like have a say in it?

401
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,200
No, it's just kind of where you fit.

402
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,000
Do different departments have different designations?

403
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,300
Yeah, the excellent employees work in the lab and the great employees work in the factory.

404
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:08,000
And she points to the lab when she says the lab and the lab is the glass and grass building behind the statues on the north side.

405
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,700
And on the east side, just above some perfectly cylindrical trees,

406
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:21,500
she points to the top of a massive greenhouse that is peeking out above these cake pop like trees.

407
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,400
Jennifer, you told us earlier you were born here.

408
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,300
Born and raised.

409
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:28,000
Were your parents on teams as well?

410
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,800
Yeah, my mom was a great employee and my dad was a great employee.

411
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:37,000
Is it typical for the children of great employees to wind up on the same team as their parents or?

412
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,000
Not always, but in my case, it worked out.

413
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Are you friends with any excellent employees?

414
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,800
Not really. We, you know, kind of work in separate places.

415
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,700
You know how I assume you guys all work together?

416
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:52,400
Yes, in a small van.

417
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:58,600
Well, then you're probably very close to your co-workers and less close to people you don't work directly with, right?

418
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,000
No, I mean, not not like as a rule.

419
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,600
Sometimes people you once worked closely with can stab you in the back.

420
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,100
Oh, with what?

421
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,600
Corporate politics.

422
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,700
Wow, that sounds really hard and sad.

423
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,800
Like your dad.

424
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,400
Are you okay?

425
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,400
Yes, yes, but we're not here to ask about me.

426
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,400
I'm just fine.

427
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,700
We want to know more about you, Jennifer, and what you do here.

428
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:34,900
And as you're kind of looking to Julius, you see a man wearing well-fitted athleisure,

429
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:42,500
monochromatic with green accents, approaches your group confidently with a hand outstretched.

430
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,900
Well, hello there, you fine interlopers.

431
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:49,900
What a coincidence indeed to run into you here.

432
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,400
My name is Fox Godel.

433
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:59,300
I am the son of my father, Fred Godel, the grandson of my grandfather, Frank Godel,

434
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:02,900
and the future CEO of the Godel company.

435
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,800
It's an absolute pleasure to meet you.

436
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:09,300
Would Julius know, has he like seen Fox outside?

437
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,000
Like does he go into the real world?

438
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,400
Oh, great question.

439
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:18,200
No, you would only know Fox Godel from some pictures that have been on like magazine covers

440
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:22,800
where he's just like posing on a sound stage with his dad just within the past year.

441
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,800
How old is he?

442
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,800
Yeah.

443
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:28,600
Fox Godel, he seems to be in his mid twenties.

444
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,000
Oh, and Zach, last question.

445
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,600
How can someone have a monochromatic outfit with colorful accents?

446
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,800
Oh, well that's easy.

447
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:43,000
It's just like white, gray, a few different shades of gray, black, and then has like green

448
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
accents on the side.

449
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Not monochromatic.

450
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Oh, fuck.

451
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
It's pretty, it's pretty.

452
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Gray scale.

453
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Gray scale.

454
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Okay.

455
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Gray scale.

456
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Gray scale with green accents.

457
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Monochromatic gray scale with green accents.

458
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
He got it on the bio farm.

459
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Mr. Godel, it is a pleasure to meet you.

460
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:12,400
And he shakes your hand, but then when he goes to shake the hand of Mr. Beck Wilder,

461
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:19,000
he looks up at you, notices the headphones on your head and immediately his eyes glaze

462
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,120
over and he gets this horribly tortured look on his face.

463
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,600
Was the last person that did that a farmer?

464
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,600
Yeah.

465
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,600
He was.

466
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,600
Yeah.

467
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,400
It was the lemon or just some other guy.

468
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,400
It was.

469
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,400
It was the ticket guy.

470
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,400
Right.

471
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,400
It was actually, it was Jesse Lemon.

472
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,400
Okay.

473
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:41,200
It was the farmer who sold his property to Fred Godel.

474
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,300
Zach, can you remind me, did I know, did I figure out that that's what he was looking

475
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,520
at at the farm?

476
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,600
Did Beck know that it was his headphones?

477
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,600
You'd even try it.

478
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,600
You even took them off and stuff.

479
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,600
Yeah.

480
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,600
Yeah.

481
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,920
I need everyone to real grip as the look of this man who was just completely normal

482
00:21:55,920 --> 00:22:03,800
a moment ago as clearly gone somewhere else inside of his own mind and is trapped seemingly

483
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,920
with the disturbing.

484
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,600
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind tonight.

485
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,000
Yeah, I definitely do not pass.

486
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I crit fail.

487
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Oh.

488
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Oh, I crit failed too, dude.

489
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
99.

490
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
It was an 88.

491
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,400
Oh, I'm going to spend luck and the other luck you gave me.

492
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:26,000
You can't spend luck because it would just be 99 to switch.

493
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Oh, that's right.

494
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Well, fuck.

495
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
You just spent your luck.

496
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
No, I made it 99.

497
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
It was the luck.

498
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
It was and it is.

499
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,400
No, I made it 9.9.

500
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,400
Oh.

501
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,400
Julius, you are going to lose one grip.

502
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:47,400
Beck Wilder, Cal Colorado, you're going to lose two grip each.

503
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,400
Well, that's not so bad.

504
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,400
Because we saw his face.

505
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,400
And I think everybody recognized it was the same thing.

506
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,400
It was the headphones that freaked him out.

507
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,400
Yeah, that's what's freaking you out is that now you've run into a second person

508
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,400
who has had the same reaction to your headphones.

509
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:08,800
Okay, so but it's not like an intrinsic fear like I saw the face of pure evil terror.

510
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,800
No, it's not pure evil terror.

511
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,800
It's simply just...

512
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,800
It's wrong for someone to be scared of a headphone.

513
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,800
So afraid of headphones.

514
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,800
And then not only that, but unnaturally with the snap of a finger.

515
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,800
But there is no snap of any fingers.

516
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:26,800
But if you were to, just he's right back to normal looking at you smiling,

517
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,800
going in for a handshake.

518
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,800
Nice.

519
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,800
What the...

520
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,800
What was that?

521
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:36,200
I don't shake his hand because I've now critically failed this grip loss.

522
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,200
I think that he...

523
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,200
Awesome.

524
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,200
What are you doing?

525
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,200
If you fail grip, you can't shake his hand.

526
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,200
That's the rules.

527
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,200
And he kind of...

528
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,200
You awkwardly grab too soon and grab his fingers.

529
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,200
No, I don't even make a move.

530
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,200
And I'm just kind of like startled kind of by how scared he was of me.

531
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,200
And maybe I go up like, is there something on my neck?

532
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,200
And then I feel the headphones.

533
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,200
Oh, fuck.

534
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,200
Who is this guy?

535
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,200
What's going on here?

536
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,600
You know, he pokes you in the belly a little bit.

537
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,600
Uh, Julius, like...

538
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,600
Like Tife.

539
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,600
Definitely...

540
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,600
Oh, shit.

541
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,600
Yeah, like Tife.

542
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,600
Is there somebody in your life who's not respecting your personal boundaries?

543
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,600
Because poking people in the belly sucks.

544
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,600
That's not a cool thing to do.

545
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,600
I guess we just had a couple...

546
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,600
Is Taylor...

547
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,600
Real rude people on the NPCs so far.

548
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:26,600
Julius is freaked out by that, but not like a crazy amount,

549
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,600
but enough that he wants to like address that...

550
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
But I would like you to...

551
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Because you just failed, you didn't critical fail,

552
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I'm going to let you roll an alertness check here.

553
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
But again, because you did fail that check,

554
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
you're going to be at a negative 20.

555
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Pass.

556
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
A 32, which makes it a 52, on a 70.

557
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Fantastic.

558
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
If I could have Thomas and Joe remove their headphones in La La La,

559
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
but don't La La La, because you're in the same room.

560
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
La La La!

561
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
So what happens?

562
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
So next, they can't hear,

563
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,400
but the next thing that happens

564
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:05,400
is that you actually, you notice that Stevie,

565
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:09,400
her eyes are welling up with tears

566
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:13,400
as she's staring into the face of Fox Gothel

567
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:16,400
as he's having this strange experience.

568
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,400
Like, do I recognize that it's from his...

569
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,400
I mean, he's doing a real weird fucking thing here

570
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,400
and her eyes weren't full of tears a second ago.

571
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,400
Gotcha, okay.

572
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,800
And then you're back.

573
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:31,800
We all give him the bird.

574
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,800
You know what we mean.

575
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,800
Julius looks at Fox.

576
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,800
What was that...

577
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,800
Stevie?

578
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,800
Oh, you're Stevie?

579
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,800
It's nice to meet you.

580
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,800
He puts out his hand and is like,

581
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,800
Fox Gothel.

582
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,800
And you.

583
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,800
So what is your name?

584
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,800
Why did you have that look on your face?

585
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,800
What, this beautiful grin of mine?

586
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,800
So sorry if it was too charming for you.

587
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,200
I like point at Beck's headphones.

588
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,200
Yeah, and when he looks back, he breaks again

589
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,200
and he's just like making this really strange face.

590
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,200
It's just pure terror is across

591
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,200
and you can just see his lips quivering.

592
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,200
His eyes are kind of like darting back and forth.

593
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,200
He's not looking even at the headphones anymore

594
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,200
and just as soon as you notice it, he's done.

595
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,200
But because this just happened

596
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:23,200
and you kind of have a bit of a grip on yourselves this time,

597
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,600
the two of you,

598
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,600
because you didn't roll alertness last time,

599
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,600
you get to roll alertness this time,

600
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,600
but because you critically failed last time,

601
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,600
I'm going to put you at a negative 20.

602
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,600
Real quick, we said Jesse Lemons did sell his farm, right?

603
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,600
Jesse Lemon did sell his farm.

604
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,600
Yes.

605
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,600
I've got a theory, guys.

606
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,600
Oh my God.

607
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,600
I rolled a hundred.

608
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,600
Oh my God.

609
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,600
I rolled a one.

610
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,600
Oh my God.

611
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
What the hell is going on tonight?

612
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Okay.

613
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
First, we are going to do Thomas

614
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
because I don't know what to do with you.

615
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
I saw your zeros.

616
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
I was like, hell yeah, dude.

617
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
So, fuck.

618
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Zach, can you take your headphones out and rub your ears?

619
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I don't want to have to change shit if we get it right,

620
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
but I think people are getting Clockwork Orange here.

621
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Like, God has some kind of device.

622
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Headphones are a major part of it.

623
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Yeah.

624
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
So I'm sure he's done it to control his son.

625
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,400
He did it to convince the farmers to sell to him.

626
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,400
I like that idea.

627
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,400
But it's in some way that they don't remember

628
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,400
because they seem kind of aware of themselves.

629
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,400
Yeah.

630
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,400
Do they have to put ear drops in?

631
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,400
Zach?

632
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,400
Oh, that was scary.

633
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,400
When you were rubbing your ears like that,

634
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,400
did you feel like you were back at the big boy show?

635
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,400
Oh, dude.

636
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,400
Yeah, but my heart wasn't thumping

637
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,400
to the point of actual anxiety.

638
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,800
It was so fucking great.

639
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,800
We were so close and so loud.

640
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,800
Absolutely rattling my chest cavity.

641
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,800
Yeah, like the way it does

642
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,800
when you're fucking 10 years old and you get to go to a show.

643
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,800
It was so cool.

644
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,800
It was absurd.

645
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,800
And we were so close to the front.

646
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,800
It was fucking awesome.

647
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,800
I had never felt this before,

648
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,800
but when I would breathe in through my nose,

649
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,800
I could feel it vibrating.

650
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,800
It was so weird.

651
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,800
So the story behind this is that I was sitting on my couch

652
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,200
on Saturday and Luke calls me

653
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,200
and says,

654
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,200
He's like, hey, what are you doing right now?

655
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,200
Well, you're about to edit the podcast.

656
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,200
I was about to edit, yeah.

657
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,200
I'm like, okay, you're going to Bentonville with us

658
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,200
to see Big Boy and Run the Jewels.

659
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,200
And then he said he'll be at my house in 10 minutes.

660
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,200
So I hung up and changed clothes

661
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,200
and then we drove to Bentonville

662
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,200
and watched Run the Jewels and Big Boy.

663
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,200
It was fucking sick as hell.

664
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,200
It was incredible.

665
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,200
That venue was pretty cool too.

666
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,600
No, it sucked. Walmart sucks.

667
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,600
Walmart does suck.

668
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,600
The venue sucked. The whole thing sucks.

669
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,600
The vans were great.

670
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,600
Terrible art. Yeah, the art sucks.

671
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,600
That coffee shop blows.

672
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,600
Well, it's confusing.

673
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,600
It is. There's seats that

674
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,600
doesn't look like you're supposed to sit in.

675
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,600
It's extremely confusing seating, Joe.

676
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,600
It's so confusing.

677
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,600
And what's also confusing

678
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,600
is the look on Fox Gottel's face.

679
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,600
Oh wait, but not to me

680
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Oh, that's right. Joe, if I could have

681
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
you and Luke take your headphones off here.

682
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Thomas, you're going to see

683
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
a couple things here.

684
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
First off, Stevie

685
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
is staring directly

686
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
into the face of Fox

687
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Gottel with just

688
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
this wild sadness.

689
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Just this deep

690
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
struggling pain.

691
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Her eyes are welling up with

692
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
tears. So much

693
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
so that the wall is about

694
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
to break, but

695
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
the dam stays and no

696
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
tear actually rolls down her face.

697
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
How old is Stevie? Stevie looks

698
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
to be maybe in

699
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
her late 20s, early 30s.

700
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Okay, what is the second thing I see?

701
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
The second thing isn't what you see.

702
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
It's what you remember.

703
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
You remember

704
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
yeah, this is Fox Gottel

705
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
but it's like a little piece

706
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
of trivia that you remember.

707
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Probably from reading the news.

708
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Or even saying it. Exactly.

709
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Literally saying it on the news when

710
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Fred Gottel had his second

711
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
born child

712
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Greg.

713
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
That's kind of washing over him

714
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
but he turns around and looks at

715
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Stevie and he mouths

716
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Faith?

717
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Her eyes

718
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
get fucking huge.

719
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Fucking Gottem.

720
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Gottel!

721
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Gottel!

722
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Sweet.

723
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
The way that I was rubbing my fingers in my ear

724
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
most of the time it was

725
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
but my finger slipped once and I heard

726
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Thomas go MOUTH!

727
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
I bet he just said like mouth but because

728
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
you were rubbing, it was just like so

729
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
loud coming through. That's so great.

730
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
I was doing it to the beat of

731
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
My House by Flo Rida.

732
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
So I was going to say to add some character

733
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
flavor to it I was trying to think why would he fail

734
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
this alertness role and it's because

735
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
all Beck's life he's been

736
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
a goofball and

737
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
maybe the worst he's ever gotten

738
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
in response to that is disappointment

739
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
and maybe some disgust sometimes when he's

740
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
like a slob. To see

741
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
himself elicit like

742
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
carnal fear in somebody

743
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
he's like what the fuck?

744
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
There's something wrong with me all of a sudden.

745
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
I'm broken. Right. Holy shit.

746
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Which makes you trip backwards

747
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
squishing the

748
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
rabbit underneath your

749
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
feet and falling

750
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
directly on the

751
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
antlers impaling

752
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
your upper thigh.

753
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Fuck dude. I guess that is

754
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
a fucking crit fail.

755
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Holy shit. You lose four

756
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
hit points as you

757
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
start bleeding out.

758
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Get a doctor. Mr. Gothel.

759
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Get a doctor immediately.

760
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Fuck.

761
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I don't actually

762
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
oh right a doctor

763
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
right. Damn it man.

764
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Move. Thankfully someone else

765
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
comes up it's one of the people

766
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
in yellow athleisure

767
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
comes up and is like

768
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
oh my goodness do you need a doctor?

769
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Okay right away and they pull

770
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
out this device out of their

771
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
pocket and it looks like a futuristic

772
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
like Star Trek

773
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
speaker system it's actually

774
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
you know what it's um they're called

775
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
tricorders in Star Trek. Okay no I'm not

776
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
going to do that. Does it have like a big

777
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
talkie grill kind of thing? Yeah it's

778

00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000

780
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
anthill thing with just a like a

781

wah wah wah wah. Yes exactly.

782
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Like a CB radio thing. Yeah almost like a

783
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
CB radio and she grabs it and

784
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
and clicks in and is like doctor

785
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I need a doctor to the south side

786
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
of the park immediately

787

immediately we're on the track yeah we're

788
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000

just hang on there buddy. You all see

790
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Foxgoddle is walking away with

791
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
his hands in his pockets while whistling

792
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Fuck. What the fuck?

793
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Can I try to first aid him? Uh

794

using to uh. The ribbon

796
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
from the ambush.

797
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Yes okay uh yeah you're

798
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
actually easily able to

799
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
uh go ahead and stop the bleeding

800
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
here so Beck you're not going to bleed

801
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
out. Oh thank god. So you get this

802
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000

00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
get one hit point back

809
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
the most important thing is that the bleeding stops

810
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
oh well that's

811
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000

812
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Fox immediately whips back around and is like

813
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000

828
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000

00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
uh medical authorities

838
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000

839
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
about your reaction to the headphones

840
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000

854
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000

jogs over and says oh yeah

858

absolutely and as soon as they look down

859
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
they see the headphones and their mouth

860
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
goes slack jawed and they just kind of

861
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
like phase out of existence

909
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
dark side of what's out here

910
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
where's the dark stuff happen

911
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
and I look at the

912
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
lab inquisitively

913
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
laughter

914
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
laughter

915
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
honestly I didn't think that we'd be

916
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
having this conversation this early

917
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
but Zach's like

918
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
fuck there's just some really

919
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
fucked up shit okay do you trust me

920
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Beck looks to Cal

921
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Stevie you are the finest

922
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
gopher we've ever had

923
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
on this crew thank you can we

924
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
trust these people with our Beck

925
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
is he safe in their hands in their

926
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
medical care yeah he'll get the best

927
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
medical care available we'll

928
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
be allowed to go with him I bet well first of all

929
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
we will not be separated

930
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
from Beck sure yeah I don't

931
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
think that'll be a problem Beck is looking

932
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
really pale and he's

933
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
slurring even more than he usually does

934
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
cause there's a thin yellow like fucking

935
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
wrapping paper ribbon

936
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
laughter

937
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
laughter

938
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
this may be like the most

939
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
fortuitous of things because this

940
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
like it is into like their like

941
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
medical facilities and

942
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
once you're there it seems like you'd have access to

943
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
a lot of things like hospitals

944
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
are like centrally located in most

945
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
facilities yeah if they

946
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
let us out it'll be at the lab so

947
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
it'll be fine Stevie

948
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
were you born here yeah

949
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
when you yeah dude when did you

950
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
get out or were the Godel children

951
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
always allowed out no I got out like a

952
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
year ago my god that's

953
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
when I think when um

954
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
I think that's when Greg got got

955
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Beck is now thinking about

956
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
it to himself and then makes eye contact

957
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
with Stevie and then

958
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
wiggles his headphones at her

959
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
yeah

960
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
you can probably answer this

961
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
what's the deal with the food

962
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
on the train why can't any outside food

963
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
come in oh yeah that's why I got you guys

964
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
all amped up on caffeine before we

965
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
got in it's uh

966
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
you can't have any caffeine or drugs

967
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
in here all the stuff that they

968
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
have doesn't actually have caffeine in it

969
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
it's just like if you have caffeine

970
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
in your system you won't

971
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
be able to

972
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
get got

973
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
that's fucking dark

974
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Beck is gonna be bulletproof here he

975
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
drank like 40 of these

976
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
so the people

977
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
here are all under some kind of control

978
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
yeah and that's what we're trying

979
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
to show I'm assuming it's some kind of

980
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
you've fucking seen it you've all seen it

981
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
kind of headphone device no

982
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
it's just and then Fox walks up and he's like

983
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
hey what are you guys talking about

984
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000

985
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000

988
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
oh my god

989
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
I just lift one of Beck's

990
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
earphones like away from his ear

991
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
and let it fall back and like point at it

992
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
when he comes to you guys are like walking

993
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
and we're whistling

994
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
at this point

995
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Fox comes up and he's

996
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
kind of talking to you guys and you see

997
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
that the medical staff has

998
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
arrived and they came on

999
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
a bowl pen cart

1000
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
yeah dude hell yeah

1001
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
with the helmet

1002
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
are they wearing green

1003
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
yeah they're all wearing green

1004
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
of course they are they get

1005
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Beck situated on this

1006
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
on this stretcher kind of situation

1007
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
comfortably sitting and

1008
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
they begin walking everyone

1009
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
kind of down the trail

1010
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
along the west

1011
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
walkway up toward the lab

1012
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
toward the north side alright well

1013
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
do any of you want to come see

1014
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
my GIZ

1015
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
your GIZ?

1016
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
yes let's go see my GIZ

1017
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
I'm very proud of it I think we'd have a good time

1018
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
you don't want to stick around and deal with all this

1019
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
medical nonsense and

1020
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
sit in a waiting room or what have you

1021
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
you should come check out my GIZ I've got games

1022
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
I've got a pool I've got a hot tub

1023
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
whatever you want we could watch a movie we could hang out

1024
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
mr. Godel I assure you

1025
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
can never leaves a man

1026
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
behind alright well

1027
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
what is your GIZ?

1028
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
my Godel innovation zone

1029
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
yes of course my GIZ

1030
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
yes of course the best

1031
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
thoughts come in your GIZ

1032
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
is that where you came up with the bouncy walkways?

1033
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
well of course yes

1034
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
I can take credit for that I believe I

1035
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
dreamt it as a child and made a

1036
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
drawing that my father made a reality

1037
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
that's rad

1038
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
could we take a rain check on

1039
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
seeing your GIZ?

1040
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
we are gonna

1041
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
stay with our colleague

1042
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
alright I'll take the I'll take the old rain check

1043
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
if you're gonna be nice about it I don't

1044
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
much care for that one and he points at Cal

1045
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
he's like you had a nice handshake too

1046
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
but you're a bit of a dick

1047
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
sir you have ignored

1048
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
the medical emergency of our co-worker

1049
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
you tried to

1050
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
refuse a medical service

1051
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
and now you seem to want to

1052
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
separate us from our friend

1053
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
now I assure you I could be very nice to you

1054
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
and very beneficial

1055
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
for your business if we

1056
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
perhaps get the message you want

1057
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
on the air but you have

1058
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
to talk to us first why don't you come

1059
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
along with us dude I can like totally

1060
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
film the interview from the bed

1061
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
I would like to be on camera

1062
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
okay you got me there

1063
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
and he continues walking alongside

1064
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
of each of you

1065
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
looks over at Beck and Cal

1066
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
you're also very handsome

1067
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
I deeply appreciate that

1068
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
of course I do

1069
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
wow Julius

1070
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
very kind

1071
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
very kind indeed

1072
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
I was trying to just

1073
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
write quickly down what has happened so far

1074
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
and one of my favorite things I think I've ever

1075
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
written in my notes is I fell on a

1076
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
jackalope

1077
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
it's not at all

1078
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
what I expected to happen tonight

1079
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
I fell on a jackalope

1080
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
and we passed up a chance to see jizz

1081
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Beck fell on

1082
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
a jackalope is honestly someday

1083
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
how I expect to hear that actual

1084
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Beck died

1085
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
holy shit

1086
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
where do Scientologists go when they die

1087
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
hell

1088
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
on the way there you guys all see a woman

1089
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
who is kind of turning the corner

1090
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
she's coming from the lab

1091
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
statue area right

1092
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
turning the corner heading down the walkway

1093
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
toward you and you see that she is

1094
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
a pencil of a woman

1095
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
with bouncy spiky

1096
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
hair on top of her head

1097
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Mr. Gotl you have pencil people here

1098
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
roll grip

1099
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
yeah

1100
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
literally imagining that's my number two

1101
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
just about to say

1102
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
I'm imagining a number two like

1103
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
bouncing down the road

1104
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
fresh shape

1105
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
this total beaker of a woman

1106
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
is just like

1107
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
notices you all and then

1108
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
bounces away

1109
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
yeah just gonna

1110
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
running though

1111
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
back from whence she came

1112
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
so wait wait

1113
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
did she just come towards us and turn around

1114
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
yep she came out

1115
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
turned the corner saw you guys

1116
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
immediately started running in the

1117
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
opposite direction and

1118
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Fox is like oh Barbara

1119
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
off to go run

1120
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
and see her old husband

1121
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
probably freaking out that he didn't

1122
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
meet you guys at the gate huh

1123
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
who is that

1124
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
oh Chuck Bidwell

1125
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Chuck Bidwell and Barbara Bidwell

1126
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Chuck is our well he's not the mayor

1127
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
but he's

1128
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
no no of course not

1129
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
I'm not the mayor but you know

1130
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Chuck is the guy who kind of

1131
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
does everything that the mayor should do

1132
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
yeah like a city manager

1133
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
yeah kind of like that yeah

1134
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
and you're saying he should have met us at the gate

1135
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
well I would assume that that's why

1136
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Barbara was running off like that

1137
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
she's kind of his keeper

1138
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
I suppose

1139
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Cal glances back to make sure

1140
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
he's been rolling this whole time

1141
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Mr. Gottle

1142
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
what would a city manager handle here

1143
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
do they handle taxes

1144
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
well yes of course I would assume

1145
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
yeah they would handle all sorts of business

1146
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
sides of things but of course

1147
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
taxes because of course you

1148
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
pay these employees

1149
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
well obviously we have to

1150
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
pay our employees in

1151
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
money? uh yeah

1152
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
US dollars

1153
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
or points which one would you

1154
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
like to hear I actually

1155
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
I'm a bit of

1156
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
afraid to say I don't know the answer

1157
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000

do not pay your employees anything

1162
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
well I wouldn't be the one paying him now

1163
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
would I I'm the future CEO

1164
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
of the Gottle company but not the

1165
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
current CEO as he points up at the statues

1166
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
ahead he says see uh

1167
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
not a statue up there yet but

1168
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
sir how much does a gallon of milk cost

1169
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
commissioning it

1170
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
a gallon of milk

1171
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
god I don't know um

1172
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
pffff

1173
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
seven

1174
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
seven

1175
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
seven dollars

1176
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
dammit he's right

1177
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
is everyone here

1178
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
vegan or vegetarian

1179
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
well no one eats meat or meat

1180
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
byproducts uh I

1181
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
guess that's what you might call vegan yeah

1182
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
pretty rough move when he came in there

1183
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Beck stepping

1184
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
on an animal like that that's uh

1185
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
not a way to make a good impression around here

1186
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
this rings true for

1187
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Beck he's kind of feeling bad that he

1188
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
fell on a jackalope

1189
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
was the rabbit okay

1190
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
I didn't even check sure

1191
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Beck yeah cool

1192
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
it wasn't oh

1193
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
I think he killed it it was at least

1194
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
a swift end

1195
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
I saw it cry

1196
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
I've never like

1197
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
killed an animal before

1198
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
and at this point you guys have kind of made your way up

1199
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
to the front here and it's a sight

1200
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
to behold this is a massive

1201
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
glass building

1202
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
three stories tall

1203
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
but extremely wide

1204
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
taking up the whole north side of this

1205
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
park square and

1206
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
in front of it massive

1207
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
26.3

1208
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
meter tall statues

1209
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
of this green rock

1210
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
and up close you see

1211
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
an immense amount of detail

1212
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
hey Zach would that happen to be 69 feet

1213
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
no

1214
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
it does seem like

1215
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
I literally just did the math in my head at 78.9

1216
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
but I

1217
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
did the math because I was like that's probably

1218
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
69

1219
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
we covered a lot

1220
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
we got a lot of fantastic

1221
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
footage of

1222
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Godel just being just incriminating

1223
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
himself really

1224
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
oh are you still filming from the

1225
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
I never

1226
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
got the camera hand off to

1227
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Stevie

1228
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
but I think that made it more

1229
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
a little more discreet

1230
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
it's all like the cover of

1231
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Rubber Soul where it's all kind of looking up

1232
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
at everybody's faces and just swiveling

1233
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
it's a really rad dolly shot there

1234
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
it's a walk and talk

1235
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
yeah it's a total walk and talk

1236
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
down low angle

1237
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Joe loves his sorkin

1238
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
you know it

1239
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
fuck

1240
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
and as you guys are walking down at the very end

1241
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
you see a

1242
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
maybe not yet

1243
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
pterodactyl

1244
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
another jackalope

1245
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
oh god

1246
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
it's gonna haunt me for the rest of my life

1247
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
this one has a

1248
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
purple ribbon

1249
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
never mind it's not the same one

1250
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Cal leans over at his TV

1251
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
hey what

1252
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
there's purple

1253
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
is there a purple team?

1254
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Fox you notice kind of runs over

1255
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
to it removes the ribbon

1256
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
puts the ribbon in his pocket

1257
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
and then starts walking away

1258
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
from you all back

1259
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
toward where you came from

1260
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
kind of toward where you

1261
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
he's kind of pointed at his house

1262
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
he's just kind of walking away

1263
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
whistling with his hands in his pockets

1264
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
once again

1265
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Mr. Godle, Mr. Godle

1266
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Fox

1267
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
I throw some headphones at him

1268
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
roll athletics

1269
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
to see if you can throw

1270
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
at a negative 20

1271
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
to see if you can throw a pair of headphones

1272
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
and I assume you grab

1273
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
I've got a 10% chance

1274
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
you grab Bex

1275
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
98

1276
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
so you grab Bex

1277
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
headphones from off his head

1278
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
and you throw them without

1279
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
unplugging them from the cord at all

1280
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
and they just kind of immediately

1281
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
swing into the ground

1282
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
and

1283
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Fox turns around as he's whistling

1284
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
and is kind of like you guys

1285
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
and he's not looking he's just

1286
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
yelling over his shoulder you said

1287
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
you wouldn't leave your friend right?

1288
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
bye it was nice to meet you

1289
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
continues kind of whistling

1290
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Mr. Godle wait where are we supposed to go?

1291
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
and one of the people walking

1292
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
with you is like

1293
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
oh we'll take care of it

1294
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
and then they notice the headphones on the ground

1295
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
and they're like

1296
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
we just like look at our watches

1297
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
and tap our feet

1298
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Bex calls after Fox also

1299
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
no interview then or

1300
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
and with that he's gone

1301
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
you guys are now walking past

1302
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
where there's this rabbit

1303
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
just kind of hopping along

1304
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
with a spare pair of antlers

1305
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
hanging out on the ground

1306
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
I'm sorry about your brother my man

1307
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000

1308
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
not Stevie the rabbit

1309
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
oh yeah I was talking to the rabbit

1310
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
I thought you were talking

1311
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
back at the rabbit

1312
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
she was about to be like shut the fuck up

1313
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
straight up

1314
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
straight up was like dude the rabbits talk right

1315
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
oh my god

1316
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000

1317
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
and can love

1318
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
we'll travel

1319
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
we hear the other one just screaming

1320
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000

1321
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000

no we're EE's not GE's actually

1327
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000

1328
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000

1329
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
am I right?

1330
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
yeah EE's excellent employees

1331
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
between you and me

1332
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
between Kyle Colorado and two EE's

1333
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
do you feel like you're better than the great employees?

1334
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
yeah I mean

1335
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000

1336
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
tell me are you from around here?

1337
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
yeah I live over there and

1338
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
they point at one of these dope houses

1339
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
inside this futuristic

1340
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
mid century modern house

1341
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
that wouldn't happen to be the home you were born in would it?

1342
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
no I'm from like the outside

1343
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
how long have you been in Grover's Gorge?

1344
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
gosh like five years?

1345
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
and do they pay you?

1346
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
in money? yeah

1347
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000

1348
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
what's your salary?

1349
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
a million dollars

1350
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
it was once close

1351
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
and you're walking up the stairs

1352
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
kind of now and this

1353
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
oh like the golf carts

1354
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
is that what you called it? I called it a bullpen cart

1355
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
are we in a

1356
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
we've been in that the whole time

1357
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
yeah you've been walking him down

1358
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
yeah you've been walking him down to the end

1359
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
standing next to me

1360
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
it does a nice little

1361
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
slide into stairs

1362
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
where it's got kind of rails that land

1363
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
down on the stairs to where it can slide

1364
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
gently up the stairs and you're walking

1365
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
up the stairs and

1366
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
all of the stairs that you're walking

1367
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
on are grass

1368
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
grass stairs leading up

1369
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
and then this like small grass field

1370
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
in front of this beautiful

1371
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
glass building and on this grass

1372
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
area is where these two I mean you're looking

1373
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
up they're huge

1374
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000

1377
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000

1378
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
real quick these things are tall

1379
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
the grass stairs

1380
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
where people have traveled

1381
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
up them or is the grass worn away

1382
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
or is it like perfect grass?

1383
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
oh it's like perfect grass

1384
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
no desire paths or like dirt

1385
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
not at all and you see a woman who is walking

1386
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
out of the lab

1387
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
currently in full

1388
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
judges robes and a powdered

1389
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
wig atop her head

1390
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
hey that's from the thing

1391
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
oh yeah

1392
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
she's wearing a

1393
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
pair of electric blue high

1394
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
heels no green or yellow

1395
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000

1396
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000

1397
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
like a real world judge and

1398
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
no gaudel corporation trappings

1399
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
absolutely not other than

1400
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
perhaps the powdered wig might

1401
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
make her not so much

1402
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
look like a real world judge or like

1403
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
I'm sorry British yeah are you aware of

1404
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000

and those fucking buffoons

1408
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
send you away to prison

1409
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
I think they make

1410
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
the lawyers wear them too straight up this is

1411

00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
no that's silly

1414
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
I like that yeah

1415
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000

I failed a

1424
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
79 yeah you're

1425
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
fucking screaming in the back

1426
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
it makes a ton of sense that you

1427
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
wouldn't pick up on this sir who a judge

1428
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
surprised I didn't have you rolling a negative

1429
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
we're like wait

1430
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Beck Beck who's do you know that lady

1431
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
and you're just like ahhhh

1432
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
the

1433
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
adrenaline has started to wear off a little bit

1434
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
I'm going in and out of consciousness sometimes

1435
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
you look back and my eyes are closed

1436
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
so I passed my ass off

1437
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
who is this judge?

1438
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
both you and Julius notice that

1439
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
the eyes of this judge

1440
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
and Stevie

1441
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
meet

1442
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
like physically touch

1443
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
laughter

1444
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
as she passes

1445
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
she leans in

1446
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
and touches her eyeballs

1447
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
they butterfly kiss

1448
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
could you touch your eye

1449
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
to somebody else's eye couldn't you?

1450
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
yeah you can it's not

1451
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
pleasant probably hurt

1452
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
feels weird we'll try it later

1453
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
I have contacts in then yeah it's protected

1454
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
so you guys see this judge and she is

1455
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
making eyes right they lock and

1456
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
you notice a

1457
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
strange look

1458
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
come over the judge's face but

1459
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
because you know who Stevie

1460
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
is you see

1461
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
a look of recognition

1462
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
on the judge's face as she looks at

1463
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Faith Godel Stevie is

1464
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
that judge going to blow your cover

1465
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
no I don't think so

1466
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
she knew where I was

1467
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
she's been keeping me safe this whole time so I don't think

1468
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
she'd fuck it up now and then who does

1469
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
she work for? the Godel Company

1470
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
what is your relationship to her?

1471
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
she's

1472
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
nice

1473
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
she's understanding at least

1474
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
maybe not nice

1475
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
she serves as some kind of

1476
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
definitely not nice actually now that I think about it

1477
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
she serves as a judge for this community

1478
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
yeah and at this point

1479
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
you guys are walking through

1480
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
these glass walls

1481
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
there's seemingly no

1482
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
door but the walls

1483
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
kind of lift

1484
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
creating an opening in the whole

1485
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
front of this building and allow

1486
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
you to walk through Cal says

1487
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
neat you continue to walk

1488
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
on grass inside

1489
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
that's fucking sick there are no

1490
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
stairs but suddenly there's an

1491
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
incline of the same synthetic pathway

1492
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
that you saw out on the track

1493
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
and that incline synthetic

1494
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
pathway takes you upstairs

1495
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
so basically you walk up

1496
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
and then you flip a yay

1497
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
and you're facing back the way you came

1498
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
and there's another huge wall

1499
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
of glass that you're looking out and

1500
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
up against that glass there are three

1501
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
stools with this glass backdrop

1502
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
and it faces back the way you came

1503
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
looking out through the glass wall

1504
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
into the beauty

1505
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
and enormity of the park at

1506
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
the city center of Grover's Gorge

1507
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
and on the far stool

1508
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
perched on its

1509
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
plastron which is the belly

1510
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
of a turtle

1511
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
is an extremely old looking

1512
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
common box turtle

1513
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
its head flippers and shell

1514
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
are covered in scratches

1515
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
and scars

1516
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
and it looks damp

1517
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
a makeup artist is attempting to powder

1518
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
it dry while holding

1519
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
the turtle steady by its

1520
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
torn up moist shell

1521
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Cal reaches a hand out to the

1522
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
turtle and says, Mr. Gotle

1523
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
I presume

1524
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
the makeup artist is like laughing

1525
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
this is just like a normal

1526
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
sized box turtle or is it like big

1527
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
yeah, how big is a box turtle

1528
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
normally, pretty small, yeah so it's like a

1529
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
big box turtle, okay

1530
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
for everybody at home he was putting his hands

1531
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
about this far apart, like the size of my head

1532
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
not that big

1533
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
yeah dude

1534
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
that would be terrifying, how long

1535
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
do box turtles live, oh forever

1536
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
like a lobsters, and god

1537
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
god was

1538
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
never born though, neither were box

1539
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
turtles, whoa

1540
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
box turtles

1541
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
yeah, you're right, box turtles

1542
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
are not born, and do not

1543
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
die

1544
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
box turtles are angels

1545
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
of our lord

1546
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
and says they're right on the

1547
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
wikipedia, dude

1548
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
in the bible, box turtles actually look

1549
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
fucking insane

1550
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
you know, like a big wheel with eyeballs

1551
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
god dammit, biblically accurate

1552
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
turtle

1553
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
its shells instead of eyes

1554
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
box turtles generally

1555
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
live to be about 35 years old

1556
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
but some have been known to survive

1557
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
for um, eternity

1558
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
yeah, that's

1559
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
what I thought, I say all this to the turtle

1560
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
so we were led up here by this

1561
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
medical staff? I thought maybe this was like a

1562
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
waiting room, but then the turtle was

1563
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
getting its makeup then

1564
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
I thought they were

1565
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
maybe disrespecting us very hard

1566
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
yeah, like, we brought you to the

1567
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
vet, you fucking

1568
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
or just like, oh you want to interview somebody?

1569
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
you want to interview, here's our employee of the month

1570
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
boxy

1571
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
one of the medical staff says to you

1572
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
well I think you'll be doing

1573
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
the interview up here and we can just have

1574
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
the medical staff come up and meet you

1575
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
they're based in this building, so

1576
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
oh wait, the interview with mr

1577
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
the mayor

1578
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
oh, with the mayor, mr bidwell

1579
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
no, the mayor

1580
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
and they look at the turtle and they say

1581
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
sandro

1582
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
woah

1583
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
I

1584
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
hey Beck, don't step on the mayor

1585
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
laughter

1586
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
my life

1587
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
is great

1588
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
wait, Mickey Rooney Jr., Buzz Aldrin

1589
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
and Neil Armstrong? and Ryan Gosling

1590
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
I was saying my movie is The First Mouseketeer

1591
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
which is about

1592
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
Mickey Rooney Jr.

1593
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
it's like the fly

1594
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
but instead of a fly, it's a mouse

1595
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
ew

1596
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
ew

1597
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
that seems like a movie they should have tried to remake by now

1598
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
I wouldn't want to live in a Cronenberg

1599
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
have you ever seen the first, like the original

1600
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
the old, old one? no, I haven't seen it

1601
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
it's not very good

1602
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
the one with Jeff Goldblum

1603
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
you know that really old one

1604
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
let's see, the fly remake

1605
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
there's no plans that I can see

1606
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
but there's an article that says

1607
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
the fly continues to make a strong

1608
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
pro remake argument

1609
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
I, oh sorry

1610
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
can I get 30 seconds to sound?

1611
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
and it's all my fault

1612
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
oh
