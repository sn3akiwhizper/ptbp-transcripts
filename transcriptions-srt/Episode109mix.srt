1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,180
Salutations, my little honeybees.

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:06,980
It's your beekeeper, Beastie Wolf, the dog.

3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:09,780
I'm here to protect you at all costs

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:11,380
while getting a little taste

5
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:15,260
of that sweet, sticky honey every now and then.

6
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:18,100
I can't wait to make some toilet wine

7
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:20,220
with y'all's sweet syrup.

8
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:25,220
I am buzzin' at you live from 694.2 PTBP,

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,700
the only radio station located

10
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:33,180
in a trash hive of my own making.

11
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,140
What's that sound?

12
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:36,380
Is it the mail truck?

13
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:39,460
They're saying I got a new Howlin' with Wolf, baby.

14
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:43,660
This fine edition of Howlin' with Wolf is from Bee.

15
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:45,020
Very nice.

16
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:48,540
Who tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending pod,

17
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,840
proving that even the busiest bees can take time

18
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,240
to make this old Wolfie feel something again.

19
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,640
They right.

20
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,040
Have you seen the yellow sub?

21
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,840
Have you felt its honey mustard contours

22
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,280
dripping around the edges of that braised brain of yours,

23
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:10,000
encased in a sun-toasted bread of skin and bone?

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,040
The sponge monkey elders assure you

25
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,840
those are olives, not eyes.

26
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,080
And if you haven't seen the yellow sign,

27
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,320
I mean sub, you will soon.

28
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:26,080
Damn, Bee, don't threaten to dog the wolf with a good time.

29
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,680
You're talking about toast, you're talking about mustard,

30
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,160
and braising, and goddamn, I am fucking pumped

31
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,900
for whatever the hell it is you are talking about.

32
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:41,520
If you wanna write up something for your honey wolf to howl,

33
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,520
tag at pretending pod on Twitter or Instagram,

34
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,880
or write up a five-star review on Apple Podcasts

35
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,240
and let my producer know at pretendingpod at gmail.com.

36
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:56,720
And if you're already wrist-deep in the interwebs,

37
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,660
go ahead and share the trailer for season one

38
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,760
of Pretending to Be People.

39
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:05,520
Share it on the mountain, share it over the hills,

40
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,820
share it everywhere.

41
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:12,120
Jesus Christ wouldn't have been so him-damn-bored.

42
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,720
God damn it, Zach.

43
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,140
If he had access to all this sweet content

44
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:21,740
in the show notes, and if that ain't the truth,

45
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:24,100
then this ain't the news.

46
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:28,020
Last time, we lost a few dear friends.

47
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,580
Please bow your heads and take a moment

48
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:33,920
to reflect on the lives of Jimmy Sanders,

49
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,140
Carmen the Possum, Harry Klinker,

50
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:40,220
Rusty the Distinguished Gray Dog,

51
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:44,000
Professor Horace Green, and the decapitated head

52
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,420
of preacher-sheriff Dr. Bobby Custard.

53
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,280
Damn, I miss all them.

54
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,520
Then the ball that is John Lee Pettymore

55
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,280
summoned Planet Juggernaut and friends

56
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:01,280
to fight alongside the Overseer against Rose Mary

57
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:06,040
in this gigantopumpathy-pipicus.

58
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,740
Taking us to the top of round one is Dragon in 3

59
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:13,360
with What Kind of World Are You Living In?

60
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,360
["What Kind of World Are You Living In?" by Dragon in 3 plays in the background.]

61
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,360
["What Kind of World Are You Living In?" by Dragon in 3 plays in the background.]

62
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,000
Whoa, whoa, everybody, welcome.

63
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
My name is Nick Nichols and I am here with my brother, Nick.

64
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,040
Wait.

65
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,320
I forgot my name.

66
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,380
I'm Nick, you're Nick.

67
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:11,600
We're all Nick for Nichols, and welcome.

68
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,520
We are here in, oh my goodness,

69
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,120
where the fuck are we, Nick?

70
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,000
I don't seem to know, but it is terrifying me to my core.

71
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,540
I am scared.

72
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,440
Look at that big fucker on the left.

73
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,480
And we've got, thankfully, bringing us home,

74
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,160
giving us some shelter with it,

75
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:33,880
I don't know, that hurts, is Planet Juggernaut.

76
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:38,400
Thanks, Nick, I'm just glad to be here.

77
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:42,680
I'm really excited to start mixing it up again.

78
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:47,440
Gotta admit, this is a little fancier than this crap pit,

79
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,640
but I think I can still be a scrapper.

80
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:54,200
Hope I can put on a good show for you guys.

81
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,900
Back to you, Dick and Nick.

82
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,760
Dick is dead.

83
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,320
Nick and Nick Nichols here,

84
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,200
and we are gonna go now to our correspondent.

85
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,880
I see him, he's running a buck.

86
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,680
He just came down in a full Technicolor flash

87
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,120
of light over there.

88
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,320
He is crying on the ground.

89
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,160
It's Jeremiah Jones Johnson.

90
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,800
Let's go with him now and see what's going on.

91
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,160
What do you think about that, Nick?

92
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,400
As before, I just always love to hear

93
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,380
my boy Jeremiah say stuff.

94
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:39,280
Hello, it's Jeremiah Jones Johnson here,

95
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,680
and I don't know where the fuck he is,

96
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:47,000
but we're gonna try to find out now.

97
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
And he walks over and sees a few other people

98
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,500
who've just been seemingly teleported

99
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,320
into this plane of existence,

100
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,820
three individuals who have just made their way

101
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:01,840
onto this plane, standing on the ground made of light.

102
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,600
What's your name?

103
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,960
I'm Brad.

104
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:09,000
Hey, Brad, where are we?

105
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,560
It's the dark world.

106
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,800
I gather it's the dark world.

107
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,920
Yeah, yeah, that makes sense.

108
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:22,040
And he pulls a T-shirt out from behind his back

109
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,280
and hands it to you.

110
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,280
Oh, sweet, hell yeah, thanks, Jeremiah.

111
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:33,280
And you, you're, what's your name, sir?

112
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:38,280
My name is Patrick Star, and, wait, is that?

113
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:43,280
Is that the SpongeBob character or the porn guy?

114
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:46,960
Okay.

115
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,840
Well, let's take it down to Jeremiah Jones Johnson

116
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,920
for our new game.

117
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,900
Is it the SpongeBob character or the porn guy?

118
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,640
My name is Patrick Star, and I disagree.

119
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,820
We're not in the dark place.

120
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:04,980
This is clearly heaven, and that's God,

121
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:08,420
and I, for one, and I'm gonna go rush up and meet him.

122
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,860
Okay, oh, and he's gone.

123
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,580
He's running full armed, like,

124
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:15,260
at the can't jump ropypicus.

125
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:20,260
Okay, and Patrick Star runs directly toward one of the legs

126
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:25,260
of this enormous, shadowy, dripping creature

127
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:29,380
and disappears into it like a open door

128
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:32,020
with only darkness on the other side of it,

129
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:35,420
and he is no longer visible to the human eye

130
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,580
or any other eyes.

131
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:41,900
And this third person, who are you?

132
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,780
Hey, you can just call me Jerry.

133
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:47,840
Oh, hey, Jerry.

134
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,580
Cool voice, what's your deal, man?

135
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:57,300
My grandson brought me up to the city to go see the games,

136
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,380
and well, this ain't the city.

137
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,220
No, it's not.

138
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,660
Back to you, Mick and Nick.

139
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:07,500
Oh, thank you so much there, Jeremiah Jones Johnson.

140
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,580
Jones, because I called you Jones Johnson

141
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,980
because you called yourself Johnson.

142
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,380
Somebody else called you Johnson,

143
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,660
so we're good with all of it.

144
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,700
Jeremiah Jones Johnson corresponding on the field.

145
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,540
Thank you so much.

146
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:18,140
Nick Nichols, what do you think about all that?

147
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,860
You know, I've said it a thousand times.

148
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,900
Every time Jeremiah says things,

149
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:26,240
I light up with a joy that just cannot be found

150
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,640
in any other place in my life.

151
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,480
What?

152
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,640
Let's go down to the field and see what happens.

153
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,680
This massive, lumbering, shadowy, dripping creature

154
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,800
that we've been calling the Gigant Umbropithecus

155
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,960
because someone in the circle of knowledge called it that,

156
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:51,960
grabs out with one of its enormous, massive arms now,

157
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,240
so large that it can hold onto the illuminated pipe

158
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:01,400
that is hanging in the sky with its hand.

159
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:06,080
Once trapped inside this eternal treadmill prison,

160
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,640
it can now hold the entirety of its former...

161
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,680
Cage.

162
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,720
Thank you, cage, within its grasp.

163
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,560
It rips and throws this toilet paper holder

164
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,600
with light shining out through the middle of it,

165
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,160
throws this thing behind it as its other hand

166
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:33,160
reaches up and touches the sky.

167
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,000
It's gonna testify.

168
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,120
It's up in this spot.

169
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,760
Luke, how do you think it looks?

170
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,480
Fuck.

171
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,800
That's right, extra fly.

172
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,640
Extra fly.

173
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,880
It touches...

174
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:53,880
It touches the dark sky above,

175
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:58,880
which immediately breaks and waves begin to form

176
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:03,520
an ocean of black ichor.

177
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:08,520
It is moving like dark, lagoon-y waters.

178
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:13,160
So gravity, seemingly, up there is opposite

179
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,280
of the gravity that you're on.

180
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,080
Does that sound cool?

181
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:17,920
Yeah.

182
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

183
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,240
Gravity.

184
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,280
A dark sky sea of endless blackness.

185
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,600
A dark-sized ski of endless darkness.

186
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,440
That's right, yeah.

187
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,760
Stark ski and hutch.

188
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,320
Word association.

189
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,720
Yeah, kids, if you wanna know how to be funny,

190
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,920
just remember what sounds sound like other sounds.

191
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:46,200
Yeah, it works 100%.

192
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,920
And blurt that out almost compulsively

193
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,040
and you'll be just like your best friends,

194
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,760
the boys at PDBP.

195
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,440
PDBP.

196
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,960
Everyone's best friend, PDBP.

197
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:06,960
Rose M-A-R-Y looks at this new set of issues.

198
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,840
She's coming straight for Planet Juggernaut.

199
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,720
Two of her metal tendrils slam down

200
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,160
into the illuminated ground below her

201
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:19,160
and she flings herself toward this enormous, robust sphere,

202
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,720
a larger version of what controls her.

203
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,680
And the other two tendrils are going to try

204
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,920
to penetrate the armor of Planet Juggernaut.

205
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,160
Does he get a reaction?

206
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,000
A hundred.

207
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,640
Laser eyes.

208
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:35,440
Fuck yes, all right, let's roll.

209
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,800
Mother fucking shit.

210
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,680
What did you roll?

211
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,480
I rolled a 66, it's a critical something.

212
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,920
It's a critical something.

213
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,240
I don't know Juggernaut stats, I don't have Mandy.

214
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,200
Would they be in the big thing of...

215
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,800
Much like Nick Cage, you don't have Mandy.

216
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,880
Fuck, no, cut all that.

217
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,240
Why don't you have your stats?

218
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,040
Dude, I don't know where our giant robot stats are.

219
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,920
Thomas, they probably don't exist anywhere.

220
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:16,200
I just wrote them on a piece of paper for you one day,

221
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,040
like years ago.

222
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,760
I do explicitly remember you just jotting them down

223
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,080
on like a scratch piece of paper and we used that.

224
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,800
It was a scratch piece of paper, why don't you have it?

225
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,640
I'll look for it in the box real quick.

226
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,520
He had real good stats.

227
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:33,000
Let me pull up the pulp Cthulhu rules.

228
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,880
I'm pretty sure that's what I pulled it from.

229
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,920
Yeah, because I remember you based it

230
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,520
on something you found.

231
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,720
Found pulp Cthulhu.

232
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:46,440
Robots tend to come in two varieties, giant and killer.

233
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,640
Laser beam, 80%.

234
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,480
Hell yeah.

235
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,880
Critical success.

236
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,000
Nice.

237
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,360
Damage 2D10, so roll 4D10.

238
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,200
Hell yeah.

239
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,120
10 and two for the first ones,

240
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,120
10 and two again for the second ones.

241
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,200
Whoa.

242
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,520
Damn.

243
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,400
That's wild.

244
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,800
24 points of damage.

245
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,040
God's here guys.

246
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:23,080
Describe how these lasers absolutely wreck shop

247
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,840
taking over half of Rosemary's hit points.

248
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,240
She was coming at him.

249
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,280
How was she coming at him?

250
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,760
She flinged herself at this planet juggernaut

251
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,280
with two metal tendrils shoved into the ground

252
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,800
and the other two are in attack mode

253
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,360
trying to stab into the planet juggernaut.

254
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,040
Okay, so with surprising swiftness,

255
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,680
planet juggernaut's eyes kind of swing around

256
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,560
and lock onto Rosemary.

257
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,320
They flash red, two beams come out of either eye

258
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,360
and you see the tip of the tendrils

259
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,720
that are like about to attack them

260
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,760
just kind of slice clean off.

261
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,040
And so he destroys like half of her body, he said.

262
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,760
Yeah, yeah.

263
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:08,240
So it's exactly like a dope fucking samurai movie

264
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,240
where you see the lasers seemingly

265
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,400
go right through her middle,

266
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,960
but nothing happens for a second.

267
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:17,880
And then the bottom half just slides away,

268
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:21,520
but you can still see like anger actively on her face,

269
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:24,200
but it's more like annoyance as she begins

270
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,440
to just climb out of this Rosemary like shell.

271
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,280
Keith, it's your turn.

272
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,360
Am I on planet juggernaut or am I on the ground?

273
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,560
You are in a very dark building.

274
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,800
Oh, that Keith.

275
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,120
That Keith.

276
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,840
Yeah, there's a few, I think.

277
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:47,320
Keith, I guess, what has Don done to me?

278
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:51,040
You are being held by the caller by Don D. Pettymore

279
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,400
and he is angrily yelling at you

280
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:56,360
because he has just seemingly failed.

281
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,880
His whole mission was getting to this phone

282
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,520
and then he seems disappointed by the results.

283
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,880
Hey man, what's your problem?

284
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,920
What's going on?

285
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,880
It's all good in here.

286
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,040
I love this because I feel like I'm shaking you.

287
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,240
I'm just like limply like.

288
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,240
For listeners at home,

289
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:26,520
Luke just did the thing that like inflatable men do

290
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,080
in front of big car dealerships.

291
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,640
More like Muppets do when they're excited.

292
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:39,640
But your voice belies the extreme emotion of the situation.

293
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:45,320
Hey man, the phone, what is it?

294
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,560
They didn't say anything to me.

295
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,360
It's all, none of this means anything.

296
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:51,400
Don't you, why don't you fucking understand?

297
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,560
Well, let me give it a try.

298
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,600
Give it to me, give it to me.

299
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:00,240
Don D. Pettymore like kind of immediately stops

300
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:05,480
and just drops you but he doesn't give you the phone

301
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,080
but he kind of walks away from you.

302
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,760
Can I get up and go to the phone?

303
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,560
Yeah, sure.

304
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,380
I get up and go to the phone.

305
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,220
Yeah.

306
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:17,040
I pick it up.

307
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,000
I'm like blindly feeling around for it

308
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,840
because I can't say anything.

309
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,680
There it is, yeah.

310
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,320
And you blew the candle out.

311
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,200
So go ahead and roll on whether or not

312
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,280
you can find this phone this turn.

313
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,480
Just a 50-50.

314
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,400
No, roll luck.

315
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,880
17, I pass.

316
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,320
And so you grab onto this phone

317
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,600
and when you lift it to your ear, you hear.

318
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:52,540
Hello, this is Keith, who's this?

319
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

320
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,960
Roll intelligence.

321
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,080
I fail.

322
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:12,980
Shocker.

323
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:23,400
What is Keith's intelligence?

324
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,240
50.

325
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,080
All right.

326
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,440
Not bad, I got a 63 on a 50.

327
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,880
You're not really able to put together

328
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:33,040
what you recognize this sound from

329
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:36,040
but you know that it sounds familiar.

330
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,080
Hmm, Don, this sounds familiar.

331
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,320
I'm gonna maybe just keep listening to it for a second

332
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:44,120
and maybe in just a little bit I'll be able to,

333
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,040
it'll come to me.

334
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,600
And Don's in the corner like,

335
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,320
the fucking piece of shit thinks he's better than me,

336
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,400
thinks he can use the phone.

337
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,760
I'm the one who came down here to get the fucking phone

338
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:55,300
but I'm not talking to anyone in particular.

339
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,200
I grab the phone, like the base of the phone

340
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,980
and I lay back down on the ground

341
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,720
and just like hold the receiver up to my ear

342
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,040
and keep listening to it.

343
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,520
Just waiting for the internet company to get back to you.

344
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:20,180
Back on the illuminated battlefield,

345
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:22,620
creatures appear out of nowhere

346
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:26,220
in between the dark oozing ocean above you

347
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:29,500
and the illuminated land below you.

348
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,540
Above you and below you, what did I say?

349
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:35,540
Between the, whatever.

350
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:36,380
And,

351
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,380
Who the fucking gives a shit?

352
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:45,460
Nobody cares, nobody's listening anymore.

353
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:47,480
This nerd shit doesn't matter.

354
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:51,480
This isn't, none of this is real.

355
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,680
Guys, we only had four listens on the last episode

356
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,680
which means one of us didn't listen to it.

357
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:03,680
Who gives a flying fuck?

358
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:09,280
Between the dark, mysterious choppy waters above you

359
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,440
and the bright light shining up from below,

360
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,920
in this air of nothingness in between,

361
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:22,720
massive creatures with gaunt frames

362
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:27,720
in black suits with translucent skin fall to the ground.

363
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,880
And as they do, they are surrounding

364
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:36,840
this luminous land liturgy that is worshiping the overseer.

365
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,480
They look directly at this floating man,

366
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:45,480
his arms out with his dark robes and his cowboy hat.

367
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,560
And in unison, they all say,

368
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:54,560
Hello, subject 1522518195518, we found you.

369
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,840
Please come with us.

370
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:04,000
And they all reach out their hands simultaneously.

371
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,840
It's the overseer's turn.

372
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,920
Clark, go ahead and roll

373
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,200
for the alternate version of yourself.

374
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,360
Go ahead and roll for Clark Old.

375
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,760
Okay, what am I rolling?

376
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,400
Just up and down, D100.

377
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,800
It's an 11.

378
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:24,840
Oh, it's a critical.

379
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,000
I'm showing the camera to the dice.

380
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,080
It is a straight up 11.

381
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,880
You see his arms move out.

382
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,840
His right arm is pulled to one side by one of them.

383
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:38,000
His left hand is pulled to the side by another

384
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,200
with their minds.

385
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,600
His legs are held down by two of the others.

386
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,480
You see he's fighting against it.

387
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:48,320
But one of them is trying to get a hold of his head.

388
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:53,120
His entire face becomes engulfed in light.

389
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:58,120
And he beams this light at one of these gaunt

390
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:03,000
alien creatures wearing black suit.

391
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,000
It's translucent skin pops puss and ooze.

392
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:14,720
Not green, not yellow, just this clear milky slime.

393
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:20,160
Hits the ground in a pile of a black suit covered in...

394
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,400
Nope, I'm gonna throw up.

395
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,920
The popping of pimples really gets me.

396
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,840
That's like fucking disgusting.

397
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:31,800
So, it's like with the beam,

398
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,400
he's got fingers on either side of just this

399
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,880
volcano eruption of puss.

400
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,800
Just comes out, I'm gonna throw up.

401
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,880
And then he turns and looks at another one

402
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,560
because he critically succeeded.

403
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:50,120
And he does it to a second one, looks at a third one,

404
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,160
does it to a third one.

405
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:54,320
There's only two more left on the field.

406
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,760
You ever DM so hard you make yourself throw up?

407
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,880
Clark Old, they're not Clark Old, just Clark Bishop.

408
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,720
It's your turn.

409
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,880
Clark, my Clark, our Clark,

410
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,040
the Clark we've all come to know and love.

411
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,520
He just saw what he thinks that he can become.

412
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,400
And he wants to do that.

413
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,240
He wants to be that.

414
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,200
And so he's just gonna do like he did with Anne Love

415
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,360
and try and imitate everything he just saw the overseer do.

416
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:27,120
And he wants to try and make his face turn into bright light

417
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,560
that pops translucent beings.

418
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,520
Okay, go ahead and roll a natural.

419
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,360
The two that popped,

420
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,840
are they the ones that have his hands?

421
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,640
Yeah, but not physically.

422
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,560
Okay, gotcha, gotcha.

423
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,120
They were like away from him.

424
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,120
They're holding him with that grip

425
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:44,160
that one of them used on Keith Beans earlier in the show.

426
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:47,680
And Marvin Glass used on Clark Bishop at one point in time

427
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,640
where they can physically grab you from further away.

428
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,760
Like Darth Vader, I like Star Wars.

429
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,920
I like Star Wars a lot.

430
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:58,160
Yeah, I'm popping the other two, trying to.

431
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,640
And it's a pass, a 28 on a 63.

432
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,480
They rolled a 17 earlier against Clark Gold

433
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,960
and that roll carries over to yours,

434
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,280
which means that you succeed

435
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,280
in being able to do this to one of them.

436
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:18,000
Please, can you describe it so I don't gak in my own throat?

437
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,400
As I said, he's imitating what he had seen.

438
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,360
He doesn't know exact,

439
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:29,360
he saw the concentration that Clark Gold exuded

440
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,760
and that he just tries to mimic that.

441
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,600
He just tries to scrunch his face up a little bit,

442
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,600
clear his mind as much as possible and just picture light.

443
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,640
He just wants to picture light.

444
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,720
He doesn't know a hundred percent if it's gonna work,

445
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,180
but it kind of did that last time with the blood thing.

446
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:47,960
And he thinks that maybe, I don't, and his head,

447
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:51,380
just like a light bulb turning on illuminates

448
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:53,680
and it kind of startles him even

449
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:57,640
as there's now a bunch of light flooded the area around him.

450
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,880
And he just directs it all as much as he can

451
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,840
into one of them.

452
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:04,200
And as though being squeezed on both sides,

453
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:08,040
goo erupts off the top of one of these things,

454
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:11,320
popping its head, fully volcanoing and splashing outward,

455
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:14,320
maybe probably hitting some of the people in the circle

456
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,940
with some pretty awful, pretty awful awful.

457
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:18,840
Awful awful.

458
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,840
It's this guy named Zach who's in the crowd

459
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:23,080
and it's like really warm and he can feel it.

460
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,200
Gets in his mouth a little.

461
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,480
Yeah. Gets in his mouth.

462
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,320
Oh!

463
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,480
Zach falls to his knees,

464
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,480
begins throwing up on the ground

465
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:35,280
and gets trampled by some of the other chanting people.

466
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:40,360
Clark is also, he's like proud of himself

467
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:44,240
and he gives a thumbs up to Clark Old and a smile.

468
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,960
Like, I did good, dad, huh?

469
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:51,080
At this moment, you see all the anger

470
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:55,600
that had come from Clark Old previously dissipates

471
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,640
and he looks at you with this,

472
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:04,360
that moment when a father realizes-

473
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,200
TFW.

474
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,400
I thought you said DFW and I was like-

475
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,400
Like Dallas, Fort Worth?

476
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,920
The pride that all fathers have

477
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:17,120
in the Dallas International Airport shines on his face.

478
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,520
Dad's face when- No, he looks at you and it's-

479
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,360
Oh!

480
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,040
Yeah.

481
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:31,040
So what's the prevailing jiff of someone becoming,

482
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,440
oh yeah, it's the guy in the woods with the,

483
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,640
is it Grizzly Adams?

484
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,120
That's what I was thinking of too.

485
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,720
Just the single head nod.

486
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,560
It's not Grizzly Adams.

487
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:44,360
It's not Grizzly Adams, but it's the guy in the woods.

488
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,840
Is it Jeremiah Johnson?

489
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,920
No, it's something else.

490
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,120
Jeremiah Johnson.

491
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,760
Jeremiah Johnson- The nodding man?

492
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,320
On the field reporting.

493
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,160
Yeah, the nodding man.

494
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,800
Robert Redford.

495
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,640
No, it's not.

496
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,480
What?

497
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,320
Is it not?

498
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,160
No, it's not.

499
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,000
I found it though.

500
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,600
Nodding man, jiff.

501
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,960
I sent it to the Discord.

502
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,280
Origin.

503
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,040
Yeah, but I'm looking for who it is.

504
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,520
It is Jeremiah Johnson.

505
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,360
Yeah.

506
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,200
That is-

507
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,320
This man is actually Robert Redford.

508
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,760
Dude, it is Robert Redford.

509
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,560
Yeah, that's what I was saying.

510
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,880
Wait, no, Robert Redford is Jeremiah Johnson,

511
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,360
but that nodding man is not Robert Redford.

512
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,200
Oh, okay.

513
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,040
That's what I was thinking.

514
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:20,960
Oh.

515
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,800
Who is this then?

516
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,620
I don't think.

517
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:23,860
It doesn't look like-

518
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:26,300
It's a gif of Robert Redford playing titular role

519
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,380
of the 1972 film, Jeremiah Johnson.

520
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:31,580
Dude, he looks so thick in that movie.

521
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:32,420
Weird.

522
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,900
Yeah, that doesn't really look like him.

523
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:34,740
It's wild.

524
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:35,940
I love that there's a lot that just says this is-

525
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,260
He's an ugly motherfucker.

526
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:41,300
That just say Zach Galifianakis is this man,

527
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,340
when it's clearly from the 70s.

528
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:44,860
Yeah.

529
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:46,980
Dude, he was like a heartthrob though, like-

530
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,540
What is he holding in that gif?

531
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,460
What the fuck?

532
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,300
You know-

533
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,140
A rifle.

534
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:54,220
There are shots of him in that movie

535
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:56,260
where he doesn't look like he does in that gif.

536
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:58,180
He's holding it to the side.

537
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:59,900
Yeah, every other picture of him in the movie

538
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,980
looks like Robert Redford when you pull it up.

539
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:03,180
Exactly.

540
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:05,460
Only this one looks like Zach Galifianakis.

541
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,780
It's really fucking weird.

542
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:11,780
Okay.

543
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:15,220
He looks at you like Robert Redford and Jeremiah Johnson

544
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:20,380
and just slowly gives you that slight smile and head nod.

545
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:22,540
And that feels real good to Clark.

546
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:23,380
Don.

547
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:27,340
Does Don hear New Commotion from outside?

548
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:28,180
Oh yeah, dude.

549
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,020
Or what's the building?

550
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,940
I didn't know if the building is like sound insulated

551
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,060
or some weird shit.

552
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:34,780
It is, but just enough to where you can hear

553
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:37,700
New Sound Commotion from outside.

554
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:40,820
New Sound Commotion is my favorite band for teenagers.

555
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,980
Teenagers.

556
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:45,860
With the hit single New Sound Commotion

557
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:48,340
on the new debut album, Hit Sound Commotion.

558
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,500
New Sound Commotion.

559
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,460
Hit Sound Commotion.

560
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:53,260
Rocking like the ocean.

561
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:56,660
Is it above you or below you?

562
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:59,580
I'm like, hey boy, are they, can you speak to them?

563
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:01,340
Are you talking?

564
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:08,460
Is that what Keith is doing right now?

565
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,660
Yeah, into the phone.

566
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:11,780
Jesus Christ.

567
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:13,820
Oh God.

568
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,700
I don't fucking know.

569
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:21,420
As he says that, you hear the same noise that you heard

570
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:23,260
on the other end of the telephone.

571
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:28,260
That's like, this noise comes from outside.

572
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,260
You hear it.

573
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:31,020
So I think when I hear that noise,

574
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,980
it'll like click in my head and I'll be like,

575
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:36,580
maybe they're here to help and I'll sprint downstairs.

576
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:39,460
Jon, it's Ball's turn.

577
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:42,220
Ball, while Mary has been caught off guard

578
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:45,300
by Planet Juggernaut, or is at least, you know.

579
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,420
Caught off guard.

580
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:47,940
Yes, sliced in half.

581
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:54,300
As Mary Ball and like Octopus is like moving out

582
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:59,300
of Mary body, Jon Ball, just in pure tiny silver form,

583
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:01,900
whips at her as hard as he can,

584
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:05,260
is gonna try to just knock her on her ass,

585
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,980
basically, on her ball.

586
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,260
A ball on ball.

587
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:09,100
This is dope.

588
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:13,020
All right, let's tangle some wires.

589
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:15,060
What should we roll for this?

590
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,540
Oh yeah, roll ball.

591
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:20,180
Get the Pulp Cthulhu ball stats.

592
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:23,140
Roll a natural.

593
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:23,980
Okay.

594
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,740
80, fail.

595
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:29,060
75, pass.

596
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:33,020
The ball of Jon Lee Pettymore lunges at the ball

597
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:36,940
that is pulling itself out of the top half of the body

598
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:40,900
of Rose M-A-R-Y, Rosemary.

599
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:44,540
The clean cut across the leather jacket

600
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:49,340
and white t-shirt of Rosemary is dripping with blood

601
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:51,740
and you see as if sheet metal

602
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:55,780
has been completely sliced clean.

603
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:59,100
It's like a layer of t-shirt that is red,

604
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:02,340
stained with blood, and then there's skin,

605
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:05,460
and then there's this metal, and then there's more skin,

606
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,740
and then there's reinforced metal,

607
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:12,740
and then inside you just see these lengthy intestines

608
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:17,580
spill out onto the illuminated land below.

609
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:22,460
I don't, what if she keeps the top half of Rosemary

610
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:24,260
and then it's a walking eye situation

611
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:26,740
but with an angry Rosemary torso

612
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:29,140
just dripping its intestines all over the place?

613
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:32,420
There aren't a lot of moments in this show

614
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:35,060
that make me as happy as the one

615
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:37,340
that you've just suggested now.

616
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,620
Thomas, 10 luck.

617
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:41,540
Nice.

618
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:44,460
And as you come at her, she kind of,

619
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:50,020
she flips up to where you just barrel

620
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:53,020
into the bottom half of Rosemary

621
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:57,100
and your ball disappears up into the guts

622
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:01,300
of Rosemary's body and you are stuck inside

623
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,420
of this human goop.

624
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,260
That's dope.

625
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:07,300
I came from the muck and I'm stuck in the ball's guts.

626
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,140
Oh no.

627
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:10,980
I thought I'd get it.

628
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:11,980
Back to the lab again.

629
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:12,820
Yeah.

630
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:20,140
And now we're gonna go to our newly minted old characters.

631
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:23,860
They haven't been around since episode 46.

632
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:28,740
It is the scrap pit versions of Keith, Clark,

633
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:32,100
and then John, who is inside Planet Juggernaut.

634
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,420
So we'll start with Keith.

635
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:35,140
It is Keith's turn.

636
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:36,020
Whoo!

637
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:41,020
Keith just jumps with his pneumatic legs,

638
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:44,340
jumps right at Mary,

639
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:49,060
and starts shooting his freezing liquid

640
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:54,060
and is aiming his legs to just smash into her frozen head.

641
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:56,300
Radical.

642
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,140
Or roll.

643
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,940
Stankling icicle guts.

644
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:01,820
Either one, depending on my roll.

645
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:08,300
And 19, which I think is a pass.

646
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:10,780
It is, but she uses her

647
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:11,860
No, she doesn't.

648
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:16,180
against John, which was a 75, which was also a pass.

649
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:21,180
You freeze the whole bottom half of Rosemary

650
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:26,180
and as you come down to try to take her on, essentially,

651
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:31,020
she uses the two tendrils that haven't been sliced off

652
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:34,220
to grab onto her frozen bottom half

653
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:37,900
and hold it up like a ice cold shield

654
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:42,900
that your fucking rad feet just boom and shatter

655
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:47,300
and the bottom half of Rosemary just explodes

656
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:51,460
into tiny little icicle pieces all over the ground.

657
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:54,420
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow.

658
00:32:56,860 --> 00:33:01,140
And for the rest of the combat, I will call you Elsa.

659
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:03,540
Clark Bishop, it's your turn.

660
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:07,100
This Clark had stocked up on a bunch of stuff

661
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:10,140
from a crazy room of providing.

662
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:13,620
And I think I have a sniper rifle still.

663
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:14,460
You do.

664
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:16,380
So I'd like to shoot that sniper rifle

665
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:21,380
aiming at where I think ball resides within Rosemary.

666
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:24,420
I'm tracing the lines of the feet up to a point

667
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:26,180
and I'm just taking aim at that point.

668
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:27,020
Okay, yeah.

669
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:29,020
The ball is actually visible currently,

670
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:31,900
holding itself right above the top of her head.

671
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:35,060
She's still in control of the top half of Rosemary

672
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:36,940
through the spine with one tendril,

673
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:40,940
but the ball itself is like she just got an idea.

674
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:42,980
It is the light bulb right above her head.

675
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:43,860
Oh, okay, cool.

676
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:45,220
That's what I'm aiming for.

677
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:51,380
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

678
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:56,700
Uh, that's a 99.

679
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,060
Damn.

680
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:02,380
That plays for this version of this Clark.

681
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:05,900
He was not doing great in that fight anyway.

682
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,940
He just popped up and was,

683
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:08,780
what the fuck?

684
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:09,620
Poof.

685
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:12,500
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

686
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:16,100
This Clark was cursed by death magic and at zero sanity.

687
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:16,940
That's true.

688
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:17,780
Oh yeah.

689
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:19,380
When he reaches back with one hand

690
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:21,500
to grab onto the sniper rifle,

691
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:24,100
his hand just immediately hits the trigger

692
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,780
and he doesn't even see it coming

693
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:28,420
because the barrel is right behind his head.

694
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:31,340
The frontal lobe of Clark Bishop

695
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:34,060
flies out the front of his skull.

696
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:37,540
And I mean, his cranium is now shattered

697
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:39,980
into 40 different pieces

698
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:42,500
that then spray out onto the ground.

699
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,380
The people who are chanting below

700
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:48,780
look up as this third version of this same person

701
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:52,700
just, and the headless body of Clark Bishop

702
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:56,020
just kind of falls off the side of Planet Juggernaut

703
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:58,420
and hits the ground shoulders first

704
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:00,460
with no head to stop the fall.

705
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:01,300
Damn.

706
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:06,300
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

707
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:08,900
Bye bye.

708
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:09,780
That was quick.

709
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:12,700
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

710
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,780
If Planet Juggernaut is a horse,

711
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:18,260
then call that man a headless horse man.

712
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:19,900
Oh my God, Nick Nichols.

713
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,780
He was riding him and now he's not.

714
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:24,660
My God, your wordplay hasn't suffered one bit

715
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:27,060
in this new hellscape we find ourselves in.

716
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,980
I'm so proud of you, my brother.

717
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:30,620
Remembering who I am,

718
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:33,540
I wrote out that I talk without thinking.

719
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:35,340
Moving on, it is.

720
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:39,540
Planet Juggernaut's turn.

721
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:41,980
So Planet Juggernaut has just seen his Clark

722
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:45,080
have his head explode.

723
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,180
Yeah, that's a bummer.

724
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,420
Correct, yeah.

725
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:49,460
Yep.

726
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:52,660
Yeah, so now Planet Juggernaut is helicoptering

727
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:55,780
from his tiny little Inspector Gadget helicopter blade,

728
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:58,480
zooming full speed at Rosemary.

729
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,320
Awesome.

730
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:03,460
And he's got his big Mickey Mouse gloved hands

731
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:06,100
extended forward like he's trying to full on

732
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,940
superhero puncher when he gets there.

733
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:09,500
Go ahead and roll.

734
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,500
You have a 60% in fight.

735
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,980
39.

736
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:18,300
It is still in the same round as her 75,

737
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,360
which was a pass from earlier.

738
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:25,360
So two tendrils grab into the luminous land below

739
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:29,460
and backstroke and dodge nimbly out of the way

740
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:31,720
as Planet Juggernaut hits the ground

741
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:34,060
right next to Keith Bishop,

742
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:37,580
who just landed, shattering the frozen bottom half.

743
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:38,420
Clark Bishop.

744
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:39,740
Did I just say Keith Bishop?

745
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:40,900
Keith Bishop.

746
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:43,960
Whoa, fun new wrinkle in the story.

747
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:48,680
If every time we misspoke about character names

748
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,600
had to be included in plot canon,

749
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,340
then this story would be confusing.

750
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,640
Well, we could have a really fun

751
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:00,040
and incestuous filled like prologue

752
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,320
where the Beans, the Bishops, and the Pennymores

753
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,680
just all get together in like the 1920s.

754
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,660
And we're all, there's just so many secret Beans babies

755
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,060
littered around contention.

756
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:14,060
It's ready to pop up.

757
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:16,040
Oh man, Beans babies.

758
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:19,380
Collectible Beans babies.

759
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:25,060
Keith Vigna.

760
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:28,220
Keith Vigna was the person whose name I tried to say.

761
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:33,220
And now it is the turn of John Lee Kevinmore, the third,

762
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:36,460
who is face first on the ground,

763
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:40,180
having just been brought here by Planet Juggernaut.

764
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:42,760
Very confused by the situation that's at hand.

765
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:46,180
He was just crushing Wheel of Fortune, not two seconds ago.

766
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,980
He fires his gun into the air.

767
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:55,740
All right, that is the end of round one

768
00:37:55,740 --> 00:38:00,040
of this other Wild, Wild, Wild Lake combat, Nick Nickles.

769
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:05,040
And first off, we have this enormous beast to our left,

770
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:10,680
throws a weird pipe made of light on the inside behind him

771
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,320
and then touches the sky.

772
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,400
Oh, he's gonna testify!

773
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:19,400
And the sky above turns into an ocean of blackness.

774
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,680
What do you think about that, Nick Nickles?

775
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,280
I'd love to go take a dip in that,

776
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,640
but I do think I would never return to be with you,

777
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:26,800
my beloved brother.

778
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,840
He looks deeply into your eyes and puts out a hand

779
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:33,000
that he wants to interlock hands slowly.

780
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,800
Yeah, we do the thing where our fingers match up,

781
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,640
but then-

782
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:40,000
And then slide off to one side and then interlock.

783
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,520
I would miss you forever and never forgive myself.

784
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,360
I wouldn't forgive myself either.

785
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,160
Rosemary Lunge, the Planet Juggernaut, got sliced in half.

786
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,440
He jumped inside of her.

787
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,960
Keith Beans, one of them jumped down,

788
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,380
froze onto the bottom half, smashed that to bits.

789
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:57,220
Planet Juggernaut jumped to the side of that.

790
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:58,480
They're all diving all over the place.

791
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,960
Clark Bishop exploded the back of his head.

792
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,720
Oh my God, he just completely deheaded himself.

793
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:08,280
What do you think, Nick Nickles?

794
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,120
Deheaded.

795
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,960
There seems to be a lot going on in this combat,

796
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,860
but I can't help but think Clark Bishop

797
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:19,720
has been an absolute failure, both in the pit

798
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:22,240
and in this new hell we find ourselves in.

799
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:25,020
However, we do see another version

800
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:26,800
of seemingly this same man.

801
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,520
He's dressed in a weird 1970s version

802
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:33,400
of a contingent police officer uniform,

803
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,680
and this version of Clark Bishop,

804
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,520
oh, light came pouring out of his head

805
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:41,760
to save an older looking version of himself

806
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,480
from these large creatures,

807
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:48,240
oh, who seem to resemble our former employer,

808
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:53,120
who's now locked forever in some sort of weird icicle box

809
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,280
into a lava volcano.

810
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,680
Bobby Glass, they kind of look like him.

811
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,960
What do you think about that?

812
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:02,160
All I know is all these details are ruining my brain,

813
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:06,680
but I feel compelled to speak in a sports announcer voice.

814
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:07,760
Back to you.

815
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,600
Oh my God.

816
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,320
Jesus Christ, what the fuck is this shit?

817
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,160
Hey, do you guys want to play Delta Green?

818
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,120
No.

819
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,760
We could do this other thing though.

820
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,760
The other hand of the Gigantumbropithecus,

821
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:36,720
shadowy and dripping with ooze and pure darkness,

822
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:41,720
reaches up and additionally begins to waggle

823
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:47,880
its long phalanges into the murky water above you.

824
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:52,480
Two things happen in that moment.

825
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:57,480
One, the water begins to rise.

826
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:02,840
It is slowly lowering down toward you all.

827
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:08,080
And two, multiple unspeakable worm-like abominations

828
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:13,400
erupt out of the surface of this black, icorous ocean.

829
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,840
These things rise at least 10 feet out of the water,

830
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:20,960
down toward you, still far away this round,

831
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,440
but seemingly will be moving toward you

832
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:27,040
with each further round played in this combat.

833
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,680
They're tube-like, they're covered in squamous,

834
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:33,920
black, partially translucent membranes.

835
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,640
Their bodies are segmented,

836
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:38,520
toxically green, pulsating arteries and veins

837
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:41,280
can be seen through their thin looking exterior.

838
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,480
They have no identifiable eyes or nose

839
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:47,360
and their cavernous, circular mouths,

840
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:49,960
one sitting just inside the others,

841
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:52,400
are lined with hooked teeth.

842
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:56,800
They spit out saliva that's somehow darker than black

843
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:01,080
and from these maws, these sharp stylets protrude

844
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:05,640
like something between a tongue and a noodle-like needle.

845
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:08,120
Does Wheel of Forch John wing one

846
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,520
when he shoots into the air?

847
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,880
Roll.

848
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,040
Firearms.

849
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,040
70 on a 60.

850
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,440
The bullet hits one of these things

851
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:23,600
and it reacts not at all to the bullet fired

852
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:26,240
from this Wheel of Forch John.

853
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,360
John Wheel Pettymore.

854
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,680
Rosemary's turn.

855
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:37,360
Rosemary plugs one of her metal tendrils

856
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:41,840
into the ground next to her and then goes deeper

857
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:45,520
and then goes deeper and out in a circle

858
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:49,760
like a riplets from a drop of water into a puddle.

859
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:53,000
Those are called riplets because they're small.

860
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,080
These ripples are made of technicolor swirl

861
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:01,000
that begin to form around and you see a new portal

862
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:06,000
begin to form around one of these tentacles from Rosemary.

863
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,840
Keith, you are on the phone.

864
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:15,560
Hmm, this seems unnatural.

865
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:18,920
Maybe I should listen to it in a different type of way.

866
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:24,760
Yep, maybe with this passing unnatural role

867
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:31,120
I will finally understand something.

868
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:39,840
Hello, Keith Ashley Beans, what can we do for you?

869
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:41,560
That's a good question.

870
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:43,960
Hey Don, I got him on the phone.

871
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,760
Yeah, what can you do for me?

872
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,960
Anything you desire.

873
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,320
Hmm, can you get rid of that big thing out there?

874
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:54,360
We will send reinforcements.

875
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:57,880
Sweet, can you have him bring me a McFlurry too?

876
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:00,120
Oreo or M&M. Oreo please.

877
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:03,360
Don, you want anything?

878
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:04,200
I'm not in the room.

879
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:06,000
Get an Oreo and a M&M.

880
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,120
I couldn't tell because it's so dark in here.

881
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:11,720
Because it's so dark in here.

882
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:14,120
Hey Don, Don.

883
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:17,480
Well, how long until they get here?

884
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:24,120
I put the phone back on the thing.

885
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:28,280
I put the phone back on the phone and just lay there.

886
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:31,720
And by laying on the floor,

887
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:35,920
you've probably done just as much as anyone else has

888
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,280
for the combat hands.

889
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:44,000
You can't fail if you don't try.

890
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:49,960
Outside, the last remaining member of Myriad

891
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:55,760
is going to take on Clarkold once again in a struggle.

892
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:58,680
Please roll for Clarkold, Joe Terry.

893
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:02,960
He passed with a 38 on my end.

894
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:04,440
I rolled a 75.

895
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,560
I don't know what I'm rolling on though.

896
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:09,200
Oh, Clarkold has 80.

897
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,120
Nice.

898
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:12,880
So that's a big old success.

899
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,280
Big old success.

900
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:17,360
Literally this thing reaches out at Clarkold

901
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:19,440
and Clarkold looks at it

902
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:24,360
and its hand fucking shrivels back to its elbow.

903
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:26,800
Its forearm is completely missing

904
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:30,280
and its suit seemed to be tailored simultaneously

905
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:31,960
so you can see the effect.

906
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:34,760
Clark, your turn.

907
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:36,200
I'm gonna just use this turn

908
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,560
because it seems like Clarkold's got it handled

909
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,560
to yell out to the creature.

910
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,640
What do you want with us, him and me

911
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:46,080
and we, what do you want with me?

912
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:48,080
Hello, subject 1522518195518.

913
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:57,360
Warning, for your own safety, please stay here.

914
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:00,200
If you choose to disobey this order

915
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:05,120
and you return to plane 1620216,

916
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:07,520
you will be eliminated.

917
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:10,480
We need to stop that thing.

918
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,280
We're not your problem, that's your problem

919
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,920
and I'm pointing at the giant creature.

920
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:17,440
It makes this similar noise of just this like.

921
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:18,360
Ah, ah, ah.

922
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:24,600
Ah, ah, ah.

923
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:27,400
Yes, I now agree with you.

924
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:28,720
Oh, fuck yeah, dude.

925
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
I didn't know that was gonna work like that.

926
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,800
It turns and looks at this enormous,

927
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:40,440
gigantic morpithecus.

928
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:42,840
Its eyes get really big

929
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:47,880
and it looks down at its shriveled hand

930
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:49,800
and then looks down at its other hand

931
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:50,920
but it already took its turn.

932
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:52,600
So it's Don D. Pettymore.

933
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:56,160
I assume Don at this point is,

934
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:59,080
am I outside of the building observing what happened?

935
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:03,920
You are looking out on a field of gory glory.

936
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:06,280
Glory, glory, hallelujah.

937
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,280
Glory, glory, hallelujah.

938
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:16,080
Wait, do I see John?

939
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:17,240
Which John, man?

940
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:18,480
Yeah, you do.

941
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,720
John and original John body.

942
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,320
Do you see one of those?

943
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:24,800
It's not the same one you were talking to earlier.

944
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,080
That one's a shiny metal ball in the sky.

945
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:31,520
Yeah, now I'm like, John, John, John

946
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:34,440
and I'm like yelling at John and running towards him

947
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:38,560
because I'm curious if me calling the telephone

948
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:40,840
brought John back to help us

949
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:42,960
and I'm gonna run directly towards him.

950
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,480
I'm assuming he's decently far away.

951
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:46,560
I don't know if I have anything else to do, but.

952
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:47,680
Yeah, he's decently far away

953
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:48,840
and you have nothing else to do.

954
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:51,920
Let's go to Keith from the scrap pit.

955
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:53,360
He's not Jenny from the block.

956
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:55,680
He's Keith from the scrap pit and it's his turn.

957
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,520
Where have I landed?

958
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,760
Planet Juggernaut is right next to you.

959
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:03,040
Rosemary's top half with a tendril hanging out

960
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:06,000
and dug deep into the ground is ahead of you,

961
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,560
about 10 meters.

962
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:10,600
A portal is opening just to the left of her

963
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:14,000
and inside of her top half,

964
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:18,440
you see the writhing tentacles of the ball.

965
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:22,680
Over to your right, there's a massive liturgy worship

966
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:24,800
happening of the overseer.

967
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:28,200
Sha-ka-tee-fa-lee-ya, all for the overseer.

968
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:31,600
Sha-ka-tee-fa-lee-ya, all for the overseer.

969
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:34,960
Sha-ka-tee-fa-lee-ya, all for the overseer.

970
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:38,640
Sha-ka-tee-fa-lee-ya, all for the overseer.

971
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,920
And Clark Bishop is in this group,

972
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:43,600
not chanting, but still dancing with them

973
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:48,600
while talking to this translucent gaunt figure

974
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:50,640
in a black suit.

975
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:54,400
Keith looks all around him at just the chaos.

976
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:57,840
He looks straight up and sees those worms.

977
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:59,280
Fuck those worms.

978
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:01,520
And he just jumps as high as he can,

979
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,960
trying to get sucked into the gravity

980
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:06,720
of the plane above him.

981
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:09,320
Oh shit, oh shit.

982
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:11,040
He's got those pneumatic legs.

983
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:16,040
Yeah, I mean, roll dexterity plus 40 for the legs.

984
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:17,480
Okay, that's a pass.

985
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:19,600
So I wanna jump as high as I can

986
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:23,960
and try to get sucked into the gravity of that plane

987
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:28,080
and once I feel the kind of shift,

988
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:32,720
I want to try to aim my body right into

989
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:36,040
one of the mouths of the worms

990
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:38,520
and just unload my freeze gun

991
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:43,520
as I slide into the open mouth of one of the worms.

992
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:47,400
Why, why, what?

993
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:49,440
I'm gonna freeze him from the inside out

994
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,000
and bust my way out of there.

995
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:58,200
Or get stuck in a frozen worm as it collapses to earth.

996
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,040
Either way.

997
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:08,200
Okay, roll firearms for the gun.

998
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:10,800
17, that's a pass.

999
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,360
The mouths inside of this,

1000
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:18,360
you've got multiple round mouths of teeth spinning around.

1001
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:21,240
It completely freezes up.

1002
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:22,880
I mean, it's exactly as you said,

1003
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:25,320
you go feet first down into this thing.

1004
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:33,800
Elsa, Jonah heads directly into the enormous xenonematode.

1005
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:37,680
Yee-haw.

1006
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:42,240
Yee-haw indeed, Clark Bishop,

1007
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:44,160
it would be one of your turns,

1008
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:47,200
but okay, with this turn,

1009
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:52,800
the legs that were up in the air fall down,

1010
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,720
like on the other side, like forward,

1011
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:01,520
and so his legs kind of go over where his head would be

1012
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:04,560
and then land on the ground, boots first.

1013
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:07,920
Planet Juggernaut, Europe.

1014
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:10,240
Planet Juggernaut is eerily still,

1015
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,480
and you hear worrying from inside of him.

1016
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:15,720
Oh shit, oh shit.

1017
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:17,960
The plan has begun.

1018
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:19,200
Wheel of forts, Jon.

1019
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,520
Jon wheel petty more.

1020
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:24,760
Have we skipped first Jon?

1021
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:29,000
Yes, sorry, we did.

1022
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,200
First Jon is a ball.

1023
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:31,440
Jon, you are a ball.

1024
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:35,400
You are inside the top half of Rosemary's body.

1025
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:36,240
What do you do?

1026
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:38,680
Jon starts reaching his tendrils out

1027
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:42,400
to the ball that's floating right above Rosemary's head,

1028
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,920
and I wanna start to try to merge with it.

1029
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:45,880
Roll a natural.

1030
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:50,240
94, fail.

1031
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:54,080
Pass, 68.

1032
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:58,360
Like magnets, different poles.

1033
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:00,880
You just bounce off this thing.

1034
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:05,880
You can't enter even within the six inches nearest to it.

1035
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:10,080
Something just like pulls you away, pulls you away.

1036
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:14,000
Cool idea, very, very intrigued by that idea.

1037
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,880
So Jon wheel petty more,

1038
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:20,360
you see a long lost member of your family.

1039
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:25,360
You haven't seen him in years, and he's running toward you.

1040
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:28,760
Jon points his gun at Uncle Don and screams,

1041
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:30,800
you stop right there, you son of a bitch.

1042
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,240
Not one step further.

1043
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:34,960
Don stops in his tracks, and he's like,

1044
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:37,200
you're gonna talk to your uncle like that, boy?

1045
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,280
What the fuck are you doing here, Uncle Don?

1046
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:41,360
Why are you pointing a goddamn gun at me?

1047
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:42,680
What is here?

1048
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:44,400
Where the fuck are we?

1049
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:49,400
Jon, I think that it's maybe too long of a story right now

1050
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:53,280
for all of this, and he like,

1051
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:57,120
what is the meme, gestures towards everything, like.

1052
00:52:57,120 --> 00:53:00,760
Jon looks over his shoulder and like looks at the nematodes,

1053
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,760
the Xena nematodes falling from the sky,

1054
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:06,040
and the giant kaijus.

1055
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:08,200
He nods to Don and he says,

1056
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:10,120
I reckon you might have a point,

1057
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:12,160
and he lowers his pistol.

1058
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:15,160
I think I brought you back here.

1059
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:18,320
There is a phone, I threw it in a bag at one point,

1060
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:20,880
and I thought it was supposed to help everything,

1061
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:23,280
maybe it was gonna heal stuff, I don't know,

1062
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:27,440
but I think you're here, maybe you can,

1063
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:30,320
maybe you're what I asked for.

1064
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:34,280
Maybe, I got brought here by a giant robot ball.

1065
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:36,080
That seems a lot more helpful,

1066
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:37,720
maybe that's what you asked for.

1067
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:40,600
Maybe the phone works in mysterious ways.

1068
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:47,320
The phone, is that like an old Hebrew name for the Lord?

1069
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:58,000
It's a phone, it's a phone, like an old time telephone.

1070
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:00,480
Uncle Don?

1071
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:01,920
Yeah boy, what?

1072
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:03,600
What do we do?

1073
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:06,920
I'm not sure, I came here,

1074
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:10,720
I was with you, but you were my brother,

1075
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:14,160
but you said you was ball, but now you're you.

1076
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:16,840
I don't know boy, I feel like I've lost my mind,

1077
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:21,760
I don't know what's happening, what's real, and what's not,

1078
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:24,920
but maybe you can help me, and I can,

1079
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,600
he gets completely lost in a train of thought

1080
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:30,200
that kind of goes nowhere.

1081
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:33,320
When he says that you're ball,

1082
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:37,000
this John has taken a moment to realize where he is

1083
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,720
and what's going on, and he sees the other balls,

1084
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:41,880
he sees Planet Juggernaut,

1085
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:44,360
some tendrils start poking out of his back,

1086
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:48,000
and one of them pats Uncle Don on the shoulder reassuringly.

1087
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:57,560
He freezes up at first.

1088
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:59,000
Yes, the metal is quite cool.

1089
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:05,640
Damn, were you always ball?

1090
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:08,640
Yes, I am a John of fortune.

1091
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:11,240
Pfft.

1092
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:44,720
What kind of world are you livin' in?

1093
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:53,400
What kind of world are you livin' in?

1094
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:15,400
What kind of world are you livin' in?

1095
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:23,680
What kind of world are you livin' in?
