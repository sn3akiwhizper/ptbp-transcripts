1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,320
Hello, my friends.

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:08,080
It's once again your fabulously ferocious furry friend, Wolf the Dog.

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,040
And I am your host with the most,

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,600
your hoist with the moist,

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,440
your greasy baby,

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,400
your large friend with the good hair.

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:26,080
And I'm talking at y'all live from sometime here at 694.2 PTBP,

8
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,680
wherever I am's best whatever this is.

9
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:34,480
This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Alchemy Yeti with Two T's,

10
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,080
who tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending pod.

11
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:41,680
Have you considered doing something similar, listener?

12
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,680
I liked it when Alchemy Yeti with Two T's did it.

13
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,560
Alchemy Yeti with Two T's writes,

14
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,360
Well, hello there, my dearest Wolf.

15
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,760
You can call me Alchemy Yeti.

16
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,600
Appreciate the howl.

17
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,720
How's the gourbage been treatin' ya?

18
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:02,800
Hopefully extra slimy for your eclectic tastes.

19
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:08,720
PTBP has been a favorite of ours ever since the trailer you fine boys put out.

20
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:15,200
We run various TTRPGs on my Twitch and YouTube with the wife,

21
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:21,520
and you've all been a wonderful inspiration to start up another mystery horror series.

22
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,200
Can't wait to ingest your future projects.

23
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,800
Wishin' you the spiciest and most fetid under grime, Yeti.

24
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,720
Well damn, thanks Yeti with the Two T's.

25
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,080
But uh, Twitch?

26
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,000
YouTube?

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,560
What about MeTube?

28
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,160
TTRPG?

29
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,000
Trash today's really pissin' good?

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,080
What else could that even mean?

31
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:52,000
You may speak in words that only bring confusion to me,

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,200
but I appreciate the kind words you said at me through the World Wide Web.

33
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:04,480
You truly seem to be a gourmand like myself, with only the finest tastes in trash.

34
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:09,760
If you wanna be like Yeti with the Two T's and write up somethin' for your wolf to howl,

35
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:12,320

36
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:17,280

37
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:23,840
If you wanna hear 30 bonus episodes, that's the $5 tier on Patreon.

38
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,440

40
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:39,840
And if you wanna watch a monthly livestream and play some Jackbox with the cast,

41
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,520
get your mitts on some shirts that kicketh ass,

42
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:48,560
or even play a gaming session homebrewed and GM'd by Zach,

43
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,360
alongside Joe, Luke, and Thomas, as your fellow players.

44
00:02:53,360 --> 00:03:00,000
Now that's all also available over at patreon.com slash pretending pod.

45
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,280
You know what they say.

46
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,520
The links are in the show notes.

47
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,680
Thanks to everyone who reached out with appreciation for last week's puns.

48
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,280
I hope you can also enjoy creative segues.

49
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,120
It's time for the news.

50
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:24,080
Last time, our intrepid hero smashed part of Cicero Mordaunt's new invention

51
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:30,000
in rages that ranged from dutiful to envious to cocaine fuel,

52
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,920
before Lafayette J. Honeycutt showed off his radical fucking jetpack.

53
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,600
And that certainly should've been the coolest thing in the episode.

54
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,600
But then, after finding a dead woman in the snow,

55
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,560
in a room upstairs with the window open,

56
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,560
Elden Ring reached out through the philanthropist's mind

57
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,680
to call out to the power he swore to help,

58
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,160
let himself be used as a vessel,

59
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:00,640
and psychic attack the top of Cicero Mordaunt's head off.

60
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,280
And now, using a word that encapsulates that scene,

61
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,080
it's Isabel Crane with Hollow.

62
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:19,840
I didn't know a body could be hollow before its blood ran cold

63
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:34,240
I didn't know that the wind could sew the tissue and ragged bone

64
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:42,240
You were hollow when you spoke to me

65
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,800
Hollow when you sang

66
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,880
I thought you might be starving

67
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:07,680
So I gave you everything

68
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,520
I feel like I'm presenting a children's show or something when I'm doing it.

69
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,400
You kinda are.

70
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,640
Yeah, you absolutely are.

71
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,600
That's how we promote the show.

72
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,040
Tell us the story, Scott!

73
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,720
It's an RPG show for kids.

74
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,800
Once upon a time, there was an inventor called Cicero Mordaunt,

75
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,360
and he made wonderful toys for all the boys and girls in the world.

76
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,400
What happened to his head?

77
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,280
He ended up a redhead at the end of the day.

78
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:41,920
Oh, man.

79
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,080
Yeah, Zach, you did something last episode.

80
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,600
Welcome to Pretending to Be People.

81
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,080
This is the fourth episode of The Thing You're Listening To.

82
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,360
Oh, yeah, Pretending to Be People.

83
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,000
I'm Zach.

84
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,080
I'm playing Elden Ring, and I did not kill anyone last episode.

85
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,160
Zach is not playing Elden Ring.

86
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,240
He doesn't play video games, but his character's name is Elden Ring.

87
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,760
Oh, that's why it's funny.

88
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,440
Like, I just thought it was a kick-ass name.

89
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,400
It is cool.

90
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,000
I've been hearing people saying it so often.

91
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,120
I thought I could use that.

92
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,080
I saw it on Twitter.

93
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,000
I thought it was a TikToker.

94
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,520
Luke, who are you playing?

95
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,320
I'm playing Checkers, a cult leader who talks like this.

96
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,680
He's only 19, and he is in the middle of climbing down some ladder rungs.

97
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,200
Is it going to be hard?

98
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,800
He passed it already, it seems like, so no.

99
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,680
All right, see you, Joe.

100
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,200
Yeah, I'm Harvey Brewer.

101
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:39,280
I'm a big, strong guy, but I hurt myself when I'm punching out a window upstairs up there.

102
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,200
After some difficulty, I made it down to the ground.

103
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:48,720
And my buddy here, my boss, he's an inventor,

104
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,840
and I just saw him take off in his new invention.

105
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,080
It's a sight to behold, I can tell you that much.

106
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,720
Well, and who knows where Lafayette J. Honeycutt is.

107
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,880
He was last seen flying off into the snowstorm with his jetpack.

108
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,560
Yeah, because there is no better time to test a prototype jetpack

109
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,280
than in a 50 or 60 mile per hour snowstorm.

110
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:17,920
Lafayette J. Honeycutt did not bring a prototype anything to upstage Cicero Mordent.

111
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,920
He brought a fully fleshed out.

112
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,840
Do you know how many Harveys died?

113
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,040
Do you know there's flesh on it?

114
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,840
How many Harveys crashed and burned in these things?

115
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,320
To get ready for this one?

116
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,460
Yeah.

117
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,080
Do you call it a jetpack, or do you have like a-

118
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,920
Do you call them all Harvey, or do they-

119
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,080
Do you think that my Harvey actually has tested this one,

120
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,320
and it's the one that worked, and that's why he's still with you?

121
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:42,720
Yeah.

122
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,840
Or have I not touched it yet?

123
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,480
No, you've tested it, and it could move your bulk around and everything.

124
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,480
He's like, this is the one.

125
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,880
Do you call it the jetpack, or do you have like a-

126
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,040
It's called the X1 right now, but-

127
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,040
It's not called the fuck you gravity.

128
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,400
It's a pretty cool name.

129
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,360
That is pretty cool.

130
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,440
This is my my fig.

131
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,460
FYG.

132
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:10,560
The fig X1.

133
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,120
Oh, that's it. I think that's who we are.

134
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:20,560
You probably are like binging all of these so you know what just happened,

135
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,680
but what just happened?

136
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,280
Okay, but I didn't kill anyone.

137
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,800
I, again-

138
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,080
You exploded his head.

139
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,360
Yeah, but again, because-

140
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,760
More manslaughter than murder because you didn't really want to do it.

141
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,960
How is it manslaughter?

142
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,760
A guy died because of him.

143
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,240
Exactly.

144
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,240
I was only a conduit, again.

145
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,840
That's like what you say like when you hit somebody with your car.

146
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,120
I was just a conduit.

147
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,280
Of the car's power.

148
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:58,240
It was just the thing working through me. It wasn't me.

149
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:58,740
Right.

150
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,040
My hands are clean.

151
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:08,240
It was an extreme instance of psychic croquet where you croquet a guy's head open.

152
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,160
You hit the ball a little too hard.

153
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,640
He is the ball in this, but he was hit. He's the implement of psychic croquet.

154
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:24,960
Scott, when the camera pans to Elden Ring, is he like covered in blood?

155
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,120
Oh, absolutely. Yeah, head to foot.

156
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,920
Well, not just blood, but cranial tissue and probably bits of skull as well.

157
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,680
I think we'll deal with the aftermath of that in a few moments.

158
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,120
Before then, I really want to catch up with Lafayette.

159
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:39,620
Me too.

160
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,420
Yes, I'm very intrigued.

161
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:47,060
I think we all would, but what if he just comes jetpacking through the window at the climax?

162
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:50,740
Oh no, you're not getting off that.

163
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,100
That's next episode.

164
00:09:55,060 --> 00:10:00,980
So Lafayette is hurtling through the air in this experimental jetpack

165
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,740
in high winds and no visibility.

166
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:08,340
You have no real idea where you're going.

167
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:13,860
Do you want to give me a luck roll to see where you end up?

168
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:19,460
Instead of that, I'm going to spend 10 luck with resourceful,

169
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:22,020
and the jetpack has a built-in compass.

170
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:27,460
You should say a parachute too, just in case.

171
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,900
The jetpack is also an inspector gadget everything.

172
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:32,040
He is.

173
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,620
Inspector jetpack.

174
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,300
10 luck spent very well.

175
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:41,700
No, there is a little cool, like he used some of Mordaunt's radon dental paste

176
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:45,780
to make a glow-in-the-dark little display for his compass,

177
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:49,380
and so he's looking at it on his wrist,

178
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:53,220
and he's like guiding the jetpack straight towards the house.

179
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,660
As David Bowie plays.

180
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,660
Rocket man!

181
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:01,940
What skill do you suppose you use to control a jetpack in high winds and no visibility?

182
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,660
It's almost like you're swimming in the air.

183
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,220
Do you have like a skill for weird science?

184
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:14,500
No, that's a talent, and I think it gave me 10 in mythos.

185
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,060
Okay, so can you use like mechanical engineering?

186
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:20,980
I would like to argue that, but I bet it would be more like pilot.

187
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:23,700
Yeah, I think pilot would be about right.

188
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,020
Oh nice, so you have a base of 1% in that.

189
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:29,860
Yeah, I'm hoping that you've put points there, or you're really lucky.

190
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,700
Seeing as how you built yourself a jetpack,

191
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,140
it'd be weird if you didn't have points there.

192
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,340
I'm trying to find it on the sheet.

193
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:40,340
I thought you were trying to take points off of other skills and put them into pilot.

194
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,780
No, I'm not doing that to drive auto.

195
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:46,660
What would never happen is that he thought of the jetpack

196
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,340
as we were sitting down to record this.

197
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:51,540
There's no way that there's not a chance.

198
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:58,420
That is of course not what happened, which is why I have 55 in pilot and nothing in drive auto.

199
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:02,100
Wait, no, sorry, that's a baseline 20 in drive auto.

200
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:05,700
I have 35 in pilot, just enough to make it spicy.

201
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,460
Love it. That's spicy as hell, baby.

202
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:10,100
Let's see how this goes.

203
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:10,660
62.

204
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,380
That's too much.

205
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:16,420
Are we still playing 69 as crit goodness?

206
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:16,920
Always.

207
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,140
But it wasn't 69.

208
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,260
Nope, it was 62.

209
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,620
I played on another podcast recently that did that.

210
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,460
I can't remember which one it was.

211
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:29,540
It was our Scott, you're with us now.

212
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:33,940
No, this was like in the last two months.

213
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,220
They probably got it from us.

214
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,900
It's not like a really easy thing to think of.

215
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:44,180
Wait, could he gain seven luck and make his roll a 69?

216
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,540
That's the face of a yes.

217
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,260
That would put me at 29 luck.

218
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,220
No, you said Dane.

219
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:58,500
Yeah, you would gain seven because to add to your score.

220
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,180
Because you went up on the skill.

221
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,500
Right, because you want to add to the roll.

222
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,180
Right, to make it a 69.

223
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:07,380
So I gained seven luck and I make it a 69.

224
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:09,860
So we do that, Scott.

225
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:10,360
We do that.

226
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:13,060
Can I just cut all this short and say no?

227
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,860
You can lick whatever you want, but...

228
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,300
He let us lick.

229
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,580
The world had realistic consequences for it.

230
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,340
We got pretty lucky.

231
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:32,580
So yes, there you are barreling through the air in your jet pack,

232
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,820
unable to see where you're going.

233
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:39,060
You're getting thrown around by the winds.

234
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:42,020
It's almost completely uncontrollable at the moment.

235
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:47,780
But you are at least navigating in roughly the right direction.

236
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:54,500
But at the moment, it does look like your options are going to be limited

237
00:13:54,500 --> 00:14:00,100
to trying to maybe land somewhere on the building.

238
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:03,860
But there's a good chance you'll just smack into the wall if you do that,

239
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,580
rather than, say, break through a window.

240
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:09,300
Because there is fundamentally a lot more wall than window.

241
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:13,060
Or you might be able to ditch the snowdrift if you're lucky

242
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,580
and you can find one deep enough.

243
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:17,620
You did say, since we had walked out to that tower,

244
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:18,820
a few feet had fallen, right?

245
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:21,460
Checkers was no longer able to see our footprints.

246
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:26,340
Was I knee-high in snow, walking out there?

247
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,780
Yeah, it was pretty much that.

248
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,700
And it's probably got deeper since then.

249
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,540
Keep in mind, I have a size 40.

250
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:37,060
On the other hand, you do know that there are quite a lot of cars parked outside.

251
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:39,700
So if you just plummeted in the wrong place,

252
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:43,380
you might end up having a rather hard landing.

253
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,740
Then here's what I'd like to do.

254
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:50,100
I would like to look for the tallest, fluffiest pine tree around here.

255
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,860
Presumably it's got, you know...

256
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:54,580
Oh, Montpelier pines are so fluffy.

257
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,100
They're so fluffy.

258
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,260
Especially when they're snow covered.

259
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:58,760
Exactly.

260
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:02,100
And I just kind of want to hug that bad boy.

261
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,820
I just want to like, I'm going to turn the engine off

262
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:10,660
and drift into a tree and try to hug it down.

263
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:14,340
That word drift is doing an awful lot of heavy lifting.

264
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:21,780
Because fundamentally, you're switching off the one thing that is keeping you up in the air.

265
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:24,660
And yeah, there are high winds.

266
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:29,940
Well, I see Scott, I didn't succeed in a pilot role when I tried to control it.

267
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:32,180
So I thought, what if I just don't?

268
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,260
Uncontrol it.

269
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:39,220
What we're hoping for here is like a Buzz Lightyear situation where he's not flying,

270
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,260
but falling with grace, or style.

271
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:46,900
I think this still comes down to a pushed piloting role here.

272
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:47,400
Awesome.

273
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:54,420
I mean, you know, if you succeed on this, you're going to land in your tree as you want.

274
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:57,060
If not, you're going to land somewhere else.

275
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,500
Fair enough.

276
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,780
How does pushed roles work?

277
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:03,460
You just roll it again on pilot.

278
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,460
And you can't spend luck on this.

279
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:07,380
Sixteen.

280
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:08,520
Yes!

281
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,020
Oh my God.

282
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:17,620
Starman, waiting in the sky.

283
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:29,380
As Lafayette glides gently into the tree and softly hugs it on the way down,

284
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:32,900
he just thinks about his kick-ass jetpack and he says,

285
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,700
this is going to blow Cicero's mind.

286
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:45,700
So yes, I mean, the way that this has ended up is you've managed to grab hold of a branch

287
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:50,900
sticking out from a fairly large pine tree and you've shaken all the snow off it.

288
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:54,420
And it is bending nicely and easing you down a bit.

289
00:16:55,140 --> 00:17:01,300
You can see that you're still a bit off the ground, but there is the roof of one of the

290
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:04,980
outbuildings that you might be able to drop onto as an intermediate point.

291
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:07,460
He says, tonight I will play the Santa Claus.

292
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:11,780
And he lands on the roof.

293
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:12,980
And he yells, parkour!

294
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,740
You utilized that last branch.

295
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:21,460
So you land on there and immediately send a flurry of snow falling off the roof.

296
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:24,340
You slide down a bit on some of the tiles.

297
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:28,580
It's not too heavily sloped and managed to just catch yourself in the guttering.

298
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:33,860
And that's the point at which you realize that you're not alone on the roof.

299
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,580
The flying pig!

300
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:46,020
There is something you can just make out this shape through the snow, this twisted dark

301
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:52,180
thing that you can just catch glimpses of it every now and then as the wind shifts,

302
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:54,260
but it's moving.

303
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,540
It's scuttling.

304
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:56,180
That's the word.

305
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:59,060
It's scuttling across the roof.

306
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:03,780
And you can see that it is leaving a trail of blood behind it in the snow.

307
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:09,220
And then it stops for a moment as you hit the guttering.

308
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,700
And at that point it seems to have noticed you.

309
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,580
And it is now scuttling in your direction.

310
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:17,220
Is this the building that everybody, all the...

311
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:18,420
The potty?

312
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,820
Yeah, is this a chauffeur party building?

313
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:21,940
It probably is.

314
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:23,860
You'd guess, maybe.

315
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:27,220
Someone outside yells, this is a great chauffeur party building!

316
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:28,740
I just...

317
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:32,500
Lafayette is terrified.

318
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,660
And he lets go of the gutter.

319
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,860
He just wants to drop and get away from this thing.

320
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:41,060
And he wants to then run into the chauffeur's party.

321
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:46,820
First thing, let's have a sand roll as you see this thing scuttling towards you.

322
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:53,700
His head looks all wrong and it looks like it's pulsating there in the gloom.

323
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:58,260
There's there's crenellations and ridges all over his head that are just throbbing.

324
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:01,940
And things sticking out, sharp things.

325
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,860
He hates it.

326
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:07,620
He is not down with this, but he passes his sand roll.

327
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:12,820
And he's like, I'm sorry to drop out so soon, old chap.

328
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:15,700
But well, and then he lets go.

329
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:18,100
Okay, give me a jump roll to have a graceful landing.

330
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,980
I don't think I have much of that.

331
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,940
Oh, that is a base plan.

332
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:24,500
What, 20?

333
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,380
Oh, 100.

334
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:29,140
Wait, what is zero, zero, zero, zero?

335
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,100
That's a hundred.

336
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:30,820
Oh my God.

337
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:32,100
That's a hundred.

338
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,140
So I think, so I think what happens.

339
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,140
Your bones go into your brain and you're dead.

340
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:44,580
You try to leap off the roof, but the cuff of your trousers gets caught in the guttering.

341
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:48,180
And you leap off and suddenly, I mean, you're there hanging by one leg,

342
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:51,140
swinging backwards and forwards like a screaming pendulum

343
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:55,860
as this thing scuttles across the roof towards you and looks down at you.

344
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,380
We'll come back to you in a moment.

345
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,820
Oh my God.

346
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:07,140
I will say the moment you said scuttles, I got goosebumps.

347
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:11,060
I wonder if that thing has too many legs.

348
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,900
That thing has two legs.

349
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,540
I wish it had none.

350
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:29,700
So, meanwhile, Checkers and Harvey had just finished climbing down the slippery,

351
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:36,020
now slightly blood splattered ladder and made it down to, I guess, the comparative safety

352
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:36,580
of the ground.

353
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:41,700
Yeah, as we get into the ground, I get down there and then I help Harvey down the last

354
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:47,540
few steps and I've got like quite a bit of blood on my face from it dripping down from you.

355
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:48,920
Yeah.

356
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:53,220
And your boss flew off.

357
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,180
Did you see which way he went?

358
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:56,100
We've got to catch up to him.

359
00:20:56,100 --> 00:21:02,820
Would the light from, I feel like maybe the completely engulfed in flames tower light

360
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:09,140
have like illuminate the area enough for us to look around and see?

361
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:13,620
The way the buildings are laid out, he's on the other side at the moment.

362
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,460
So you wouldn't be able to see him from where you are.

363
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:18,980
But if you start moving up towards the main building, you could probably see him fairly

364
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:19,700
easily.

365
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:26,340
I think when I was climbing down, I think I saw him fly off that way towards the buildings.

366
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,340
Then let's head that direction then.

367
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:30,100
We got to catch up with the boss.

368
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,220
How's your arm?

369
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:33,860
Can we try to maybe fix that?

370
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,380
It's bleeding pretty bad.

371
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:40,180
I tore my sleeve off here and I put it down there on the last little accent.

372
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:41,620
Put it down there.

373
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:44,340
I put it on the cut.

374
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,420
I'm going to try to do a first aid on him.

375
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:53,220
In addition to the first aid, I'm going to use my resourceful talent to have some antiseptic

376
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,580
and bandages on me.

377
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:54,900
Okay.

378
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,500
So spend the 10 points of luck.

379
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,220
Okay.

380
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,740
That puts me at 22.

381
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:02,020
So okay.

382
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,540
Someone's not getting out of this alive.

383
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,140
35 on a 50 first aid.

384
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,820
So yeah, you managed to patch that up.

385
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:14,500
You are helped as well by the comparatively bright light of the burning tower above your

386
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:14,740
head.

387
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:16,180
Perfect.

388
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:23,380
However, there is this nasty cracking creaking sound from the burning timbers above you.

389
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:30,020
And there are little bits of burning debris that are beginning to fall down like Satan's

390
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,140
own hell stones.

391
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:37,780
I pour the like hydrogen peroxide or rubbing alcohol that I have on you.

392
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:42,660
I bandage your arm up and then I like tenderly like put my hands around your arm and I look

393
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:46,740
at you and say, you can take the last branch for that.

394
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,180
Now let's run.

395
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:49,860
I owe you one, buddy.

396
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,540
That feels so much better.

397
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,580
What was that voice?

398
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:53,540
Oh shit.

399
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:55,620
I owe you one, buddy.

400
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:57,140
That feels so much better.

401
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,060
He's just excited.

402
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:00,020
I owe you one, buddy.

403
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,220
It's so much better feeling now.

404
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:01,620
Thanks.

405
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:02,660
Fuck.

406
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:05,700
Just remember, uh, the last branch helped you.

407
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,660
Now let's run that way and hope that we don't get crushed.

408
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:12,740
Yeah, we're taking off running and I I'm kind of trusting him at this point to just know

409
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,420
where, what he's doing to get out of there.

410
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:14,580
Yeah.

411
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:20,900
I mean, running might be an overstatement for how you're going to try not to fall down.

412
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:26,820
But yeah, you, you Trump your way through the snow and there are larger and larger bits

413
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:30,580
falling off the burning tower now smacking into the snow around you.

414
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:37,780
And as you make your way into the courtyard, the courtyard, I'll tell you what, give me

415
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:38,100
a spot.

416
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:38,660
Hit and roll.

417
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:39,780
Both of us.

418
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:40,900
Yeah.

419
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:42,900
Fuck.

420
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,380
I got an 84 on a 70.

421
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,980
I got a 78 on a 40.

422
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:54,420
Then yeah, you, you, you obliviously walk past the house where the party's going on

423
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:56,580
and just miss the swinging form of Lafayette.

424
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:58,580
Holy shit.

425
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:06,980
I was really counting on that.

426
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,580
It's a snow whip around.

427
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:14,500
As they like run out of the area, like where they would be smashed by the tower, Checkers

428
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:18,740
turns around and is just kind of like walking backwards through the snow, like looking at

429
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:21,700
the tower as it's like collapsing on itself.

430
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:26,180
So oblivious, pretty good distraction, oblivious to everything else around him.

431
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:31,220
Well, and so obviously from that angle, my silhouette would be perfectly illuminated

432
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:31,860
as he turns around.

433
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:35,220
I was about to say, if you want to use that as the basis for a pushed.

434
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,540
Yes, I do want to use that as a basis for a push.

435
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:42,500
And that is a 51 on a 40.

436
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,940
Can we both push it?

437
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,860
Can I push it for the same reason too, right?

438
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:47,540
Did Harvey look at all?

439
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:53,220
Why not be hilarious to have you both fail at the same time?

440
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:56,180
I pass my 25 on a 70.

441
00:24:56,180 --> 00:25:02,740
Just through the shrill, like shriek of the wind, you hear like, Harvey, Harvey.

442
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:06,820
And like a dog hearing its name, I shoot my head around, pointed right at it.

443
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:10,740
Well, I was about to say, you see a few different things.

444
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:14,980
So, you know, I mean, they're in the light from the burning tower and also from the light

445
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:19,940
coming out of the house where, or the outbuilding rather, where the chauffeurs were having their

446
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:20,660
little party.

447
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:27,700
You can just see the outline of Lafayette in his jet pack, swinging backwards and forwards

448
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:28,820
by one leg.

449
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:35,380
There is something above him, but you can also see through the windows of the house

450
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:36,180
behind him.

451
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:41,300
You can see blood sprayed all over the windows.

452
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:49,140
And yeah, I mean, that's the point at which you cat's eye to the thing that is scuttling

453
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:51,380
down over Lafayette.

454
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:53,220
Do you want to give me a sand roll for all this?

455
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:01,060
That's a super duper pass, a three on a 60.

456
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:03,300
Okay, so you don't lose any sand for that.

457
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:10,420
So you're in a position to act, but Checkers, having failed that push, I think you're standing

458
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:15,140
there as well, looking back at this tower and it's beautiful, isn't it?

459
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:17,620
Just the way the fire is burning there.

460
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:22,340
Steam is coming off of it as the snow falls down into the fire.

461
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:24,340
Oh, it's gorgeous.

462
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:26,900
I mean, it's almost transfixing, isn't it?

463
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:32,100
And it's really easy to stand there just for that moment too long as some of the larger

464
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,500
timbers start falling down in your direction.

465
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:34,740
Right.

466
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:38,660
And it's almost as if every single one of my senses is focused on this.

467
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:42,180
The only thing I can hear is the crackling of the fire in the wood.

468
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:46,420
The only thing I can see is the beauty of the tower on fire.

469
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:51,460
I stick my tongue out and snow falls on it and I'm like, that tastes cold.

470
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,700
But what I'm looking at is hot.

471
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:59,940
And I feel the warmth from the fire as it radiates off the tower.

472
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:05,140
But the tower at this stage and the strong winds is rocking backwards and forwards.

473
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:11,460
And as you stand there looking at it, you can see it's moving and it's toppling and

474
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:15,620
it's toppling and Jesus Christ, it's coming straight for you.

475
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,620
Oh my God.

476
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:20,260
Is it going to hit the creature?

477
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:25,140
What is my sense of like, if I didn't move right now, would it fall right on me?

478
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,100
I mean, if you want to stand there, we try to work it out.

479
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:34,260
You did fail a push-draw, right?

480
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:38,980
I'm going to say that I'm pretty freaking transfixed on this thing and it's hard to

481
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:40,660
move around in this snow, so.

482
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:43,540
All right, so you're not going to try to dodge out of the way.

483
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:44,980
You're just going to stand there and let it hit you.

484
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:50,580
I'm going to continue moving backwards at the same pace I was, but there's like no

485
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:53,380
sense of urgency in my movements.

486
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,580
So you're not trying to dodge it?

487
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:55,620
No.

488
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:59,460
Yeah, really make a point about how you're not trying to dodge the huge tower coming

489
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:02,020
down on you when you don't have enough luck to stay alive.

490
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:04,500
Yeah, maybe without all your luck, it'll still Buster King you.

491
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:08,740
Maybe once it gets close to me, it might snap me out of my way.

492
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:10,260
Oh yeah, maybe you should dodge.

493
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:14,340
From the point it starts falling, there isn't going to be a hell of a lot of time before

494
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:15,700
it's actually on you.

495
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:16,420
How about this?

496
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:18,820
Yeah, I won't dodge because I just failed my dodge roll.

497
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:21,800
Okay.

498
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,740
So yeah, no attempt made.

499
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:25,460
By how much?

500
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,220
51 out of 25.

501
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:29,060
Oh fuck.

502
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:29,780
I could.

503
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:31,060
Yeah, spend it all.

504
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:32,020
Or could I push?

505
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:33,700
But then I might die.

506
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:38,820
Yeah, you can't really push this because this is a, you know, it's not an action you

507
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:39,940
can really retry.

508
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:42,900
Um, do I have enough luck to, I don't think I do.

509
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:45,220
Uh, 22.

510
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:46,100
22.

511
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,500
You failed by 26.

512
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,380
So now I can't.

513
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:49,880
Yeah.

514
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:56,980
Okay, well then these burning timbers just start crashing all around you.

515
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:03,060
The structure atop the tower falls off to one side and explodes in a shower of sparks.

516
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,980
The timbers though are falling hard and heavy around you.

517
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:11,380
And one of them does hit you because you don't manage to get out of the way.

518
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,620
And you take.

519
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,020
Oh, that face.

520
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,620
My health plus five damage.

521
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:23,460
You take, you take 11 hit points of damage.

522
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:30,260
Or wax into you and, and it drives you into the snow drift.

523
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:34,660
You are simultaneously freezing and burning at the same time.

524
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:42,980
Oh, that drops me down considerably, but I'm not stunned or anything.

525
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,540
Is it more than half your hit points?

526
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:49,700
Almost very almost 23 or 24.

527
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:52,100
I had 24 and that was 11 damage, right?

528
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:53,300
Okay.

529
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:53,860
Okay.

530
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:56,580
So yeah, I'm down to 13.

531
00:29:56,580 --> 00:30:01,620
But you are at least partially pinned under this burning timber.

532
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:04,020
So it's like a huge plank of wood.

533
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:09,940
Basically, yeah, one of the, one of the struts that was supporting the tower is broken up

534
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:14,500
into pieces because of the fire, but this is a fairly big pole or whatever that, that

535
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,300
has landed on you.

536
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:20,020
I mean, the good news is that you have a very strong man.

537
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:25,700
The bad news is I think he might be preoccupied.

538
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,900
Well, what I want to do if I'm able to.

539
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:30,820
Harvey!

540
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:32,260
Fuck it.

541
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,140
Harvey!

542
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:33,620
Harvey!

543
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:34,100
Help me!

544
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:39,700
And I'm assuming Lafayette shouting pretty much the same thing at the same time.

545
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:43,140
Can I do like a charm roll to charm Harvey into helping me?

546
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:50,420
I want to do a fast talk roll to talk faster and get more Harveys out.

547
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:50,580
Okay.

548
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:53,460
I'm going to, can I charm his fast talk?

549
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:57,140
Do you want to make an opposed roll to see which one of you is making the more compelling

550
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:57,460
arc?

551
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:57,620
Yeah.

552
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:01,620
68 on an 80 fast talk.

553
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:05,380
Ooh, you win 25 on a, on an 80.

554
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:05,780
Harvey!

555
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:06,100
Harvey!

556
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:06,500
Harvey!

557
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,860
I'm asking you very quickly.

558
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:08,660
I think he wins.

559
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:09,060
Yeah.

560
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:09,940
Oh wait, this is lower?

561
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:10,180
Yeah.

562
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:10,580
Yeah.

563
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:11,780
Lower is good in this game.

564
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:12,900
Oh, it's good in this game.

565
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:15,460
It's the hard success versus just a regular success.

566
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:16,660
Then, uh, fuck that.

567
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:20,180
I mean, I mean, I mean, it is still obviously, yeah.

568
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:22,980
Up to you, Harvey, which one do you follow?

569
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:28,340
But it certainly sounds like from, from the cries that are reaching you, it sounds like

570
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:29,780
checkers is far more in need.

571
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:31,060
Harvey, look at your arm!

572
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:35,060
And help me!

573
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:40,580
How far off the ground is Lafayette compared to us?

574
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:46,260
He's probably only about five or six feet off the ground, but it's just, it's just the

575
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:52,980
fact that he's hanging by an ankle while this creature is starting to crawl over him.

576
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:53,540
Oh shit.

577
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:57,380
If he's that close to the ground, I think Harvey's instinct would be to help his boss

578
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:01,460
by trying to just grab his ankle and pull it off the scaffolding.

579
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:04,900
Do you at least give like a caring look toward...

580
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:05,700
Well, that's what I'm saying.

581
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,140
I didn't realize he was that close to the ground.

582
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,500
I think I can try and do both.

583
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:12,740
I mean, you could do both if they weren't like 20 feet apart.

584
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:17,380
It's just moving backwards and forwards between them through the heavy snow is going to take

585
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:18,500
such a long time.

586
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,100
You can't help both of them.

587
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,380
Harvey, your arm!

588
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:22,100
I helped you!

589
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:23,220
Help me!

590
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:28,180
And if he's that far away, I'm going to, I'm going to, I think, turn to the guy who's yelling

591
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:33,140
at me closest to me right now and I'm going to, I want to rip the other sleeve off of

592
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:40,660
my other arm and I want to create like oven mitts now that I've got a fiery thing I got

593
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:43,140
to pull off a guy and yeah, I want to try and move it off of him.

594
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:45,540
And you're going to try to lift this large burning...

595
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:49,780
Could I like roll to help him by like pushing...

596
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:50,820
You certainly can.

597
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:54,740
Yeah, I mean, if you give me a strength roll and if it's a pass, you can give them a, it

598
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,740
will take the difficulty level down by one.

599
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:57,220
Cool.

600
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:57,540
Okay.

601
00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:01,540
I got a 25 on a 60 for my strength roll.

602
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:05,140
So that's going to be a straight strength roll for Harvey.

603
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:05,780
No!

604
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:06,980
I, uh, I fail it.

605
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:08,260
It's a 97 on a 90.

606
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:10,980
So I'm going to use seven luck to just make it a success.

607
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:11,300
Nice.

608
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,980
Oh, thank goodness.

609
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:17,460
So yeah, you managed to, I mean, luckily using your, your oven mitts, you managed to avoid

610
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,980
burning your hands too much.

611
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:20,980
And yeah, it's, I mean, it's difficult at first.

612
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:23,380
This is a really big, heavy timber.

613
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:25,060
And I mean, it's on fire.

614
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:27,300
It doesn't open up at all.

615
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:31,780
But somehow, yeah, you put in almost a superhuman amount of strength.

616
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:32,740
Yeah.

617
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:35,780
I mean, it's obviously down to the great first aid that checkers gave you.

618
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:39,060
You wouldn't have stood a chance.

619
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:39,940
Yeah.

620
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:43,380
So like we were, as I'm like pushing up and he's lifting up.

621
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:44,660
Come on buddy, push!

622
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:45,780
Push with all your might!

623
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:50,340
I'm barely able to, like with the, the snow is melting underneath the fire.

624
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:55,220
It's melted just enough that I can slide right out and we drop the, drop the log.

625
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,340
And, and, and will you drop your log?

626
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:01,460
Let's, let's go to Lafayette and see whether you still have a boss.

627
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:04,180
Yeah.

628
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:06,340
Well, Lafayette doesn't know if he still has a Harvey.

629
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:10,340
He sees him go to help him and he's like, he's almost as pissed as he was at Morden.

630
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:12,260
You can have my guy.

631
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:13,220
We'll just switch guys.

632
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:20,500
I've lost three of my best friends recently and I'm looking for a new master.

633
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:23,220
Your guy is weird.

634
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,180
The old guy is weird.

635
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:27,860
Okay.

636
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:28,740
Yeah.

637
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:35,940
I mean, there you are swinging by your, your trouser calf off this, uh, off this gutter.

638
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:42,740
And this creature now has, has crawled down and is beginning to move its way down your body.

639
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:49,620
You can see his hideous misshapen head pulsing in the light that's coming from the windows

640
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:50,900
and from the burning structure.

641
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:55,220
Lafayette ignites the jet pack and tries to push off.

642
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:58,900
And he hopes that breaks the thread on his trousers.

643
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:02,180
So are you, if you're hanging upside down, there's a chance that this,

644
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:04,180
no, I'm going to try to push off as I do it.

645
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:07,780
But I thought you were trying to burn the creature sideways.

646
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:08,280
Oh yeah.

647
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:12,500
I think there's many things that can be happening all at once here.

648
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:15,700
Well, do you want to give me a piloting role then?

649
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:18,020
I think if it's a regular success, you're pushing away.

650
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:20,420
And if it's a hard success, you can try igniting the creature.

651
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:21,140
Oh, piloting.

652
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:21,380
Yeah.

653
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:22,660
I have a 55 in that.

654
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:28,660
So it was, it was, it was, it was 35, 35, 35, two, two.

655
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:29,460
You rolled a two.

656
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,020
I rolled a two.

657
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:33,780
Oh my God.

658
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:35,540
Extreme success.

659
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:38,420
Like a jet pack fart in the face.

660
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:43,940
And as you're pushing off and taking off, it seems to be trying to take off after you,

661
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:48,660
but yeah, your jet catches it straight on and you can see fire engulf it.

662
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:53,060
And yeah, just a sizzling sound as it falls down to the snow and twitches there.

663
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,140
Happy new year chap.

664
00:35:57,140 --> 00:36:01,940
And I do a flip in the air and land next to Harvey and checkers.

665
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:04,180
Fuck yes.

666
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:09,140
And I think that's a good point to cut back to Mr. Ring.

667
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:12,180
Hello, bright light in the, in the wardrobe.

668
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:18,100
I, I've lost three of my best friends recently and I'm looking for a new master.

669
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:23,140
I think along with the three of your best friends, let's see whether you've lost any

670
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:28,340
San for all this, because this is a lot that's going on at the moment.

671
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:29,460
It's a lot.

672
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:30,660
54 on a 90.

673
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:31,700
Okay.

674
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:33,540
You still lose one point of San.

675
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:34,100
Okay.

676
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,940
Cause he accidentally popped ahead.

677
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:41,620
So we got to, he croquered ahead.

678
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:46,580
I do want to luck roll as well, just to see whether you've been injured by any of the

679
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:48,340
bits of flying cranium.

680
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:49,220
Oh, that's a fail.

681
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:49,780
93.

682
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:51,380
Okay.

683
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:53,300
He created a frag grenade skull.

684
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:58,740
Think of the infection you're going to get from that.

685
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:00,740
That's three points of damage.

686
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:04,740
So yeah, I mean, you can feel a sting in your, your cheek.

687
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:09,460
And, and as, as you reach up, you can feel that there's something hard stuck in your

688
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:09,940
cheek.

689
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:16,260
My beautiful face has been tainted forever by me being the psychic conduit for the, the

690
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:20,420
cattywampus game of a croquet that's been played through my mind.

691
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:27,460
And yeah, I mean, if you, if you pull this, this loose, you can see that it's a bit of

692
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:30,180
a high socket and there's, there's a bit of a high in it as well.

693
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:32,660
Oh my God.

694
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:34,020
Embedded into your face.

695
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,540
Now you've got an actual third eye.

696
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:36,260
So it works out.

697
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:44,980
The physical realm, the physical realm is not nothing in the physical, nothing in the

698
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:46,260
physical realm can hurt me.

699
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:51,380
Margaret Payne has liked it at this stage.

700
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:56,420
And how many legs, how many legs did she do it?

701
00:37:56,420 --> 00:38:04,420
You can hear this buzzing from inside the wardrobe, or at least very deep inside the

702
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:08,020
wardrobe, it sounds like, which again just goes, release me.

703
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:10,900
How would I do that, my new friend?

704
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:14,900
I mean, there's, there's no direct response to that.

705
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:20,180
Yeah, well, you get the impression from the acoustics that that voice is coming from

706
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:21,540
quite some distance away.

707
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:25,060
The powers that possess the world help those who help themselves.

708
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:30,580
All right, well, I will be on my way then.

709
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:32,500
Bright light in the wardrobe.

710
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:32,980
Really?

711
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:33,940
You're not going to do it?

712
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:35,060
Do what?

713
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:36,660
Open the wardrobe?

714
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:38,580
It is already open.

715
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:39,540
The wardrobe's open.

716
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:41,540
I mean, you can already see the light coming out of it.

717
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:41,860
Yeah.

718
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:46,820
I'm not, I don't feel, it did not tell me to step into it nor reach into it nor throw

719
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:48,100
any body into it.

720
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,540
So what if Narnia is back there?

721
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:49,780
Yeah.

722
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:53,060
Grew up, Christian.

723
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:53,460
You love that.

724
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:59,140
All right, so did Elden Ring, actually.

725
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:01,300
He's a PK from Kentucky.

726
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,260
A preacher's kid?

727
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:05,540
Yeah, he's a preacher's kid from Kentucky.

728
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:07,060
Is that what you say on the boards?

729
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:11,220
Yeah, when we're talking about all of our religious trauma.

730
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:17,460
So, so does that mean you're not investigating the wardrobe or you are?

731
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:21,140
Well, I'd like to if, if it would give me any sort of direction.

732
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:23,700
I am one who follows direction well.

733
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:27,700
You can hear when the voice is coming from somewhere deep within the wardrobe.

734
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:30,260
Are you there, my dear master, sir?

735
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:33,140
Are you saying that in the conversational tone or are you shouting?

736
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:38,740
He's reaching his head towards the light to kind of like poke its head in to say it.

737
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:42,020
Yeah, I mean, I mean, as you look into the water, go into the water, you can see that

738
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:48,180
what it is is there's a false door or secret door in the back of it that seems to go to

739
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:50,180
a staircase that's leading down.

740
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:56,980
I'm no lion as I am not strong in physical strength, but I can be a witch.

741
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:59,940
And he walks into the wardrobe.

742
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:02,900
C.S. Lewis.

743
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,940
There are these wooden steps leading down.

744
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:10,260
There's a fair bit of light coming from down below and you can hear this.

745
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:13,140
Oh, it's my voice breaking up again.

746
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:14,260
I just got good.

747
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:16,820
I'm just like getting fucked, man.

748
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:19,700
I'm just like ready for it.

749
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:22,260
I'll say that again to make it easier for you to edit.

750
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:22,980
Appreciate you.

751
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:24,100
Yeah, you head down.

752
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:26,660
There's a set of wooden stairs that are going down.

753
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:30,740
There's brick lined walls and you can see light coming from down below.

754
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:34,740
And there's this rattling sound as well, sound like metal rattling.

755
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:41,220
And this this buzzing voice again saying, Releasing.

756
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:42,500
Yes, OK, I hear you.

757
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:43,540
Calm down.

758
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:44,260
I'm so sorry.

759
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:48,340
You seem very perturbed by this whole situation.

760
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:49,940
May I ask you a few questions?

761
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:50,980
Who is that?

762
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:53,060
That is that is not Mordant.

763
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:54,740
Who are you?

764
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:56,660
No, we destroyed Mordant together.

765
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:01,620
There's a pause there.

766
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:03,300
Mordant is dead?

767
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:04,260
Well, yes, of course.

768
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:07,860
Through the power invested in me from you.

769
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:09,220
Good.

770
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:11,940
Then you must release me.

771
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:12,580
Yeah, all right.

772
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:15,540
Okie dokie.

773
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:16,180
Yeah, sure.

774
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:23,620
OK, and as you make your way to the bottom of the stairs, you can see that it opens up

775
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:30,500
into what looks like a laboratory or a workshop of some kind, that there are workbenches

776
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:35,700
with all sorts of strange equipment and kind of half-finished devices, inventions.

777
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:37,220
You know, you're not quite sure.

778
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:43,300
There's a big freestanding, what looks like electrical loom that's got all sorts of

779
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,580
strange wiring on it.

780
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:52,260
But the thing that attracts your attention the most is in the center of the room, you

781
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:57,540
bolted to the floor is something that looks almost like a medieval torture device made

782
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:58,500
of black iron.

783
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:03,140
And there is something that is bolted within it.

784
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:13,460
This strange, twisted, insectile-like thing, it has too many legs and it has claws and

785
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:18,980
pincers and things sticking out of its head and its head is pulsating.

786
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:20,340
You can't see any eyes.

787
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:23,460
You can't even really see anything you can identify as a mouth.

788
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:28,340
Do you want to give me a SAN roll?

789
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:28,840
Yeah.

790
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:30,060
I do.

791
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:34,440
That's 11 on an 89.

792
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:35,160
Yes, yeah.

793
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,840
Somehow you're taking this in your stride.

794
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,560
Okay, all right.

795
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:45,320
Hello there, future bug master and overlord, perhaps.

796
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,560
I have a question for you.

797
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:56,440
I'm a very passionate voter and so I would like to know what platforms you are interested

798
00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:02,360
in paying attention to if you are going to take over humanity, which is just an assumption

799
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:04,120
is my thought of your goal.

800
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:07,640
I have no interest in taking over your pitiful species.

801
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:11,560
Release me now and you shall be spared it.

802
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:16,360
So does that involve the killing of the rest of the people like me?

803
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,600
Only those who get in my way.

804
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,200
And what is the end goal?

805
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,360
My goal is to be released.

806
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:24,600
Well, sure, for now that's short term.

807
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:26,600
What is your long term goal, please, mister?

808
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:35,320
There is this long pause as it is trying to process what the fuck you're saying.

809
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:39,640
It's rattling this iron cage that it's stuck in.

810
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:43,720
The other thing you can see now that you're a bit closer in talking to this is that it

811
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:45,720
looks really badly hurt.

812
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:48,120
A few of its limbs seem to be broken.

813
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:50,360
There are wounds all over its carapace.

814
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:53,960
It looks like it has wings, but the wings look damaged.

815
00:43:54,440 --> 00:44:02,680
But the worst of all is, yeah, this sort of brainy looking head that it's got covered

816
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:07,480
in crenellations has got holes in it.

817
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:10,440
It looks like holes have been drilled into its head.

818
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:16,600
And you can see crusted around some of the holes, this sort of yellowish pus.

819
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:18,520
Oh, my God.

820
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:23,000
Hey, I was just wondering, you seem to be in pretty bad shape.

821
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,480
Do you think that that would make you any less...

822
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:27,640
Psychic attack, psychic attack, psychic attack!

823
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:34,360
You can try to psychic attack it by your means.

824
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:37,880
Oh, fucking shit.

825
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:39,560
71 on a 90.

826
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:40,600
Normal success.

827
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:43,400
Oh, yeah, that's an extreme success on this path.

828
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:48,520
So what happens if your opponent bests you?

829
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:49,560
Sorry?

830
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:52,760
So what happens if your opponent bests you at this contest?

831
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:59,960
Psychic powers, psychic attack, allowing heroes to use psychic attack.

832
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:02,920
Is this a monster or a mythos monster?

833
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:04,760
It's a mythos monster.

834
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:07,560
Psychic attacks do not work on mythos monsters.

835
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:17,960
So not only have you failed on basic terms, but they wouldn't have worked even if you

836
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:18,680
succeeded.

837
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:23,960
The minds of mythos monsters are so alien that to connect with them is to risk losing

838
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:25,640
one's own mind.

839
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:30,840
A human attempting to psychically attack a mythos monster must immediately make a sanity

840
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:35,720
roll, taking the standard sanity loss as described in the monster's profile.

841
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:40,120
So it means that you could take the same sanity roll twice for seeing them and then trying

842
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:40,680
to connection.

843
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:49,400
Then you get all these impressions as you dig into its mind of just darkness and these

844
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:57,480
strange alien minds and moving through interstellar space and flying just through space, through

845
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:01,320
all these places that the angles don't quite work right.

846
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:04,360
I rolled a 94 on an 89.

847
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:12,280
Oh, and you lose six points of sand.

848
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:17,160
Do you want to give me an intelligence roll?

849
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:23,320
Oh, 28 pass on a 50.

850
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:24,440
It's probably bad for you.

851
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:28,040
The good news is to get five points of Cthulhu mythos.

852
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:31,880
The bad news is you're having a battle of madness and you're having one where there

853
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:33,320
are no other player characters around.

854
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:36,280
Summary rules for that.

855
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:41,160
So let's just draw a curtain on what happens here and we'll come back to you shortly to

856
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:42,760
see what's happened.

857
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:45,800
Hey, Scott, thank you.

858
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:49,720
I'm really happy right now.

859
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:57,640
I like that we learned in real time that what you did was a horrible decision to think back

860
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:01,640
on how much glee we had when you shouted psychic attack and the way that it ended up.

861
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:07,720
Whoops, you've gone mad.

862
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:10,200
And so you're just repeatedly trying to psychic attack.

863
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:12,120
Oh God.

864
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:14,360
Now, meanwhile, back out in the courtyard.

865
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:22,600
Yeah, there's there's bits of burning debris all around now, which are lighting the courtyard

866
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:24,440
quite nicely.

867
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:30,280
And you can see that there are more of these flying creatures, some of them moving through

868
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:30,680
the air.

869
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:32,920
Some have landed on the roofs.

870
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:39,320
You can see some scuttling in through windows on the manor house and the air around you

871
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:40,120
is buzzing.

872
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:44,440
Holy shit.

873
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:47,480
Well, I don't know about you fellas, but I think we ought to get up there and kill that

874
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:49,800
thing in the wardrobe in the bedroom.

875
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:59,720
OK, now that I've been rescued from underneath the burning log and I've got burns and shit

876
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:02,120
all over me and I've seen this crazy shit.

877
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:09,480
I immediately start to miss Eldon and I'm like, yeah, he actually believes in the shit

878
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:12,280
that I was trying to peddle and it's happening now.

879
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:13,480
Fuck.

880
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:19,640
And he's just going to run towards the entrance of the main house to try to go find Eldon.

881
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:21,080
Harvey's just going to turn to Lafayette.

882
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:23,000
Hey, boss, I think it's time we get out of here.

883
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
I think that's a capital idea, Harvey.

884
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,160
Do you think we could get one of these cars going?

885
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:31,240
I don't think any of these cars are moving into some of the snow melts.

886
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:35,240
I think our best bet is to seek refuge inside, maybe find the wine cellar.

887
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:41,320
As Checkers is running off, he's like, don't you want to show your that the scientist how

888
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:42,600
much better you are than him?

889
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:48,040
You know, perhaps tomorrow when things have calmed down, but there are an awful lot of,

890
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:51,000
you know, demons in the air.

891
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:55,560
Demons in the air.

892
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:01,960
Yeah, I'm following Lafayette's lead no matter what, but I think we're aiming for the house.

893
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:04,520
I mean, we're running after you all the same.

894
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:08,120
So, yeah, you make your way as quickly as you can through the snow.

895
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:12,440
Actually, each of you could give me a spot hidden roll on your way past if you want.

896
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:13,880
Ought 7.

897
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:15,000
25.

898
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:15,560
OK.

899
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:17,240
A 14 on a 70.

900
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:19,640
That's the extreme, extreme success.

901
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:24,280
You all notice as you're going past, at least parts of the cars that are parked outside

902
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:28,200
seem to be relatively cleared of snow.

903
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:32,440
In fact, it mostly seems to be the fronts of the cars.

904
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:38,200
Now you look at it, the hoods are open and there are bits of engine just strewn all over

905
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:39,000
the place.

906
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,280
Oh, shit.

907
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:43,080
Looks like snow is the least of our troubles with these autos, Harvey.

908
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:45,560
Yeah, we ain't going anywhere in any of these.

909
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:46,120
Eldon!

910
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:53,800
So, yeah, I mean, you make your way towards the house and as you get in through the main

911
00:49:53,800 --> 00:50:00,680
doors, you can see coming down the stairs at the far end of the hallway, there's a few

912
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:02,600
of the staff who stopped and just looking.

913
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:03,720
There's Margaret Payne.

914
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:11,320
She's walking fairly slowly down the stairs and she is absolutely covered in blood with

915
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:12,680
grey specks on her.

916
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:20,360
She's got a thousand yard stare in her eyes and she's just swaying as she's coming

917
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:20,680
down.

918
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:24,280
Ms. Payne, have you seen Eldon?

919
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:26,920
He killed Cicero.

920
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:28,920
He killed Cicero.

921
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:29,800
He killed...

922
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:30,360
Where?

923
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:31,560
He did what?

924
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:35,960
She just points upstairs and then just faints dead away and bounces down the rest of the

925
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:36,520
stairs.

926
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:37,320
Oh, shit.

927
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:42,680
Lafayette is bounding up the stairs where she pointed three at a time.

928
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:44,040
Checkers is following after him.

929
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:44,760
Same with Harvey.

930
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:48,440
He's like, maybe he's not dead yet and he can see my jet pack before.

931
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:54,920
It's the last thing he sees as I hold his hand and I'm like, look, look, Cicero.

932
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:59,320
And then he's gone and then I piss on his bed.

933
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:09,400
As he's dying, he looks up to you with a tear in his eyes and he's like, you were better.

934
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:15,240
Yeah, he says this with no eyeballs and no head.

935
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:19,160
This is all in Lafayette's imagination as he's running up the stairs.

936
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:20,680
He says, I never hated you.

937
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:22,200
I just loved your wife.

938
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:31,160
It's the look in the eye that's still embedded in Mr. Ring's cheek.

939
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:38,200
I'm shouting Eldon's name as I'm running up the stairs too.

940
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:38,760
Do it.

941
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:43,560
I mean, yeah, you can see that there's light coming down from the end of the corridor and

942
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:48,040
probably more importantly, there is a trail of bloody footprints coming down the corridor

943
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:49,720
from this room at the end.

944
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:51,960
Yeah, that's what Checkers is going to be following.

945
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:57,480
You get in there and I mean, as bad as the wallpaper in this room probably looked before,

946
00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:58,760
it looks a lot worse now.

947
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:06,280
There is blood and brain and bits of skin and bone just splattered around the place

948
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:15,880
like pebble dash, the almost headless body of Cicero leaking blood into the carpet.

949
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:21,400
And from down below you can hear this heavy clanking sound and something heavy falling

950
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:30,360
over and this buzzing voice saying, yes, yes, you shall be spared, you shall be spared,

951
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:31,480
you and you alone.

952
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:35,240
Checkers runs towards that.

953
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:43,080
Lafayette dips his finger in some of the blood on the wallpaper and takes a lick and he knows.

954
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:44,120
He knows it's Cicero.

955
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:47,400
It's cold.

956
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:53,400
He sits down for a moment next to the corpse on the bed and he doesn't really know what

957
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:54,120
to do with his life.

958
00:52:56,120 --> 00:53:02,520
I mean, there is still this bottle of strange yellowish liquid there and a hypodermic syringe

959
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:03,560
as well.

960
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:09,480
Yeah, this is rock bottom.

961
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:10,680
I should probably start injecting.

962
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:19,400
Scott's just like, well, here we go.

963
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:20,600
Having a rough night?

964
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:27,240
The next logical step for you.

965
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:31,480
Harvey standing over Morden's body.

966
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:33,480
Well, this is good news, right?

967
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:35,480
This is the kind of the end game here, right?

968
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:36,760
You win.

969
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:37,160
You won.

970
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:37,880
You won.

971
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:38,760
Harvey, don't you see?

972
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:42,280
I wanted to rub his nose in it and now he doesn't have one.

973
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:42,920
Well, you can do that.

974
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:43,480
Here, look.

975
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:47,000
And I start to rub his skull.

976
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,240
Rubbing his nose in it.

977
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:49,800
That's lovely.

978
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:51,480
That's the half of a skull.

979
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:57,320
So it's just Checkers who's running downstairs and the other two of you are commiserating

980
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:59,800
over Morden's corpse upstairs.

981
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:00,920
Yeah, you've got this, right, Checkers?

982
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:03,400
Oh, I've never been more ready.

983
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:05,720
We'll start moseying on down there.

984
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:14,760
You run downstairs and there is this horrible buzzing sound, the sound like the one you

985
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:15,560
heard outside.

986
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:22,280
And sure enough, when you come around the corner, there is this battered form of this

987
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:29,320
creature like the one you saw outside or the ones you saw outside that is beginning to

988
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:35,640
rise off the ground and there on the ground before it, kneeling almost in reverence,

989
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:38,280
is the form of Mr.

990
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:38,600
Ring.

991
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:39,880
Mr.

992
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:46,040
Ring is coming back to his senses now, I guess, but how this has affected you, how this

993
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:50,360
glimpse of seeing something so much greater than yourself is shaping your thoughts at

994
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:52,040
the moment is entirely up to you.

995
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:54,440
Is this thing still inside the cage?

996
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:54,680
No.

997
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:56,040
No, Mr.

998
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:58,360
Ring seems to have just finished freeing it.

999
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:02,600
I'm going to use my resourcefulness, so I'm going to take 10 points.

1000
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:08,600
And I have a gun on me and I'm going to shoot this thing because it scares me.

1001
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:11,160
So, yeah, I mean, Mr.

1002
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:16,440
Ring, you can see that Checkers, your old master, is that right?

1003
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:18,040
Or is he still your current master?

1004
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:22,280
I mean, does he still have anything to teach you compared to the wonders you've just seen

1005
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:23,800
inside this creature's mind?

1006
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:24,440
Good point.

1007
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:29,400
I have been completely transformed by the darkness that is now within me.

1008
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:36,840
It has completely tainted my soul, and I will now be known as Dark Soul.

1009
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:48,440
Oh, my God.

1010
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:50,760
Wow.

1011
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:53,960
I love it so much.

1012
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:57,000
Oh, my God.

1013
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:03,320
Then, yeah, Mr.

1014
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:14,760
Soul can see Checkers pulling out this gun as this divine creature is beginning to rise

1015
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:15,480
up in the air.

1016
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:17,720
What's everyone doing?

1017
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:20,760
Checkers is just going to unload his gun.

1018
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:29,160
And while he's screaming like, Elden, Elden, my name is no longer chosen to be Elden Ring.

1019
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:32,680
You were once my friend and my mentor.

1020
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:42,280
So you're just firing wildly into this thing as fast as the gun will shoot.

1021
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:43,240
Exactly.

1022
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:45,160
Yeah, it's going to be point blank range.

1023
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:49,480
So this will be three normal firearm handguns rolls.

1024
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:58,040
FAIL 85 on a 50, 36 on a 50, 19 on a 50.

1025
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:02,920
Don't bother rolling damage on this because guns aren't very effective.

1026
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:14,360
So, yeah, I mean, the bullets whack into it and I mean, they make holes and the thing

1027
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:16,040
seems angry.

1028
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:24,280
You can hear the timbre of its buzzing getting louder and the buzzing voice just fills

1029
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:30,120
the room, even over the deafening effect of the gunshots.

1030
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:31,560
And Mr.

1031
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:35,560
Soul can hear it just saying, Destroy him.

1032
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:41,320
Well, obviously, after some time to get...

1033
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:43,560
Taking attacks, taking attacks, taking attacks!

1034
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:53,080
As I finish unloading or like just shooting three bullets off at this thing, I feel the

1035
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:55,880
same feeling that I got downstairs in the ballroom.

1036
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:57,400
The feeling that broke your heart.

1037
00:57:59,000 --> 00:57:59,640
60.

1038
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:00,360
44.

1039
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:00,840
Fuck you.

1040
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:08,520
I see the lack of effect that my bullets have made on this thing.

1041
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:15,240
And I look at Eldin and I change the aim of my gun because I can feel him attacking me

1042
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:16,760
again psychically.

1043
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:21,160
And I fire a single bullet towards Eldin.

1044
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:22,600
Wow.

1045
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:28,920
OK, while you're doing this, the creature is just flying through the air past you to

1046
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:29,960
go up the stairs.

1047
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:30,520
Oh, OK.

1048
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:31,160
Not at me.

1049
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:35,560
It's quite happy to leave you two downstairs to kill each other while it escapes.

1050
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:38,120
Pretty good plan on its part.

1051
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:41,240
It's not stupid.

1052
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:44,280
We've got personal shit we're working out.

1053
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:49,640
So you were going to shoot Mr.

1054
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:49,960
Soul?

1055
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:53,000
Hopefully not, but I'm going to shoot at him.

1056
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:56,360
You'll get a bonus die as well because it's point blank range.

1057
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:57,160
Oh, perfect.

1058
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:02,920
Well, that's a 31 and also a 31 again.

1059
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:06,680
So I successfully shoot him.

1060
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:11,080
So what kind of gun is this?

1061
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:16,040
Just like a small handgun, like a 38.

1062
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:17,560
Yeah, like a 38 special.

1063
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:20,120
OK, so roll a D10 damage.

1064
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:23,800
10.

1065
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:31,480
OK, so yeah, there is this searing pain.

1066
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:38,200
Your friend, your confidant, your leader, the man who defined your life.

1067
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:41,640
Defined your beliefs, defined your existence until a moment ago.

1068
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:42,760
A man named Checkers.

1069
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:48,120
A man named Checkers.

1070
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:51,480
Yes, Checkers has betrayed you.

1071
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:54,040
But only because you betrayed me.

1072
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:55,480
That's fair enough.

1073
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:58,440
I went from 21 to 11 hit points.

1074
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:01,800
Oh yeah, I mean, does the physical pain hurt more,

1075
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:05,720
or is it more the emotional pain of having been shot by your mentor?

1076
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:07,560
Well, obviously physical pain can't.

1077
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:08,440
Oh, I just got shot.

1078
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:09,960
Yes, physical pain hurts more.

1079
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:15,800
And as soon as I shoot him, I drop the gun and I'm like, why?

1080
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:19,080
Why would you do that?

1081
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:21,800
You've shot him in the abdomen.

1082
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:24,440
If you're lucky, maybe not in the gut, in the stomach,

1083
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:28,360
but there's blood welling out from between his fingers now.

1084
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:31,000
I definitely am going to immediately try to first aid him.

1085
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:35,320
Is Mr. Soul putting up with that?

1086
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:38,520
You've just been shot and now he's trying to tend to your wound.

1087
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:40,860
Why?

1088
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:44,360
Why did you not join on the true side of...

1089
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:47,400
You got tricked.

1090
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:49,240
They got to you.

1091
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:51,080
I thought you were stronger than that.

1092
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:54,680
But we seek the universe and its power.

1093
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:57,000
Well, on my way down, you don't know any of this,

1094
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:00,680
but on my way down the ladder, I thought about just whatever you're into,

1095
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:02,520
I was going to do.

1096
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:04,840
But then you tried to mind attack me again.

1097
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:06,200
You son of a bitch.

1098
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:12,200
And then he starts pouring the hydrogen peroxide on his open wound on his stomach.

1099
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:17,400
Oh, there is a fine line between first aid and torture.

1100
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:22,120
Well, I'm trying to do a little column A, a little column B.

1101
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:24,920
Do you want to give me a first aid roll?

1102
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:26,540
Yes.

1103
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:30,280
54 on a 50.

1104
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:31,880
I have four luck.

1105
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:34,840
Oh, I'll spend four luck to make that pass.

1106
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:35,560
Okay.

1107
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:37,400
Which puts me at eight.

1108
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:45,080
So you can have a D4 hit points back as somehow having hydrogen peroxide

1109
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:47,560
poured in a gunshot wound does you the world of good.

1110
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:48,760
Well, yeah, it's that.

1111
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:53,960
And then once it's kind of done fizzing up, I get some gauze and just put it in the hole.

1112
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:57,240
It was like 70% hydrogen peroxide, so it dissolves the bullet.

1113
01:01:57,240 --> 01:02:03,400
Uh, I'm back up to 13 now.

1114
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:04,920
Former master checkers.

1115
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:09,000
What was that thing that you were talking to?

1116
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:18,040
That it wanted to be free and it wants to, I didn't quite understand, but it's powerful.

1117
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:23,160
He's just like jaw on the floor, like mouth open, like does not understand what in the

1118
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:27,320
past 20 minutes what's happened to his friend.

1119
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:29,400
Like he's just like shaking his head.

1120
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:30,360
Like what the fuck?

1121
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:38,200
I've seen things on the others tonight that are so powerful.

1122
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:41,160
More than you can imagine.

1123
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:49,880
And while Mr. Soul bears his soul to checkers, let's cut upstairs.

1124
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:56,840
Harvey and Lafayette can hear this buzzing sound from down below.

1125
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:57,960
Then there's gunshots.

1126
01:02:57,960 --> 01:02:58,920
They're shouting.

1127
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:06,760
The buzzing sound is getting louder and louder as something comes bursting out of the wardrobe.

1128
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:09,080
Something very much like the things you saw outside.

1129
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:11,960
But this time you're now seeing it in bright light.

1130
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:21,960
You can see the twisted insectile form, the strange pincers, the pulsating head, the strange

1131
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:25,160
wounds all over it as it floats above the ground.

1132
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:28,120
Do you want to give me sand rolls first of all?

1133
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:33,720
Oh shit, I fail a 68 on a 60.

1134
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:35,720
Can you, can you luck a sanity roll?

1135
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:36,360
You cannot.

1136
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:37,400
Okay.

1137
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:38,760
Can you lick a sanity roll?

1138
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:41,560
How many licks in the center of a sanity roll?

1139
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:43,320
I believe I passed.

1140
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:45,000
Let me get my sheet back up.

1141
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:45,720
Oh nope.

1142
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:47,000
93 on an 89.

1143
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:47,320
I fail.

1144
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:48,760
Okay.

1145
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:49,880
So you both failed.

1146
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:52,760
So Lafayette loses.

1147
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:59,640
Oh, he only loses one point of sand and Harvey loses five points.

1148
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:00,440
That's more like it.

1149
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:04,120
Can I have an intelligence roll off Harvey, please?

1150
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:05,480
Yes, you can.

1151
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:10,360
That's a 44 on a 60.

1152
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:11,480
Okay.

1153
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:13,320
So you're having a bad madness as well.

1154
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:15,400
So again, you get five points of Cthulhu Mythos.

1155
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:18,440
What do you think of them?

1156
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:19,240
Blind panic?

1157
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:20,360
Does that sound about right?

1158
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:21,320
Yeah, totally.

1159
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:26,120
So yeah, I mean in your panic to get out of the room, you're pushing Lafayette out of

1160
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:26,840
the way.

1161
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:32,280
The two of you are just stumbling all over each other and this creature actually doesn't

1162
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:33,800
seem to be paying you much attention.

1163
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:37,640
It just flies out of the room at speed.

1164
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:44,760
From beyond in the corridor and down the stairs, you can hear sounds.

1165
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:49,800
I mean, you heard a few sounds before, glass breaking and stuff like that.

1166
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:52,840
But now there are other sounds.

1167
01:04:52,840 --> 01:05:00,120
There are people screaming and there's strange sounds like electrical discharge and just

1168
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:04,360
this buzzing, so much buzzing in the air, not just this thing that flew past you.

1169
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:10,280
But it's just like suddenly the air is absolutely filled with buzzing.

1170
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:12,280
Oh my God, it's a swarm.

1171
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:15,000
And shall we leave the episode here?

1172
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:16,380
Yes.

1173
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:20,120
Yeah, holy shit.

1174
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:26,840
So we're going to be able to clean it all up and have a good ending by the next episode.

1175
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:28,760
Yeah, it should be a pretty clean ending.

1176
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:29,260
Fine.

1177
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:35,480
The light in that tower was actually like a bug zapper that we destroyed.

1178
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:40,520
It wasn't a zapper, it was going to draw them in like moths.

1179
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:41,720
Oh my God.

1180
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:43,080
There would have been thousands more.

1181
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:45,400
But they would have been over there.

1182
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:47,720
Yeah, they would have been over there.

1183
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:51,480
It's totally what it is.

1184
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:55,160
It's going to change the world, you know?

1185
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:06,280
A body could be hollow before its blood ran cold

1186
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:20,760
I didn't know that the wind could sew the tissue and faggot bone

1187
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:28,760
You were hollow when you spoke to me

1188
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:35,240
Hollow when you sang

1189
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:43,400
I thought you might be starving

1190
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:52,040
So I gave you everything

1191
01:06:56,040 --> 01:07:00,040
Thorns and rocks and devils glow

1192
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:04,040
Brides and dry-baked clay

1193
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:10,040
Crocus blossoms in February

1194
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:13,560
And I lay home in May

1195
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:20,040
Time between a mother's fingers

1196
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:23,160
And spit off of a bridge

1197
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:28,600
Restless legs at 3pm

1198
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:32,680
While waiting for a fix

1199
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:19,160
So come back here and see what's left of me

1200
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:29,160
Is this the wholesome girl you left in Missouri?

1201
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:35,880
My voice is nothing now

1202
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:40,920
But the howl of the wind

1203
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:46,440
Come closer dear in my teeth

1204
01:08:46,440 --> 01:08:48,920
Rattle in my jaw

1205
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:57,480
Come closer dear in my teeth

1206
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:02,920
Rattle in my jaw
