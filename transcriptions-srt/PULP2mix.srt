00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,240
Hello to all my friends from the underworld, the overworld, and the in-between world.

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:17,040
It's your multi-dimensional devilish demon wolf the dog, and I'm also a radio DJ for

3
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:24,240
the station we all know and love, 694.2 PTBP.

4
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:32,000
And I'm here to provide you with ear cream in the form of my beautiful soul tree voice.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,080
This week's Howlin' with Wolf is the cream of the ear crop, and it's from TLN in Kansas

6
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:44,840
City, who tweeted about the show and tagged at Pretending Pod, a nice thing you can do

7
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:48,360
right now, like super easily.

8
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,360
Thanks TLN in Kansas City, TLN writes.

9
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:58,840
Hello wolf, and thank you for the ceaseless howlin', keepin' me company upon these

10
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,400
dayless moors.

11
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:08,080
TLN here from Kansas City to give a shout out to the very vilest viziers whose creative

12
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,960
powers have wrought upon this world great and terrible things.

13
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:21,120
Because of you we have unleashed the weird and wild, the book of gob, the thawing kingdom,

14
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:28,320
marvelous mutations and merry musicians, and very soon the world shall behold the dreadful

15
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,120
sunny smiles unicorn farm and unicorn meat.

16
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:39,600
May the pig king remain at rest, may the seven finger hand reach to the ends of the earth,

17
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,640
long live the vile viziers.

18
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,400
Damn TLN, you had me at unicorn meat.

19
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:54,200
I generally consider myself a vegetarian, but I dabble in some minced mythical meat

20
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,200
every now and again.

21
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:02,600
Thanks for writing whatever the fuck all that was TLN, I appreciate it, even if I don't

22
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,320
know what in the ever lovin' fuck any of it meant.

23
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,840
If you want to write up something for your wolf to how, tag us on the internet or write

24
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,360
up a five star review on Apple podcasts.

25
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,560
The links are in the show notes.

26
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,440
The sausage links are in the gross throats.

27
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,880
On the golf links I have the most strokes.

28
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,920
Fuck Mark Zuckerberg it's time for the news.

29
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:32,280
Last time we met the disguised Lafayette J. Honeycutt, a rival inventor who has snuck

30
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:39,960
into Cicero Mordaunt's New Year's Eve party to unveil his own mysterious invention with

31
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:46,380
his security detail Harvey Brewer, an absolute hulk of a man.

32
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:53,680
We also met Checkers, the oddly deep voiced 19 year old leader of the Last Branch, a cult

33
00:02:53,680 --> 00:03:00,400
hoping to recruit the wealthy and powerful with the disarming charm of Checkers and the

34
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:07,720
spiritual potential of Elden Ring, an open vessel seeking otherworldly knowledge.

35
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,520
Will the Last Branch gain a key third member?

36
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:20,200
Will Honey J. Laugh-a-cut, aka James Dean, aka Dave Ellington, figure out what the deal

37
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:27,720
is with Cicero Mordaunt's new invention that requires all these cables and antennae?

38
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:33,120
Will Scott admit that Elden Ring is a perfect character name?

39
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,860
Come on down.

40
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,780
No one sane will follow.

41
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:43,620
It's the renowned Isabel Crane with Hollow.

42
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:19,820
With a tissue and a faggot bone You were hollow and you spoke to me

43
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:33,380
Hollow and you sang I thought you might be starving

44
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:43,220
So I gave you everything

45
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:46,700
Did you like that, Scott?

46
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:51,860
I think it helps focus the mind before a session, so yeah.

47
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:55,740
We try to do a lot of stuff that helps focus the mind before a session.

48
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:59,740
What do you do, Luke, to get into the mindset of a role-playing session?

49
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:04,580
Wake up, roll out of bed, and sit down on the couch.

50
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:08,540
What about you, Scott?

51
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:09,540
Maybe a different answer?

52
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:14,980
No, that's pretty much it for me.

53
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,540
I don't do any prep for anything.

54
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:24,020
I mean, if I'm GM, you're lucky if I read the fucking scenario.

55
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:26,940
I'm so jealous of your skills.

56
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:33,260
I over-prep so hard for everything, and I talk to myself in character voices, and my

57
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:41,300
wife asks me how I'm doing, and I'm like, fine.

58
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,980
I worked out a while back that I was absolutely shit at character voices, so I don't really

59
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:47,300
try them anymore.

60
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:51,260
I feel like you give them vocal affectations even though you don't do accents.

61
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,540
Yeah, I try.

62
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:58,100
I don't try full voices, but I try to differentiate them a bit.

63
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:04,700
Also, for us, you already have a built-in character voice.

64
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:08,700
But it's the wrong fucking accent for everything I've run for.

65
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:14,260
Hey, Scott, will you run some stuff that's only set in America for us?

66
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:18,180
No, the next one is he's going to force us to do English accents.

67
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:21,340
The next time, we'll all do English accents.

68
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,340
Oh, God.

69
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,340
Hey, Scott, would you like an accent?

70
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:27,260
That would be so much less fun for him.

71
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,340
It'll just be Beatles and Cockney accents.

72
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,340
Yeah, that's cool.

73
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,340
We're the Beatles.

74
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:36,780
It's taking me something like 30 years of living in England to get the hang of this

75
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:37,780
already.

76
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:38,780
Don't confuse me.

77
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,780
I'm Ringo, isn't it?

78
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,780
Is that good?

79
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:43,780
Wow.

80
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:44,780
Yep.

81
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,780
There we go.

82
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:52,220
Well, we were talking weird science.

83
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,100
What's your favorite weird science movie, Thomas?

84
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,540
Oh, I like that movie, Weird Science.

85
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:57,540
RDJ?

86
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:01,960
What's the Val Kilmer, is it Young Genius?

87
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,960
Real Genius?

88
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,960
Yeah.

89
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,960
Something like that.

90
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,960
Real Genius.

91
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,960
Real Genius.

92
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,960
Yeah.

93
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,960
I like that one.

94
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,960
Oh, God.

95
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,960
I haven't thought about that film since the 90s.

96
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,960
Why do you know it, Joe?

97
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:15,460
It was one of those movies that would run on HBO when I was a kid.

98
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:19,820
It's just perfectly childish enough that I was into it.

99
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:20,820
Yeah.

100
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:24,100
Did you know that your parents letting you watch HBO at a young age made you who you

101
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,100
are today?

102
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,100
Yeah.

103
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,100
Definitely.

104
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,220
Did you ever see boobies on there?

105
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,780
Taxi cab confessions all the time.

106
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:33,780
That's why I am the way I am.

107
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,780
Obsessed with boobies.

108
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:38,820
Were there nipples on taxi cab confessions?

109
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:42,700
Sometimes, if you were lucky, if it was a good episode.

110
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:46,820
You know, if the driver was shirtless.

111
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:55,060
Scott, when you were coming up, what was the thing that was scandalous that you hid

112
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:58,500
from your parents that you were looking at?

113
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,940
Oh, God.

114
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:06,240
Oh, this has got to be a deep cut and very obscure, but I think the inappropriate media

115
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:12,040
that I encountered at a fairly young age that shaped me and my parents really didn't like

116
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:17,520
when they encountered it was a book called Image of the Beast by Philip Jose Farmer,

117
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:24,860
which is a science fiction novel come sort of new Irish thing that was published in the

118
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:27,460
60s or 70s.

119
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:37,200
And it is basically just somewhere between bizarro fiction and outright pornography.

120
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,060
It's one of the weirdest books ever written.

121
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:45,600
It is insanely on brand for that to be a fact.

122
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,520
To give you an example of the kind of book it is.

123
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:54,100
One of the characters in this is Gilles de Rais, AKA Bluebeard, but it's not the classic

124
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,100
Gilles de Rais.

125
00:08:55,100 --> 00:09:01,760
He's been reincarnated and he now lives as this snake-like entity living in the womb

126
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,480
of one of the female characters.

127
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:10,480
And his shtick basically is every time she has sex with anyone, he comes out and just

128
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,880
bites the cock of the person who's having sex with her and kills him.

129
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,920
Oh my God, that's great.

130
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,920
Well thanks a lot, Scott.

131
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:23,680
I didn't need to know I was into that too.

132
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:29,860
I had a VHS of Double Jeopardy and there's a sex scene in that movie and I would just

133
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:30,860
watch that.

134
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:36,180
I thought you meant like you had taped an episode of Jeopardy and you're like, there's

135
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,900
a sex scene in this Jeopardy.

136
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:41,620
I was just thinking, I don't remember Trebek ever working with me.

137
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:44,020
This was Tommy Lee Jones.

138
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,020
Let's go to...

139
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:47,660
I'm like, Joe, I didn't have to hide anything really.

140
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:51,040
So my parents exposed me to a ton of media and stuff.

141
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:56,260
They were separated, so my dad was a little more permissive about what I got to watch.

142
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:59,340
Well, like a lot more permissive.

143
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:04,900
And so South Park came out in 1996, I think.

144
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:05,900
Oh my God.

145
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:06,900
I was...

146
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:07,900
30?

147
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:08,900
I was 30, yeah.

148
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:13,300
I was seven years old and my dad was like, hey, there's this show I think you're going

149
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:19,620
to really like, but you can't tell your mom you watch it when you're over here.

150
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:24,180
And so for a few years, South Park was a secret, but that was literally the only thing I had

151
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,460
to not tell one of my parents about.

152
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:31,420
When I was six years old, my mom also said the same thing to me, hey, there's this show

153
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:33,900
that's coming out and I think you're going to like it.

154
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:34,900
It's called VeggieTales.

155
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:35,900
It's Pokemon.

156
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:40,900
I thought you were going to say the Left Behind movies.

157
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:46,240
I did read all the Left Behind books and it gave me night terrors.

158
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:51,160
And so in order to fix me, my parents prayed for me.

159
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,160
It didn't work.

160
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,500
It was just anxiety, guys.

161
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,820
It was just anxiety the whole time.

162
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,260
Yeah.

163
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,260
Oh my God.

164
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,260
Religion.

165
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,260
Religion.

166
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,260
It's a hell of a drug.

167
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,460
Let's do some lines.

168
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:05,460
It's pretending to be people.

169
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:08,060
I Googled it and I was eight when South Park came out.

170
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,540
Oh wow.

171
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,500
That is young to watch South Park.

172
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,500
I was probably nine by the time he showed it to me.

173
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:17,980
I'd already been watching The Simpsons since I was literally born and I was obsessed with

174
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:18,980
it.

175
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:22,020
And he was like, if you like The Simpsons, you're going to fucking love this shit.

176
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:27,180
I'm not going to say how old I was when South Park came out.

177
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,660
I was four years old.

178
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,660
Oh fuck.

179
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:33,940
I was 32.

180
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:36,380
You'd already lived so much life, Scott.

181
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:37,740
So how did South Park hit you?

182
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,220
All right, let's kick into...

183
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,220
Appropriately.

184
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,220
Yeah.

185
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:45,700
The target demographic.

186
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,820
All right.

187
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:56,820
Last time on Pretending to be People, we played Colputhulu.

188
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,820
Colputhulu.

189
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,540
Colputhulu.

190
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:01,540
Actually the P is silent.

191
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:04,740
It's just Thulu.

192
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:09,180
We introduced our characters and made it to the party and kind of got acquainted with

193
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:11,340
the goings on of what's happening at the party.

194
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:14,380
Can we give a quick rundown of our names and our characters real quick?

195
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,380
Thomas?

196
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,540
Jay Honeycutt, a gentleman inventor.

197
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:23,820
I'm Harvey Brewer and I'm here to protect him and make sure nothing happens to him.

198
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:26,860
Checkers, leader of a fantastic organization.

199
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:33,020
It's a cult and I'm Elden Ring and we're trying to change the world through the powers that

200
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:36,180
exist between mind spaces.

201
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:39,020
We got government officials, we got...

202
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:43,180
We're going to bag ourselves a senator and a movie lady.

203
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,180
Star of...

204
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,180
Favorite movie she was in.

205
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:48,500
Oh, probably Last Train to Jacksonville.

206
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,500
Clarksville.

207
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,500
Nope.

208
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,500
She did a whole series.

209
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,500
Last Train series.

210
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,260
Yeah, they're some of my favorites.

211
00:12:55,260 --> 00:13:01,220
I like the rom-com First Train to Love Town.

212
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:10,220
And yeah, we went to the party and currently I believe Thomas, Jay, Edgar, Honeyfella and...

213
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:12,140
What is your guy going by here at the party?

214
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,260
David Ellington.

215
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:14,340
David Ellington.

216
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:18,700
David Ellington and Harvey Brewer are checking out the radio antennas that are strangely

217
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:23,620
sticking out of kind of like the front of the house and also the tower that seems to

218
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,500
have been built outside of this estate.

219
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,460
Yeah, I think we're turning around to pick up our coats from Kochek.

220
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,460
Yeah.

221
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,420
You guys are going back out in the cold.

222
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:36,020
I'm standing in the warm about to talk to a senator about the world.

223
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:37,660
I think that's a good point to pick up from.

224
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:38,660
Yeah.

225
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,660
There we go.

226
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:46,860
Eldon was making his way through the crowd.

227
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:50,580
Say the last name, Scott.

228
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:53,540
I like to go by first hand last names.

229
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:57,660
Brought to you by From Software.

230
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:00,380
Mr. Ring was making his way through the crowd.

231
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,380
Oh, get it?

232
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:04,860
Because it's like mystery, but it's also my name.

233
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:05,860
What is your name?

234
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:06,860
Sekiro.

235
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:07,860
Halo 3.

236
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:16,460
So, yes, Mr. Ring is making his way through the crowd, trying to home in on the senator.

237
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:21,980
But before you get a chance to, there is a woman who's been making her way through the

238
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:22,980
crowd as well.

239
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:27,340
I think she's, you reckon, probably in her mid 40s.

240
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:29,900
She's got fairly frizzy reddish brown hair.

241
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,500
She's got thick glasses on.

242
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,740
She's wearing a bald gown that doesn't quite fit.

243
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:39,700
Like a number of the guests here, she looks a bit flushed and drunk.

244
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:43,980
She just comes up to you and grabs you by the hand and says, you look like a dancer

245
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:47,180
and immediately sort of whisks you off and starts dancing with you.

246
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:49,840
Well, yes, thank you so much for that.

247
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:56,140
And he begins dancing with her and says, you look absolutely wonderful.

248
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,140
Oh, thank you.

249
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:00,060
Oh, you are a darling little man, she says.

250
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,060
Oh, yeah.

251
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:04,340
He's looking up to her as they're dancing.

252
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,340
His feet are on her feet, like.

253
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:12,980
Yeah, you got a good view straight up at her buck teeth and nasal hair.

254
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:16,260
And she's swinging you through the crowd.

255
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,580
What brought you here this evening, my dear madam?

256
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:22,220
Oh, I'm here with the Harvard contingent, you know.

257
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,820
Oh, very good.

258
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:26,340
Are you expecting much from the party tonight?

259
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:28,340
Not really, no.

260
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:30,660
Champagne, the occasional dance.

261
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,660
Psychic attack!

262
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:32,660
Psychic attack!

263
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:33,660
Psychic attack!

264
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,140
How does the psychic attack work?

265
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,140
What is the...

266
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:48,660
Did you just perform a psychic attack?

267
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:58,860
Scott, Zach had his hand raised for a psychic attack.

268
00:15:58,860 --> 00:15:59,860
He thought it so loud.

269
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:06,060
So you tell me if I'm wrong here, but I believe we roll a power contest against each other.

270
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,060
Yeah.

271
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:10,660
So is your goal basically just to get it to go away at this stage?

272
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:11,660
No.

273
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:19,620
So my goal is to continue dancing with her while basically intimidating her into continuing

274
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:26,560
dancing with me while I completely eliminate all of her magic points and she comes under

275
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,560
my thrall.

276
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,060
Is this how you get cult members?

277
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,060
Yes.

278
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,060
Holy shit.

279
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:38,260
So yeah, then give me a power roll, I shall roll against you as an opposed roll.

280
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:42,780
Well I passed with a 62 under a 90.

281
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:44,260
Regular success.

282
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:49,380
So if you psychic attack me at some point, we'll be doing a power roll off?

283
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:53,060
Yeah but I'm trying, I don't want to psychic attack you.

284
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:55,060
Okay, she failed.

285
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:57,060
Oh, sick.

286
00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:05,060
Well, you say that, but there's something weird that happens when you do this.

287
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:12,900
I mean you basically use the tricks that you've honed to try to take control of her mind and

288
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:19,160
you realize as you're doing this, someone's beaten you to it.

289
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:24,940
You're trying to grasp hold of her will, but it's like it's already in the thrall of something

290
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,240
else.

291
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,600
You could give me, I'd say, another power roll here to see whether you can deduce what's

292
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,360
going on.

293
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,360
That is a success.

294
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,360
59 under 90.

295
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:40,320
Yes, as you try to grab hold of her mind with yours, you're looking into the darkness.

296
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,600
You're looking into the darkness that is enveloping her mind.

297
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:51,520
Try to find something, anything to hold onto and there is something in the darkness there

298
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,480
with you.

299
00:17:53,480 --> 00:18:01,240
You can just hear this growling voice from all around, this sibilant growling voice that

300
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:04,240
just says, mine.

301
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:09,000
Give me a sand roll if you want.

302
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,880
I got chills a little bit.

303
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,920
I will absolutely give you a sand roll, fuck.

304
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:18,400
Yeah, in real life I lost sand.

305
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:24,520
So as far as sanity goes, I have 90 because my power and I rolled a 63.

306
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:29,480
Okay, so you don't lose any sand for this, but it probably still gives you enough of

307
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:39,960
a start that it breaks you out of the psychic trance that you were going into to do this.

308
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,720
The woman looks at you strangely and says, are you all right?

309
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,640
Yes, ma'am, what is your deepest desire?

310
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,280
I thought you were going to say, what's your deal?

311
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,280
What's your deal?

312
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:55,200
She looks at you strangely, my deepest desire.

313
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,880
Oh, I suppose I really want to see Cicero's invention.

314
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,040
I want to see it succeed in every way possible.

315
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,680
It's got to change the world, you know.

316
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,680
Interesting.

317
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,200
Do I also believe that?

318
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,360
Um, up to you.

319
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,560
Sounds like it already has.

320
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:16,360
Ma'am, tell me anything more that you know about this wonderful invention that will change

321
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,400
the world.

322
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,080
I too am interested in learning about these things.

323
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,320
Oh, yeah, of course you are.

324
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,480
I mean, it's going to be the most wonderful thing ever.

325
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,080
It's got to change the world, you know.

326
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,080
Yes.

327
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,080
What will it do?

328
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,480
It's got to change the world.

329
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,920
Incredible.

330
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,600
Everyone here has been brainwashed.

331
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,600
Okay.

332
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,560
Uh, he is going to go back in.

333
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:41,360
He's going to try to like get in and then fucking fight.

334
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:45,120
Like once he's in her mind space, he wants to punch up.

335
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:51,760
Oh, so what are you effectively trying to use her as a conduit to get to whatever has

336
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,760
got to her first?

337
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:56,720
Yeah, I'm playing, uh, what's that lawn game with the balls?

338
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,720
Croquet?

339
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,920
Yep, I'm using her as the, uh-

340
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,920
You're playing psychic croquet.

341
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,920
Yep.

342
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:08,200
I prefer psychic curling.

343
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:12,720
Psychic croquet sounds amazing, but how are you playing psychic croquet with her?

344
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,960
Okay, so you know when one of your croquet balls gets up against somebody else's croquet

345
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:22,080
ball, so then you put your foot on your croquet ball and smack it and then it shoots theirs

346
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,480
off in a crazy direction.

347
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:29,000
I'm smacking her and the point is to make the movement happen on the other side of her.

348
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I like this.

349
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
You make that work.

350
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I do like that.

351
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Yeah, I like that a lot.

352
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,600
Just as an aside, I'm pretty sure I saw psychic croquet open for Hawke when she needed it.

353
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:46,960
Psychic croquet, holy shit.

354
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,560
So I rolled power again and I got an aught 5.

355
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:53,320
Okay, let's see what your opponent gets here.

356
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,800
So you've got an extreme.

357
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,800
Yes.

358
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,800
I see him.

359
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:00,560
I think that might help me with my double jump up to punch this guy's butt with his

360
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:04,700
mind in his space, he's a silly goose, he doesn't know who he's messing with, he's messing

361
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,100
with Elden Ring.

362
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:10,940
He's got an extreme as well and his power is significantly higher than yours.

363
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,340
Oh, damn.

364
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:20,860
This time you're in her mind trying to shunt through to this other mind and it's almost

365
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:26,800
like there's no resistance and yeah, you can push through her mind and connect with this

366
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,860
thing that's on the other side.

367
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:34,740
And then you realize this only happened because it let you.

368
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:38,780
And suddenly you feel like a rat in a trap.

369
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:42,780
I'm in danger.

370
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:48,140
There is something that has just seized hold of your psyche and I mean, even if you want

371
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,200
to try to pull your mind back, you can.

372
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,200
Checkers, where's checkers?

373
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:57,680
Yeah, as this is happening, I come out of the bathroom and I am coked up and had slammed

374
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,680
like three drinks.

375
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:03,400
So I'm feeling pretty wild, but I see him dancing and not talking to the senator and

376
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,680
I am not very happy about that.

377
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:10,420
Not only dancing, but I read in the book that if you fail these checks or if someone is

378
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:15,540
looking and paying attention to the face during a psychic attack, they're contorted in pain

379
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:16,540
and confusion.

380
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:24,200
Oh, it's worse than that here because what checkers sees as he comes back from the bathroom

381
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:31,860
is that Mr. Ring has broken off from the dance.

382
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:37,400
The woman who was leading him through the crowd now seems to be standing over him.

383
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:43,000
You see Eldon just fall to the ground with a heavy thump and she's standing over.

384
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,280
Are you all right, mister?

385
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,200
And at least you think that's what she's saying.

386
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,560
You could barely hear her over the band.

387
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:55,080
And there are a few other people who've stopped their conversation and now gathering around.

388
00:22:55,080 --> 00:23:00,800
Yeah, there's Eldon lying on the ground, his eyes rolled back into his head.

389
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:06,700
As I see this, I approach, I'm like, everybody stand back.

390
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:10,800
And I pull out like a little vial from my pocket.

391
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,800
It's like smelling salts.

392
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:16,020
I like put it under his nose like this happens all this has happened before for sure.

393
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,020
And I'm like prepared.

394
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:21,340
I'm going to have that because I have the resourceful talent.

395
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:22,340
Oh, nice.

396
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:23,340
Sure.

397
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,340
Oh yeah.

398
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:25,740
If you want to spend 10 points of luck for that, that's perfect.

399
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:32,760
I would, uh, I'll just not spin the points.

400
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:37,320
I know I can do that, but yeah, I want to do that and basically like snap him out of

401
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,320
it.

402
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:43,400
And as you do so, I mean, there is a hand that comes down on your shoulder and as you

403
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:50,000
look around, you can see that there is this clergyman who you've seen moving through the

404
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,660
crowd before when he's got a fairly thin face and graying temples, he almost chiseled

405
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:57,340
good looks.

406
00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:03,580
He gives you a concerned look looking down at Eldon as well and says, uh, is your friend

407
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:05,140
quite all right there?

408
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:10,500
He's got a very sort of cut glass English accent says something I can do to help.

409
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,700
It happens all the time.

410
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:16,700
He's got a condition, but this bad boy right here usually snaps him right out of it.

411
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:19,140
Oh, well I suppose you better do that then.

412
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:26,600
Uh, yeah, so I, I smell salt Eldon, uh, and I'm like, but like, I'm like looking at the

413
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:34,300
clergy guy while I'm doing it mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, Eldon.

414
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,300
What happened?

415
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,340
I mean, actually, no, you have a condition.

416
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:38,600
This happens all the time.

417
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,760
Don't tell me what happened right here in front of this guy.

418
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,760
Yes.

419
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:45,800
Perhaps we better get your friends somewhere quiet.

420
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,800
Who are you by the way?

421
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,800
Oh, I'm sorry.

422
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,080
That's terribly rude of me.

423
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,080
I'm Reverend Nye.

424
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,260
I earned this whole deal.

425
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:54,260
Thank you, Reverend.

426
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,260
Uh, Reverend Nye.

427
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,260
Is it Bill Nye?

428
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,260
Is it Bill Nye?

429
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:59,100
Uh, Reverend, thank you.

430
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,900
I think Eldon, are you good?

431
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:05,320
I think I don't know that I want to be isolated at the party unless you feel like you need

432
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,320
it.

433
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:10,140
I'm sure we can find somewhere quiet just for him to recover his senses.

434
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:16,520
He gestures at one of the serving staff who's going past and just says some water for this

435
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,820
young man here.

436
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,040
Thank you, Reverend Man of the Cloth, sir.

437
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:26,280
I would like to look into his eyes and try to get a read on him.

438
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:30,880
Yeah, I was going to say, is there like a human type, uh, skill?

439
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,880
That's psychology.

440
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,880
Psychology.

441
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,880
Perfect.

442
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:36,480
Can I psychology this guy to see why he's trying to isolate us?

443
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,480
Sure.

444
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,480
Yeah.

445
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,480
38 on a 60.

446
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,480
Okay.

447
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:44,380
It's going to have to be a hard success, so you'd have to spend eight points of luck to

448
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:45,380
make that.

449
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,380
Do it.

450
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,380
Let's do it.

451
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:48,940
Minus 18.

452
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:49,940
Yeah.

453
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:53,540
I went down 10 for the smelling salts and now I am at 32.

454
00:25:53,540 --> 00:26:02,020
There is something about his manner for all the urbaneness that strikes you as being terribly

455
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,340
predatory.

456
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:05,500
Master Checkers, should I trust this man?

457
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:13,380
Well, we always trust men of the cloth, but it's a party, so sorry, but no rest tonight.

458
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,380
That's right.

459
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:15,380
Sorry.

460
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:16,380
It's a party.

461
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:27,660
And, uh, I, I help Eldon up off the ground, miss, uh, Reverend I nice to meet, nice to

462
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:28,660
meet you.

463
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:32,420
Maybe we can catch up later, but we've got an important business to attend to and I kind

464
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:34,260
of gesture towards the Senator.

465
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:40,020
He smiles at you and says, of course, of course, but we must talk later.

466
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:43,020
I'm sure we have great things to discuss.

467
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:48,540
Well, if you read this, uh, you know, you'll, you'll know what I'll be wanting to talk about

468
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:49,540
later.

469
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:51,220
And I hand him one of my pamphlets.

470
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:56,780
He takes it and immediately scans it and flicks through it and says, oh, how wonderfully droll.

471
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:59,480
And then tucks it into his pocket.

472
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:04,340
Checkers is coked up and he has just created a shit list and this guy is at the top of

473
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:08,140
it.

474
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:17,340
Before you lead Mr. Ring away from the Reverend, Eldon can give me a SPOT HIDDEN, if...

475
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,700
74 on a 25.

476
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:24,500
So you lead Eldon away from the Reverend who turns around and starts making small talk

477
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,500
with someone else.

478
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,500
Okay.

479
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:30,740
And yeah, we'll, we'll head towards the Senator Billings.

480
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:32,580
Okay.

481
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:35,060
So we'll come back to you in a few moments.

482
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:40,340
Let's cut back to our scientific investigation team outside.

483
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:42,540
Newly, newly outfitted in their coats.

484
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:43,540
Okay.

485
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:48,580
So you've gone back inside, you've managed to get some coats, uh, they might even be

486
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:49,580
your own.

487
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:51,580
Their tongues have warmed up to body temp again.

488
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:52,580
You're right.

489
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:56,580
We found some, we got some better coats.

490
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:58,580
Does this look good on me?

491
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:03,220
Um, so yeah, we are, we are trudging back.

492
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:06,580
Lafayette wants to go see this tower.

493
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:07,580
Come along, Avi.

494
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:09,140
We've, we've got to get to the bottom of this.

495
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:13,140
Uh, and I believe the bottom of this is at the top of that tower.

496
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,140
I get it.

497
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:15,140
I get it.

498
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:17,580
You're saying that this thing points at that thing, so it must be related there.

499
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:23,300
You know, my last several men were much dumber than you and they didn't appreciate my wit.

500
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,380
And so you're, you're a delight, Avi.

501
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:26,860
It is a delight to have you along.

502
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:28,340
Well, I've got your back.

503
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:30,620
Well, I, well, I got your back.

504
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:31,620
There it is.

505
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:32,620
There it is.

506
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,020
It's easy to do.

507
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:38,020
Now, now forward, Avi, for science.

508
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:40,020
Yeah, we're, we're making our way to that tower.

509
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:47,020
Making our way to the tower, walking slow cause it's snowing and cold.

510
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:50,340
You mentioned, you mentioned to think of it as kind of like a watchtower.

511
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:54,300
Is there forestry around it or is it kind of standing on its own in a field?

512
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:59,900
It's standing on the edge of this plateau that makes up the, the compound, the sort

513
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:04,020
of grounds of the manor house and the outbuildings.

514
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:08,380
So it does overlook some woodland, but it's not actually in the woodland.

515
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,380
Gotcha.

516
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,380
Sure.

517
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:14,540
When you get up to the top of it, is it like one that kind of has like a like porch around

518
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:18,860
the outside and you like walk through a door into a building or is it just like open on

519
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:19,860
the top?

520
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:25,020
Well, you're going to have to, I think, get a bit closer to really see the top of it.

521
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:27,020
Luke's trying to fast forward.

522
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:32,780
Yeah, because it's now snowing so heavily that even by the time you get to the bottom

523
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:37,940
of it, the top of it in the darkness and the snow isn't really visible.

524
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:42,200
There is a ladder that goes up to the center of it.

525
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,460
So there's not stairs.

526
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:45,940
It's just like a ladder that goes up to, okay.

527
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:49,900
I don't want to ruin the reveal, but if we used my invention right now, we sure could

528
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:50,900
get there a lot faster.

529
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:53,240
And it gives Harvey a knowing, like wink.

530
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,420
Does Harvey know what's in the case?

531
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:55,420
He does.

532
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:57,220
I'm going to show you, Joe, but I have it written down.

533
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:58,220
I just hadn't had the moment to-

534
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,220
Does Scott know?

535
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,220
No, Scott doesn't know.

536
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:01,220
Nope.

537
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:03,220
I am a quiver with anticipation.

538
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:05,220
Scott doesn't know.

539
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,220
Don't tell Scott.

540
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:14,140
No, it's just, I took the gadget talent and chose this gadget.

541
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:19,420
Cicero Mordant is going to eat fucking crow when he sees my cool ass gadget.

542
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:24,780
Oh, you hypnotized a bunch of fucking assholes at your mansion?

543
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:28,060
Well, I can't say anymore, but you'll see.

544
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,780
I think he can fly.

545
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:33,220
I gathered some sort of levitation device.

546
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:34,220
Levitation device?

547
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,220
No.

548
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:37,980
Are you guys coming louder or what?

549
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:40,460
So were you, yeah, was that what you were intimating?

550
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:42,540
Is it we're going to use it or we're not?

551
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,540
No.

552
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:44,540
Gotcha.

553
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:47,740
It's not at the time, Harvey, but so they keep trudging on through the snow towards

554
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:48,740
that tower.

555
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:50,540
And you mentioned some outbuildings.

556
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:55,780
Are they like a groundskeeper's house or is it more like industry, like science-y?

557
00:30:55,780 --> 00:31:00,580
No, I mean, that said, I mean, you do know that there is an outbuilding around the back

558
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:05,980
of the manor house, which is Mordant's laboratory.

559
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:14,980
But the ones that you're passing on your way to the tower, there's some old stables, there's

560
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:21,580
some garages, there's this building, which, yeah, maybe a groundskeeper's cottage or something

561
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:25,900
like that, where there does seem to be a party going on for the chauffeurs.

562
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:29,020
None of it is necessarily related to the weird science.

563
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,580
No, not that you can see.

564
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:35,820
I mean, the only building that you can think of that might have anything to do with that

565
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:38,540
is Mordant's laboratory, but you haven't been there yet.

566
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:42,580
Well, I mean, this time, but that is where I fucked his wife.

567
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:43,580
Jesus.

568
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:47,740
Yeah, he hates me.

569
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:51,820
At the bottom of this tower, is there any of that stuff that we can see on top?

570
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:54,700
Are there wires or anything coming down the legs of the tower?

571
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:57,660
There are no wires down here.

572
00:31:57,660 --> 00:32:04,820
It is basically just a wooden frame with some metal supports and a ladder going up.

573
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:09,060
The ladder is slightly iced over, but as long as you're careful going up and down, you should

574
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,060
be fine.

575
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:14,020
Keep your tongue away from it.

576
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:16,220
You don't have to lick everyone.

577
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:17,220
I vote we go up.

578
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:23,500
I thought you were going to say, I vote we lick everyone.

579
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:29,700
Yeah, I'm sorry.

580
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:32,420
I was imagining we're licking everyone.

581
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:39,980
Okay, so yeah, Harvey, actually, no, Lafayette definitely orders Harvey up there first.

582
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:43,380
Yeah, for sure, I'll start climbing up.

583
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:44,380
Okay.

584
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:47,420
Yeah, you make your way up and it is about a hundred feet tall.

585
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:50,780
Harvey looks down and goes, yep, most of them are cold.

586
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:56,900
Oh, do, do, hurry, do hurry, Harvey, and then throw down a rope.

587
00:32:56,900 --> 00:33:00,380
Seems more difficult.

588
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:06,220
The higher you get, the more aware you are of how strong the wind is as the snowstorm

589
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:09,380
is building up and the snow is getting quite heavy.

590
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:15,220
But you make your way up and there's a trap door in the bottom of the platform that's

591
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:16,220
up there.

592
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:19,860
But, I mean, if you try it, it's not locked, you can just push it open.

593
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:22,580
Okay, I do that, I pop my head up.

594
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:28,980
And inside, it's dark, but you can see what looks like maybe electrical equipment and

595
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:34,220
some maybe work benches or consoles or something like that, a lot of wiring.

596
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:40,700
But up above, on a separate platform above you, you can just make out the outline of,

597
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:45,460
yeah, maybe you've seen something like this before, it looks pretty incongruous, but it

598
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:52,180
looks like the kind of huge light or bulb or whatever that you'd see in a lighthouse.

599
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,260
Oh, wow.

600
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:58,300
Why just spill your beans?

601
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:01,740
I kind of report down to the Lafayette, are you staying at the ground or were you coming

602
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:02,740
up the ladder behind me?

603
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:08,300
I mean, he's 100 feet down below in high winds, you're not going to be able to shout down

604
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,300
to him.

605
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:14,180
So he's peering up and as soon as he sees Harvey peek his head up and get in there and

606
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:19,540
not be immediately eviscerated or thrown back down, he starts climbing up after him.

607
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:21,020
You make your way up.

608
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:26,820
It is a bit of a tricky climb at times, again, because of the high winds and the icy rungs,

609
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:29,420
but you make it up there.

610
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:37,020
And sure enough, you are inside this cabin atop the tower that's got glass windows that

611
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:39,900
are rattling a bit in the high winds.

612
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:46,780
You can see outside in the darkness the shape of a variety of aerials poking out.

613
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:54,140
There seems to be a lot of wiring inside and yeah, this light up above you.

614
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:59,300
You know how that one aerial outside on the house was pointed up at this tower?

615
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:00,300
What?

616
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,980
I'm sorry, Zach?

617
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:04,980
He said aerials poking out?

618
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:11,420
Yeah, he said aerials poking out and Zach looked at me and started playing with his

619
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:18,300
nips and was like, uh, uh, uh, and then you said aerials again and it just really sounds

620
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:23,060
like aerial is, so yeah.

621
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:28,020
Did the nipples that we saw earlier, are they, uh, is there any more of them from our vantage

622
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:29,020
point now?

623
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:30,580
Are there any more on the house or anything?

624
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:37,940
Give me a spot hidden, Raul, because you are looking through heavy snow in the dark.

625
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:40,260
I pass a 21 on a 70.

626
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:43,580
Oh, so that's a good, that's a good situation.

627
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:50,060
So looking around, as you scan around the main house and the outbuildings, no, the only

628
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:55,980
aerial you can see is the one that is directly above the ballroom, but you do see something

629
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:56,980
else.

630
00:35:56,980 --> 00:36:04,540
And just for a moment in the darkness, you think you see something moving in the snow,

631
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:11,280
a large shape is impossibly as up in the air, almost as high up as you are, just moving

632
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,580
fast through the air, a dark shape.

633
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:15,580
And then it disappears.

634
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:17,460
Is it going in a certain direction?

635
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:20,540
It seems to be heading towards the house.

636
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:21,540
Good question.

637
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:22,860
But I've lost sight of it at this point.

638
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:25,700
Yeah, because there isn't any light up here.

639
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,020
It's dark and it's snowy.

640
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:31,780
Harvey is just pointing to where he last saw it and trying to get Luffit's attention.

641
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:36,280
Uh, boss, there was a thing and, uh, use your words, man.

642
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,280
What did you see?

643
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,260
I saw a big thing up in the sky over there.

644
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:42,900
It was, uh, it was, it was moving, it was moving fast, but I did, I lost sight of it.

645
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,100
It was heading for the house.

646
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:46,480
A big thing moving towards the house.

647
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,480
How big?

648
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:52,760
It's really difficult to say because there wasn't really anything to give you a sense

649
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,760
of scale as it moved past.

650
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:58,640
You think it might've been human size, but you're not sure.

651
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,600
We didn't, we didn't pass anyone, Harvey.

652
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,040
What did, what do you think you saw?

653
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,600
It had to have been a, you know, a boy, a boy.

654
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,600
It was a boy.

655
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,600
Nevermind.

656
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,600
It was just a boy.

657
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,640
A boy was, it was in the air.

658
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,960
It was, it was big though.

659
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:15,520
It was bigger, bigger than I picture most boys, but it had to have been a boy.

660
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:20,200
What else would it be up at the same level as us at this point?

661
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:30,480
Lafayette is, um, is thinking hard and tapping his suitcase, but he doesn't open it yet.

662
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,600
So is Lafayette taking a look around at the equipment here?

663
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:38,600
Yeah, he's going to start investigating what Mordant was up to in here, what he can deduce

664
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,720
that this place is for.

665
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:40,720
Okay.

666
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:47,280
Have you a choice here as to whether you use engineering or electrical repair to try to

667
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,000
work all this out?

668
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,840
Those are dead even scores for me.

669
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:51,840
Okay.

670
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:56,760
I think for flavor's sake, he's, he's looking at the electronics around here and following

671
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:01,440
wires and trying to see what is connected, you know, to what device and what it might

672
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,440
be for.

673
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:05,040
He's probably using both skills to be honest, but he's, you know.

674
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,800
But if you get an ordinary success, you'll be able to work out most of it.

675
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,400
If you get a hard success, I'll give you something extra.

676
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,200
I got a 54 on a 90.

677
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,200
Oh, close.

678
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,200
You could spend nine.

679
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,880
You could spend nine points of luck.

680
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,880
You'll learn a bit more.

681
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,880
Do it.

682
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:20,880
I will do it.

683
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:21,880
Nice.

684
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:22,880
Good.

685
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:29,120
I'm, I'm all about whittling down that luck, preferably to get you below 30.

686
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:32,080
Oh shit.

687
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,480
I forgot.

688
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,720
Can you explain why?

689
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:35,720
Okay.

690
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:42,760
In pulp Cthulhu, you can survive certain death, so you could have, yeah, you could be on top

691
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,760
of this tower.

692
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:49,280
It catches fire and the, the falling structure collapses down into the forest below.

693
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:54,040
Yeah, almost certainly killing anyone, but as long as you have 30 points of luck or more,

694
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:58,600
you can spend all your luck in one go and survive that certain death and just narrate

695
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,800
how you managed to get out of the situation.

696
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,800
Okay.

697
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,840
As soon as you have less than 30 points of luck, however, you're dead.

698
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:09,640
Well, okay, so yeah, I do.

699
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:16,960
He spends the luck and he, are you sure you want to, yeah, I'm, I'm above 30.

700
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,520
I'm doing all right.

701
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,600
He spends that luck.

702
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:25,200
He puts it all together and, and has an epiphany moment and, and what does he discover?

703
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:29,200
One thing I'll ask before you do this, do you have any points of Cthulhu Mythos?

704
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,800
I have 10%.

705
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,240
We'll see what that applies in a moment.

706
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:41,760
The first thing that you work out is that this does tie in with your working theory as

707
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:46,880
to what that other antenna was, that electrical wiring and the antenna around here do

708
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:55,840
seem to be receiving equipment for whatever is going to get transmitted from the house.

709
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:02,800
And you reckon that when the power turns up, that it is going to light up that huge light

710
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,360
up above.

711
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,040
Sorry, what light is that?

712
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,880
The huge lighthouse type bulb that is above your head.

713
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:18,000
What makes less sense to you is some of the other antennae that are around here, because

714
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:23,680
looking at the design and looking at the way everything is connected, there are a few

715
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:28,960
smaller antennae that point out in other directions that you're fairly certain are

716
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:34,400
designed to transmit, but they don't look like they're designed to transmit power.

717
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:40,400
They look like maybe radio antennae, but you're not really sure.

718
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:45,680
There's something about the design that looks weird even to you.

719
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,880
And this is where you could give me a Cthulhu Mythos roll if you want.

720
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,120
Are there penalties for fumbling?

721
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,360
Um, well, penalties, no.

722
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:58,960
Maybe a lot of fun to be had.

723
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,760
Are there ways to make the story cooler?

724
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:08,480
Right now, he just has that weird tingle at the back of his mind again, and he knows something's

725
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:08,980
not right.

726
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:14,560
But I can guarantee if he fumbles, something fun will happen.

727
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,280
You should do it.

728
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,120
Yeah, you should definitely do it.

729
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,560
It'd be weird if you didn't.

730
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,600
No, I'm not going to do it.

731
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,800
Oh, I'm sorry.

732
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,200
We should have told Thomas not to do it.

733
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:30,160
Hey, Thomas, don't do it.

734
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:30,960
I'm not...

735
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,080
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

736
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:42,320
Okay, so yeah, I mean, there's something weird about the design of these, but you can't quite

737
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,680
work out what it is.

738
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:47,280
You know, Harvey, there's something quite weird about all this, but I can't work out

739
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:47,920
what it is.

740
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:48,880
What do you mean by weird?

741
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:52,080
I mean, it's a lot of that same kind of equipment you got in your place.

742
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,680
Nothing's weird here.

743
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:59,040
Again, Harvey, I know the distinction may be subtle to one such as you, but I'm a man

744
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,520
of science, and this is weird science.

745
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:04,960
Do you need a twine on anything?

746
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,560
Maybe take some readings?

747
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,400
He's a little depressed.

748
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,840
This is more advanced than he thought Mordant was capable of.

749
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,520
He doesn't know exactly what it is.

750
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,200
He knows it might be cool.

751
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,240
It's at least big.

752
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:24,560
And he's like, oh, Harvey, this evening isn't going anything like I imagined.

753
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,560
I haven't even seen Cicero or his wife.

754
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:31,920
He dejectedly flips a couple switches on and off, and he's like, but what's the point?

755
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,480
Does anything happen with those switch flips?

756
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,320
No, because there's no power at the moment.

757
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:41,280
Yeah, the power looks like it's running from the house to here.

758
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,200
There are no power sources here.

759
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:50,640
Yeah, it looks like if you're right, and that antenna on the main building transmits

760
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:56,000
electrical energy, it looks like that powers everything that's up here on the tower.

761
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,560
You could probably roll Cthulhu Mythos to figure out more.

762
00:42:59,200 --> 00:42:59,920
Probably could, yeah.

763
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:01,520
Might fumble, though.

764
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,360
It'd be cool if he did.

765
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:04,640
But what if he passed?

766
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,600
It's a one-shot.

767
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:08,160
You shouldn't...

768
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:08,660
Yeah.

769
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:14,720
Listen, I'm not familiar with Pulp Cthulhu.

770
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:18,560
I just know that when you mess up Mythos shit and the other versions of shit...

771
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:20,400
It makes it cooler?

772
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,880
No, things go very, very bad.

773
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,040
It makes everything cooler.

774
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:28,960
We're Pulp Cthulhu heroes this time, so even when shit goes bad,

775
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,560
we're still going to be able to pull it out.

776
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,320
He can mind attack people.

777
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:33,440
Yeah, I fucking mind it.

778
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:36,640
I just feel like he's fooled everyone else in this room here.

779
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,160
He was like, no, just do it.

780
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:40,960
It'll be fun.

781
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:45,920
Scott has built an awesome roller coaster, and I just want to strap in and ride it.

782
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,640
Then you take a Mythos roll, bitch.

783
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:52,720
One thing I'll point out, though, is that in Pulp Cthulhu,

784
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,880
you can spend luck to mitigate fumbles.

785
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:55,440
That's true.

786
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,920
The fumble is only if it's a 96 or higher, right?

787
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:58,400
Yes.

788
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,680
Oh, that's fucking nothing.

789
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:00,560
Yeah, just roll it.

790
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:01,060
All right.

791
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:03,280
24.

792
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,440
God damn it, that would have been so funny.

793
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,400
24, yeah.

794
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,840
You could spend 14 luck.

795
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:09,040
No, no, I'm good on that.

796
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:11,840
Oh, Cthulhu Mythos?

797
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:12,640
I'm okay on that.

798
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:16,400
Okay, then...

799
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,000
Oh, well, hmm.

800
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,440
Cthulhu Mythos?

801
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,560
You think it's that important?

802
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:21,840
It's pretty cool, yeah.

803
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,160
No one ever passes these.

804
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,200
No, dude, I cannot spend that much luck.

805
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,880
I can't spend that much luck right now.

806
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:30,560
I'm sorry, dude.

807
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:33,120
God damn it, I've never been more disappointed.

808
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:35,920
Can I spend my luck?

809
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:40,320
I'll spend 14 of my luck to make this a success.

810
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:42,800
Next episode, if you guys want to trudge out here

811
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:46,160
and spend your luck, do your Mythos rolls.

812
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:46,560
I will.

813
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,080
I'll spend 14 of my luck.

814
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:50,320
And we'll talk to the movie stars and the senators.

815
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,480
You know, I am willing to accept that.

816
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:52,960
Fuck yeah.

817
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:53,840
The movie stars is.

818
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:57,520
You're willing to sacrifice 14 of your luck?

819
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,440
Hell yeah.

820
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,040
It's that psychic link you guys have.

821
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:12,000
Then what you pick up from this is there is something about the design of these other

822
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:18,640
aerials that is, for a start, very different from any of the other technology that you

823
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,080
can see around here.

824
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:25,600
But there is something that, as bizarre as it might sound to your obviously rational

825
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:29,200
mad scientist mind, is that it seems...

826
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,040
Sorry, we're losing you.

827
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,440
And it made a really funny sound as we lost you.

828
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,160
Yeah, it did.

829
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:36,000
You're like, as bizarre as it might sound...

830
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:43,120
Am I practicing with you?

831
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:44,720
Yes.

832
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,480
Yeah, you seem good now, yeah.

833
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:47,840
Okay, I'll try that again.

834
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:55,440
As bizarre as it might sound to your otherwise rational mad scientist mind, there is something

835
00:45:55,440 --> 00:46:01,280
about the design of these other aerials and the circuitry leading to them that looks,

836
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,360
well, alien.

837
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:08,960
You're fairly certain that the technology here, even though you may never have encountered

838
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:17,920
anything like it before, is not of this Earth, and that it is designed to broadcast some

839
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:22,560
kind of signal using means you can't quite identify.

840
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:27,520
You think that the signal that it's sending out may even be a psychic one?

841
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,200
Sanity check.

842
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:32,880
Yeah.

843
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:36,960
Do I need to take a sand check for that?

844
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,320
I don't think so, no.

845
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:44,480
You are a mad scientist, you've got weird science, so I think this is in your wheelhouse.

846
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:45,360
Awesome.

847
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:49,760
Okay, so grasping what is going on and being an intensely jealous man...

848
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:55,600
Um, Harvey, would you lend me a hand in destroying all of this?

849
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:02,800
And he wants to just smash up everything, and it's like a fit of...

850
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,800
It's like professional rage.

851
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:09,120
He can't believe Mordant has built a tower.

852
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:16,880
A, he has a bad feeling about what the purposes of that broadcast are, but B, he is just enraged

853
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:23,600
that Cicero Mordant has built this kick-ass alien radio tower, and he is going to smash

854
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:24,400
it like a child.

855
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:26,640
Harvey cracks his knuckles.

856
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:27,680
Say no more, boss!

857
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:30,160
And comes down with a Hulk smash on the nearest console.

858
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:37,280
Lafayette unscrews a knob from like a lever and chucks it at the big light bulb.

859
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:38,240
Oh, yes!

860
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:44,800
In which case, let's cut away from you two as you have your protracted temper tantrum,

861
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:47,600
and go back to the others in the ballroom.

862
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:54,080
Mr. Ring was going to have his second pass at trying to meet the senator, and this time

863
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:56,480
he is accompanied by his boss.

864
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:03,200
Can you give me listen rolls each, just to see whether you can pick up snatches of conversation

865
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,360
as you're passing through?

866
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:06,480
I got an aught too.

867
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:09,120
Oh, I also pass 35 on a 50.

868
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:09,760
Then...

869
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,920
I don't super pass, like, uh...

870
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:18,240
Yeah, well, I think what Mr. Ring picks up is just a couple of snatches of conversation

871
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:26,080
where you do hear that phrase being repeated that you heard a few months ago.

872
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:27,520
It's going to change the world, you know.

873
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:35,840
But what Cheggers picks up on a 0-2 is one of the groups you move past.

874
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:40,640
There are three people standing together, all talking to each other enthusiastically,

875
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:45,360
and they're all just looking at each other over and over again, saying,

876
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:46,880
it's going to change the world, you know.

877
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:48,160
It's going to change the world, you know.

878
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:49,520
It's going to change the world, you know.

879
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:50,880
It's going to change the world, you know.

880
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,800
It's going to change the world, you know.

881
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,480
That's so good.

882
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,080
That's so fucking cool.

883
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:58,240
Can you give me a sand roll?

884
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:02,000
I love this game so much.

885
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,840
Is my sanity equal to my power?

886
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:04,320
Is that right?

887
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:05,120
Yeah.

888
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:05,840
Initially, yes.

889
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:07,680
I pass then, 75 on a 90.

890
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,720
So yeah, you don't lose any sand for that, but it may still send a shiver up your spine.

891
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:14,480
Yeah, it creeps me out for sure.

892
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:20,560
And then I make a mental note of like, maybe Elden can get into their heads later.

893
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:23,040
Like, they seem pretty easy.

894
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:23,680
Pretty easy.

895
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:26,320
Because that's worked out so well for himself.

896
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:26,820
Yeah.

897
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:31,040
Sweat drops down from his forehead.

898
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:36,640
But honestly, the invention is pretty low on my concern level.

899
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:37,140
Same.

900
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:40,800
Senator is top priority for me.

901
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,040
So we're continuing on to Billings.

902
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:46,640
Senator is a way bigger deal than actor.

903
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:50,000
So we're going to really give our go here.

904
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:57,840
OK, so yeah, you walk over and the senator is talking to a younger woman, maybe in her

905
00:49:57,840 --> 00:49:58,560
30s.

906
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:03,200
She's very expensively dressed, wearing a nice diamond necklace.

907
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:09,360
She's perhaps not the most attractive woman you've ever met.

908
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:20,560
She's got one eye that seems to swivel around a bit and a nose that's a bit too large for

909
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:20,960
her face.

910
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:23,680
But she's got an absolutely radiant smile.

911
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:25,600
Just roasting this poor woman.

912
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:28,080
Yeah, you were really rude until the last thing.

913
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,360
He based it on your mom.

914
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:35,600
That's why it takes so much offense.

915
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,360
You could give me education rolls, the two of you, just to see whether you recognize

916
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:41,600
her.

917
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:42,960
I think I do recognize her.

918
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:43,360
I do, too.

919
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:44,800
With the 24, 54.

920
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:48,080
OK, yeah, again, you've seen her in the society pages.

921
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:52,160
This is Margaret Payne, who's the heiress of the Payne fortune.

922
00:50:52,160 --> 00:51:01,200
She is primarily a philanthropist that she's involved in a lot of humanitarian and art

923
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:01,840
charities.

924
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:07,840
And she and Senator Billings seem to be talking quite animatedly as you come over.

925
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:12,000
So, yeah, as we approach them, Eldon, you take the senator.

926
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,200
Yeah, of course, Checkers.

927
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,200
Yeah, definitely.

928
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,400
What was her name again?

929
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:17,120
Margaret Payne.

930
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:18,560
He whispers.

931
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:22,720
He's like the bag man for Checkers.

932
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:28,720
He's like, it's Margaret Payne is the philanthropist and Charlton Billings is the senator from

933
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:29,280
Vermont.

934
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:29,780
Thank you.

935
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:33,620
Miss, Miss Payne.

936
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:38,260
And she looks around and says, oh, do we know each other?

937
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:39,380
We're about to.

938
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:41,540
And I turn the charm on.

939
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:47,380
I should give you a penalty on the charm.

940
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:50,580
Well, I roll an ought to again.

941
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:55,380
Oh, my God.

942
00:51:55,380 --> 00:52:03,060
Then somehow, despite that opening, she seems to warm to you and say, oh, did we meet at

943
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:05,940
that party in the Hamptons last summer?

944
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:07,300
You do look very familiar.

945
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:12,100
I don't believe we've met in real life, but you have seen me in your dreams.

946
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:20,500
And she tilts her head back and laughs quite musically and says, oh, you are funny.

947
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:22,260
Yes, funny.

948
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:29,460
I actually have a charity that you might be interested in.

949
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:32,420
I know that you're a big, big into philanthropy.

950
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:34,980
And yeah, the last branch.

951
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:37,140
Have you ever heard of us?

952
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:42,100
The last branch, I'll tell you what, give me a LUCK roll.

953
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:45,860
24 on a 32.

954
00:52:45,860 --> 00:52:51,540
Yes, I'm trying to work out whether it would be luckier or unluckier.

955
00:52:53,060 --> 00:52:56,180
I think it's probably I think it's probably better for you if she hasn't heard of you.

956
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:56,660
Right.

957
00:52:56,660 --> 00:52:57,380
Yep.

958
00:52:57,380 --> 00:53:00,580
And she says, no, but you must tell me more.

959
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:04,100
Oh, well, we've got, you know, Miss Jermaine?

960
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:08,180
Oh, the actress, I saw her earlier.

961
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:09,300
Yeah, she's a big...

962
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:11,620
Between you and me, I'm a little bit worried about her.

963
00:53:11,620 --> 00:53:15,860
I saw her come back from the lavatory earlier and there was white powder on her nose.

964
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:16,260
Oh, yeah.

965
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:17,780
Ask this lady if she has any cocaine.

966
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:22,180
The one who's worried about them then doesn't know what to wipe out.

967
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:22,500
Yeah.

968
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:22,740
Yeah.

969
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:29,220
Well, I actually spoke to her when we arrived at the party and I got rid of that for her.

970
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:30,260
I was worried as well.

971
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:38,580
Oh, you must be such a good friend to her.

972
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:42,100
She is a very important part of our organization.

973
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:46,420
The mind is the most important part of the human soul body space.

974
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:46,660
Yeah.

975
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:52,500
So our organization serves to help free people's minds in a sense.

976
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:56,580
Oh, do you find a lot of people whose minds are enchained?

977
00:53:56,580 --> 00:53:57,540
Everybody's is.

978
00:53:58,260 --> 00:53:59,620
Yours included.

979
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:00,500
Really?

980
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:00,900
Really?

981
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:02,260
Yes.

982
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:02,500
Yes.

983
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:03,620
You must tell me more about this.

984
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:08,980
Before we get into all that, have you seen our host anywhere?

985
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:10,900
I'm a little bit worried about him.

986
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:11,780
I have not.

987
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:13,300
Have you seen him this evening?

988
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:14,020
Not at all.

989
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:15,220
And I'm a bit worried.

990
00:54:15,220 --> 00:54:16,740
Cicero and I go way back.

991
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:20,180
We were engaged, we married once.

992
00:54:20,180 --> 00:54:24,900
But tell us more about the heartbreak that must have come from that.

993
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:30,580
Well, relationships fail for a variety of different reasons.

994
00:54:30,580 --> 00:54:35,620
But I'm more concerned about how he's been in recent months.

995
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:39,540
I mean, have you seen him at all over the last year?

996
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:42,580
He's a changed man, isn't he?

997
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:44,260
I'm really quite worried about him.

998
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:52,180
I mean, we were talking about your young lady friend a little while back and perhaps indulgences.

999
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:53,860
But I'm...

1000
00:54:54,740 --> 00:54:56,900
Do you think he's indulging?

1001
00:54:56,900 --> 00:55:00,420
Is she paying to get her sins removed so that she may go to heaven?

1002
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:04,340
Eldon, quiet for a second.

1003
00:55:07,060 --> 00:55:10,420
Nobody had Luke tell Zach to calm down Bingo.

1004
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:22,500
She looks at Mr. Ring quizzically for a moment and then continues,

1005
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:25,860
Well, I'm just a bit concerned, yes, that...

1006
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:33,300
I don't know, maybe it's nothing but some of the changes I've seen in his personality

1007
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:38,180
and the changes in his health, I'm a little bit worried about him.

1008
00:55:38,180 --> 00:55:42,180
Particularly the fact that he hasn't made an entrance when this is his big night.

1009
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:44,980
And you know Cicero, don't you?

1010
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:51,540
I mean, you know how much he loves working a crowd and making new friends.

1011
00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:57,060
Quick question, when you think about his new invention, what comes to mind?

1012
00:55:58,020 --> 00:55:59,140
It's going to change the world.

1013
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:05,860
I look at Eldon and I'm like, do the thing.

1014
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:10,340
He looks back and he looks scared and he like shakes his head no

1015
00:56:10,340 --> 00:56:16,340
and like kind of like moves back away from you like a dog that did something wrong.

1016
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:19,860
I pull the smelling salt vial thing out of my pocket, I'm like,

1017
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:21,000
it's okay.

1018
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:29,060
The pained look on Eldon Ring's face as he tries to decide whether or not he can...

1019
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:30,260
Margaret Payne look.

1020
00:56:31,860 --> 00:56:36,340
As he's trying to decide, you know, whether or not he needs to follow his master's...

1021
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:41,620
Psychic attack, psychic attack, psychic attack!

1022
00:56:41,620 --> 00:56:43,300
Okay, well give me that roll.

1023
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:48,420
I legitimately feel like stunned and psychic attacked every time you do that.

1024
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:51,220
I got really excited because I rolled a 44.

1025
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:52,740
That is a hard success though.

1026
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:53,140
Nice.

1027
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:54,340
I thought it was a crit.

1028
00:56:54,340 --> 00:56:56,100
Oh, but we're not playing.

1029
00:56:56,100 --> 00:56:59,940
I am going to roll against you from your psychic opponent.

1030
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:00,440
Of course.

1031
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:02,660
Hard felt good.

1032
00:57:03,540 --> 00:57:04,420
Hard felt good.

1033
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:05,060
That's what she said.

1034
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:06,820
Wow.

1035
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:09,220
Yeah, that's an extreme.

1036
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:10,420
Oh, fucking shit!

1037
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:18,020
This time the darkness closes around your mind once more.

1038
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:22,820
And you hear this, this voice again in the darkness.

1039
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:27,540
Oh, you are a tenacious little thing, aren't you?

1040
00:57:28,580 --> 00:57:32,020
I think, I think we should play together.

1041
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:34,420
Would you enjoy that?

1042
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:35,940
Yes, sir.

1043
00:57:36,580 --> 00:57:38,340
Good, good.

1044
00:57:39,060 --> 00:57:43,700
I think while you're here, why don't you help me?

1045
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:44,760
Okay.

1046
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:46,920
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

1047
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:48,520
You'd like to help me.

1048
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:52,360
Yeah, everybody likes to be useful.

1049
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:54,040
Yes, I thought you would.

1050
00:57:55,720 --> 00:58:02,840
Well, it is very, very important that everything goes well as possible tonight.

1051
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:06,040
There's no interference, no silly games.

1052
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:08,120
I think it's important there's no silly games.

1053
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:10,440
And more importantly, that everyone is impressed

1054
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:17,000
by Cicero's invention because it's going to change the world, you know.

1055
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,760
It's going to change the world, you know.

1056
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:23,240
And you do understand how important it is to get that message out there.

1057
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:27,960
I can feel your little gifts there.

1058
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:34,120
Why don't you use them in service of me and of Cicero

1059
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:38,440
and of the glory that his invention will bring to the world?

1060
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:39,480
What's your name, sir?

1061
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:41,240
I have many names.

1062
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:44,840
I have so many names.

1063
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:46,600
That's cool.

1064
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:47,720
I gave myself mine.

1065
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:50,600
Well, isn't that special?

1066
00:58:57,240 --> 00:59:02,040
The evil voice in your head really condescended to you there.

1067
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:03,240
No, no, no.

1068
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:04,680
I felt no condescension.

1069
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:07,160
Elden Ring is like, oh, yes, to be held.

1070
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:12,120
Checkers is standing there looking at you with your eyes rolled back in your head.

1071
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:14,120
And he's like, he's nailing it.

1072
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:20,280
That's my boy in psychic warfare.

1073
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:25,240
Well, if I can count on you to help me with this small matter,

1074
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:28,440
then I'm sure we'll be great friends.

1075
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:32,280
Otherwise, I may have to punish you.

1076
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:34,600
You do understand, don't you?

1077
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:36,360
Yeah, I sure wouldn't like that.

1078
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:37,560
Good, good, good.

1079
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:38,680
I'm so happy.

1080
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:42,520
And if you're happy with me framing it this way,

1081
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:50,360
perhaps then Mr. Ring wakes up once again there on the ground with checkers.

1082
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:52,440
You're doing the spending salt trick again

1083
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:57,160
and Miss Payne and the senators standing there looking worried.

1084
00:59:57,160 --> 01:00:01,000
And standing in between them is the Reverend Nye,

1085
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:04,840
and he just smiles down at you and winks

1086
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:07,320
and just for a moment as he winks,

1087
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:09,320
you can see that his eyes are completely black.

1088
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:15,320
Fuck yeah!

1089
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:17,640
Oh, hell yes.

1090
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:18,600
Yes, yes, yes.

1091
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:38,920
I didn't know that the wind could sew

1092
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:44,920
through tissue and faggot bone.

1093
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:52,920
You were hollow when you spoke to me.

1094
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:59,400
Hollow when you said

1095
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:07,560
I thought you might be starving

1096
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:17,560
so I gave you everything.

1097
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:23,720
Thorns and rocks and devils' clothes

1098
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:28,360
and briars and private clay

1099
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:33,640
and crocus blossoms in February

1100
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:37,640
and I live in May.

1101
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:43,400
Time between a mother's fingers

1102
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:46,520
and spit off of a bridge.

1103
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:56,520
Restless legs at 3pm while waiting for a fix.

1104
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:43,320
So come back here and see what's left of me.

1105
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:53,480
Is this the wholesome girl you left in Missouri?

1106
01:02:53,480 --> 01:03:05,000
My voice is nothing now but the howl of the wind.

1107
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:10,520
Come closer dear, in my teeth,

1108
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:13,000
thread her in my jaw.

1109
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:21,720
Come closer dear, in my teeth.

1110
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:29,800
Thread her in my jaw.
