1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,700
Shoot, dang boy, I can't believe that time machine I bought off the internet actually

2
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:12,540
worked and I managed to squeeze my producer in that little thing with me.

3
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:18,520
It was gonna be a tight squeeze but my barrel of meat grease helped us slip and slide right

4
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,760
in y'all.

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:26,120
We are broadcasting live from 25 years ago in contention once again.

6
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:33,080
No matter what reality or time-space continuum we are in, we are always right here for y'all

7
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:42,720
at 694.2 PTBP, the world's only time-traveling pirate radio station.

8
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:48,840
Now this timeline's howlin' with Wolf is from At Matt Makes Messes who tweeted about

9
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:56,760
the show and tagged At Pretending Pod a remarkably helpful, cool, and easy thing to do.

10
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:03,060
He writes, Contention PD has issued a warning for residents to be on the lookout for a devilishly

11
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:10,920
handsome 6 foot 1 British man with brown hair and brown eyes who goes by At Matt Makes Messes

12
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,320
on Twitter.

13
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:19,320
This individual has been seen being too attractive for his own damn good and CPD have warned

14
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:25,980
not to approach this individual for fear of him talking to you about RPGs and other useless

15
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:29,520
nerdy shit for far too long.

16
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:35,360
If you have any information please contact Officer Poppy Cox of the Contention Police

17
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,360
Department.

18
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:44,960
Well Matt Makes Messes, you may be beautiful, you may be tall, heck you might even be British

19
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:51,280
for all I know, but I'd like to see if you can make as big a mess as I can boy.

20
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:58,000
I've made houses unlivable just by being near them, cleared out an entire neighborhood with

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,640
the stank that my mess produces, I have made a dumpster behind an all-you-can-eat buffet,

22
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:13,560
my residence, my kingdom, the rats gather around my grease-coated frame, I am the king

23
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:22,480
of mess and you will respect and fear me as I sit atop my garbage throne.

24
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,600
But thanks for writing in buddy, remember if you want to write up something for your

episodes including a Q&A session with the cast, an absurd game of Everyone is John with

31
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:10,720
Justin, a disgusting game of The End of the World with Taylor, and a cartoonishly silly

32
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:17,360
two-episode run of Magnum Vice Fury Force GM'd by Jake who voiced a young Ferguson

33
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,960
Beans on the show.

34
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:25,040
This game is so wild y'all, normally the PCs would be cops, ex-special forces or informants

35
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:31,460
sent on a mission by an angry police captain, but not this time, no Jake wanted the mission

36
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:36,260
to be doled out by the fanatic pasture of a fringe religious group.

37
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:43,700
So join Joe as Nelson Fairbanks, choir director and kung fu master, Zach as Christian, rookie

38
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:50,060
believer and youth minister, Luke as Homer Wacketts, golden boy of the youth group and

39
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:57,460
baseball prodigy, and Thomas as Mike Megabyte, church IT guy and hacker along for the ride

40
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:02,860
as they go in search of Satan in 1986 Honolulu Hawaii.

41
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:09,160
Again, that's all available when you become an honorary police officer for $5 a month

42
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:13,740
over on patreon.com slash pretending pod.

43
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:18,380
That's enough news for now, and I'm sure you're just as antsy to see what it's like here in

44
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,380
the past.

45
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:26,260
Well two things will always be true, one, shit is crazy fucked and two, Wolf has the

46
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:30,000
tunes to shake loose the foundations of reality.

47
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:38,020
So get ready, it's an oldie, it's timeless and perfect for a spineless crisis, it's Moondance

48
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:42,540
by Blue False Indigo.

49
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:53,980
She runs, she runs, she runs, she runs, she runs, she runs, she runs, she runs, she runs,

50
00:04:53,980 --> 00:05:05,420
the sun is leaving soon.

51
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:20,460
She knows, she knows, she knows, that the time has come to dance beneath the, dance

52
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:25,540
beneath the shadow of the moon.

53
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:39,500
No, is that not, they did it, it was a, it was a mash, they did a smash.

54
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:44,420
They did the mash, they did the monster mash, they did the mash, it was a graveyard smash.

55
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:49,820
They did the fuck, they did the monster fuck.

56
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:59,060
Wolf bar mitzvah, spooky scary, men becoming men, men becoming men, boys becoming wolf.

57
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:02,820
You're so bad at knowing how it works.

58
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:06,980
I'm bad at knowing how a lot of stuff works, it's October 1st guys, we're in the spooky

59
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:07,980
season.

60
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:08,980
Scary time.

61
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:09,980
It's our season to shine.

62
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:10,980
Hell yeah dude.

63
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:14,420
I think it's a perfect time to start a spooky woods story.

64
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:19,620
And if you're starting the podcast with this episode at any point in the future that's

65
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:26,420
not like the fall, I suggest you just stop and wait a year, just wait until it's the

66
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,780
spooky times.

67
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:31,380
You gotta know where we're coming from and you're just not gonna get it otherwise.

68
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:36,900
Also if you're starting the podcast now, go back and listen to him from episode one probably,

69
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,940
would be the best way to go about this.

70
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:42,420
That one's a little tricky because you have to start it in December 2018.

71
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,900
That's true.

72
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:44,900
That's true.

73
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:45,900
It'd be hard.

74
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:46,900
Can you time travel listener?

75
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:47,900
Hey listener.

76
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:48,900
If you can.

77
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,780
I appear in this room right now.

78
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:51,780
Ooh.

79
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:52,780
Oh my god.

80
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:53,780
Whoa.

81
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:54,780
Hey.

82
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:55,780
Hey.

83
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:56,780
You can't just come in here buddy.

84
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:57,780
Hello.

85
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:58,780
I am a time traveler.

86
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,580
Are you guys glad the podcast is over?

87
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:04,220
What time are you from?

88
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,380
Oh goodness.

89
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:11,820
So we're doing a new story set in the same universe.

90
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:15,300
When did I tell you guys to start working on characters for this?

91
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,300
Like three weeks ago.

92
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,300
Yeah.

93
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,300
Yeah.

94
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,300
Something like that.

95
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,300
Around there.

96
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,300
And...

97
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,300
And then we made them last night.

98
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,300
Yeah.

99
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,300
Yeah.

100
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,300
Pretty much.

101
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:29,720
When I told you guys to make characters, did you expect it to be in the same...

102
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,720
What did I tell you?

103
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,720
I told you to make High Schoolers.

104
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,220
You told us pretty much exactly what's about to happen.

105
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,440
High Schoolers in the Woods.

106
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,440
It's a prequel.

107
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,440
Oh yeah.

108
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,440
Prequel.

109
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:44,440
A while back you told us to prepare to make new characters, and I figured that our characters

110
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,200
would die and we would just come in, you know.

111
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,800
He figured our characters would die.

112
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,800
Yeah.

113
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:54,280
But we fucked up those plans in a very fun way.

114
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,400
I didn't expect to be...

115
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:59,340
Well, when you first brought it up, I didn't expect to be a High Schooler, but you know.

116
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,340
Here we are.

117
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:01,340
Here we are.

118
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:06,760
So for those listening, I have asked these boys to create High Schoolers to play a little

119
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,040
game in the woods.

120
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,820
That's where we're at for this one.

121
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,740
That's what Zach likes to do with his free time.

122
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,200
Play with High Schoolers in the Woods.

123
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,600
Take High School boys out for games in the woods.

124
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,600
Yeah, it's fun.

125
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,440
It's a good place to role play.

126
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,440
It's called orienteering.

127
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,440
I run a course.

128
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,600
How many times do I have to tell you, Thomas?

129
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,600
Fully licensed and accredited.

130
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,440
Yeah, go out to one of those team building things out in the woods.

131
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,440
Walk on a rope.

132
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,600
A lot of rope walking.

133
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,760
So much rope walking.

134
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,760
Get ready.

135
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,600
I hope you guys have rope walking as a skill.

136
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,200
I wrote it down as my craft.

137
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,200
On your character sheets.

138
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,120
I have 100% on rope walking.

139
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,240
So we sat down and made characters last week.

140
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:52,680
And just to give you guys, listeners, a parameter of what to expect here.

141
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:59,040
The whole last arc with the characters that we played, we did a Pulp Cthulhu mashup.

142
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,760
And on this one, we did not do that.

143
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:09,120
So for their characteristics, what are they called, stats, for the strength and constitution

144
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:15,540
and power and stuff, I gave them 60 points to put in, which would average out to 10 points

145
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,380
on each stat there.

146
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:19,640
Which means that they're weaker.

147
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,640
They're the worst characters.

148
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,040
Makes us a lot daintier.

149
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,040
Exactly.

150
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,040
And the hit points.

151
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:27,600
We're just helpless little teen boys, like Zach likes.

152
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,600
Exactly.

153
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,320
Out in the woods.

154
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,040
It's just because I want to teach young men how to become better men.

155
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,040
Probably die eventually.

156
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,440
I mean, everybody dies eventually.

157
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,440
Exactly.

158
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:47,480
But sooner, if I'm around and well, that hasn't been the case in the show so far, but it might

159
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,980
be coming up.

160
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:56,280
And then for the skills, I gave them 400 points to put into the different skills, which is

161
00:09:56,280 --> 00:10:00,940
considerably less than even a Call of Cthulhu or Delta Green character.

162
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:04,880
He also put the parameter on there that we couldn't have any skill higher than 50, which

163
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,640
puts another layer of squishiness on us.

164
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,640
Yeah.

165
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,640
There's a bit of squish.

166
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,480
We're just helpless little boys.

167
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,480
Just out here in the woods.

168
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,880
Is that the only thing you wrote on your character sheet?

169
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,480
What does Zach want to do to us out here?

170
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,600
Torment, scare, kill.

171
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,600
Push the narrative along.

172
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,600
All right, we got it boys.

173
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,600
We got them.

174
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,600
We got them.

175
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,920
Yeah.

176
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,920
Come on in.

177
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,920
Hello.

178
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,920
No, Zach.

179
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,920
I am a time traveler.

180
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,920
From the FBI.

181
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:40,720
All right, well, this has been going on long enough.

182
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,920
Let's dive into the game.

183
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,920
Damn it.

184
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,920
Fuck.

185
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,920
Oh, did you not want to play tonight?

186
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,920
No, I just lost the game.

187
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,920
Oh.

188
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:51,920
Fuck.

189
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,920
It's been a while.

190
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,920
Yeah.

191
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,920
All right, diving right in.

192
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:07,240
We see a high school classroom and the round clock up on the wall, like all high school

193
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:15,000
clocks, the normal analog clock says 3 30 on it.

194
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:23,960
And on the whiteboard or chalkboard, regardless, is the word detention and sitting at the only

195
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,600
desk that is occupied in the room is a boy, a helpless boy.

196
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,560
Thomas, what does this boy look like?

197
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:40,200
Like Judd Nelson in the Breakfast Club, but really young, like 13, 14.

198
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,960
He even looked young for his age, but he's still trying to put on like pretty tough.

199
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,960
So what's he wearing?

200
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,940
Denim, cut off jacket.

201
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:54,980
He's got kind of raggedy, like pretty thin Western shirt on Wranglers jeans and some

202
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:58,940
kind of punky boots and a scowl.

203
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,620
What's he doing right now?

204
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,660
Sitting alone in detention.

205
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:07,920
He's got his arms crossed and he's just staring at the clock and kind of tapping his toes.

206
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,340
And even if there were other people in this room, like he's, he would be, he's giving

207
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:15,180
off a vibe like fuck off, I've got enough friends.

208
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:18,660
Mr. Pettymore, you know that you're supposed to be doing your schoolwork.

209
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:21,660
He rolls his eyes.

210
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:24,700
The teacher also rolls his eyes.

211
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:31,980
The teacher is wearing a sweater vest and some slacks and kind of like an oversized

212
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:36,300
shirt underneath the sweater vest that's poofing out from underneath it.

213
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:42,540
And he's got horn rim glasses and he is equally scowling at you.

214
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:49,620
Then there is a knock on the door and two more young boys come into the room.

215
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:52,480
What do these boys look like, Joe and Luke?

216
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:58,500
You see Ken Krenkelhoff walk in and he's wearing a letterman jacket, but he also is like 13

217
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,500
or 14.

218
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,940
So he wouldn't, shouldn't have one.

219
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:06,140
It happens to be one that was bought for him by his dad and told that he needed to wear

220
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:09,540
to visualize himself in the future.

221
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:16,580
But he's tall and very fit and he's got a great head of hair and he walks in with a

222
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:19,420
lot of, his head held high.

223
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:22,560
He's got a lot of self esteem behind him and he's got a swagger to his walk.

224
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,960
And the teacher greets you very warmly.

225
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,980
He's like, Oh Ken, what a surprise.

226
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:30,220
So good to see you come into my classroom on a day like this.

227
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,500
How you doing, sir?

228
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:36,460
Oh, I'm doing extremely, extremely much better now that, now that you're here.

229
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:40,380
And Oh my God, look who it is, Ash.

230
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,900
Oh, my two favorite students.

231
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:48,300
Jeremy Pennymore real quick, just gives both of them like a look and pulls out his denim

232
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:51,660
jacket so the teacher can't see, but he gives them a like jack off motion.

233
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:52,660
Like, okay.

234
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,780
Like, all right, jack offs.

235
00:13:54,780 --> 00:14:01,140
Ash walks in, he is like average freshman high school height, like however tall that

236
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,980
is five something.

237
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:08,380
He's got like black hair, just kind of messily placed on his head.

238
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:14,020
He's got a white t-shirt on with kind of like a, like a sleeveless jacket vest kind of thing

239
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:17,180
that's buttoned up over his white t-shirt.

240
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:21,380
And it's a mix between like cheetah print and horn, horns, what is it?

241
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:22,380
Houndstooth.

242
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:27,740
Uh, but it's like cheetah print colored acid wash jeans and some like, uh, kind of like

243
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,980
scuffed up tennis shoes on.

244
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:33,980
And he walks in and he just kind of winks at the teacher and he looks and he sits down

245
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:34,980
at a desk.

246
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:39,240
Ash, I am, I am positive that you don't have detention today.

247
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,900
What are you boys doing in my classroom?

248
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,980
We saw that, uh, our buddy Jeremy was in here.

249
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,900
We thought we'd come keep him company.

250
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:46,900
Get back to work.

251
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:47,900
Sorry.

252
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:48,900
You were saying?

253
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:53,100
We just, uh, we had some work that we could get done and we just thought we'd do it down

254
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,480
here with Jeremy.

255
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,980
Just make sure you didn't feel alone down here.

256
00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:00,780
Ken and I have a group project that, well, my parents don't really want people, uh, to

257
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:04,340
come over until they're at home and, uh, Ken's is too far to walk to.

258
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:10,500
So, uh, we figured we just hang out here until, until, uh, we got done with our, our stuff.

259
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:15,740
Well you know that here at Silas Cole K through 12, we don't necessarily appreciate people

260
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:20,960
joining in on detentions when they don't quite have detention, might give off the wrong idea

261
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,780
that it's something fun to do.

262
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:26,940
But you know, you, you two are allowed to do whatever you want.

263
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,660
You know that Jeremy, get back to work.

264
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:31,340
Well, hey, you want me to do my schoolwork, right?

265
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,340
Yes.

266
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,340
Fuck.

267
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,340
The only schoolwork I got is with these two.

268
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,340
Jeremy cursing.

269
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:37,540
Sorry, sir.

270
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:44,140
And he looks at the two of you and he's like, are you actually going to keep him in line?

271
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:47,460
He is in our class with the, this, this group project.

272
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:48,460
Okay.

273
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:53,820
Yeah, somebody responsible has to be in here and Ken, since you're here, that's fine.

274
00:15:53,820 --> 00:16:00,020
I actually, I'm, I need to run down to the teacher's lounge real quick and okay, I'll,

275
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,740
I'll, I'll be, I'll be back shortly.

276
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,820
Yeah, we'll put it, we'll put our nose to the ground.

277
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,660
Jeremy, get back to work.

278
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:06,660
Yes sir.

279
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:11,420
And the, uh, the, the teacher leaves the room and closes the door behind him.

280
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:15,700
Jeremy flips him huge double birds as the door closes.

281
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,100
Your fingers like grow.

282
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,100
Yes.

283
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:23,260
Uh, and I knocked some stuff off his desk and I'm like, all right, let's get out of

284
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,260
here losers.

285
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,260
Jeremy, what'd you do this time?

286
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:28,060
Oh, you just know what, what's that guy's name?

287
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:32,900
Oh, my teacher's name is, uh, uh, Benji Krinklehoff.

288
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,460
Uh, no relation.

289
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:38,300
Oh, you know, there's so many Krinklehoff's in contention.

290
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,860
It's a common contention name.

291
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,580
You know, old Benji just hates me.

292
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:42,580
He just has it out for me.

293
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:43,580
Oh yeah.

294
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:47,620
Plus I called him a fuck.

295
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:55,020
You hear from down the hallway, you all ready for the woods tonight?

296
00:16:55,020 --> 00:17:01,420
I open up my like little sweater jacket thing and lining the inside is just a bunch of like

297
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,700
a water dynamite.

298
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,700
What's water dynamite?

299
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:07,100
The little red things that you can throw in water and they'll still explode under water.

300
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:11,700
Oh, they're kind of like M-80s, but they're like waterproof M-80s.

301
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:16,180
Oh, you guys were, we were, we were at, we were going to do that.

302
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,900
Uh, yeah, no, sure.

303
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:18,900
Of course.

304
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:19,900
Are you nervous?

305
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:20,900
What do you mean?

306
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,900
Yeah.

307
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:22,900
You scared old man.

308
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:27,300
I just, I thought maybe we were maybe skipping, but no, it's, it's cool, but let's do it.

309
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:30,580
Well, you might not want to see, we're going to go back to my house before we go to the

310
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:36,540
woods and I got some, I got something that I wouldn't even bring to school, that home

311
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:39,780
that explodes.

312
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:45,380
Is that a penis joke or no.

313
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:48,540
It's fireworks or maybe something more.

314
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:54,060
Uh, yeah, I mean, I'll have to talk to my mom and dad and you know, they've been riding

315
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:58,220
me lately, but it is our last hurrah for this year.

316
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:02,900
So, uh, my older brother said I could take his car out and we can drive all the way out

317
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:03,900
there.

318
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,740
He's going to be partying with his stupid girlfriend anyway.

319
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:08,780
That probably won't fly with my mom, but I'll meet you guys there for sure.

320
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:11,180
Well, you can just come over to my house.

321
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:13,180
You don't have to tell your mom.

322
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,820
I'm sorry guys.

323
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:15,820
You know how they are.

324
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:18,580
It's a sick 91 firebird.

325
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,740
It's practically brand new, dude.

326
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:25,780
Maybe next year I'll be able to ride it, but this year I've got to do what they say.

327
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:26,780
All right.

328
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:27,780
You're a fuck.

329
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:28,780
Just like Mr. Krinklehoff.

330
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:29,780
We'll see you out there.

331
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:35,160
Cursing as he comes back into the room and Mr. Krinklehoff looks at the stuff that was

332
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:40,420
on his desk that is now on the ground and he looks specifically at Jeremy Pettymore.

333
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,620
You shouldn't have left the window open, man.

334
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,580
Hey man, actually our school project, it's outside.

335
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:48,020
We got to go out in them woods and gather some sticks and stuff.

336
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,360
So I'll see you all around.

337
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:55,300
It's for our biology class with, uh, and then Ash, Ash can't think of a biology teacher

338
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,140
because he's not in biology this semester.

339
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,220
It's for biology, right Ken?

340
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,220
Right?

341
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,940
Biology, Mr. Krinklehoff.

342
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:03,940
That's what he was working on.

343
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:04,940
You trust Ken, right?

344
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:05,940
All right.

345
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:08,340
Well, Ken, if you, if you say so, that's, that's fine.

346
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:12,580
But sir, Jeremy, before you leave, you're going to be here with me tomorrow.

347
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:13,580
The two.

348
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:14,580
Okay.

349
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:15,580
I'll look forward to it.

350
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,580
Wait, no, tomorrow.

351
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:17,580
Saturday.

352
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,580
We have the, the big, uh, the big parade.

353
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:19,580
Yeah.

354
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:20,580
No, um, yeah.

355
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:21,580
Monday.

356
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:22,580
Okay.

357
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,580
Yeah.

358
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,580
Detention right here.

359
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,580
Whole time.

360
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:26,580
And you're going to work.

361
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:27,580
Don't think you're not going to work.

362
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:28,900
These two can't come in every single day and save you.

363
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:31,980
I mean, Ken's got sport practice, you know, that's true on Mondays.

364
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:32,980
That's when you do sport.

365
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:33,980
I wouldn't miss it.

366
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:34,980
You better not.

367
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:37,700
You are the best at the whole, the whole team.

368
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,700
Yeah.

369
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:41,660
And in the school, perhaps even in the state, you're one of the best.

370
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:44,820
I understand that a lot of people's hopes and dreams are pinned on me and it, uh, it's

371
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:45,820
never lost on me.

372
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:50,020
My dad said, you're the only reason that anyone would ever hear of contention.

373
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:53,380
Uh, once you're a senior bringing us to the game, the big game.

374
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:55,620
My dad always says, I'm going to put the family on the map.

375
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:56,620
That's for sure.

376
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:57,620
The whole town's counting on you.

377
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:58,620
The Krinklehoff name.

378
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:05,700
I, I know Ken that we're not technically blood related, but, uh, it would be really nice

379
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,120
to have our name shining in lights.

380
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,120
That's right.

381
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,120
That's right.

382
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,720
Benji you married into the Krinklehoff family and took your wife's last name, right?

383
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,720
Yeah.

384
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,720
And this is the nineties.

385
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,720
So that's emasculating and strange.

386
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,720
Just like you.

387
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,720
Let's go boys.

388
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,720
I think, well, what are you guys doing tonight?

389
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,720
We're already out the door.

390
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,440
Yep.

391
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:34,800
And uh, as you guys are walking down the hallway, let's get a sense of, I'm sorry that even

392
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:39,920
though we're acting, uh, I felt real animosity towards an authority figure.

393
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:48,440
Like it's just our natural relationship.

394
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:52,520
As you guys are walking down the hall, I think we've gotten a decent sense of who your characters

395
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:56,520
are, but how do you walk down the high school hallway, each of you?

396
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,520
I'm curious.

397
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,640
Uh, I'm probably kind of leading the way up toward the front, maybe even a little further

398
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,720
ahead than it would be to look like I was with these people.

399
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,120
I've got a lighter, the lighter that I'm gonna use for fireworks later in my hand and I'm

400
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:12,920
just running it down the lockers to make like a clink, clink, clink, clink, clink, sound.

401
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:16,960
I'm just on my smartphone.

402
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,600
I like that.

403
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:25,500
It's the only thing that, my only rule is no smartphones.

404
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,500
It's a school.

405
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,080
It is 1994, right?

406
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,080
Doesn't matter.

407
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,280
25 years later, 25 years earlier.

408
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,280
Yeah.

409
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,280
Okay.

410
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,280
Time.

411
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,280
I don't care for it.

412
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,280
Yeah.

413
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:42,640
That's why I decided to, on our very first podcast venture, run a role playing game based

414
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,200
around time travel.

415
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,680
Like a fucking idiot.

416
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,680
Wait.

417
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,680
What?

418
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,680
Yeah.

419
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,120
That's fair.

420
00:21:51,160 --> 00:22:00,720
So, as you guys are walking down the hallway, you see one of the upperclassmen, oh hey guys,

421
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,760
looking in his locker, putting his books up and stuff and he's like, what are you guys

422
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,760
up to tonight?

423
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,600
I mean, come on man, tonight's the night we go out in the woods.

424
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,600
You know how we boys do.

425
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,600
Oh yeah.

426
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,000
I forgot that's your guys' thing, right?

427
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,880
You guys go look for Madge or whatever?

428
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,880
Yeah.

429
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,880
That's our thing.

430
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,880
It's out of the three of us.

431
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,880
That's our thing.

432
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,880
It's certainly a thing that we've-

433
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,880
That's our thing.

434
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,880
We've done.

435
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:26,560
It's kept us together over all the years we kind of became different people, kind of started

436
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:31,080
hanging out with the little different groups, but it's the one thing that keeps us tied

437
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,080
together like glue.

438
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,200
Well, are you guys going to find her this year or what?

439
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,200
Yeah, man.

440
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,200
I mean, that's always been the idea.

441
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,200
I mean, that's the goal.

442
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,200
We're going to find her.

443
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,200
What are you doing tonight?

444
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,200
Yeah.

445
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,200
Yeah.

446
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,200
We'll find her.

447
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:50,800
Oh, I'm just going over to like, probably like the, you know, the, um, you know.

448
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,720
Hey man.

449
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,720
We'll have fun doing that.

450
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,720
Are you on weed?

451
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,720
Yeah.

452
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,720
Don't tell anybody.

453
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,720
Hey.

454
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,720
That's not cool, man.

455
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:08,600
Dare to resist drugs, alcohol, violence, resist drugs, alcohol, resistance, education.

456
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,600
Yep.

457
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,600
Yeah, sure.

458
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,600
There we go.

459
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,600
Yeah, it works, man.

460
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,600
It's real.

461
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:21,160
Brother, uh, as I said, if I ran into you to tell you that he's out and, uh, to get

462
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,160
ahold of him.

463
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,160
That's cool.

464
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,160
I could use some.

465
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:27,360
Oh, do you guys want, how should I, am I supposed to sell weed to freshmen?

466
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,680
I'm, I, I'm, I'm good for now.

467
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:33,880
Ken, Ken is suddenly pretending to like not be involved in the conversation.

468
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:37,800
He's kind of like turned around and just maybe like kicking the locker across the hall.

469
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,800
Hey Ken.

470
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,800
Ash, Ash.

471
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,840
Dude, we got to be on our toes tonight.

472
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:46,120
He's kind of waving and walking down the hall a little further now.

473
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,120
It's true.

474
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,120
We gotta, we gotta be.

475
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,120
Okay.

476
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,320
Well, Cleve Moore, we gotta, we gotta get on our way.

477
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,320
I'll see you later.

478
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,320
Yes.

479
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,320
All right.

480
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,320
Goodbye, Eduardo.

481
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,320
You know, I prefer it when you call me Eduardo.

482
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,880
It's well, it's the name I've chosen.

483
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,880
Yeah.

484
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,840
I just like to call people by their last names sometimes.

485
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:01,840
All right.

486
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,480
Well, it's rude, but I like you anyway.

487
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,480
Okay.

488
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,480
Bye Eduardo.

489
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,480
Thank you.

490
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,480
That guy's exhausting.

491
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,640
It's like talking to a fucking turtle.

492
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,640
It's like talking to Eeyore.

493
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,640
I would, I don't know.

494
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:17,560
That guy gets high every day and I personally as Jeremy Pettimore can not relate to that.

495
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:21,200
And we skip on down the hallway.

496
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:26,720
Ash and I arm in arm and we're like, what are, we're like reaching out for Ken.

497
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,720
What is the contention?

498
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,720
Ken, skip with us.

499
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,400
What is the contention high school mascot?

500
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,120
Ooh, uh, the octopi.

501
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,600
Did we ever, was it, is that cannon?

502
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,600
I think it's something weird.

503
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,120
I doubt you said it.

504
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,120
Octopus isn't bad.

505
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:41,040
It's a Silas Cole K through 12 is the name of the school.

506
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,440
And what was his industry besides orphans?

507
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,600
It could be miners.

508
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,600
The miners.

509
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,600
100% the miners.

510
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,600
Yeah.

511
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,600
We know how much Zach likes that.

512
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,600
The 40 miners.

513
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,600
Stop making that joke.

514
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,600
You're not.

515
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,600
Oh, thank you.

516
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:58,180
I didn't even get it because that's not how my mind works.

517
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:00,240
Your head was swirling with lore.

518
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,240
That's exactly right.

519
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,440
I was like, I do like mines.

520
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:07,440
Lore is the name of a young boy he's had his eye on.

521
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:11,880
It's short for Lauren, spelled like the boy name.

522
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,880
Okay.

523
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,880
All right.

524
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,880
Well.

525
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,880
Yeah.

526
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:21,040
On the way out, the mascot is a guy with one of those hard hats on with the light and he's

527
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:24,860
got the pickaxe in one hand and he's holding out his other and I jump up and I smack his

528
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:26,200
hand to give him a high five.

529
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:29,080
Except it's a huge, like it's a giant mascot head.

530
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,560
Oh, that's fun.

531
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,680
Like one of the cows.

532
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:36,960
Like it's an oversized head mascot head of a minor dude and he's just like, he's got

533
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,380
a little like foam hand.

534
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:42,800
It's important that the head is massive with a giant minor head on it.

535
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,800
Yeah.

536
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,800
That's very fun.

537
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,800
Yeah.

538
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:49,240
I jump up and give him a little high five for good luck for the team, for Ken and for

539
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,360
tonight.

540
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,360
He topples over.

541
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:55,640
He's just too top heavy and you guys head off.

542
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:13,760
All right, Luke, Ash Hornbeam, horn beam.

543
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,760
What is it?

544
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,760
Horn beam.

545
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,760
Horn beam.

546
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,760
That's fun.

547
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,040
H O R N B E A M. Horn beam.

548
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,440
And Thomas, your character is Jeremy Pettymore.

549
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:25,720
I believe we already know how to spell that.

550
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,280
A lot of people don't.

551
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,280
Ash you.

552
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,280
It's not with a Y.

553
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,280
It's with an I.

554
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:34,880
Ash, you mentioned that you have a car for the evening, I believe.

555
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,880
I do.

556
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,880
It's my older brother's car.

557
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:43,360
I think I said a 91 Firebird, which is an ugly car.

558
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,360
What color is it?

559
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:49,040
That weird like gold color from the 90s.

560
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,480
Very cool.

561
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:56,360
So as you guys are making your way out to the woods of contention for this evening,

562
00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:00,560
you're driving in this 91 Firebird.

563
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:03,320
Luke, how fast do you drive in?

564
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,320
How fast is Ash driving?

565
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,560
Am I on a main road or the dirt road?

566
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,560
It's a main road.

567
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,560
It's like a country road probably, yeah.

568
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,560
Two lane.

569
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,560
Okay.

570
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,560
I'm going the speed.

571
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:17,800
I'm going like probably 10 over till we get to the dirt road and then just pedal to the

572
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,800
metal.

573
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,800
All right.

574
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:25,780
So as soon as you turn on the dirt road to the contention woods, you put the pedal to

575
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:26,780
the metal.

576
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:31,800
I just fishtail into the dirt road and just dust is flying out.

577
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:35,440
I reach over and turn the tape deck up and Copperhead Road is blessed.

578
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,960
Oh, hell yeah.

579
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,580
Go ahead and roll a drive check for me.

580
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:43,440
When he does that, I'm like, dude, don't bust the speakers.

581
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,560
And then I look at him and laugh.

582
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,120
I'm like, it's my brother's car.

583
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:51,640
And as you laugh, you look back at the road and you see a squirrel has run out directly

584
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,440
in your wheels path.

585
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,480
I rolled a 44 on a 50.

586
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,400
Oh, okay.

587
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:02,400
My brother lets me drive his car a lot.

588
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:08,560
And you are very good at fishtailing and whipping the back end of this Firebird around.

589
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,840
And as soon as you see it, you...

590
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:13,620
So I'm still fishtailing and I see it.

591
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:18,680
So I kind of turn the wheel to where the car kind of like goes sideways on the road, goes

592
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,440
underneath the car.

593
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:25,560
I like start driving backwards and flip it around and basically do a 360 and keep going

594
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,560
straight.

595
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:34,240
The squirrel looks at you with these massive cartoonish eyes before it dips off into the

596
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,240
woods.

597
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,480
When it's staring at me, I do a finger gun and wink.

598
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:41,880
Jeremy's like, what the hell, man, are you trying to get me killed over a squirrel?

599
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,400
Hey man, they're people too.

600
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,400
And you guys pull in...

601
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,180
It's gotta be popular to everybody, huh?

602
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,960
You know, it works.

603
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,920
It actually works out really well that you rolled a crit success on your first roll as

604
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,920
Ash Hornbeam.

605
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:56,480
Bean, I keep fucking this up.

606
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,480
Hornbeam.

607
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,480
Hornbeam.

608
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,360
I want to say bean.

609
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,360
Hornbeam.

610
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:06,480
Fucking weird offshoot of the beans.

611
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,480
Yeah, exactly.

612
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,480
Yes.

613
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:13,520
Well, we don't really speak with the Hornbeam cousins, but...

614
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:18,640
So you guys pull into this parking lot, it's a gravel parking lot for the contention woods.

615
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:25,160
And there are two cars in the parking lot currently, one of which has a notice that

616
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:32,520
is taped up on the driver's side window and the other has a boot on the back left wheel.

617
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,820
What does the notice say on the car?

618
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:41,920
Move your car or we'll put a boot on it.

619
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:49,320
And you guys see that there is a little shack at the entrance, which you know is typically

620
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:54,320
unoccupied and it is like the entrance to the woods.

621
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,160
So it's where the trailhead is.

622
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,760
Is it like a park ranger shack thing?

623
00:29:58,760 --> 00:29:59,760
Exactly.

624
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:08,600
Also, there in the parking lot right next to it, next to this little shack, is a SUV,

625
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:14,240
like a Bronco, let's go with a Ford Bronco, that has got a lift kit on it.

626
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:19,140
I want to reach back into the back seat, or like into the console of the car, get out

627
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:26,400
a little piece of paper, write, please don't boot my car, ash horn beam, and put it underneath

628
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,400
the windshield wiper.

629
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:31,620
That's going to be crazy when they find our bodies.

630
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:32,900
You said like a Bronco though?

631
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:33,900
Yeah.

632
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,260
Is there any notice or boot on that?

633
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,260
No.

634
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:37,260
So fresh.

635
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:38,740
Does it look like the ranger's car?

636
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:39,740
It does.

637
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:40,740
Okay.

638
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:50,340
To just in general shitheadery and hooliganism and anger at my dad, I want to see if those

639
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,340
cars are unlocked.

640
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:52,340
Absolutely.

641
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:53,640
Do some petty theft from them.

642
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:58,800
You guys were extremely mature police officers, so I'm sure making you a freshman in high

643
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,500
school won't-

644
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:06,800
My new eyes specifically was like, yeah, this guy's got a huge chip on his shoulder.

645
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,040
Is it visible?

646
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,540
Seems like it might be visible.

647
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:16,100
And go ahead and roll a search check first.

648
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:20,900
Ooh, critical success, 11.

649
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:30,300
They are both unlocked, and in the first one you find almost nothing that has been cleaned

650
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:32,300
out perhaps previously by someone else.

651
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:36,060
Is there any like identifiable, like can we find out who the car belongs to?

652
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:42,780
It's so clean inside that it looks like someone came in and took everything out of it already.

653
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:43,780
That's kind of weird.

654
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:44,780
That is kind of weird.

655
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:54,900
And the other one you find a bunch of camping equipment, and there is in the console a title

656
00:31:54,900 --> 00:32:02,380
for the vehicle that belongs to one Stuart Feldman.

657
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:03,380
Do we know who that is?

658
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,380
No.

659
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,660
Is it registered in contention, or somewhere else?

660
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:08,980
It is registered in the city.

661
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:12,260
We didn't bring any camping stuff, should we just take that?

662
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,660
We can return it later.

663
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:17,900
Yeah, Stuart hasn't been around in a while, so it's a real nice tent.

664
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:20,340
It's the one with the notice on it.

665
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:21,340
What do you think?

666
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:22,340
We can always just bring it back.

667
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:23,340
Yeah, I mean, yeah.

668
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:24,340
I like that idea.

669
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:26,720
Do we find any liquor or anything?

670
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,220
You find liquor and a pistol with ammunition.

671
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:31,220
Oh shit.

672
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:33,220
Oh fuck, dude.

673
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,580
That's a badass piece.

674
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:42,940
Ash gets kind of nervous, but I have all those fireworks in my jacket, and then I found a

675
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:46,700
stick of dynamite at my grandpa's house, so I brought that with me.

676
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:50,100
Well, okay, we're gonna shoot the stick of dynamite later.

677
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,220
I don't want to touch the gun.

678
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:53,460
I checked the gun to see if it's loaded.

679
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:54,460
It is loaded.

680
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:55,940
Holy crap, this is awesome.

681
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:58,460
I'm gonna grab the tent and a sleeping bag.

682
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:59,460
Sure.

683
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:02,260
Can I peek into the shack to see if the ranger's in there?

684
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:09,300
Yeah, and as you walk up to it and peek in, you do see there is an elderly man sitting

685
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,740
on a stool.

686
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:16,900
It's got one of those open-air windows that he would greet you from, basically, and he

687
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:19,660
was asleep until you walked up.

688
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:20,660
Fuck.

689
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:21,660
And this is the ranger?

690
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:23,780
This is the ranger, but as soon as you poke your head in-

691
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:26,580
He's got a sweet fucking ride for such an old man.

692
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:27,580
I know.

693
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:28,580
He kind of-

694
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:30,580
Hello there.

695
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:37,060
Hi, young boys, what are you doing tonight in these woods of contention?

696
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:40,020
Well, hey Jeb, we're here for our yearly camping trip.

697
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:48,420
So you misread the situation because this is not the normal for a stranger of contention,

698
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:53,780
and you see that he's actually wearing a uniform that is issued by the state, and he says,

699
00:33:53,780 --> 00:34:02,660
Well, it says right here, Woodrow, you can call me Buzz, as that is my nickname, and-

700
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:04,260
Wait, didn't you just say his name was Jeb?

701
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,260
No, you did.

702
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:08,860
I know, but that was- I didn't make that up, did I?

703
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:09,860
I think so.

704
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:10,860
I think you did.

705
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:11,860
I thought I heard it.

706
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:13,580
You're just so good at improv that you just-

707
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:17,700
Well, and you're so bad at it.

708
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:20,620
And looking around, you see that he's got a cane.

709
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:22,020
You've misread the situation.

710
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:23,460
You've misread the situation, sir.

711
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,140
No, but-

712
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:31,460
I've already written down this man's name, and he's got a cane next to him, and you would

713
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:36,660
see looking around the little shack, there are clipboards all hanging on the wall and

714
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:44,180
at this desk, and there are fire extinguishers, axes, machetes, flashlights, hand sanitizer,

715
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:47,780
and a first aid kit, and a bunch of other stuff like that.

716
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:54,780
And you do see there is a board behind him with pictures and pieces of paper thumbtacked

717
00:34:54,780 --> 00:35:00,340
into the board, like a bulletin board kind of thing, and he says, I'm going to need to

718
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:07,420
take down some of your information, as you know, all these people been going missing

719
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:13,300
around here in contention, so we just need to make sure that we have all of the information

720
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:19,620
necessary for any people who are coming into the woods, that way we have the information.

721
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:21,300
Oh, sorry, I didn't hear you there.

722
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:25,060
Did you ever consider that a goo monster was taking them to the past?

723
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:26,500
Not even a little bit, son.

724
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,500
Are you high right now?

725
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,220
No, I was just fucking around with you.

726
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:30,900
Hey, what happened to Jeb, the normal guy?

727
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:34,940
Well, and he points back at the board, and there's a picture of Jeb.

728
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:41,140
It's a Polaroid, and there's a piece of paper behind each Polaroid, and he says, we're going

729
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:47,140
to need to take a couple pictures of you both and get some information as well, son,

730
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:48,140
what's your name?

731
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:51,660
And he holds a Polaroid up to you and snaps a picture.

732
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:57,300
It's a picture of me blinking in the flash, and then I'm like, Jeremy Pettymore?

733
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:02,860
Jeremy Pettymore, and what is your business in the woods this evening?

734
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,700
We're just going camping.

735
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,060
Okay.

736
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:11,580
Did you bring along anything with you aside from normal camping gear?

737
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:16,540
Just a keen sense of imagination and wonder and hope for the world and the future, despite

738
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:21,700
the circumstances I come from personally in my broken home, I still got a lot, I think,

739
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:22,700
to live for.

740
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:25,500
That is very nice to hear.

741
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,500
I like that.

742
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,100
I like you.

743
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:34,340
And he writes all that information down, and then he looks up and he says, one last question.

744
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:40,740
If you were to be scared and run away in some place, where might we find you if you

745
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:41,900
were hiding?

746
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,380
Probably the old caves.

747
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:45,140
Probably the old caves indeed.

748
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:49,900
And then he looks over at Ash and he says, oh, I like the jib of your cut, and he takes

749
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:50,900
a picture of you.

750
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:54,260
And it's me smiling, giving thumbs up.

751
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:56,580
And it is an extremely good picture.

752
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:59,180
You might be the most photogenic person in contention.

753
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:01,340
He says, what's your name there, sonny?

754
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:02,340
Hornbeam.

755
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:03,340
Ash Hornbeam.

756
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:04,340
Ash, Hornbeam.

757
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:06,340
All righty.

758
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:09,580
And what are you up to tonight in the woods?

759
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:15,220
Well, we take this trip every year, probably meeting a friend down there, probably going

760
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:20,300
to come down later, but me and this guy and another buddy, every year we come down here

761
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:23,060
and we, you know, just boys' night in the woods.

762
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:24,180
Yes, sir.

763
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:25,900
We've done it four years running.

764
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:26,940
Four years running.

765
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:29,140
You must be very close friends.

766
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:30,300
Oh, yeah.

767
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,420
The closest.

768
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:35,980
And did you bring anything with you this evening, Mr. Hornbeam?

769
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:38,540
That is not traditional camping equipment.

770
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:41,740
Just the tent and this sleeping bag.

771
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:44,060
But I see there's a first aid kit in there.

772
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:45,060
Could we borrow that?

773
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,940
Yeah, well, of course you can.

774
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:52,580
I normally like to keep it here with me for people who may need it later.

775
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:54,180
They come here looking for it.

776
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:58,700
It's like if your kid goes missing in the grocery store, you don't want them to go looking

777
00:37:58,700 --> 00:37:59,780
about for you.

778
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:03,100
You want them to stay as close to you as possible.

779
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:10,860
I remember one time my grandchild Poppy, he went missing in the grocery store and we never

780
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:11,860
found him.

781
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:15,300
Did you ever consider that a goo monster was taking him back to the past?

782
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:19,540
You have a funny sensibility about you and I enjoy it thoroughly.

783
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:24,780
Well, sometimes your first aid kit grows up and you just got to let it go on its own.

784
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:27,380
Same with the...

785
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:30,380
Sometimes our normal campsite's a little overgrown.

786
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:35,020
What about maybe, could we have one of those machetes to maybe cut down brush and whatnot?

787
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:40,420
Well, you're going to need to roll a persuade check to get one of those.

788
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:41,860
They're in alphabetical order.

789
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:44,860
I know.

790
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:46,660
That only helps if you can read.

791
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:48,700
That's a fail.

792
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:56,700
Well, you know, Sonny, I like to keep this one here just in case if there's any grass

793
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,940
that grows too quick around here.

794
00:38:58,940 --> 00:38:59,940
You know what I mean?

795
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:00,940
I know what you mean.

796
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:04,300
Unlike the first aid kit, you're going to keep it because you're not entirely bad at

797
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,300
your job.

798
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:06,300
Exactly.

799
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:12,340
I figure when all goes to chaos and we're desperately hunting, searching for our lives,

800
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:13,700
if that were to happen.

801
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:14,700
I hope not.

802
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:18,860
You know, I figure we can just loot this place silly once all goes to hell and we find this

803
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:20,460
guy with his head ripped off or something.

804
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:21,460
I doubt it.

805
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:28,060
And I was like, very strong and I've got my head on my shoulders tight.

806
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:34,580
My mom always said that if my head wasn't attached to my shoulders, I wouldn't be alive.

807
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:35,740
What else does your mama say?

808
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,460
Does she ever tell you anything else?

809
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:42,940
Yeah, she once told me that if you've got two birds, then why are you looking in bushes?

810
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:43,940
Why don't you tell me some more?

811
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:47,780
And as he does, I want to kind of like sneak around and try to maybe steal some of that

812
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:48,780
shit.

813
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:52,580
In order to help him, I want to pull a slingshot out, light one of my fireworks and kind of

814
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:56,420
fling it out past to create a distraction.

815
00:39:56,420 --> 00:40:00,660
That is some good old fashioned like childhood shenanigans.

816
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:03,780
I would like you both to roll stealth for me.

817
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,540
Can I roll pranks for mine?

818
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:06,540
Okay.

819
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:07,540
So Luke.

820
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:08,540
Yeah.

821
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:09,540
Dude, yes.

822
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:12,980
Luke made a skill under craft, right?

823
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:13,980
Yeah.

824
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:14,980
Yeah.

825
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:16,100
And you can craft pranks.

826
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:18,140
So that I'm crafting a prank right now.

827
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:19,140
Okay.

828
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:24,500
So first off, you're going to roll the prank first and if you succeed, then it'll give

829
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:28,500
Thomas a boost to his stealth roll.

830
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,680
That is a 46 on a 50.

831
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:33,720
I would also like to use criminology instead of stealth.

832
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:34,720
You absolutely can.

833
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:41,040
As a petty more child, like my mom and dad are just addicts and I come from a bad home,

834
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:46,480
but the uncles that I've been fostered out to occasionally are all quite criminal and

835
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,640
they're the only people I have to look up to.

836
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,880
All right.

837
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,480
So I've kind of thing or two.

838
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:55,900
Well, I'll give you a plus 40 on your criminology check here.

839
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:59,720
That would, that takes me up to a 70 and I roll a four.

840
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:00,720
Congratulations.

841
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,120
Do you guys want to describe what happened?

842
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,120
What all was in here again?

843
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,800
A lot of clipboards.

844
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,800
We've got the bulletin board with the pictures and the information.

845
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:14,880
We've got fire extinguishers, axes, machetes, flashlights, hand sanitizer, and a first aid

846
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,720
kit that is already in Ash's hands.

847
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:22,520
I have stuffed that into the sleeping bag, which I will make into a regular bag until

848
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,520
I sleep in it.

849
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,080
I would like to focus on the clipboards.

850
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,080
I'm kidding.

851
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:31,880
I'm going to grab a fire extinguisher and then a machete for everybody.

852
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,020
Does he leave?

853
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:37,260
Does he go check out the relatively big pop in the sky behind the shack?

854
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:38,260
Yeah.

855
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:44,020
So there's a, uh, you pull out a slingshot and an M80 and I light the fuse and I sneak

856
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:50,580
out of the view of the little window and like fired up probably 20 feet past the shack.

857
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:52,420
So he has to leave to go check it out.

858
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:55,380
He goes, Oh my goodness.

859
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:59,740
And you hear it and he's like, Oh, Oh no.

860
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:04,340
I, I, Oh, I'm going to be right back boys.

861
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:05,980
I need to take care of something.

862
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:11,380
And he stands up and uses his cane to walk out of this little shack and he heads over

863
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:15,640
to the restrooms that are attached to the shack.

864
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:19,660
So over the little counter, like through the window where you, where he would talk to people,

865
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:25,200
you just see like machetes and the fire extinguisher and flashlights all just like being cartoonishly

866
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,420
tossed out to Keith.

867
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:28,900
And I just catch them all in my sleeping bag.

868
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:29,900
Perfect.

869
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:30,900
Keith.

870
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:31,900
Uh, ash.

871
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:32,900
Ash.

872
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:33,900
Ash.

873
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:34,900
That's going to be fun.

874
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:35,900
So did we pretty much get everything?

875
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:38,580
Maybe one fire extinguisher just in case two of everything.

876
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:43,260
Two machetes, two axes, a fire extinguisher, three flashlights if we can get them.

877
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:44,260
Yeah, for sure.

878
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:47,180
Uh, and then hand sanitizer, hand sanitizer.

879
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:48,820
And then I kind of want to take a look at the board.

880
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:54,740
So looking at the board, you see lots of different types of people from contention.

881
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:59,980
We recognize many of them because this is an extremely small town and you would know

882
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:08,420
that a lot of people have been going missing over the past month and the contention police

883
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:13,340
force is seemingly doing very little about it.

884
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,180
They're not even really talking about it.

885
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:19,100
Well they just assume it's contention realm spring where everybody goes out to the city

886
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:24,300
for six months and you know, lives a sinful liberal life.

887
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:26,220
Yeah, exactly.

888
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:27,220
Learns about the world.

889
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:29,060
So how many people are missing?

890
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:30,060
18.

891
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:31,060
Holy shit.

892
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:33,580
Is there anybody I don't recognize or anybody who really stands out?

893
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:39,380
Yeah, there is a, there's one guy who is named Stuart.

894
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:40,540
What did I call that guy?

895
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:41,780
Stuart Feldman.

896
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:52,420
Stuart Feldman is a bald guy with an extremely thick jaw line and he seems to be upper middle

897
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:59,980
aged but in incredible shape and looking at his information, he said that he was out

898
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:06,500
in the woods on business and he is a Brit.

899
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:07,500
It is noted.

900
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:11,140
This is kind of, this is kind of weird here, Ash, right here looking for madge.

901
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:16,340
I think we might've stumbled on some, some kind of a young adult coming of age bonding

902
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:17,340
mystery.

903
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:18,340
I agree.

904
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:21,020
What's a, what's a British guy doing in contention?

905
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:22,700
I don't even know what that is.

906
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:28,460
I that's because you are always in detention and not doing your homework.

907
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:32,660
Hey, you know, but Hey, I didn't know enough about geography than I can point it out on

908
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:33,660
a map.

909
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:34,820
I can't tell you why he's here though.

910
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:37,900
That's like a three or four hour drive from England.

911
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:38,900
Here's a little map.

912
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:40,460
Here's a globe sitting on his desk.

913
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:41,760
Could you point to that?

914
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,340
And I point to Ireland.

915
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:46,640
That's pretty close.

916
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:50,140
If you were playing Keith, that would have been like an absolute win.

917
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:51,140
Yeah.

918
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:55,660
Uh, and then the last, the last thing I want to look for, um, are the keys to the Bronco.

919
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:56,660
Okay.

920
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:57,860
Do I see those in here anywhere?

921
00:44:57,860 --> 00:45:01,940
Uh, roll another search check for me there.

922
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:04,620
17 on a 50.

923
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:05,620
You do.

924
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:11,460
You see the keys to the Bronco and they are attached to the keys for this shack seemingly.

925
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:13,460
I'm going to go ahead and pocket all of those.

926
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:14,460
Are there any more keys?

927
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:15,460
Nope.

928
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:16,460
Okay.

929
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:20,340
I'm a little, uh, kind of like nervous, but I don't say anything about it.

930
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:21,340
Hey, come on man.

931
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:22,340
It's a role playing game.

932
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:23,980
It's just, that's what I'm doing.

933
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:26,980
We just thieve in stealth.

934
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:35,400
The door opens to the bathroom and you guys hide all of your stolen items and buzz comes

935
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,100
back and he says, yeah.

936
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:39,260
And one more question there.

937
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:44,700
If you were to go missing and running off somewhere, where would you be hiding?

938
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:45,700
Ash?

939
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:47,540
I'd be with, uh, with my friends.

940
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:48,860
So I assumed the caves.

941
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:49,860
Yeah.

942
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:52,620
I mean, that's where we, that's where he said he'd be.

943
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:54,260
That's where I'd go hiding.

944
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:55,260
All right.

945
00:45:55,260 --> 00:46:00,340
And I'm not too familiar with these caves, but they are, where are they?

946
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:05,020
They're in the far west of, yeah, in the, in the, in the northwest corner of the park

947
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:06,020
on the globe.

948
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:08,020
I point to contention.

949
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:09,340
I'm like, they're right here.

950
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:10,340
I hit there.

951
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:11,340
Yeah.

952
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:12,340
See?

953
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:13,340
Okay.

954
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:14,340
All right.

955
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:15,660
You're learning.

956
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:16,660
Yeah.

957
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:21,940
He writes it all down and then he sticks your guys's pictures up on the board along with

958
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:24,340
the information behind them.

959
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:26,700
And he says, all right there.

960
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:33,940
Well, welcome once again to these here fine woods of contention and be safe out there.

961
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:38,740
If you find any one of these people and he like points at all the people whose pictures

962
00:46:38,740 --> 00:46:43,280
are now around your picture, you know, let us know.

963
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:47,280
Can you take a, can you take a picture of those pictures and give it to us?

964
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,480
So we might have a reference.

965
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:54,400
I can absolutely spare one, a single Polaroid, a single Polaroid.

966
00:46:54,400 --> 00:47:02,320
I'll just have tiny little pictures we can't fucking see on it.

967
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,240
I got, I got, we got young eyes.

968
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:05,240
Is it yet?

969
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:06,240
Is that Stu?

970
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,240
I think so.

971
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:12,000
Hey, sometimes I'm doing real good about pretending to be a child and sometimes I'm out, but that's

972
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:19,760
cause I'm going through puberty and you guys head off to your normal camping spot.

973
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:20,760
I would assume.

974
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:25,920
Is it like a drivable trail down to there or is it walking on like, it's so we know

975
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:31,960
that it is a trail that can handle a four wheeler and it is technically wide enough

976
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:37,000
to handle a vehicle as well, but it's not, you're not supposed to, yeah, we'll leave

977
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
the car here.

978
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Right.

979
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
What do you think Jeremy?

980
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Oh yeah.

981
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,920
We already stole all this shit.

982
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:48,000
We don't want to like attract more attention by just driving over the, the parking barrier.

983
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,600
My brother would kill me if we fucked up his beautiful car.

984
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:52,560
Your brother's going to kill you one of these days anyway.

985
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:53,560
He's a fucking maniac.

986
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:54,560
I know.

987
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:57,160
But uh, well he lets me borrow his car, so yeah, he's pretty cool.

988
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:58,160
For now.

989
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:03,720
Uh, Hey also look, look, look at what we got from, from the car and I, I waved the little

990
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:04,720
liquor flask.

991
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,480
You know what I'm saying?

992
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:07,480
Yeah.

993
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:08,560
I flashed the flask at him.

994
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:10,040
It's a massive flask.

995
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:11,560
It holds like half a fifth.

996
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:18,680
Oh, I look at him and I look at him and I kind of smile and I'm like, well, and out

997
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:25,400
of my back pocket, I pull out a great mad dog 2020 and I'm like, I'm like, we're prepared.

998
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,040
Is tonight the night we become men?

999
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,040
I think so.

1000
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:29,040
I think it is.

1001
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:51,440
So as Ash and Jeremy are heading down the trail, who's got a better survival skill between

1002
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:52,440
the two of you?

1003
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:53,440
I have a 30.

1004
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:54,440
Fuck.

1005
00:48:54,440 --> 00:49:00,040
I thought we were still playing shit back and I was like, I've never heard this at all.

1006
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:03,160
It's like, this is insane.

1007
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:07,920
The look on your face when you, your eyes were like bugging out of your head.

1008
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:08,920
Legit.

1009
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Why does he look like that?

1010
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:17,560
He repeated the same words for the start of it and I was like, okay, we're listening back.

1011
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:18,560
Shit.

1012
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:19,560
Okay.

1013
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:22,560
That was spooky.

1014
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:24,560
I've got a 50.

1015
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:28,560
Okay, Thomas, go ahead and roll a survival check for me.

1016
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:29,560
19.

1017
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:30,560
Congratulations.

1018
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:36,680
You notice as you're walking out there, you've been in these woods a fair amount of times

1019
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:46,920
and you see that there are tracks on this trail and you are pretty positive.

1020
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:53,000
It looks like a car, some sort of vehicle and a smaller vehicle like a four wheeler

1021
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,120
have both driven down this trail.

1022
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:57,360
Here's something weird, man.

1023
00:49:57,360 --> 00:50:02,720
Looks like both a car or some kind of large vehicle and a four wheeler both driven down

1024
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:03,720
here recently.

1025
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,960
When I look down, I'm like, oh yeah, I see it too.

1026
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:08,440
Damn, we should have driven down here in my brother's car.

1027
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:11,120
Yeah, I don't think that old guy pays too much attention.

1028
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:12,120
Obviously not.

1029
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:13,600
We're pretty far down the trail anyway.

1030
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:15,840
He probably won't be giving us any trouble tonight then.

1031
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:17,840
That's true, yeah.

1032
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:21,440
Or come to our aid in case of emergency.

1033
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:23,200
Good thing we got that first aid kit.

1034
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,440
Yes and hand sanitizer.

1035
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:28,200
And liquor that we can pour on any wounds.

1036
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:32,120
So when you guys get to your normal camping spots, what do you do?

1037
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:33,120
How do you set up camp?

1038
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:35,800
I start building a fire right away.

1039
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:41,840
Okay, you notice immediately that there is no wood waiting for you.

1040
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:48,320
Normally the contention woods, each camping spot has enough wood for a fire waiting for

1041
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:51,040
people to come start a fire.

1042
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:53,240
And you got a fire pit, but there's no wood.

1043
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:56,640
Damn, good thing there's that log over there and we have an axe.

1044
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:58,920
Yeah, go ahead and chop that up.

1045
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:00,080
You want to help me?

1046
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:01,080
No.

1047
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:07,280
Okay, well I go and start chopping at this log that's 20 feet away from the campsite.

1048
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:09,680
I know how to lat fire us, I don't know how to create them.

1049
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:13,320
So while he's chopping wood, what are you up to, Jeremy?

1050
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:19,960
I think it's kind of weird that there's no wood here, especially like Jeremy called ahead.

1051
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:22,760
He like made this reservation weeks ago for this spot.

1052
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:29,960
Like it was a weird amount of initiative for a 14 year old, but yeah, I'd like to reserve

1053
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:35,000
camp spot number B-15, it's Jeremy Pettymore, we come out there every year.

1054
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,960
Make sure he has some wood for us.

1055
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:39,480
I think it's pretty weird.

1056
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:42,080
I'm a little frustrated, but I also want to look around.

1057
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:45,000
I want to do a little search of the area to see what else is different.

1058
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,920
All right, go ahead and roll a search for me.

1059
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:47,920
89.

1060
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:48,920
I do not succeed.

1061
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:49,920
All right.

1062
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:58,000
So you go looking around in the woods in the area and everything seems to be about normal.

1063
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:02,840
And Luke, while you're chopping the wood, I'm going to have you roll an alertness check.

1064
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:05,640
42 and a 50.

1065
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:06,640
All right.

1066
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:23,280
Thomas, if you could leave the room.

1067
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:28,880
So I'm chopping at this log and it's just usually the wood is like real nicely chopped

1068
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:30,560
and easy to make fires out of.

1069
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:37,560
I just have like some just misshapen giant pieces of wood that, you know, will eventually

1070
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:38,560
start a fire.

1071
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:40,400
But I've never done this before.

1072
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,360
Disheartened by your attempt.

1073
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:46,040
Turn around and I just sit on one of the big pieces that I've chopped and just kind of

1074
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:47,040
take a break.

1075
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:57,280
As you're sitting there, you hear a rustling and then you see a man's head pops up from

1076
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:04,200
behind one of the bushes, alert ears, looks left, looks right, looks, makes dead eye contact

1077
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:07,520
with you and pops back down under the bush.

1078
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:10,800
My heart stops and my palms get sweaty.

1079
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:11,800
Are your knees weak?

1080
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:12,800
Are your arms heavy?

1081
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:13,800
There they are.

1082
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:14,800
Mom's spaghetti

1083
00:53:42,800 --> 00:54:10,800
The time has come to dance beneath the dance beneath the shadow of the moon, ooh, ooh,

1084
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:28,160
ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh with the howling wind.

1085
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:38,300
The sun has come again.

1086
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:50,300
Her eyes, her eyes have seen it all.

1087
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:58,300
The wonders of, the wonders of the shadow of the moon.

1088
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:22,300
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
