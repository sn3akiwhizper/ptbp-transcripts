1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,280
What's good my spawn? It's your mom Wolf the dog, and I am here to provide

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:11,400
Sustenance in the form of a radio show. Will it nurture your organs?

3
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:19,800
Maybe. Will it feed your brain? It better. Will it deliver you all unto the great void?

4
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,680
I actually do not know

5
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,680
I

6
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,480
Hello one hello all

7
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,000
Hello, y'all. It's your best friend with the trash-eating problem wolf the dog

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,160
It is December 6th, and the time is five o'clock y'all

9
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,620
Sounds like it's about garbage been o'clock for your wolfy boy

10
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:49,580
Now speaking of trash earlier

11
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:55,760
I took my dog wolf the dog to go find him something to fill his big old belly up with

12
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:02,980
But upon venturing outside the sky suddenly darkened all around us for a little bit y'all ever seen an eclipse

13
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,180
it was like that but uh

14
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:11,240
Different it was real spooky y'all wolf nearly shit his big-ass britches

15
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:17,320
Which wolf did that I'll let y'all figure that one out when I came back down to the studio

16
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:21,520
I found a note attached with a thumb tacked to the inside of my door

17
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:26,880
It is emblazoned with a solid green triangle and says for wolf at the top

18
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:33,800
I guess it's this week's howlin with wolf it comes from user chuckling boy over on the subreddit

19
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,040
He's an Android user

20
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:42,200
But logged on to iTunes on his computer to leave a review this boy sure knows how to make old wolfy blush

21
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:48,260
Chuckling boy writes the cowboy years introduced a turn of phrase for dealing with a shitstorm

22
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,760
We called it a night at the Opera you boys have taken care of a few off-screen

23
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:57,740
But damned if your debut isn't like the Mets own debut Faust

24
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:03,900
Somewhat fitting isn't that and remember the mission is over when the world ends

25
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:08,620
For all of you out there listening be sure to stop by the subreddit

26
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:16,000
We are starting to see more discussion around the greater Delta green cannon as well as game running tips and general show

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
stuff see y'all there

28
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:20,340
Wolf bless you chuckling boy

29
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:26,140
I think you're smooth like butter like a criminal undercover hot like summer

30
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:31,420
y'all make me sweat like that when you tag us on Instagram or Twitter at

31
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:37,080
Pretending pod all right a five-star review on Apple podcast that's good, too

32
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:42,500
Fuck a whole lot of people, but especially those with influence who propagate

33
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:48,660
Anti-science rhetoric it's time for the news a tall gaunt

34
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,220
humanoid figure

35
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:57,620
Where an older version of himself just stood

36
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:02,780
None of that made a lick of sense to me, but that doesn't mean I'm not hungry

37
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:08,100
Filling me up always is kudzu with no backbone

38
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,620
You

39
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:41,020
All see yourselves existing in this infinite

40
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:49,420
Darkness and you feel eyes on you all over you and out of your own bodies floating in this vast

41
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:52,060
nothingness in this endless void

42
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,420
You see a hand

43
00:03:54,420 --> 00:04:01,780
stretching out of darkness and in the palm of this hand a small metal sphere a ball

44
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:07,300
Suddenly long and wiry metal tendrils begin shooting from this round

45
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:15,100
Shape the wires wrap their way around this hand holding the silver object and begin tightening the grasp

46
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:21,140
Constricting until the skin on this hand peels open at each strip of wire

47
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,860
Bleeding out into the nothing and this hand

48
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:28,860
unable to hold the ball any longer falls and

49
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:35,780
disappears and with no platform no support the silver sphere to begins falling a

50
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:39,780
line of bodies forms in its downward

51
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:47,060
Trajectory hoping to slow its descent the bodies are human men women children and their fashion

52
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:55,220
Follows a distinct pattern the first bodies are dressed like pioneers in the Old West you recognize one as

53
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,540
the founder of contentions wife

54
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,340
Mary Cole

55
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:07,020
the next looks to be from the turn of the century then the roaring 20s the Great Depression then looks from the

56
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:11,060
Mid-century and eventually you see modern clothing as you know

57
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:15,980
It far down at the end of this line and this small metal sphere this ball

58
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:21,300
Cannot be held for long on top of each of these bodies before its wire arms

59
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,900
Decimate the skin until there's no more blood left to drain from this

60
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:32,020
Biological shell or the round object simply blasts its way through its short-lived host

61
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:36,740
Either way the blood from previous bodies above

62
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:39,460
trickles at the start

63
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:47,240
Eventually pouring down onto those below before the subject of this story even makes it to them and finally

64
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,700
the lowest body a

65
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,980
young girl

66
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:54,660
Receives this hellish gift

67
00:05:55,540 --> 00:06:03,460
The ball buries itself into her forehead and the vast nothingness is blown away by a new

68
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:07,380
Setting this girl is running through the woods. It's raining

69
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,740
She seems to be chasing a teenage boy

70
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:17,240
The girl lifts a machete that flickers in the glint of the moonlight and the boy turns around just in time to watch as

71
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,240
She brings the sharp blade down

72
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,540
over her head

73
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,900
But

74
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:29,540
She trips and she drops the machete which plunges perfectly into a crack between two stones

75
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:33,460
Blade facing up and this young girl falls face first

76
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,060
splitting open her skull

77
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:40,380
revealing a small metal sphere sitting inside

78
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:48,140
The scene changes again and the only image that remains is the cleft head of this young girl

79
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:53,940
Now sitting in a storage tub atop a folded bloody suit

80
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:59,560
But time has not treated this head. Well, it has been removed from her body

81
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,380
the skin decayed and

82
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:06,460
slumping over the bones in her face completely

83
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:15,100
Unrecognizable and we see John Lee Pettymore the fourth who's plucked the silver ball out of this corpses dome

84
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:17,540
And he pops it in his pocket

85
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:20,420
And your vision fills with water

86
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:29,080
Sitting on top of all this water is a desk and sitting on top of this desk is the small metal sphere as well

87
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:36,380
As an odd-looking old-timey revolver with glass tubes on the cylinder and a green light lit in front of the desk

88
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:41,800
Rosemary dives for the gun and snatches it behind the desk

89
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:46,520
Marvin Glass reaches out one of his spindly arms and with the flick of his

90
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:50,140
Translucent hand he flings the ball at her

91
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:57,060
Suddenly multiple shiny limbs extend from the small metal sphere and slam into the body of its target

92
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:04,000
Rosemary one of its appendages slices into the soft tissue on the back of Rosemary's neck

93
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:10,200
Another snaps her head forward and you hear the fracture as a third metal tendril reaches in

94
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:16,000
Gripping the top of Rosemary's spine where it meets her head and it rips her entire

95
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:22,560
Spinal cord out of her body in one swift motion promptly forcing itself into the now

96
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:25,940
vacant spinal column of this human being

97
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:34,660
The new Rosemary standing before you has a crazed look in her eyes as she blows her nose

98
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,160
into her hand

99
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:40,440
Slams the mucus black shiny

100
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:48,040
Fiscus into the empty chamber and squeezes the trigger on this odd-looking revolver

101
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:55,640
There's an almost blinding flash of light that illuminates your entire field of vision and then

102
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:00,400
Covering the spot where Rosemary just stood this black

103
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,360
shiny

104
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,360
Fiscus sludge

105
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,080
Oozes and

106
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:13,560
Seemingly inside this muck is the placid body of Rosemary

107
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,160
she is lying peacefully as

108
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,840
Her limbs seem to fold into this ooze

109
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:27,640
becoming one with the sentient mass of goop and

110
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,200
then

111
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,880
You all

112
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,880
Wake up

113
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:41,040
You've felt this feeling before the shock your stomach feels weird and content your ears are

114
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,120
Ringing it's dark. It's cold

115
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:52,640
And it smells like burned flesh which immediately brings you back as your eyes begin to adjust

116
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:59,560
there's a pool of blood on the floor and next to it is a coffin on the ground an

117
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:04,480
Ari Manstein's mausoleum where you've woken up before you look at each other

118
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:10,480
there's blood splatter speckled on each of you John Lee Kevin Lee Pettymore the thirth and

119
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:19,200
All-black tactical gear Keith Vigna in his brightly colored polo and boat shoes Clark Bishop and an old

120
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:23,520
contention PD uniform currently holding a thick

121
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:27,920
Black cloak and the shock begins to wear off

122
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:34,280
You feel the searing pain on your chest on your back

123
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,960
on the bottom of your left foot and

124
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:40,040
inside your dominant palm

125
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:48,160
Welcome back to contingent boys or rather the city cemetery

126
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,360
Holy shit

127
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I'm getting sick of this shit

128
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,880
Uh

129
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:05,160
Clark is looking bewildered at everybody. Are we back? What's the last thing you guys remember?

130
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,600
John and I know we

131
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,640
We found we found my parents old book you

132
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:21,400
Where it was right under my nose the whole time. Is it it's in my house. Well, what's in it? I

133
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,400
Mean I

134
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,480
Power I guess

135
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,080
It lets you it lets you do things it's

136
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,680
What's what's your last memory Keith? What happened when you?

137
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:40,040
Crossed through the door. Oh my god. I I have vivid

138
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,840
vivid memory of

139
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,200
falling through the door

140
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,740
landed on the pastor I went

141
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:53,260
through some of those doors down there and went down an elevator and I

142
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,540
Got to our room doors in an elevator

143
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:02,860
Opened a few doors and what I got I got into a room and found

144
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,100
Well, I found

145
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:15,040
Some papers and I found the gun and I saw Tilly B, but she was

146
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,040
Very

147
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,080
Much worse for wear

148
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,560
how so

149
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,280
well, she just her hair was falling out and her

150
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,560
skin looked thin and almost translucent and just

151
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,800
she didn't have any fingernails and oh

152
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,720
man, I I

153
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,440
found a

154
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,080
spell on

155
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:43,920
One of those papers and I I said it and my my fingernails popped off

156
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:52,200
And I checked my hand real quick and you have fingernails. Thank God. Wait was was Tilly be alive. She was alive

157
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,200
She was acting like a monster

158
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,680
or

159
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,560
like a caged-up

160
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,480
animal she was

161
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:05,680
Behind a door like a blast door, but I didn't open it up. She was screaming and making crazy noises and

162
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,680
after I cast that first spell I

163
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,560
figured it worked and

164
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:19,380
Figured you know magic works. So I I cast this cast a spell that that Mildred Mitchell had on her and

165
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,600
my god my I

166
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,240
Feel I want to feel my arm

167
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,640
You can feel the metal

168
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,200
underneath where muscle should be when I cast that

169
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:40,040
My arm and chest and face ripped open and all the metal that was in me popped out and I pre grew my bones

170
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,040
They just popped back in

171
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:49,240
At that point I kind of lost it and I pulled the trigger on that gun and

172
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,040
Guys I was Silas Cole. I

173
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:02,320
I found it contention. I own them. I own the mine and I

174
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,920
I'm made I made Mary

175
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,740
Mary's a ball you made Mary Cole

176
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:20,120
Mary I think it gets real fuzzy after I pull that trigger, but I

177
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,040
Don't know if there is a Mary Cole

178
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,560
Mary is is ma are why she's a ball

179
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,480
She's one of those silver balls

180
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,920
Why did you what do you ma are? Why what I?

181
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,680
Well, I

182
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:44,500
It's fuzzy and it's not at the same time when before I pulled that trigger. I found paper

183
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
with the

184
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:53,840
It had a through X of what looked like failed attempts of making something and

185
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,020
the last one was

186
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:01,600
looked like a success and it was M a are why

187
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,600
Like

188
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:10,920
You ain't got no alibi you're Mary what what you're Mary I

189
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,840
Had to off the dog make that same

190
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,480
Really yep, damn it I

191
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:29,060
Made him do it. I made him. I made him make Justin

192
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:33,420
Every once in a while put in a joke that I'm like hi you motherfucker

193
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:41,880
Hey Luke, are you using your internet from your house or your hotspot my hotspot? Is it bad? Yeah, maybe use the other one

194
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:47,460
Okay, I will until your robot voicing hard which made that agonizing and wonderful

195
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,580
Okay

196
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:55,160
I'm on regular internet now, so

197
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:01,280
Fingers crossed it stays on so did you get most of that or should I go over it?

198
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,320
Just with you guys I got the gist of it

199
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,020
There was one thing that you cut out for that

200
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:10,240
I was here Oh your but did you say your your metal popped out and something about your bones?

201
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:16,040
My bones grew back grew back. Oh shit. I thought you said everything popped out

202
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:20,280
Metal and bones but your grunts, okay

203
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:24,960
It feels like I'm still got metal in me now, so there might be there might be a way back

204
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Yeah, I mean to what we were

205
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:35,120
Yeah, I wouldn't I don't know if I'd recommend going through that again, but let me see that watch you son of a bitch

206
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:40,320
Thankfully, he doesn't wake up with the watch you had to go get it in contention. Thank God

207
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,700
But yeah after I pull that trigger I have vague memories of

208
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:50,060
Starting the town and having the mine and

209
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:53,900
making stuff that helps people and you know

210
00:16:54,720 --> 00:17:01,860
Wow, you didn't go all evil anything. Did you I don't know it just gets up to a certain point and then it's nothing

211
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:07,220
I can't remember probably not you probably just did good. How do you know how to make stuff? You know how to make stuff?

212
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:13,020
Now yeah, like I said, I've been secretly competent this whole time like I said the

213
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:17,600
Once I've pulled that trigger it all gets super fuzzy. I just

214
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:22,660
Make us all right now. It's almost like I wasn't doing it. It's like I have the memory of

215
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:26,420
Like somebody else, but I know it was me

216
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,140
Cuz I felt going back in time

217
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:35,340
I've felt it but are you sorry saying that you didn't have the capability to to change anything. I

218
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:38,940
Don't know what apparently not I've you know

219
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:43,500
I was feeling a little crazy when I pulled that trigger

220
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:48,860
Like if I had a meter of sanity, there was nothing else to lose in it

221
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:56,420
Almost as if my decisions were not my own but a higher beings. I know that feeling sure sure. Yeah

222
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:05,740
You're talking about the the gun with the tubes on it, is that what you're saying that was the one yeah

223
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:09,900
But at the same one, I don't know if it it's either the same one or

224
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:17,100
Or it's gotta be it's gotta be a replica. But I mean, I think that room I was in down there. It was some sort of like

225
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:22,420
Science lab for Silas Cole, which was me

226
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:26,940
But I didn't know it until I became Silas Cole

227
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:35,300
but then I must have remembered the diagrams and made them from what I remembered again and then

228
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,740
It's a made more of them

229
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:43,180
Is one of them dang old bootstrap paradoxes it sounds like

230
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,420
It does sound like that Keith

231
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,580
Shit I haven't gone by Keith in a while

232
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:54,100
That's weird

233
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,300
and he just looks off into the distance like

234
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,940
way deep in thought

235
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:02,340
So do you reckon that Adams Cain Adam Cain's?

236
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,340
I

237
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:13,420
Reckon Adams Cain got him through all this. Yeah, I was thinking Adams Cain like there's multiple of them and that's what you say

238
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:17,540
Like courts martial

239
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:25,060
You you reckon then that Adam Cain's whole plan would it would have been destined to fail if

240
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:28,360
He wouldn't have been able to change anything in the past. It sounds like

241
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:32,940
You guys think that that was a viable option maybe everything is

242
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,120
Predetermined I thought of

243
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:42,760
Science experiments and stuff not philosophy. So the gun is behind the door

244
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,800
that's right, and I think that watch opened it up because

245
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:53,360
Right when I got down there the other door open when my watch was close to it and I told you John and Adam Cain

246
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,840
Has the radio and the helmet right now? I guess he does

247
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,920
He's probably I bet he did that earlier than just right now

248
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:06,560
Seemed like by the time we got back there. He'd been consolidating all this shit for a few days

249
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:09,960
He really yeah made hay while we were away, you know

250
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:15,600
Once you time travel this much it's real hard just to determine where you are when you are

251
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:22,040
Speaking of and I look at my watch. What time is it in the mausoleum now 5 p.m. Yeah. Sorry

252
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,960
Do you want to guess 5 p.m. I bet it's about 5 p.m. Oh my god. Yep. That's it

253
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:32,320
So in the past we've woken up at 3 and 1 and 11. Yeah. Yeah as a number 4, baby

254
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,360
So it's 5 o'clock

255
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,200
What do you reckon? We're doing right now like not us but

256
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:42,940
Us God are there are there three other us is running around?

257
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:50,000
As we speak that's kind of been our operating theory so far. Yeah, maybe we're the ones who just let ball

258
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,240
Take care of everything. Look at your body. Look at your body

259
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,220
Do we have anything crossed out this time and I'm looking at all the yeah names

260
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:03,420
Before you had seen that Marvin on each of your chests were crossed out and you confirm that

261
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:09,240
You saw that Maggie on the bottom of your left feet were crossed out

262
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:16,360
Which you also confirm and Clark you again see the eaten away logo for the circle of knowledge

263
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,100
On your back was drew

264
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:24,680
Which you all see is crossed out when you check each other's backs

265
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:30,380
Check for ticks too and inside the dominant palm of each of your hands

266
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:34,580
It says Tildy and that is also

267
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:38,340
Crossed out. Oh shit. That last one was a twofer

268
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:45,300
Well, this this it kind of seems like we got a freebie boys to just tie this all up

269
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:50,340
Well, so Drew's crossed out what what ended up happening with Drew? Oh, yeah

270
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:53,260
You don't even know what happened after you went down in the hole. No

271
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:58,340
The pastor might yeah. Well, that's in the future past

272
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:08,760
Wait, what about the pastor's future past? Well, I left him down there with two bullet holes in his feet, but I propped him up

273
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:13,860
You kind of glossed over that

274
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:18,660
Remember you said to shoot him so he didn't follow me and I did and then you said

275
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,700
Literally, yeah

276
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:26,420
Yeah, was he ever he was he was still knocked out unconscious the last time you saw him

277
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:33,460
Yeah, and I reckon if I went back in time and all that probably nobody else got there that got down there to him. So

278
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,820
oops

279
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:39,020
But yeah withdrew what happened withdrew

280
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:45,640
What happened what happened with everything after I went down there when when's last you saw drew was he still under gunpoint?

281
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,740
well, he was

282
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,380
drew

283
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:52,700
Carries or what? However, we're saying he was good

284
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:59,140
I'm the last thing I remember pretty much was him in her body and not really much else had happened

285
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:05,980
Well, I took a shot at Adam as you guys were heading down into that hole and that prompted

286
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:10,420
Kristoff fuck. What was his name? Yeah, the janitor. Yeah

287
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:15,600
We thought we thought drew was a goner because we heard a gunshot ring out right then

288
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:23,980
Turned out we had a little Savior in the in our midst. Yeah, who shot Kristoff's hand off. It was a

289
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:29,060
Her name's and loved you. Do you know her? No

290
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:30,980
She

291
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:35,740
Killed my parents. She killed your parents and love killed my parents

292
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:43,220
To have you always known that or I mean, I've known it as much as I've known things since these things started. Oh

293
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:49,100
What she killed your parents? Why is she trying to get you and mister?

294
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:55,700
Here's the thing is that and I've known this for a while and that's been eating me up. She she works for the circle

295
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,700
She's a circle of knowledge member

296
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:03,500
She was also in case L with Kevin with dad you and

297
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:13,340
Daddy me. Yeah. Well, what was she doing there? Well, I thought she was working for the circle here

298
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:18,540
Here's the mind blower. You ready for this get you might sit down. Are you seated? Well, you know it can't yeah

299
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:24,100
sure, Jim Cook was her handler in some kind of covert operation to

300
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:27,060
Do stuff

301
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:29,420
Secret

302
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:32,860
Interest can you believe that?

303
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:44,220
You know what Keith

304
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:47,140
Thanks, something's up

305
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,700
Got a firm grasp on how all this works

306
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:53,740
Jim was her hands. So you're telling me

307
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:58,340
Jim cook was an loves handler to do something secret

308
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:06,060
So they were he was the handler of case L it turned out but then he had some kind of some kind of a splintering

309
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:12,100
So you remember we saw those notes about how Maggie heard that Jim Cook was worried about Maggie and all that

310
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:16,620
there was some kind of yeah some kind of strife within the circle itself and

311
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:18,540
And

312
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:23,980
Was was working for Jim in particular. So that's why she killed my parents Jim sent her off to get a book

313
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:30,940
You remember that book we found in Jim's house. Yeah. Yeah. Hey, that's one. He like homemade so it didn't work too. Well

314
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:35,840
Okay, so you got the real book at your house turns out

315
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:39,300
John can actually fill you in on how we figure that now. I

316
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:41,940
Had a vision. Oh

317
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:47,880
Without the watch yes, but that though that's my own thing god damn it. Oh, okay. I believe you

318
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,900
Everybody's doing their part to save the world

319
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,860
I was Silas Cole guy

320
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:02,660
Tell me what happened what about it? What about the book?

321
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:06,340
It's a grimoire and wanted us to get it real bad

322
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:09,100
And then we were gonna go over to calm comfy campground

323
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:12,340
But then she did some shit that we didn't take too kindly to

324
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:15,060
namely killing John I

325
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:17,820
Thought John she killed you well nearly

326
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:24,940
Stabbed a knife through his head good ass. I got I got pretty lucky though without provocation or I

327
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:28,180
wouldn't exactly say

328
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:32,180
Without provocation, but

329
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:37,220
while we were talking to Ann John let it slip that he was a ball and

330
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:44,500
Turns out that's kind of Ann's whole thing is to get rid of them balls. She's trying to get rid of all my kind

331
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:48,100
okay, so that makes a little more sense why I should do that, so

332
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:54,340
Did you guys save drew though? Oh, yeah, I forgot. That's what you asked about. He's fine. He went back to the tunnels

333
00:26:54,340 --> 00:27:01,220
We told him to you said get on down there just scamper be safe, and then did you kill Ann yeah, I?

334
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:04,060
Got real mad at her and I killed her

335
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:08,820
And then I still was kind of curious about what the book would do now that we knew where it was cuz she was so

336
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,820
Hyped up on it right

337
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,860
went and got the book and

338
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:17,140
That's I

339
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:19,540
Yeah, they kill you

340
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:27,600
Use it no not it. It certainly didn't kill me in fact. It. Maybe did the opposite, but I it all gets fuzzy after that

341
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:30,220
huh, huh

342
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,880
What happened with your head wound oh

343
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:34,940
well

344
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,940
And magic some of it away

345
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:39,780
enough for me to help out and killing her I

346
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:47,140
Also, I gave a I gave a shot at doing the same thing. I'd just seen an do which was

347
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,820
Just a little just a little blood magic

348
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:54,260
She just did like a like a little magic spell with that used that used blood

349
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:59,540
like like John said that a while ago would have really freaked me out, but

350
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:01,220
It freaked me out, too

351
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:06,860
I tell you what I believe in magic it freaked me out so much that I decided to try it myself in a young girl's

352
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,060
heart

353
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:10,060
You believe in magic

354
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:16,140
It worked when I did it well, and what did it do held him up held him up a whole lot if I remember right?

355
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:19,380
Sorry, that's I don't know yeah, it felt real nice

356
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:25,140
So I was really filled with purpose at that point and decided to go and get the book and that's the last thing I remember

357
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:28,060
It yeah

358
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:30,700
You got I got it. I got to

359
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,620
you

360
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:36,260
Keith you can relate you know sometimes at the end of the day

361
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:41,620
You're crazy, and I didn't really know what I was nothing left in you yeah

362
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,740
You guys remember

363
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:53,340
Jim cook right remember Jim when we found out he died in a yeah in an alley right I did that

364
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:57,660
You did you did that I did that when

365
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:03,060
what I touched the book and I said a spell and I

366
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:06,300
Was suddenly in the alley with Jim

367
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:12,540
and I knew that he'd sent and loved to kill my parents and it it just got the better of me and I I

368
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:16,260
Killed him I strangled him and I killed him oh

369
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,820
Whoa whoa whoa whoa Clark Clark?

370
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,260
You're under arrest

371
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:26,340
I'm just kidding

372
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:38,480
So is that the last thing you remember is killing him in all honesty. Yeah that I got the feeling that

373
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:45,220
I'd found purpose in my life, but when did that happen that was just a couple days ago

374
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,860
That was five days ago five days ago

375
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:51,740
So we potentially could have

376
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:58,260
Have a few of you running around along with us a murdering one

377
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:00,980
You know the last thing I remember is watching wheel of fortune

378
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:13,180
Well boys with the fell asleep on the couch and woke up here really damn yeah, you get me right

379
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:20,020
Roll intelligence fucking one

380
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:30,020
Keith I swear to God I got him all right every one of them. Well damn what a worthless fucking one

381
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:32,020
I

382
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:44,220
Don't know what the hell we do now. I mean going to watch wheel of fortune sounds just good as anything

383
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:47,500
Hey, I John Lee petty more roll a d10 for me

384
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:52,180
Seven gain seven sanity nice I

385
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:59,540
Can't tell what's real in this world, but wheel of fortune. That's it. There is something so calming about that experience

386
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:04,140
after everything that you've been through of just sitting on the couch and

387
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:10,740
Crushing wheel of fortune boys. I'd highly recommend it. I'm right there with you. I wish I could it I

388
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:14,980
Mean what do you what what do we do now?

389
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:21,580
I mean, I've got a couple couple ideas personally it kind of depends. Oh, that's one thing Keith

390
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:27,580
I should tell you and love put a name to that creature that I saw she called it a gigantic

391
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:34,020
Permanente kiss I nailed it. Don't ask me more and she clarified and she

392
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:41,780
She she she said that that that whole thing's real that whole thing is something that the circle is is

393
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:44,300
Trying to keep out of the world Freeman Donna

394
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,980
That's it

395
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:52,260
That's right, that's what she said right John. Yeah, no something like that

396
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:56,980
Real hold up real quick. I gotta I gotta rewrite the end of this campaign real quick

397
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:00,580
Yeah

398
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:04,980
Yeah, so and and was telling us that the the giant

399
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,180
Penta kid

400
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:13,420
Perminta kiss was a was a real bad thing and that was still the goal of the circle and that's always kind of been

401
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:21,060
The thing here's here's one kind of scary thing Keith that and mentioned to us is that Maggie had some designs on the circle of knowledge

402
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:23,060
That would then

403
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:26,060
Lay in a new world order or something like that

404
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:30,460
But Ann was pretty much on our side as far as she didn't care about that

405
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:33,400
She just wanted to make sure that the creature didn't happen

406
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:39,460
Well, the is the creature related to the ball in any way, you know hell

407
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:44,020
I haven't been able to make that connection quite if I made ball then probably not

408
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:49,720
Probably not where you may. Yeah, I made ball. I

409
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:52,580
made Mary

410
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:55,140
Daddy

411
00:32:56,420 --> 00:33:01,500
I'm you're my real daddy. I guess so. Holy shit

412
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:11,540
Runs out of the mausoleum

413
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:14,200
and he stumbles over one of the

414
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:18,980
broken androids who's crushed and falling on the ground and

415
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:24,920
Sitting in this dirt and this cold cold December 6th. You're looking up

416
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:29,340
The fire is almost completely out on this crawfish boil

417
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:31,780
smell

418
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:33,780
souring hits your nose

419
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:38,840
As he runs out I look at Clark and kind of like give him an elbow and go

420
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:42,540
Hey son, where are you going and then laugh to myself?

421
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:44,540
We

422
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:48,300
Probably ought to follow him out though

423
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:53,860
I'd be careful about person this one Keith. That's that's why I said it in here

424
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:59,460
Yeah, I'll start following John out just to make sure

425
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:05,380
John John don't don't get too far. We get it. We got to figure something out now. John is running

426
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:07,380
He's gonna disappear if you don't catch him

427
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:09,380
So

428
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:13,700
You just take off I look at Clark I

429
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,340
guess

430
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:19,780
John and I just take off after him. Oh, hey. Oh hell

431
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,820
Clark's gonna run to

432
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:26,260
John John come back. We're gonna need your help

433
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,300
Okay, yeah

434
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:36,100
For the last time you just run right by those androids don't look at them at all Clark take your headphones off

435
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:39,380
Take your headphones off as well

436
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:44,360
Joe not Clark, whatever you have one name

437
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:53,800
Thomas dr. Bradley aim

438
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,700
Say it

439
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,300
Dr. Bradley anus

440
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:14,700
We got to name ourselves in the zoom chat

441
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:20,180
Tell me petty more the third is sprinting through

442
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:24,860
Mausoleum, I need you to roll an alertness check for me

443
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:28,260
17

444
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:33,260
There are clearly the lights and sounds of an ambulance

445
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:38,700
Pulled up at the entrance of the city cemetery, which is now

446
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:43,540
Close enough that you can tell what is happening up there

447
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:47,040
Remembering back from the last time that you were here

448
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:54,220
There's a woman sitting in a wheelchair at the entrance the city cemetery who passed away

449
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,980
likely an hour ago

450
00:35:56,980 --> 00:36:00,700
That's probably what this is. I I crossed myself and

451
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,700
Pay my respects to

452
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:11,300
You know this woman who we have really come to think of as a friend

453
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:17,180
And then I'm booking it for the

454
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:23,180
Marmal glasses place. Okay. I'm looking at for planet juggernaut fair enough

455
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:25,180
As

456
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:30,660
Clark Bishop and Keith vigna take off running through these above-ground

457
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:36,780
Mausoleums here in the city cemetery. I need you to roll alertness checks for me

458
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:44,900
61 on a 60. Oh shit. I thought I'd rolled a 11, but it's a 17 on a 70

459
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,900
Thank God

460
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:52,940
Sometimes is a handler you really really want

461
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,700
Certain roles to get made. Oh

462
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:00,460
That was nerve-wracking

463
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:03,700
as you're running through you hear sirens and

464
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:06,780
You see lights from an ambulance

465
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:10,180
at the entrance the semi-se

466
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:12,540
Semi-semitary

467
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:14,540
the semi-semitary

468
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:20,020
The semester and as soon as you recognize that you actually hear

469
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:27,540
The running of a slightly heavier than human man taking off in a perpendicular

470
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:35,740
Direction to the entrance of the city cemetery and that man is running toward the glass compound

471
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:41,500
Is a John do we know it's John we would have just been running after him. Yeah. Yeah, it's John, okay

472
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:46,300
I wasn't sure if it was one of the robot guys that were protecting Stan Manstein got back up

473
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:49,460
That's what I was. No, you didn't hear me make fun of you for not looking at them. I

474
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:54,580
Mean I just remembered them I brought him up every time

475
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:04,660
Well, so since I filled my alertness check I'm gonna keep running till till he alerts me

476
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:08,340
Keith he's heading that way. There's a there's there's a there's a

477
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:13,540
Ambulance up there at the front gate. He's good. He's going the other way. He's heading toward the glass compound. Let's

478
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,300
Go get him

479
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:20,460
Silas Cole completely forgot what Keith Vigna's

480
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:29,180
Yeah, I'm like, um, it's legitimately weird for me to be Keith again

481
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:31,820
Right now. Yeah, I

482
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:34,100
am in pursuit of

483
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:36,500
John I

484
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:43,140
Am too do I see him? Can I see him? Am I that close roll both of you real athletics for me? I

485
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:46,220
Got an 8 on a 50

486
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:51,460
Fuck I got a 31 on the baseline 30. I was super fucking close. Wow

487
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:54,460
Let's get Thomas in here to roll for us

488
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:06,100
It was a bit

489
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:08,940
It seemed like a bit

490
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,980
What's up?

491
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:14,580
We were waving at you looked up and then just look down at your phone

492
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:23,860
Like right when we started burning it right when we started doing it. Hey Thomas real quick roll athletics for me. Oh

493
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:29,620
Nope 70 on a 50 so as you're

494
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:36,580
Approaching the edge of the city cemetery about to make your way onto a

495
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:39,740
Main street here in the city

496
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:47,940
Keith Vigna catches up to you and you can see Clark Bishop trailing at least eight mausoleums behind

497
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:55,940
Standard measurement when I catch up I want to just like grab his shoulder like what are you doing? Just come on slow down

498
00:39:55,940 --> 00:40:00,940
We got a we got a talk. Where are you going? It's far away from you as I can get

499
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:07,900
I never asked to be born. Don't worry about that right now. I'm not even totally sure what any of it means. Oh

500
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:12,700
Great real comforting dad, please. Don't call me that

501
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:16,220
Dad

502
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:19,420
Clark Bishop hears as he approaches

503
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:25,240
Where are you running off to I'm going to be with planet juggernaut John

504
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:30,220
I'm gonna ride him into the sky. No, it's what I want to do

505
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:39,020
John just just cuz there's a chance that Keith in the body of Silas Cole invented you doesn't mean he's your dad

506
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:41,860
You had a dad. It was Kevin. You're in his body now

507
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:43,860
Oh

508
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:57,420
Full identity crisis

509
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:09,860
Well, he wasn't here to raise me when I was a young one and neither were you Keith so planet juggernaut is the strongest male

510
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:15,040
Influence I've ever had in my life. You're older than me. I don't know how I could have raised you

511
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:17,740
Then what you should have thought of that

512
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:20,180
Before you had me

513
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:22,940
Well

514
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:24,940
Shit, I'm out of breath

515
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:33,460
Actually, uh, John Lee Pettymore cannon is 26 years old and Keith Vigna is 29 years old

516
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:38,560
We never talked about birthdays. Yeah, John never asked Keith

517
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:41,660
a

518
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:43,660
John assumed the same

519
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:52,820
Clark help me talk some sense into him. We I don't even know where we need to be going John

520
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:55,980
I'll tell you I don't I don't think the glass compounds where we need to go

521
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:58,980
First of all that his name is crossed off our chests

522
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:04,260
That seems like a clear sign that that's all taken care of over there at the end of the day

523
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:08,780
We're gonna need you with that vision thing you got going on these days. That's that's a powerful skill you got

524
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:11,540
That's something you can hang your hat on. That's all I am to you

525
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:13,300
I mean you've been you've been with us from the beginning

526
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:16,320
We didn't we never treated a different after we found out you were ball

527
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:21,820
You were still one of our friend. It's cuz we need you around you're you're you you help us

528
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:25,420
Y'all always did treat me like a friend

529
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:29,700
All right, what do you want to do Clark you got any

530
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:33,540
Yeah, any ideas? I got I got one

531
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:39,400
Yeah now that we know where the book is and these days I'm feeling like I have my wits about me a little more

532
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:45,220
Why don't we go get the book and head over to calm comfy campground? See what see what we can do?

533
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:47,420
Maybe save the world there

534
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:55,660
Okay, you know what that that one song said I'll follow you into the dark Clark

535
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:57,660
I

536
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:04,680
Don't step on Superman's cape I'm no Superman

537
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:13,060
You don't follow Clark into the dark and you don't mess around with Jim

538
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:17,780
I see you guys think that ambulance is here to pick up our mess back there. Oh, most certainly

539
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:20,420
Yeah, I think we ought to let him see that

540
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:21,940
Hey, all right

541
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:25,460
You know what a good place to start might be checking out the bodies of these androids

542
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:28,380
Moving them into the mausoleum, so they're not so obvious

543
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:36,660
Yeah, I don't think I don't think this to have an EMTs see robots. It's gonna be help our case any let's get on it

544
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:40,300
John they were at the front gate when we busted out of the mausoleum after you there

545
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:45,960
I think they're they're pretty close. We got a hurry. We got to move fast. So so we are dragging the

546
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:49,740
Androids back into the mausoleum, but also giving them a thorough

547
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:57,580
Investigation Zach as we do so especially their penises you guys are so good at role-playing. It's wild. Thanks

548
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:01,580
you know these ideas just come to us second I

549
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:07,620
Mean you did say every time we left the mausoleum that they were there so

550
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:14,460
It's not like we would have forgotten that yeah. Well was also just like yeah, we killed him

551
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:19,020
Dealt with what's next

552
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:22,160
There's nothing interesting about them. Fuck you

553
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:27,460
Okay, so

554
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:33,880
So the three of you make your way back to where you just were deep in the heart of the city

555
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:36,700
Cemetery as you're dragging these androids

556
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:39,620
into Ari Manstein's

557
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:41,460
tomb

558
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:47,460
You're giving him a good once over so I will need each of you to roll search

559
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:51,700
Because you each have one of these androids

560
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:59,940
30-40 didn't hear either one of you because you're both standing go Luke 31 on a 40 48 on a 50

561
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:04,120
64 on a 20 Clark. Come on, man. Clark's useless

562
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:08,740
This guy's totally lame rat dead

563
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:11,820
John the androids are dead

564
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:19,780
What else did you want to know Keith Vigna as you are dragging yours and you're kind of looking over it you remember

565
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:26,520
Fighting one of these things at James the mill workers house and you remember how strong?

566
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:29,060
the metal was and

567
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:34,140
how the wrists popped off and had wiring inside and

568
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:38,940
There were there were all sorts of gadgets kind of an inspector gadget style

569
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:46,620
Dave Bautista thing going on here and I followed the first part where it is. Yeah Bautista come in

570
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:50,900
Yeah, it's as if Dave Bautista was playing inspect your gadget. Yeah

571
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:56,900
Cool that would be that's a fun casting I would fucking love

572
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:05,100
All right podcast over

573
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:10,940
a

574
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:13,220
Friendship with podcast is ended

575
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:23,740
I mean, he's he's he's hitting like

576
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:27,800
65% right now. He's nailing it for blockbusters

577
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:33,620
So it might be more like 40 after some of those bombs so we could probably sneak in there. That's what we want

578
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:37,900
Stuber. Yeah, he did. He did. He did blow a stuber. That was a bummer

579
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:40,940
Hey Dave, we've got just

580
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:48,060
Everybody loves a reboot

581
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:50,620
Also movies are huge right now

582
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:57,960
No, it would be oh, oh my god it had Dave Bautista inspector gadget series on Disney Plus

583
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:03,020
Can we use that Mandalorian screen

584
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:06,500
That thing is fancy

585
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:10,220
I'm editing all of this out so we can actually make this happen

586
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:15,080
It's got a better chance of happening if we put it out in the world, baby. That's the secret

587
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:19,040
Did you read that didn't have to that's the secret?

588
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:28,780
Keith I forgot what I was gonna tell you. I don't know but they already have an inspector gadget in the works for Disney Plus

589
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:35,960
Who called it baby, but who's starring I haven't gotten to those starring the writers are Mikey day

590
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:41,240
What has been on SNL? He's gonna nail that and Streeter Seidel

591
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,920
Streeter they got Streeter Seidel

592
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:55,360
Yeah, they're also behind the Home Alone reboot for Disney Plus, I would love to see Home Alone, but Dave Bautista is the kid

593
00:47:55,360 --> 00:48:08,200
Keith Vigna as you drag this thing into the mausoleum you notice that this

594
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:11,200
robot seems to have

595
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:16,680
none of the advanced features that were previously part of

596
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:24,080
The Android that you fought at the behest of you now know Maggie Cook and myriad

597
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:28,440
They're at James the mill workers house and dr. Bradley anus fuck

598
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,820
Do you really rely on it that much I'll change it and John Lee petty

599
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:37,200
I

600
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,440
Was like it was he a part of me

601
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:44,960
Dr. Bradley anus is behind it all

602
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,280
That asshole

603
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,280
It

604
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:57,720
Was there and you took it easy low-hanging fruit John Lee Kevin Moore the third as you're

605
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:02,680
Dragging this thing in by the ankles of its pants

606
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:07,940
Pants begin to fall down and instead of a Ken doll

607
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,600
Right there where the smooth part is

608
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:16,080
We're finally checking out these robot dogs

609
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:18,080
You

610
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:21,720
See a stamp that says property of

611
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:27,280
The city asylum well god damn this one's hands don't pop off

612
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:32,480
That's fascinating you find anything on yours

613
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:37,200
Yeah, it belongs it belonged to the city asylum

614
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:41,000
Holy shit are there any cavities to search?

615
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:43,600
Cuz just call me dr. Anus

616
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:45,840
I

617
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:47,680
Will never again

618
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:51,360
Keith I don't know if we if we told you and and filled us in a little bit

619
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:57,580
There's this other group this opposing group called the city asylum, and that's who we think McKinley and

620
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:01,640
Harrison Harrison Harrison Harrison was one of them

621
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:08,640
But then the other guy the the woman who else got dead and as a president McKinley Canada and Kennedy

622
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:13,280
Agent Kennedy we think that that's who they were working for and we told and

623
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:16,360
They kind of helped us out in the end and and was like yeah

624
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:22,520
Everybody's kind of moving around toward the same goal so so the city asylum isn't like an asylum

625
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:30,000
It's a group it seems kind of like the opposite of the circle of knowledge or maybe you're huh, so we got some of these

626
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:34,720
Robots are from them and some of these robots are from myriad

627
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:42,300
And they just got these robot if you'll excuse the metaphor inspector gadget Bautista's running around out there

628
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:49,360
Just wreaking havoc on the public doing their whims. I don't I don't stand for that

629
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:53,820
I think these people started out trying to save the world and now now it's just gotten out of hand

630
00:50:53,820 --> 00:51:00,880
I mean we know Maggie's trying to take over the damn thing a small-town police chief just seems like a really unlikely and

631
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:06,640
Poor starting position to be taken over the world from but somehow she did it, so that's I

632
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:10,560
Will give her kudos there. That's some real Putin shit

633
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:19,760
Quick question do we as characters know anything about the robots being tied to

634
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:23,780
Any of the project stuff so that's the big thing

635
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:29,160
I'm blanking on is that and clarified a little bit of those connections, and I'm blanking on how it all worked out

636
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:36,600
Yeah, I thought we knew myriad had made them originally or yeah, you guys know that myriad makes these things so myriad

637
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:40,160
That's why myriad has the newer model cuz these are old, but then also

638
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:45,880
myriad decided that they were gonna start selling them to private companies and

639
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:48,560
Jim Cook's operation

640
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:51,560
operation stapler was

641
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:54,280
his respect

642
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:57,020
operation to cut down on cost

643
00:51:58,020 --> 00:52:03,940
For selling to private companies so the first one we fought was like og

644
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:06,680
these are

645
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:08,680
cheaper and not

646
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:11,060
myriads

647
00:52:11,140 --> 00:52:14,100
Hmm I think out loud as Keith Vigna

648
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:22,160
Boy, it was a good thing. We thought to check these bodies. Yeah, and John like takes the job one of them, and he's like

649
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:29,020
Oh

650
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:33,740
That's pretty silly don't you think was

651
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:48,040
Where we going Clark I vote I vote hit I vote heading to get my book and then heading to calm comfy camper

652
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:50,300
Okay, let's do it. I'm down

653
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:56,100
How are you guys getting to contention I start running on all fours like a horse

654
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:58,920
And I say I feel like I knew somebody that did this

655
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:05,340
It's kind of fuzzy quit Clark hop on Keith I

656
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:14,800
Don't know isn't I guess somebody's cars got to be here. Yeah, I guess drew got occupied last time so

657
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:18,280
Okay, well. I think we should take over the ambulance

658
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:22,440
Cops can do that right do we have any badges I?

659
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:28,200
Got my badge on looks real old. They're gonna know looks like you're like in a

660
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:33,440
Costume for a movie these are these are these are medical professionals

661
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:37,620
They're they're around cops all the time what we need to do is go up to a civilian

662
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:41,520
And steal their car under the guise of you being a cop. Yeah, I

663
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:46,520
Don't really mind how we get a car. Let's just go. Oh, you know what also. We're grown-ass men

664
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:52,720
Do we have wallets on us? Are you saying buy a car? I'm saying rent one. I kind of like the idea of stealing one

665
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:58,240
We could just hail a cab yeah, we could just take an uber there as

666
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:02,880
Somebody gets their phone out to order an uber. I'm like. I don't know we could steal that pretty easy

667
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:10,680
Imagine how easy it'll be to steal once we're inside the uber if we want to go with now

668
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:14,420
That's genius once we're in the vehicle. We can steal an uber well

669
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:17,900
Yeah, and also let him drive us around a little bit and see if you know is this a car

670
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:22,660
We want to steal you don't just go with the first uber. Yeah, I don't have a very good uber rating

671
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:25,420
So I'll call him Keith. What'd you do? Oh?

672
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:32,920
I've only ridden a couple times, and it's been on official police business, so they'd you know what let's not get into it

673
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:36,540
Keith has like a 2.4. He just

674
00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:40,260
Why I wonder

675
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:47,100
Right, but I don't know

676
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:58,460
Excuse me dear listener, but I have to drop in here real quick with some unfortunate news

677
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:03,360
See we had to record the rest of this episode on a different day and on that day

678
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:09,620
We had issues two of them in fact the first is fine Luke. Just didn't have his newer microphone

679
00:55:09,620 --> 00:55:13,860
So he's at a slightly lower quality than he will be moving forward

680
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:21,140
But the second sucks shit my laptop couldn't handle my recording and Google Docs and discord and my manatee

681
00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:26,740
Masturbation meditation videos all at the same time so my voice is pretty choppy

682
00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:32,980
I've been trying and trying tirelessly to figure out a way to repair this issue to no avail however

683
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:39,540
I do think the rest of this episode rules hard enough to pull the focus away from the problem in fact

684
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:45,640
You know what I actually did it on purpose to make your muscles tense while listening to this fairly

685
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:51,680
Unnerving part of the story so when you feel your jaw finally relax at the end of the episode

686
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:54,760
You'll know it worked hugs and kisses

687
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:04,060
It doesn't get you down to a 2.4

688
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:06,580
stars from just one

689
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:10,540
Incident so I think we should all describe a single

690
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:16,860
Incident that got teeth while on duty a low uber score. I will start one word at a time

691
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:23,700
Yeah, we'll go around Keith really shit

692
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:31,900
His mama

693
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:38,580
My

694
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:46,100
Okay, we do need we need to take improv lessons if we want this to be

695
00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:55,020
Well hold on let me improv this one word at a time for everybody Keith really shit what his mama gave him

696
00:56:55,500 --> 00:57:03,660
And forgot his police cruiser, so he called a wacky uber to drive him to the crime scene

697
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:07,220
That was really cool how we all work together

698
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:15,560
We all do a really good Thomas we should just make the one episode where all it is is a mad lib

699
00:57:15,740 --> 00:57:21,620
We should do like four episodes in a row where it's just one of us talking. It doesn't sound like it would be very popular

700
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:31,260
Okay, so I like to think that Keith was out on a call and he needed to arrest someone so he handcuffs a perp

701
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:37,340
And then as he takes him back to the police cruiser you realize he locked his keys in his cruiser with the car running

702
00:57:37,340 --> 00:57:39,340
so then he has to

703
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:49,100
Explains to the uber driver like this is a wanted criminal

704
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:57,100
Pop the trunk

705
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:03,260
I

706
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:08,300
Throws him in the trunk and then Keith gets in the shotgun seat of course and

707
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:13,860
Instead of going straight to the police station Keith is like I'm gonna shit with my mama gave me

708
00:58:16,940 --> 00:58:20,180
He shits his pants, and then still makes the guy go through a drive-through

709
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:25,900
I shit my pants

710
00:58:31,860 --> 00:58:33,860
Away, there's no trouble afterwards

711
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:40,760
Actually I was wrong that one experience might take you all the way down to

712
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:46,700
He's only been on three uber rides

713
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:56,220
Goodness so Keith pulls out his phone and orders an uber and it's you see on the app that there is a vintage

714
00:58:56,220 --> 00:58:58,380
I guess it wouldn't say vintage, huh?

715
00:58:58,380 --> 00:59:01,300
I wouldn't say what year the car is no

716
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:05,740
It might say what year the car is it says what year the car is once somebody agrees to pick you up

717
00:59:05,740 --> 00:59:12,420
It does tell you what what the car is so one unfortunate soul does agree to pick the three of you up

718
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:15,620
I guess he doesn't know that there's three of you, and you don't know it's a he

719
00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:20,460
But it does does it say his name. It's been a while since I've used you. Yeah. What's his name?

720
00:59:20,980 --> 00:59:23,780
Lewis his name is Lewis, and he's driving a

721
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:26,780
1966 Toyota Prius oh

722
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:31,260
His name is Reginald, and he's driving hey

723
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:35,500
1966

724
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:41,980
Volkswagen van like a bus or like a mini. Yeah, it's like a bus. It's like a van bus

725
00:59:43,220 --> 00:59:46,100
Two different things are just the same name for the same thing

726
00:59:46,940 --> 00:59:49,660
Was the van this vintage teal?

727
00:59:50,540 --> 00:59:54,380
Volkswagen van rolls up on the outskirts of

728
00:59:54,940 --> 01:00:01,180
The city cemetery and it is driven by a man as like long hair

729
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:03,580
He looks pretty

730
01:00:03,580 --> 01:00:10,100
Pretty lanky and his eyes are darting all over the place. He's kind of flinching a little bit and

731
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:18,140
You see that his shirt seems to be made from random pieces of fabric that were like patched together quilted together

732
01:00:18,980 --> 01:00:20,980
Hey guys

733
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:31,060
Are you what what's your name Spud, but I'll miss but it was Lewis or Reginald

734
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:34,900
Oh, no my mom tried to name me Lewis, but my dad

735
01:00:35,260 --> 01:00:37,740
He he really liked the name Reginald

736
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:44,460
And he grabs a can of whipped cream from the floorboard under his feet, and he just goes

737
01:00:45,460 --> 01:00:47,460
Into his mouth

738
01:00:48,660 --> 01:00:53,620
But but I'm gonna sidebar with my compatriots real quick

739
01:00:53,620 --> 01:00:59,780
Is he eating the whipped cream or is he like inhaling the the gas from the can?

740
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:00,060
Yeah

741
01:01:00,060 --> 01:01:05,980
Is he popping a rule search for me to see if there's a any any actual cream on that any cream?

742
01:01:05,980 --> 01:01:08,460
And I'm gonna search for cream in his mouth

743
01:01:14,460 --> 01:01:18,420
Let's see 22 freaking crit success

744
01:01:21,420 --> 01:01:23,940
Dude there is a little there's a little bit of cream

745
01:01:23,940 --> 01:01:28,180
There's like a little bit of cream on his lip and it seems to like at least sputtered

746
01:01:28,180 --> 01:01:33,860
You know there's some he keeps his lips tight around that white

747
01:01:35,340 --> 01:01:37,340
But

748
01:01:37,780 --> 01:01:39,740
So you can't see it all but like yeah

749
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:46,580
So we are John leads these guys into a sidebar real quick, and it's like hey

750
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:49,700
You know I don't know if it's just that the good Lord

751
01:01:50,060 --> 01:01:53,500
You know can only make so many variations of his own creations

752
01:01:53,700 --> 01:02:01,260
But but doesn't doesn't this guy sound a lot like that that weird creature that was looking for the overseer

753
01:02:04,260 --> 01:02:07,020
I'd have to hear him. I'd have to hear him talk one more time

754
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:10,080
Do you think maybe those creatures are doing poppers, too

755
01:02:11,740 --> 01:02:13,740
That's not what poppers are I

756
01:02:15,100 --> 01:02:20,340
Did them one time in a hot tub at a bastard you're thinking of you're thinking of whippets Joe whippets

757
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:25,860
That's something yeah, I've never done whippets, but I did do poppers in a hot tub with a bunch of hot dudes

758
01:02:25,860 --> 01:02:28,660
You know what happened to your accent Keith?

759
01:02:31,060 --> 01:02:33,660
Yeah, that was Keith saying that he forgot who he was

760
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:41,660
Being Silas Cole for so long made him forget who he was yeah, I'm having like flashbacks. I'm like I'm not okay, okay

761
01:02:42,340 --> 01:02:48,180
Zach you gave me like dirty looks and flipped me off, so I was asking a legitimate game strategic question

762
01:02:48,180 --> 01:02:51,260
No, I I appreciate that he turns and he's like

763
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:54,320
Sorry, I had something in my eye

764
01:02:56,500 --> 01:03:00,540
Hey, hey, I had some I had something in my

765
01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:10,480
This sidebar was a false alarm. This is just an average country feller. Just like you or me or Keith even

766
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:13,820
I just been doing some helium and whipped cream

767
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:18,860
Wait you've been doing your are you high right now nah?

768
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:22,900
You want your driver relaxed. Let's get in yeah normally

769
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:27,680
I've started, but this seems kind of like the guy that wouldn't think twice about anything. We're about to do

770
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:30,720
Yeah, if you see some freaky shit. It's cuz you're high Clark

771
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:36,080
I don't want to alarm you, but every time you've been in a cruiser with Keith, or I we have been at least

772
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:38,400
His level or beyond on

773
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:43,920
Inhalants or some other substance he hears you guys talking, and he's like nice. Hey

774
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:46,880
Yeah, we used to be the law still are kind of not anymore

775
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:51,280
I guess we're we're kind of wandering vagabonds like you creatures of the road

776
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:54,340
Are you guys going to like a costume party or something?

777
01:03:54,340 --> 01:03:56,340
Oh

778
01:03:56,380 --> 01:04:04,220
Sure, that's sick. Yeah, man. You're born naked and the rest is just drag dude. The rest is just ha ha and he like

779
01:04:04,780 --> 01:04:08,860
grabs on his shoulder like the shirt of his shoulder the shoulder of his shirt and

780
01:04:09,380 --> 01:04:13,260
He's like the rest is just rags my dude

781
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:16,100
Yeah, your clothes are not very good

782
01:04:18,140 --> 01:04:21,540
Self man, it's yeah, I'm making myself. It's really me

783
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:25,680
Self yeah, it yeah, it does look like that

784
01:04:26,540 --> 01:04:29,500
Where did I where did I put the address as?

785
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:37,140
For our end. Yeah, could you just take us to the to the pen man? Oh, yeah for sure dude, and he starts driving

786
01:04:37,620 --> 01:04:43,040
I'm really glad that I got that thing out of my throat. I feel much more comfortable like this

787
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:48,020
I'm glad to man. I'm glad you can be comfortable. I'm glad you can just drive us

788
01:04:48,060 --> 01:04:53,100
Guys doing in contention really have to say anything at all to us. No, I figure we talk

789
01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:58,020
I'm one of those uber drivers who likes to talk to everybody the whole time. What are you guys doing in contention?

790
01:04:58,020 --> 01:05:02,620
Huh? Do you find that people like that? I know I know dude. It's just like I get so lonely

791
01:05:03,420 --> 01:05:09,340
Sometimes, you know, yeah one cool thing that an uber driver can do is just put on some some pretty

792
01:05:10,420 --> 01:05:13,980
You know some pretty well-liked music radios busted man

793
01:05:14,060 --> 01:05:19,220
Pretty me some music that like everybody can kind of get you know anything from the 70s basically off

794
01:05:19,220 --> 01:05:21,380
I wish I could do the worst

795
01:05:21,940 --> 01:05:26,960
Worst thing they could do besides talking is like put on Imagine Dragons, but they do that a lot

796
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:32,260
Would we recognize this guy from like around contention? Nah, man. I'm from the city. What are you guys?

797
01:05:32,260 --> 01:05:35,620
Are you guys from contention or what born and raised here? What?

798
01:05:36,060 --> 01:05:40,980
Yeah, you're from contention. That's sick, dude. I heard the cops. They're like

799
01:05:41,540 --> 01:05:47,340
Bad I heard there's some crazy boys. Yeah. Yeah. What else have you heard about him? Oh, dude

800
01:05:47,340 --> 01:05:54,140
I just have some friends down there who like get litty like my homie. He's the manager at this sandwich place and

801
01:05:54,740 --> 01:05:58,980
Like you I mean he grows his own shit. It's fucking cool. Yeah, that's my cousin

802
01:06:00,420 --> 01:06:04,980
No shit what yeah, he's a good guy. His stuff is pretty good. Oh

803
01:06:06,100 --> 01:06:09,620
Dude, and he like as he's driving he turns fully around

804
01:06:11,780 --> 01:06:15,740
Look you in the eyes and hands and puts on his fist to give you nuts

805
01:06:15,740 --> 01:06:19,240
I quickly return his knucks and point towards the road

806
01:06:20,100 --> 01:06:22,100
nice

807
01:06:22,180 --> 01:06:24,180
And it's quiet for the first time

808
01:06:25,420 --> 01:06:30,380
Hey, could you put something on like even Imagine Dragons at this point? Oh, like I said before

809
01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:34,380
We're kind of both standing up at the same time. It's pretty crazy

810
01:06:35,380 --> 01:06:38,700
But like so I couldn't hear you or you can hear me

811
01:06:38,700 --> 01:06:45,320
But like radio is fucking busted I could I could sing some Imagine Dragons for you if you want. Yes, please do that

812
01:06:45,580 --> 01:06:48,880
Yeah, that's for sure that that sounds great to me. Thank you

813
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:50,880
Oh

814
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:09,080
Well, maybe I need to give them boys a second chance cuz that's the best Imagine Dragons song I've ever heard I

815
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:12,080
Mean just fucking imagine them though, right?

816
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:20,080
It is evocative as hell I'm picturing them all Game of Thrones, you know one time after I think it's like smile

817
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:24,920
I read all those books in my early 20s. That's one thing. You don't know about John Lee Pettymore. Oh nice

818
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:26,920
John Lee Pettymore is your name? That's long

819
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:30,960
Yeah, it's three it's three of them

820
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:34,680
All together they're

821
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:37,880
Mean my name's spud pass bud spud

822
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:44,520
Yes, but like the beer dog like it like a tater like a tater nice and he turns fully around

823
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:57,120
Back back turn around and as you turn around you both you all see two things in the distance both are

824
01:07:57,320 --> 01:08:03,960
Roughly 30 feet in the air the Sun slowly beginning its descent behind them one is

825
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:11,660
Expected it's the billboard for the contingent trucks your hometown baseball team trucks. Bring it

826
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:17,680
Trucks bring it. The other is less expected. It's a floating

827
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:20,240
four-wheeler this

828
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:26,720
Familiar all-terrain vehicle adds another terrain to its already impressive resume

829
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:28,720
As it seems

830
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:32,800
As it seems to surf on some sort of

831
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:41,620
Invisible wave roll sanity. Is this a four-wheeler occupied or just on its own up in the it's occupied as hell

832
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:43,920
It's pretty far away

833
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:51,080
Can I can I reroll my sanity? No, that's great though. If you failed it's fun. I did

834
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:53,980
I am at 18. Oh and so

835
01:08:54,700 --> 01:08:57,540
Do you think 44 is a good roll

836
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:07,260
Yes, I do think 44 is a good roll Joe you put a thumbs down meaning you pass

837
01:09:10,260 --> 01:09:16,580
It was luckily under my power, okay under your power and then Thomas what did you roll I failed

838
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:21,300
Okay, so it says if you pass you don't lose any sanity

839
01:09:22,180 --> 01:09:24,180
Congratulations to no one

840
01:09:24,580 --> 01:09:25,860
if you

841
01:09:25,860 --> 01:09:33,420
Joe and Thomas both roll a d4 as Luke takes one d4 of sanity damage or I mean, sorry

842
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:35,700
Luke you take all four

843
01:09:36,020 --> 01:09:40,660
That's what I figured Joe and Thomas roll a d4 as Luke rolls a d4

844
01:09:43,260 --> 01:09:46,420
You guys are rolling a d4 for fun, he's actually losing the same

845
01:09:47,420 --> 01:09:51,760
I didn't want to feel I didn't want you to feel left out of this interactive process

846
01:09:53,660 --> 01:09:57,460
Zach I got bad news for you or good news. I hit my breaking point. Hey

847
01:10:00,260 --> 01:10:04,460
This already but every time I wake up in the mausoleum, I'm one point away from my breaking point

848
01:10:08,580 --> 01:10:14,020
It's fucking great and Thomas, what'd you roll? I lost to sanity okey-dokey and Luke lost four

849
01:10:14,020 --> 01:10:20,060
I mean Keith Vigna lost four which puts me at fourteen. There's one thing on my notes here

850
01:10:20,060 --> 01:10:23,640
It says if they pass read this I won't read that

851
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:31,300
Okay fast approaching is a massive black shiny wave the size of a tsunami

852
01:10:31,660 --> 01:10:36,980
formed from the indelible viscous sludge that infiltrated your town and

853
01:10:37,540 --> 01:10:43,060
Disrupted your lives inside this thrashing swell of my I wrote this already

854
01:10:43,100 --> 01:10:46,900
So it's like but it disrupted your lives and now I'm thinking like what lives

855
01:10:47,700 --> 01:10:49,700
We don't really sad

856
01:10:50,540 --> 01:10:54,740
Jesus Christ inside this thrashing swell of muck

857
01:10:55,820 --> 01:11:02,620
Thrashing bodies. Yeah, read your copy and add like any commentary or like embellishments later. Don't fucking

858
01:11:04,020 --> 01:11:06,120
Hold your applause for the end, dude

859
01:11:06,820 --> 01:11:11,020
If you want to add some parentheses, like what lives these miserable fucks

860
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:13,980
Okay, do that you don't know you got it I mean

861
01:11:14,660 --> 01:11:20,740
Bust out of character just to throw shade. It's it's it's fine. I'm a tree birch. So

862
01:11:21,620 --> 01:11:27,060
inside this thrashing swell of muck are the thrashing bodies of

863
01:11:27,820 --> 01:11:33,820
councilwoman Carrie pages and Salem the cats their hands and paws

864
01:11:34,300 --> 01:11:38,220
Stretch out trying to breach this inescapable tide

865
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:45,740
But their struggle does not last long their limbs fold into this ooze becoming one with a sentient

866
01:11:45,900 --> 01:11:50,380
Massive goop that is about to crash down upon you

867
01:11:51,580 --> 01:11:53,020
What do you do?

868
01:11:53,020 --> 01:11:59,620
How fast is this wave moving? Like do we have much time? Nope, and as it collapses over you

869
01:11:59,620 --> 01:12:01,620
You

870
01:12:03,540 --> 01:12:10,740
It's just enough time for you to also realize that the driver is seeing what you're saying as he just goes

871
01:12:11,700 --> 01:12:13,700
dude

872
01:12:14,380 --> 01:12:18,220
But the dude is pretty much cut off by the wave

873
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:23,940
like the swell of like, you know when you get hit by a wave in the ocean and just kind of holds you down and

874
01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:25,980
for like a moment you think it's

875
01:12:26,700 --> 01:12:28,700
over

876
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:37,580
Okay, so like GAC was Nickelodeon's version of flarp or slime a toy for children made by mixing water

877
01:12:37,580 --> 01:12:45,020
With borax and with my wife. I'm sorry. It's I GAC slime. Yes. What was the other thing? You said flarp?

878
01:12:45,660 --> 01:12:47,660
flarp flarp flarp

879
01:12:48,020 --> 01:12:54,100
FL AR I think I that's what we called it. Hang on. Wait. Wait one second. Oh shit

880
01:12:54,620 --> 01:13:01,060
Does he have some floor just walked away he just like ran away with a giddy child like smile I have

881
01:13:01,900 --> 01:13:04,620
It's not in the thing, but I've got the case for it. No

882
01:13:07,420 --> 01:13:09,420
I don't know where

883
01:13:09,420 --> 01:13:12,620
Buddy oh no, it got out noise putty. So it's the stuff

884
01:13:14,780 --> 01:13:20,060
You can put your finger into it and it makes really easy fart sense. Gotcha. Yeah, okay

885
01:13:20,140 --> 01:13:25,260
Or if you can't afford a pocket pussy almost as if like the the sound is that's where it went

886
01:13:26,140 --> 01:13:30,460
Or if you can't afford a fuck barrel the flarp barrel. Oh, that's a patreon joke

887
01:13:31,860 --> 01:13:33,860
Yeah, nobody

888
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:44,780
It's it's so good right now, I cannot wait until you make a fuck barrel the fuck barrels are gonna come out sooner than the t-shirts

889
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:52,300
Fucking hurts

890
01:13:53,380 --> 01:13:59,860
The the stuff we created in our kitchen with like borax and water and liquid glue is a lot like wetter and runnier

891
01:14:00,460 --> 01:14:07,300
Than the GAC like the name-brand stuff and it felt cold and wet but sort of heavy at the same time

892
01:14:07,300 --> 01:14:14,580
And when the stuff moved around it peeled away like it had to like make an effort to release from your skin

893
01:14:14,980 --> 01:14:20,540
What is that called where it's like when you hit it it's a solid but I was just thinking about that too

894
01:14:20,540 --> 01:14:24,220
I think it's a Newtonian substance or a yeah

895
01:14:25,620 --> 01:14:32,580
Newtonian yeah non-newtonian with like cornstarch or something. Is that how you used to make it? Yeah cornstarch and and like come

896
01:14:33,060 --> 01:14:36,020
Oobleck oobleck. Yeah black ooh

897
01:14:37,380 --> 01:14:40,420
Flarp ooh black. Okay now imagine

898
01:14:40,420 --> 01:14:42,420
Dragons

899
01:14:42,740 --> 01:14:44,620
Imagine the stages

900
01:14:44,620 --> 01:14:48,340
the way that your thoughts change throughout this

901
01:14:49,180 --> 01:14:50,420
vorish

902
01:14:50,420 --> 01:14:53,100
Process as you are consumed

903
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:59,380
Oh the reason that I talked about GAC for so long is imagine that it's like literally covering your entire body at first it

904
01:14:59,540 --> 01:15:06,100
Feels like jumping into a pool with your clothes on like a little strange little awkward like in the van. Yes

905
01:15:06,100 --> 01:15:10,060
Oh completely. You can't see anything anymore except for darkness and

906
01:15:10,700 --> 01:15:17,820
As the ooze pushes in around you it becomes increasingly difficult to move your limbs

907
01:15:18,380 --> 01:15:20,380
this cold wet sludge

908
01:15:20,900 --> 01:15:29,340
relentlessly fills every orifice in your body and you struggle to maintain a sense of optimism as you are

909
01:15:29,660 --> 01:15:32,420
completely enveloped in this suffocating

910
01:15:32,980 --> 01:15:34,700
goo

911
01:15:34,700 --> 01:15:40,820
John Lee Pettymore who rolled over his power has just unbuckled his seatbelt like while he could still move

912
01:15:41,260 --> 01:15:47,780
He rolled up into as much of a ball as he could, you know, this form is not really my own. I

913
01:15:48,380 --> 01:15:52,220
Will survive the goo onslaught. I hope my friends will be as lucky

914
01:15:52,220 --> 01:15:57,900
If not, perhaps I might rip their spines out and take their corpses if this one is ruined by the goo

915
01:15:58,580 --> 01:15:59,840
Keith

916
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:06,620
After having just lost four sanity, he isn't really computing like he knows what's going on

917
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:12,240
But he's just decided it's not actually happening to him. And so he's just sitting there

918
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:15,240
Breathing in as normal. I

919
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:18,000
Think Clark tries to scream and gurgles

920
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:21,480
This isn't how it was supposed to go

921
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:34,840
So look directly into the camera right now Joe look directly into the camera right now

922
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:46,600
Dear listener, I have such mixed emotions right now

923
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:54,000
An oozing substance has just made its way into my studio and it is heading directly

924
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:58,140
Towards me on one hand. I feel like I am

925
01:16:59,100 --> 01:17:00,140
Unfortunately

926
01:17:00,140 --> 01:17:03,840
Staring down the empty pudding cup of my existence

927
01:17:04,020 --> 01:17:11,580
But on the other hand, it kind of looks like rotting putrid slop like I said, I'm hungry

928
01:17:17,940 --> 01:17:19,940
What the fuck

929
01:17:28,140 --> 01:17:30,140
Oh

930
01:17:58,140 --> 01:18:00,140
You

931
01:18:28,140 --> 01:18:30,140
You
