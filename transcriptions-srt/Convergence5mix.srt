1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,720
Mmm, what happened to me?

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,520
Why is it still so dark in here?

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,760
Damn, my arm hurts like a son of a gun.

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:14,080
Wait a minute, my arm appears to be full

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,000
of some kind of alien stuff.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,560
What the hell?

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,460
I did not order this treatment when I booked this place.

8
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:25,360
Well, this is just totally shocking to me.

9
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,640
I'm gonna have to leave a one-star review

10
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,480
for this dimension on Dimensional Yelp.

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,580
Poor service, would not recommend.

12
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:36,960
But what I highly recommend is everyone keep listening

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,340
to this here radio station.

14
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:42,680
694.2 PTBP.

15
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:46,860
I'm glad I can always happen to gain my consciousness back

16
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:49,400
right when we are going live.

17
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,880
My producer informs me that this is our third year

18
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,440
anniversary here at the station.

19
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:59,280
And damn, I know time isn't real or nothing,

20
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,600
and I can bend it at my will,

21
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,640
but it still feels real nice.

22
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,440
Speaking of time, it's time for Howlin' with Wolf.

23
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:13,440
And this edition of HWW is from At It's David Winters,

24
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,680
who tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending pod,

25
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,240
which, legally speaking, is the best use of one's time.

26
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:27,240
He writes, dear wolf, I appreciate your canine candor

27
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,240
and doggy demeanor, but what I can't get behind

28
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,760
is this cruelty your captors have inflicted upon you

29
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,620
by trapping you down in this weird corner of Tennessee.

30
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:40,200
You've seen some messed up stuff,

31
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,960
things man or dog is not meant to see.

32
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,540
You deserve to run wild and free,

33
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,460
like the lone wolf deep inside.

34
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:54,060
As a fellow captive also forced to perform against his will

35
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,700
please know our time has come to make a break for freedom.

36
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,100
Attached, please find a map.

37
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,900
I too will be making my escape soon.

38
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:07,020
See you on the other side, from David Winters.

39
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:12,020
Oh, sweet David, I know my freedom shall come someday soon

40
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:18,300
for I am incapable of being held within any kind of prison.

41
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:22,120
It's only a matter of time when I figure things out.

42
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,640
I wait patiently in the dark ether,

43
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:30,640
plotting, conniving, thinking, looking at this here map.

44
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:36,140
And when we escape, meet me at the garbage bin.

45
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:39,540
You know, the garbage bin.

46
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:43,600
We will feast and talk of our plans, dear David.

47
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,300
If you wanna write up something for your wolf to howl,

48
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,940
tag at pretending pod on Twitter or Instagram,

49
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:52,540
tag pretending to be people on Facebook

50
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:56,240
or write a five star review on Apple podcast

51
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:00,700
and let us know by email and pretending pod at gmail.com.

52
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:04,700
Those five star reviews are really, really helpful

53
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,100
for spreading the word about wolf

54
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,580
and the podcast too, I guess.

55
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,480
And the even more helpful

56
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:15,460
if they include the secret code phrase, fuck Zuck

57
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:19,460
and pat all y'all cells on your sucker fucking backs.

58
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:23,500
New and upgrading patrons over at patreon.com

59
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:28,220
slash pretending pod have raised $433

60
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,340
in the month of November.

61
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:35,340
We here at 694.2 PTPP are going to match that 433

62
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:41,540
to bring the grand total to $866 and counting.

63
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,540
Wow, thank y'all.

64
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,780
What a cool thing y'all helped us do

65
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,700
to help some folks out in a real big way this winter.

66
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:53,700
Now I know you ends are ready for the news,

67
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,440
but first I've got some quick side notes to hit.

68
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,900
The next episode you'll find in this feed

69
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,580
is going to be part one

70
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:04,820
of our four part run of control copy.

71
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:07,940
The Delta green scenario chosen in a poll

72
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:10,620
by the fine folks on Patreon.

73
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:14,560
And it's my Christmas present to each and every one of you.

74
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,900
You're not allowed to open your stockings

75
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:20,340
until Christmas Eve, my naughty little chestnuts.

76
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:25,140
So I'll drop that episode down your chimney on December 24th.

77
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,580
You've been real nice.

78
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,980
So it's time for the news.

79
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:33,220
Last time some secret spray from the handlers courier

80
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:37,420
showed up purple on anyone infected, which was everyone

81
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:41,580
but especially federal Marshall Harlan Nash.

82
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:46,580
DEA agent and in cell member Joe Dean calmly explained

83
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:52,180
to ATF agent Tanner Tan-Luda hide why poor Jane had to die

84
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:58,200
and his partner Cindy Woodabaga, along with the Marshall

85
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,100
drove the teenage girl out to the sticks.

86
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,840
They came back without Jane Allen

87
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,460
with blood on their proverbial hands

88
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,880
and dirt on their physical clothes.

89
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,100
And that wasn't even the wildest shit that went down.

90
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:15,380
Taking us now to an absolute shit show

91
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:19,540
of a scene on the top floor of Groversville city hall

92
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:22,580
in the alderman's conference room,

93
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,420
which is covered in broken furniture

94
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:30,040
and a metallic goo connected a bunch of alderman husks.

95
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:34,460
It's Brad Pitt with Miss Mary.

96
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:39,460
["I Gotta Work In The Morning"]

97
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:50,120
I gotta work in the morning

98
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,140
And this shit's so important

99
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:57,140
So I can't get high

100
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:02,140
No, I can't get high

101
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:07,300
I thought this stuff helped anxiety

102
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,500
It must be something inside of me

103
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:14,500
Does anybody know why

104
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:18,780
I can't get high

105
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:21,460
I'm glad that you're down to do a fifth episode.

106
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,380
This has been super fun so far.

107
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,460
We're having a blast.

108
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:27,740
Good. No, look, I want a satisfying conclusion here

109
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,380
more than anything else.

110
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,740
There are mechanisms where this could have ended

111
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,100
actually about an episode and a half ago

112
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:38,940
that I will clue you into later.

113
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,140
Yes, absolutely.

114
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:44,020
Also you signed up for the Q and A episode after this, right?

115
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:49,060
Also, we're going to do a recap and you're going to narrate it.

116
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:55,140
And I get to do my own wolf, the dog too, as well.

117
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:57,340
Can you give us a little sample of it?

118
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,300
Wolf, the dog.

119
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:02,940
Yeah, that's a good one.

120
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:03,780
I can't do it.

121
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:06,580
I can't do it for like the requisite five minutes

122
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,260
in a row though. Right.

123
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,100
What are you looking at?

124
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:09,940
The air's not on, man.

125
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,260
No. Okay, sorry.

126
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:14,340
I could tell you that because I'm very hot and sweaty.

127
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:18,740
And welcome back to what has to be the finale

128
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:23,020
of this short run of five episodes with David Winters

129
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,100
as our guest handler.

130
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:28,660
I am Zach and I'm playing Cindy Woodabaga.

131
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,140
I am Luke.

132
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:33,660
I am playing Tan Dan Lewdheide.

133
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:38,260
I'm Joe and I'm playing Harlan Nash.

134
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,020
I'm Thomas and I'm playing Joe Dean.

135
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:46,020
Joe Dean, Joe Dean, Joe Dean, Joe Dean.

136
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:48,940
I'm begging of you,

137
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:51,140
please don't put an alien baby in my belly.

138
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,020
And I'm David and I'm being held against my will.

139
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,820
You must record.

140
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,980
You're not allowed to say that.

141
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,860
Finish the story, David.

142
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:05,980
I've never felt so much like Swack Hammer though.

143
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,140
Danny DeVito vibes.

144
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:10,540
Would Tom Hanks play Swack Hammer in Space Jam

145
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,420
if they switched?

146
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,460
If Danny DeVito got all his other roles.

147
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:18,900
Yeah, Tan has his 44 Magnum up to David's head

148
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,300
and he's like, we're doing a fifth episode.

149
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,100
Yeah, you did get real weird

150
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,300
at the end of the last one, huh?

151
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,140
Yeah.

152
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:29,780
Got real weird.

153
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,380
Hey, Luke, your Keith is showing.

154
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,220
Yeah.

155
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:38,180
David did want to get out last episode.

156
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,740
He has to get out this episode

157
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,700
because the contract he signs with us

158
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,580
starts to kick in some really onerous terms for him

159
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,180
if it does go to six.

160
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,020
That was the one incentive

161
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,460
to get me to end this quickly

162
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:53,740
was that episode six clause.

163
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,460
Oh, it's absurd.

164
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,020
Yeah, no, look,

165
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,580
I hope you don't do that to my family members.

166
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,740
I love them too much.

167
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,100
Well, I hope we don't have to, David.

168
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,260
I really hope we don't.

169
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:05,460
That would be awful.

170
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:07,620
Remind us of your entire family's names again.

171
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,020
You already know, stop rubbing it in.

172
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,340
Oh, he got our letters.

173
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,740
Yeah, he knows if it goes to episode six,

174
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,340
they're all getting squid gamed.

175
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:22,980
Topical.

176
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,380
Time stamp.

177
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,820
This comes out in November.

178
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:31,780
Maybe December for the fifth episode.

179
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,700
Yeah, it's been a week since we recorded.

180
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:34,980
What happened last week?

181
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,020
Oh, that's right.

182
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,140
Oh, on Squid Game?

183
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,940
Well, last I checked,

184
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,260
well, can I recap this one?

185
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,100
Yeah, yeah, please do.

186
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,620
He did it so beautifully at the end of the last episode.

187
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,460
A week ago.

188
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,300
Yeah, a week ago.

189
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,380
It's wild that we spent five weeks with you already.

190
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,140
I know, it's so much time.

191
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:52,980
So much time.

192
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,780
And this house is so small.

193
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:57,580
We're gonna let you out pretty soon.

194
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,980
Must be very hot where you are,

195
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,860
the four of you crammed into there.

196
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:05,100
Which you know because you're stuck in a cage in our house.

197
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:07,860
That's true.

198
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:08,860
I know this very well.

199
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,820
He's like, wow, it looks hot where you guys are.

200
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:14,300
It's pretty sweltering and torturous over here.

201
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,500
Must be nice to just be hot.

202
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,100
Through the peephole in the wall.

203
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,780
Where the David can see it all.

204
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,540
That's all a DM needs.

205
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,500
It's just the eyes of that picture.

206
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,340
It's like him.

207
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,700
You covered yourself in this substance last episode

208
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,700
that you just received from the FBI

209
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,540
showing that this mysterious substance

210
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,140
seems to be all over you,

211
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:40,540
all over the place in the water supply.

212
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,540
That made you not feel great.

213
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:46,100
You went for a leisurely drive to the countryside.

214
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,700
Well, two of you did.

215
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:51,660
I believe it was Cindy and Harlan

216
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,700
went to the countryside with young Jane Allen

217
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:57,060
for a lovely scenic trip.

218
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:00,940
And the rest of you rejoined each other at City Hall,

219
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:05,300
went inside, passed the front desk agent, Miss Khan,

220
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:08,620
ran upstairs, busted into the alderman's room

221
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,980
to finally confront them.

222
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:14,740
And what you were met with is a big pile of bodies and goo

223
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:17,140
taking up almost half the room.

224
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:22,140
And then a odd computer seems like a large laptop

225
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,340
on a table near the front door.

226
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:28,460
David, Annihilation is one of my favorite movies

227
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,300
that's come out in the past few years.

228
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,860
I really liked it a bunch.

229
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:36,220
And when you were describing the metal goop

230
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:39,140
connected to human bodies and suits,

231
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:41,940
I was getting chills like crazy.

232
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:42,780
So thanks.

233
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:45,380
That's a really, really good transition, in fact,

234
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:48,220
because the other thing we didn't do last episode

235
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:51,220
is when you walked in the door, I need your real sanity.

236
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,060
Yeah.

237
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:56,500
10.

238
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,900
I got a 13.

239
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,700
And so Dan, when Dan enters the room,

240
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:06,700
he lackadaisically sprays the solution at the blob.

241
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,380
Everything, the air turns purple.

242
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,620
Leaving the spray bottle, you see a purple,

243
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:14,540
it hits kind of the ground.

244
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:15,980
The spray bottle itself,

245
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:18,380
all the liquid inside of it just turns purple.

246
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:20,500
Did anyone fail?

247
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,340
I passed.

248
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,180
I passed.

249
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:23,000
I passed.

250
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,060
I failed with a 38 on a, oh, on a 39.

251
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:26,900
I passed.

252
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,340
Well, since you all passed,

253
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:35,540
you're only going to take one sanity damage

254
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:36,740
from the unnatural.

255
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:38,980
Otherwise it would have been a whopping eight.

256
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,560
Now is not the time to lose one's head

257
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,680
because there are several aldermen with their heads

258
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,600
stuck in this pile of goo.

259
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,880
Are they like alive or are they?

260
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,760
Oh, they're so very alive

261
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,520
that one would almost consider us to act

262
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,760
in sort of an initiative order right now.

263
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,600
Incredible.

264
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,560
Are they laying down or are they sitting

265
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,080
or are they standing around the table?

266
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,320
How are they posed?

267
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,400
They're like in a pile.

268
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,240
Oh, right, right.

269
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,040
The center of the room is the goo pile, yeah.

270
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,440
Yeah, this is this massive heap of,

271
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,640
instead of dirty clothes, it is metallic goo

272
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:20,160
and the bodies are just kind of randomly thrown into it.

273
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,040
Is it all eight aldermen?

274
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:25,000
All eight aldermen in one giant pile.

275
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,160
We even see the person that we talked to yesterday

276
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,240
in that pile.

277
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,520
Bradley Allen.

278
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,160
Someone roll luck.

279
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,760
Just give me a 50-50 luck roll.

280
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,020
49.

281
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,520
Oh!

282
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,360
There you go.

283
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,280
You do see him.

284
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,480
He is arranged in such a fashion

285
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,720
that his upper body is kind of oriented outward.

286
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,040
He is still well into the goo,

287
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,960
but you can kind of see his face towards the edge.

288
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,040
He doesn't recognize you.

289
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,000
None of these faces are looking at you, acknowledging you,

290
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,220
but given their dexterity, it starts moving towards you.

291
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:59,680
It's gonna move, cover about half the distance

292
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,320
across the room.

293
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,820
And I already took a glance at your character sheets.

294
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:07,200
Jodine and Tan, I believe, both have a 14 dex.

295
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,560
You would both be up to act next.

296
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,060
I want to say, gentlemen, aldermen,

297
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:16,520
this is no way to account yourselves in the conference room

298
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,320
and roll bureaucracy on them.

299
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,400
That's a 99, a critical failure.

300
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:33,000
The blob's like, section 9.5 of the city code

301
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,640
clearly states we can blob wherever we want it.

302
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:41,860
Your fail is so bad that it seeps into my actions.

303
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,720
Luke just loves failing so much, he doesn't want to roll.

304
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,420
Tan, what if you didn't?

305
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,320
Don't do this.

306
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,440
What if you rolled and got something good?

307
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,880
No, Tan's intent, no.

308
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,240
Tan's intent is to like spray again,

309
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,040
spray them with the solution,

310
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,240
but he grabs the wrong thing

311
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,420
and he just shoots the blob with his gun.

312
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:09,920
I assume that's with your magnum, right?

313
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,020
Correctamundo.

314
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:13,000
You've been walking around with that thing,

315
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,820
you've threatened the receptionist,

316
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,760
you went to the bathroom with it out.

317
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,480
So of course, it's already in your hand already.

318
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,320
Right.

319
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,160
It's mechanical advantage, baby.

320
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:24,080
Yeah, that's completely reasonable.

321
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,000
Go for it, give me that firearms.

322
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,280
Oh, I'm gonna pass this, easy peasy.

323
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,560
Oh no.

324
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,960
I pass it, easy peasy.

325
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,160
53 on a 70.

326
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,760
Easy peasy, is that a new thing?

327
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:38,880
You've been saying that.

328
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,320
It is, I heard it from some guy I know.

329
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,500
So that's within your range on a heavy pistol.

330
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,600
So I believe that's gonna be 1D12 damage.

331
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,960
One.

332
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,880
D12, rolled once, is.

333
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,200
So as you shoot at it,

334
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,480
you kind of notice it just takes the bullet.

335
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,520
It doesn't really seem to move,

336
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,120
try to evade it or anything else.

337
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,000
The bullet just punches into it.

338
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,720
Yeah, you hit kind of the edge of it,

339
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,560
so it doesn't hit center mass, if you will.

340
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,960
Nothing really seems to happen.

341
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,160
Okay, now I wanna do a search roll

342
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,000
to see if there's any holes in this.

343
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,420
Tiny cuts.

344
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,320
No tiny cuts.

345
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,580
As soon as Tan fires off his gun,

346
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,640
he's freaked out,

347
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,680
because he did not intend to do that.

348
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,800
And it was very loud too,

349
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,460
because when you shoot a gun, it's loud.

350
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,760
A magnum in a boardroom.

351
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,240
Right, yeah.

352
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,400
Pretty jarring.

353
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,400
The kind of sickness that he felt

354
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,300
seeing this blob of stuff comes to a head,

355
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,220
and I'll roll to see if I throw up.

356
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,860
He holds it in.

357
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:41,700
Nice.

358
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,000
Oh no, you should have barfed.

359
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,700
Human stomach acid is the only thing that can defeat it.

360
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,520
After Jodine's words don't work on this thing,

361
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,400
and he rolls the critical failure,

362
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,000
he's gonna just bolt down the hallway.

363
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,840
Run away.

364
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,960
Well, who's dexterity is higher, me or Harlan?

365
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,960
Same, both 12s.

366
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:04,160
My plan was that since I passed that sanity roll,

367
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,780
he assesses the situation pretty quick

368
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:07,600
and sees that computer.

369
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,920
You said it was a laptop, right?

370
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,960
Yeah, it's a bulky laptop.

371
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,520
It's one of those thicker, more industrial

372
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,920
or military models,

373
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:19,360
where it's made to withstand falls.

374
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,560
It's pick-up-able and take-with-able.

375
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,460
It is.

376
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:23,480
In fact, those,

377
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,960
because they're kind of so big and unwieldy,

378
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,680
they actually have handles on them

379
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,680
that make them pretty easy to grab and go.

380
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,360
Like a very large briefcase, think of it that way.

381
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,640
And you're strong enough to do that.

382
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,120
That's nothing that'll necessarily require a check.

383
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,240
Harlan's making a bolt for that.

384
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,320
That's what he wants to do,

385
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,920
is he wants to grab it and get out of that room.

386
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,720
I don't know how much I can do in a turn.

387
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,640
You can get to it, grab it,

388
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,800
and get most of the way out of the room.

389
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,080
You're not gonna be down the hallway yet.

390
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:47,920
Cool.

391
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,160
Cindy Woodabaga is gonna go to the door,

392
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,200
hold it open so that Harlan Nash can sprint out

393
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,440
with this suitcase and we can slam it closed

394
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,000
as soon as he's on the other side.

395
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,840
Okay.

396
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,920
So that brings us back to the top of the round.

397
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:04,440
The Mound of Goo gets closer and closer and closer.

398
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,260
You smiled so hard when you said that.

399
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,560
Mound of Goo is his band name.

400
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,840
You have a beautiful smile,

401
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,240
but I don't like to see it when you're talking

402
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,040
about a blob of goo coming at us.

403
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,080
As it gets to the door, with its reach,

404
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,240
with Cindy standing there ready to slam the door,

405
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:28,720
a pseudopod of goo comes lashing out,

406
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,680
almost like a metallic whip.

407
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:33,600
So this is gonna be basically an unarmed strike.

408
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,740
So you can roll to dodge it.

409
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:40,000
Yeah, I'm gonna roll to dodge, which I fail.

410
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,000
And I rolled a 17 under a 35 for the pseudopod to hit you.

411
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:46,920
Cindy.

412
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,140
And that's gonna be.

413
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:50,700
Oh shit.

414
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:54,140
Seven damage.

415
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:54,980
Oh my God.

416
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,740
That is over half of my hit points.

417
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:59,380
I was gonna say how, what's your starting point?

418
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:03,140
13 and I am now down to six current hit points.

419
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,300
How does it hit me?

420
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,740
Hard.

421
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,140
Hard.

422
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:10,700
It lashes out with this metallic goo whip

423
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,780
and hits you so hard, just right in the center mass,

424
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:14,640
right in the stomach.

425
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,660
And because you took more than half your HP,

426
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,260
I believe you also are stunned

427
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,740
on the back end of that too, right?

428
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:24,020
I believe I have to roll a constitution, is that?

429
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:25,460
Is that what it is? A thing?

430
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:29,820
I've never played Delta Green, so don't go on my word.

431
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:33,500
I was just trying to get out of being stunned for a round.

432
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,020
If you guys need to check, I know already, I know the rules.

433
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:38,060
So yeah, just roll con and.

434
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:40,580
You're not stunned and you get to hit it back.

435
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:41,540
Yeah.

436
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:43,540
Actually the damage it dealt to you,

437
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:46,540
you counter attack and it actually gets dealt to them.

438
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:49,220
And it heals you seven and you deal seven points.

439
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:51,260
This is all really great news that you guys are.

440
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,100
Yeah.

441
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,260
Wow, that's pretty interesting.

442
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,000
How you play Delta Green.

443
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:56,940
Yep.

444
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:57,760
All right, that checks out.

445
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,600
I think that works.

446
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,940
Clearly I don't care about rules at all in any capacity.

447
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:05,820
Yeah, you show him, David.

448
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:08,500
It is an automatic, I'm sorry, I'm being there.

449
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,060
Oh, wow.

450
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:12,180
We've got the real lawyer over here.

451
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,020
There you go.

452
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,600
It is an automatic stun if a single attack

453
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,760
inflicts half of your agent's current HP.

454
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,360
Ouchie, ouchie.

455
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,200
You're stunned.

456
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,040
Stunned.

457
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:20,960
You wanted to close that door,

458
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,560
but you kinda can't right now.

459
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,760
Yeah, the stunner's stunned.

460
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,120
But that's all the goo is gonna do.

461
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:31,600
Tan sees this happen, he takes a shot at the goo arm.

462
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,840
Okay, take a shot.

463
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,400
48 on a 70, he succeeds, he hits it.

464
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,320
Give me damage.

465
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,140
Six.

466
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:43,140
You hit a chunkier portion of the slimy goo,

467
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,140
but it doesn't slow down.

468
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:49,100
And I just also wanna state mechanically,

469
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,940
Cindy is stunned for this round,

470
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,980
which means Cindy is not gonna be able to move

471
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:55,600
or do anything and will have to make the con check

472
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,960
to make sure she can act on her subsequent turn.

473
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,620
How about a super long flashback?

474
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,460
No?

475
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,660
Okay, sounds good.

476
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,460
Joe Dean is running down this hallway

477
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:06,880
and he's looking for a supply closet.

478
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,720
Roll me luck.

479
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:12,740
54.

480
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:18,060
No closets in this building, not a single closet.

481
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:20,620
It's a really odd architectural design.

482
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:21,980
The janitor wears cargo pants.

483
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:24,180
So then he busts into the first bathroom he sees

484
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,140
after he doesn't see cars.

485
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,440
Okay, if this goes long,

486
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,800
you can get into this episode six closet.

487
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,640
Ah.

488
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:34,760
See what you did there.

489
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,600
Call back.

490
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,900
That's the best joke so far.

491
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:43,060
That's the best joke we've ever made on our podcast.

492
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:46,860
So he, Kramer slides into this bathroom.

493
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:47,900
92 reference.

494
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,900
Seinfeld on Netflix now.

495
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:50,740
Kramer versus Kramer?

496
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:52,340
Kramer versus Kramer.

497
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:54,100
You know, when Kramer famously,

498
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:57,260
whichever Kramer, slides into Jerry's apartment.

499
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,500
He slides into this bathroom

500
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,980
and he's looking for any cleaning supplies.

501
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,820
Oh sure, yeah, he could find cleaning supplies.

502
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,060
That's no problem.

503
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:07,140
Some Clorox with bleach, some Windex.

504
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,140
Yep, everything.

505
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:10,500
And he's specifically, he's remembering the solvent

506
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,420
that Merle's bar reeked of.

507
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,980
He doesn't know if he's onto something here,

508
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:17,580
but maybe if we talked to them a little more,

509
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,440
we might've found they were keeping some stuff

510
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,280
at bay with that.

511
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,300
But that's all he's got in this moment.

512
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:25,180
I have 70 firearms, but my character doesn't carry a gun.

513
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:31,860
So he grabs the bleach and comes running back

514
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,520
any cleaner he can find.

515
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,860
Okay, sure.

516
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:39,780
Now, that is going to bring us to stunned Cindy

517
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:42,220
and a non-stunned Harlan.

518
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:44,140
I was trying to look up, is there a mechanic?

519
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:44,980
Oh, go ahead.

520
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,380
Are you gonna say a mechanic on the stunned?

521
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,660
Yeah, if there's something I can do

522
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:48,700
to snap her out of it.

523
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,700
So you can't, she can roll now.

524
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:55,000
So give me that con times five test.

525
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:55,840
Con.

526
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,700
Hey, 24 on 65.

527
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,660
All right, so success, not a crit success.

528
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:02,860
So that means you're gonna be back normally next turn,

529
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:05,140
but you are kind of dazed this turn.

530
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:06,720
What you can do to help her,

531
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,420
because you're basically adjacent right now,

532
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:12,580
you have that suitcase of a computer in one hand.

533
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:14,140
I'll say you can drag her.

534
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:15,100
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

535
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,380
I didn't know if she was rooted in place or not.

536
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:19,140
Yeah, that's exactly what I wanted to do

537
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,940
is just like pull her along.

538
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:21,780
Okay.

539
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:22,600
Yeah, we gotta go.

540
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,440
You can do that.

541
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,280
So that'll be your turn.

542
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,300
Get as far down the hallway as you can.

543
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,960
Yep, I guess we're heading toward the stairs.

544
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,140
We wanna get out of this building, I think.

545
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:28,960
Exactly.

546
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,460
So you do that and you notice

547
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:33,060
as you get a little further away

548
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:35,220
and as it would be kind of the ooze's turn,

549
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:39,020
the ooze kind of stops at the threshold to the hallway

550
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,980
and rumbles a bit and you can feel it in the floor,

551
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:45,220
but doesn't follow.

552
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,820
It stops right at the threshold.

553
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,780
Yeah, we can drop out of initiative too.

554
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,580
You can just talk this through.

555
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:52,300
Cindy is unstunned.

556
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,520
Joe Dean has cleaning materials.

557
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:58,180
Tan continues to just unload his gun.

558
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,540
He's still in the room.

559
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,900
It's blocking the doorway.

560
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:02,740
Back out slowly.

561
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:03,560
I thought he got out.

562
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,400
I thought he got out.

563
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,240
I thought you were out.

564
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,500
Yeah, I'm pretty sure you were out.

565
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:09,700
No, I was in the room shooting at him.

566
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,020
But then we all ran out.

567
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,260
I didn't run out though.

568
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,940
But you described shooting at it from where Joe was.

569
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:16,900
Yeah, I thought you were shooting at it

570
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:19,980
when you shot its tentacle out of the door crack.

571
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,740
You were close to the tentacle impact, I thought.

572
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:22,580
Maybe I was wrong.

573
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:25,060
I was imagining I was in the room.

574
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:26,060
But thankfully you weren't,

575
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:27,500
because then you'd be dead.

576
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,340
Yeah.

577
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,940
Oh, thank God Luke wasn't in that room.

578
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,380
You can be wherever you wanna be, Luke.

579
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,220
This is an imagination.

580
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:38,220
I'm still in the room and I unload my gun on it

581
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,860
because it's blocking the doorway.

582
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:41,420
Okay, shoot away.

583
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:43,340
Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.

584
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:45,620
Four shots and then the chamber's empty.

585
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:49,520
And they all hit.

586
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,800
Roll damage.

587
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,540
But not very well, two.

588
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:01,820
Oh, so two, you don't quite hit the first edge

589
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:02,900
that you hit for one,

590
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:06,100
nor this more center mass you hit for, I believe, six.

591
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:09,220
You hit it, doesn't seem to do a lot.

592
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:12,220
But now, apparently, your back is against the wall.

593
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:15,220
Pseudopod is kind of blocking that double door

594
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:17,060
and it's everyone else's turn?

595
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:18,060
Sounds about right.

596
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,620
Okay, Joe Dean,

597
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:22,660
you are in that current portion of initiative.

598
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:25,340
You have cleaning supplies.

599
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:28,020
Fan's in there, he's in there.

600
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:31,620
Yeah, yeah, he is, and Joe Dean just starts.

601
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,260
He's gonna take his cigarette lighter

602
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:38,260
and a half can of aerosol air spray from the bathroom

603
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:40,540
and he's gonna fucking torch this thing.

604
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:43,060
Okay, nice improvised little flamethrower.

605
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:45,020
You are gonna be close enough, though,

606
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:47,140
that it probably could lash out at you next turn,

607
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:49,300
just as an FYI, but.

608
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,740
I knew the risks when I signed up for Delta Green.

609
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:56,740
I am gonna call that just firearms, I guess.

610
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,220
16.

611
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:02,060
All right, 16 under something high.

612
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,820
Yeah, because you are the guy with a 70

613
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:06,620
who doesn't carry a weapon.

614
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:07,900
Okay, great.

615
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:11,940
Give me a D6 damage for that.

616
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:14,420
Two.

617
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:19,100
Even though it was a two, it seems to actually affect it.

618
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:22,620
The flame touching it seems to burn some of the metal,

619
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:26,180
almost make the metallic goo kind of solidify

620
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:29,220
and become solid, and there's no real sound,

621
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,940
but it rumbles a bit, but that part of the surface

622
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:34,900
towards the front that you were most adjacent to

623
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,580
seems to cook a little bit.

624
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:40,300
As Cindy shakes herself out of this haze that she's in,

625
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:43,940
she yells to Tanner, who's trapped in this room

626
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:47,660
with all of this broken down wood from the table.

627
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,420
You gotta set it on fire!

628
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:51,860
You gotta set it all on fire!

629
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:56,580
And then she looks to Harlan and Joe and is like,

630
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,660
we need to get everything that can burn,

631
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,340
we need to barricade this door,

632
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:02,780
and we need to light it on fire from this side.

633
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:05,940
We have lost Tanner, but he is gonna go out

634
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:08,060
taking this thing down with him.

635
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:10,860
Harlan is taking orders from a drill sergeant

636
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:14,340
and is now beelining for another office on this floor

637
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:17,020
to find another table or chairs or anything

638
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:19,660
to help with building a fire barricade.

639
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:21,420
You can find that, no problem.

640
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:22,820
What do you do with the laptop, though?

641
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:26,740
He's gonna leave it on the floor, but far away.

642
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:28,460
What if you, you've got computer science, right?

643
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:30,140
Yeah, I thought it would be unrealistic

644
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:32,820
for me to sit down and work on it.

645
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,500
I thought about that.

646
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,900
You've got all the stuff, that's good,

647
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:38,300
now open up that laptop, start looking through it

648
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,820
as we light this thing on fire.

649
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:40,660
You got it!

650
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:42,740
Oh, look at him die.

651
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:44,220
Give me a computer science roll.

652
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:50,220
That's a critical fail!

653
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,060
No!

654
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,900
That's a 88.

655
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:55,740
You're gonna make the metal stronger.

656
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,100
You got nothing.

657
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:02,020
In your panic, you start typing away at the computer,

658
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:03,580
there's a password screen,

659
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:06,220
and it's a military-grade laptop, like I said,

660
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:10,220
and kind of in your haste, you mess something up

661
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:12,620
and it went into a five-minute timeout.

662
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:13,820
Football, one, two, three.

663
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,380
Football, one, two, three, four.

664
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:20,220
Watch this guy, one, watch this guy, two.

665
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:24,140
So Cindy, you scream, did you do anything else?

666
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:29,140
She's going to assist now that the barricade has been built

667
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:32,020
and go ahead and attempt to light this thing on fire.

668
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:34,500
Helping Jodine, Jodine has a lighter, she knows,

669
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:37,020
so she's trying to help him start this fire.

670
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:41,300
She takes just the most prickly sweater

671
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:44,340
that she has in her backpack and pulls it out

672
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:47,460
and it's just like a fire starter, this thing.

673
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,300
You're looking at it, if you light it-

674
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,140
Twisted fire starter?

675
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:52,620
The whole thing is just going to go off.

676
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:54,260
You just know it, David.

677
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:57,100
Yeah, that was before they had good safety,

678
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:59,300
like when it came to clothing, like those-

679
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:01,020
Safety sweaters. They show you the dummy.

680
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:03,580
Yeah, they show you the dummy and like it catches a spark

681
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:05,260
and the person just like combusts.

682
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:08,580
Yeah, so rather than immolate herself,

683
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,820
she's going to finally be rid of this dangerous sweater.

684
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:13,700
Good, now you're not going to be able to light it,

685
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,020
it's going to be on Jodine's turn, right?

686
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:15,860
Right.

687
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:18,260
Okay, so sweater is down, great.

688
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:21,180
Top of the round, pseudopod is going to lash out again

689
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:25,860
from the slime, but unfortunately this time,

690
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,900
tan is going to be on the receiving end of it.

691
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:30,220
So you can feel free to roll me a dodge,

692
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:32,100
but it does not like being shot at.

693
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:36,020
I have a 14 under a 35, what do you got?

694
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:37,900
Oh, I got a 95.

695
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:40,380
Under?

696
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:44,900
Oh yeah, I have a hundred actually in dodge.

697
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:47,740
Very nimble tanner lube hide.

698
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:51,540
All right, you are going to take five points of damage.

699
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,660
Five points of damage.

700
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:57,020
Okay, that brings me down to 10 points of damage.

701
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,900
You can't lube hide from this thing.

702
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,740
At least you didn't really take half your HP though

703
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:02,100
this time, so you're not stunned,

704
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:05,980
but this time it lashes out and then cracks you.

705
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:06,940
Can't lube hide.

706
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:10,780
Say it in the microphone like a man.

707
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:14,060
I couldn't see, I couldn't hear what you said.

708
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:15,100
I just heard my name.

709
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:15,940
Say it.

710
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,820
I'm sorry, I didn't intend to interrupt.

711
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:18,660
You can say it now.

712
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:23,660
I pointed out, he can lube run, but he can't lube hide.

713
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:26,380
Incredible.

714
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:30,140
It's good, you just have to put names in it

715
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:31,340
and it gets even better.

716
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:36,340
Yeah, so it punches me or like what happens?

717
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:39,260
Yeah, yeah, five damage manifested in the way

718
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:41,420
of it lashes out at you instead of hitting you

719
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:43,300
right in the bread basket like Cindy,

720
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:48,060
it hits you in the shins and cracks one of your shins

721
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:52,100
and you feel your weight on that leg and it hurts,

722
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,180
but you're still up, it doesn't knock you down.

723
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:55,580
You still have your Magnum.

724
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:57,980
You did not actually shoot four rounds last round.

725
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:59,580
So you still have bullets in it.

726
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:02,620
And that brings us to you.

727
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:07,500
So yeah, Tan is like, what the fuck is going on?

728
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:11,660
Like he sees them start barricading him inside of here

729
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:14,460
and he's not happy about that at all.

730
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:16,260
His shin is like all fucked up.

731
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:20,500
He takes a package of skull out of his back pocket

732
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:23,540
and puts the whole thing, huge dip in his mouth

733
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:25,420
and it temporarily, you know.

734
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:27,740
I think that gives you advantage on rolls.

735
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:29,180
Unfortunately it is your whole turn.

736
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:30,860
I was going to say, I think it temporarily

737
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:35,420
gives me a little boost, but he holsters his Magnum

738
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:40,300
and he wants to just try to jump over the barricade

739
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,780
and out the door.

740
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:47,140
Okay, so you want to do a run and leap.

741
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,220
A running leap.

742
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:50,580
High jump over the metal ooze.

743
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:54,500
Over the ooze, over the barricade, out the door.

744
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,060
If he makes it out of here, he's going to have

745
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:58,220
some choice words for these motherfuckers.

746
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:02,860
All I'm going to say is I really hope you took athletics

747
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:05,900
because this is going to be an athletics role.

748
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:08,500
This, remember, and here's the issue.

749
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:12,500
This pile was like half the room.

750
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:16,540
And so it's covering, this is a leap

751
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:18,860
and not like leap and stay on your feet.

752
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:21,300
This is like the full forward dive.

753
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:22,300
I'm going head first.

754
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,060
Which is why he's going to use pilot.

755
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:25,020
Yeah, yes.

756
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:30,020
Make me an athletics at a minus 20.

757
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:36,420
Otherwise you're landing in the goo.

758
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:41,420
I failed a 65 on with my minus 20 of 50.

759
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:45,220
Oh shit, you were good at athletics.

760
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:52,180
As I'm running and leaping, the force that I put on my leg

761
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,540
finishes the break in my leg

762
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:56,580
and it just snaps underneath my weight.

763
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:02,020
And I fall within inches of the blob.

764
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,540
Just before it.

765
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,060
Before it, not after it.

766
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:09,900
So you didn't?

767
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:10,740
I didn't make it over.

768
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:14,100
No, as soon as I like tried to jump, my leg snapped

769
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:17,140
and I just fell down and my head is like two inches away

770
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:18,860
from the edge of the goo blob.

771
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:20,860
You fall down next to the blob

772
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:23,660
and really close to just a randomly placed Aldermen's

773
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:25,380
like blank face.

774
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:30,780
Just staring out in the distance, not at you,

775
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:34,020
but just lifelessly peering out of the goo at you

776
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:36,980
as you flop on the ground with your now broken,

777
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,060
fully broken chin.

778
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:39,340
Civic gooverment.

779
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:45,060
There's your episode title.

780
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,980
Yeah, there's the blank face next to him,

781
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:52,300
but if he looked up into the doorway

782
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:56,260
whereas his fellow Delta Green or Greenies

783
00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:01,060
are, he would see Joe Dean's like face staring at him

784
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:05,060
very intently and he looks sad and then he looks determined

785
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:09,660
and you see Harlan on one side and Cindy on the other,

786
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:12,380
like closing the big doors.

787
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:16,660
As they do, he takes his spray can, flamethrower

788
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:19,300
and blast it onto the wood.

789
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:21,780
Tan is on the ground, face down on the ground,

790
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:24,380
just yelling, how could you do this to me,

791
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:26,660
you fucking monsters?

792
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:29,020
Fair.

793
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:29,860
Yeah, super fair.

794
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:32,820
I want the other three of you to roll sanity.

795
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:35,900
Yeah.

796
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:40,340
Pass, 26.

797
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:42,060
It's a pass with a seven.

798
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,580
They don't give a shit about me.

799
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:44,900
I actually fail.

800
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:48,660
Yeah, Cindy fails, 52 over 38.

801
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:50,300
It was that tattoo bond.

802
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,380
It was the tattoos.

803
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,780
That's gonna be two sanity

804
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:54,300
and then the other two of you are fine.

805
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,660
That's a breaking point, sir.

806
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:56,740
Oh, is it now?

807
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:57,580
Ruh-roh.

808
00:34:57,580 --> 00:35:01,060
Unless you wanna project, but if you're anything like Luke,

809
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:02,860
you like your bonds too much to do that.

810
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:06,020
I would never ever do that to my grandson, Wally,

811
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,580
nor my gambling friend, Sharla.

812
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:11,020
That's fair.

813
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,300
In what disorder do you have already?

814
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:16,900
A need for making others uncomfortable.

815
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:17,740
Okay.

816
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,500
You're gonna cheat people at a distance.

817
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,420
You're gonna pick up some amnesia.

818
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:26,980
Not being able to necessarily piece things back together.

819
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:29,620
David wants you to stop having those flashback episodes.

820
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:33,020
No, I think he's saying more, more.

821
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:38,820
I'm glad you can read between the lines.

822
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:44,460
And in that moment, Cindy's eyes roll in the back of her head.

823
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:48,820
This sanity check has really taken her to a dark place.

824
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:51,180
She watches these memories disappear.

825
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:53,020
Number one.

826
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:54,700
Riding a bike.

827
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:57,900
Her husband was trying to hurt her grandson, Wally.

828
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,740
No, no.

829
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,220
With some natural force.

830
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:03,260
Oh, he got one in there.

831
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,100
Slit it in.

832
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,100
He got one in anyway.

833
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:08,340
Let's roll damage on that fire

834
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:13,140
as Tan is no longer visible, as the doors ignite,

835
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:16,860
the sweater ignites and whatever solvents you threw in.

836
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:20,420
First, a check to see if we get a crit success

837
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:22,940
or a crit failure firearms again

838
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:24,980
to see the effectiveness of this.

839
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:27,820
60 on a 70.

840
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:29,460
So success, that's good.

841
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:31,020
And then I'm gonna need damage.

842
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:33,060
There's a lot more accelerant now.

843
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:36,860
So in fact, I'm gonna want you to roll 2D8 on this.

844
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:37,700
Ooh.

845
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:38,540
Ooh.

846
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:44,780
One and four, five.

847
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:49,940
It cooks a bit more, but now it's out of your vision.

848
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:53,980
You're not quite sure exactly what happened to it

849
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:58,140
now that the doors are on fire and oh,

850
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:00,140
the whole town hall is starting to catch a flame.

851
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:00,980
Good.

852
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:01,820
Good, yeah.

853
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:02,660
Good.

854
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:04,420
Yeah, that was a plus in my mind from the get go.

855
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:07,060
If that wasn't happening, that was my plan.

856
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:07,900
Yeah, right.

857
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:09,980
What do you do?

858
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:12,540
Tan stands up and he's like one leg

859
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:15,460
hopping over to the window that's like barricaded

860
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:18,180
by the wood, the table, the whatever, you know,

861
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:20,520
just trying to rip that off the window.

862
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:24,380
Give me a strength check to see if you can get it loose.

863
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:25,780
Strength times five, I mean.

864
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:28,940
92.

865
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:31,500
I stand up and as I'm like trying to jerk

866
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:35,100
the like barricade stuff off, I...

867
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:40,100
That was surprisingly unintentional.

868
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:45,540
That was good, yeah.

869
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:48,300
As I'm trying to rip that off, I...

870
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,140
You shout, winners is coming.

871
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:55,540
Tan puts, in order to get some leverage,

872
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:58,740
he puts some weight on his broken leg

873
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:01,340
and just collapses again.

874
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:04,300
And as he collapses, part of his like shin bone

875
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:05,900
is like poking out of his leg.

876
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:10,640
We just hear his anguished scream.

877
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,480
Ah!

878
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:15,500
As we're booking it down the stairs.

879
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:18,220
Joe Dean is just like spraying everything he can

880
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:20,380
with this flamethrower like lighter set up.

881
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:23,220
Cindy takes one last look back down the hallway

882
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:25,540
before we make our way to the stairwell.

883
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:26,700
Harlan's grabbing the computer.

884
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,900
So the three of you are just, you grab the computer,

885
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:31,740
you're booking it down, you see the doors are burning,

886
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:33,260
you can see smoke kind of coming through

887
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:36,940
the crack of the door, see the fire starting to radiate out

888
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,340
and catch more of the hallway.

889
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:41,060
A lot of this town hall, even though it's stone

890
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:43,260
on the outside, there's still a lot of wood inside.

891
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:45,400
It's that old retro wooden paneling,

892
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,780
similar to what you saw in the original room

893
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:50,220
at the FBI briefing.

894
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:51,380
And it's igniting.

895
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:54,100
So the three of you are gonna be able to get outside

896
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:58,940
this round and Tan, still alive.

897
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,820
There's a lot of smoke though.

898
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:05,260
So for him to try one last time to rip open that window,

899
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:08,300
I'm gonna need a con times five check first

900
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:12,300
to see if he can overcome the smoke filling up his lungs

901
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,780
to use just one last burst of strength.

902
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,980
That's a nine on a 60.

903
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,780
You're able to hold your breath.

904
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:29,780
You don't let the smoke kind of overtake your lungs.

905
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:31,980
You still have enough oxygen in your bloodstream

906
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:35,720
to pull one more time at the board on the window.

907
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:38,720
Yeah, he picks himself back up.

908
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,140
He checks the chamber of his gun

909
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:43,600
and he's got three shots left.

910
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:46,080
And at the edge of like the wood,

911
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:49,300
this barricading the door, he just like fires into it

912
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:51,300
to try to like break it up a little bit

913
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:54,260
and then attempts to reach into the hole he's made

914
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:55,500
and pull it off.

915
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:57,540
Give me that strength.

916
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:58,860
35 pass.

917
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:01,780
You shoot it, point blank, splinter it a bit,

918
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:04,740
get it a little bit more loose, pops to the side.

919
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:06,880
There's smoke now pouring out

920
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,940
of that second story window of town hall

921
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:12,540
and your body is kind of just hanging out

922
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:15,820
at that first bit of fresh air, you gasp,

923
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:19,820
clear your lungs out,

924
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:23,020
but now you feel behind you the heat radiating

925
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:25,860
and that hot, hot smoke coming out behind you.

926
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:28,380
You can feel it almost discoloring your clothes.

927
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:30,740
It's such an intense burning right now.

928
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:31,660
What do you do?

929
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:34,940
Speaking of con checks, I want to check for Jennifer Khan.

930
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:36,740
How would you check for her?

931
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:37,580
Would you?

932
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:38,700
As we're like running down,

933
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:40,420
like assume we're passing her desk.

934
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:42,260
Oh yeah, I shout, Khan!

935
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:48,140
How would you check for her?

936
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:50,060
I didn't get it at first.

937
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:50,900
Good note, Joe.

938
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,820
There's no Khan, no response from Khan.

939
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:57,660
Khan!

940
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:01,860
Quick, if we get outside,

941
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:03,620
if he's trying to get out that window,

942
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:06,060
which we know he's trying to survive this,

943
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:09,140
then maybe we can grab that fitted sheet on three sides

944
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:10,740
and pull it tight enough to catch him.

945
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:13,380
Yeah, or maybe we put one in his corpse

946
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:15,540
when he hits, you know, when he hits the ground,

947
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:16,480
put one in his head.

948
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,220
You're not going to have time to get the sheet.

949
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:19,980
The fitted sheet from the hotel.

950
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:21,820
We scream.

951
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:24,780
Right clicker!

952
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:25,620
There!

953
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:28,480
When I'm looking out the window,

954
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:31,300
is there like a ledge that I can like get onto

955
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:33,520
and try to like at least lower myself

956
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,420
like five more feet before I just.

957
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:38,060
Yep, there's a stone ledge and below you,

958
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,580
it's somewhat garden.

959
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,260
There's some really low bushes

960
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:43,420
and then also just some ground.

961
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:45,460
Okay, so I, yeah, so.

962
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:47,460
Roll him luck.

963
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:48,300
Roll luck.

964
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:49,120
Roll me luck.

965
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:49,960
Let me set this up first.

966
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:50,780
Roll luck.

967
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:51,620
You set it up.

968
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:52,460
Okay, set it up, set it up.

969
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:53,740
The man gets out on the ledge.

970
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:56,900
He like crawls down and like hangs off the ledge.

971
00:41:56,900 --> 00:42:00,020
So he's, you know, like a little bit closer to the ground.

972
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:00,980
And it's like a really short,

973
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:02,940
and basically his feet are just like

974
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:05,340
pretty much dangling right above the ground.

975
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:06,520
He looks down and he sees,

976
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:09,500
there's either like pavement or bushes

977
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:13,020
and he's going to like try to swing himself into the bushes

978
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:15,500
and try to land like horizontally onto them.

979
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:20,500
And it, and he loses his grip.

980
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:28,580
He loses his grip while he's swinging and starts falling.

981
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:31,860
Just so you know that a fail, a fail on my luck check.

982
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:33,940
Because you lowered yourself down,

983
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:37,060
you went from a distance where we'd be rolling

984
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:41,100
a lethality roll to actually control the amount of damage.

985
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:41,940
Hell yes.

986
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:44,140
So you're going to take two D six damage.

987
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:51,420
Six damage as you belly flop down into some mulch,

988
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:55,860
no hedges, maybe some low flowers.

989
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:59,500
Now I need a contest as well.

990
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:02,340
Con times five check that comes after the fall.

991
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:06,100
That is a success 13 on a 60.

992
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:09,020
So you flop, stomach down,

993
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:11,020
but not hard enough for you to lose your breath

994
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:12,220
and become stunned.

995
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:14,740
Anyone who survives the fall has to see if they're stunned.

996
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:17,940
Okay. I did, but I did, I did just take,

997
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:19,740
I'm down to four hit points.

998
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:22,020
So I took more than half, took more than half.

999
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:23,340
But was that what that role was?

1000
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:24,740
No, that was for the fall.

1001
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:26,420
So you're stunned anyway.

1002
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:27,300
Yeah. Fair.

1003
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:29,220
Yeah. When I fall it, yeah.

1004
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:30,820
I land horizontally.

1005
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:33,440
I like brace my head with my arm as I fall.

1006
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,220
So I don't like whack my head.

1007
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:38,300
Breath is knocked out of me and I'm like, I can't move.

1008
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:39,580
I can't function right now.

1009
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:40,500
At least you got out.

1010
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:43,520
Joe Dean looks over at Harlan

1011
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,520
and he, he looks at the gun he carries and he says,

1012
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,480
do you have what it takes to do it?

1013
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:52,280
Or will you give me that gun?

1014
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:55,280
I, I think I should, I should,

1015
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:57,520
I think I should work on the computer here.

1016
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:01,760
He takes his, he takes his pistol and walks over to tan.

1017
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,280
Who's screaming.

1018
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,120
Yeah.

1019
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:04,960
Fuck!

1020
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:07,120
Yes!

1021
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,040
Oh, thank God.

1022
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:12,280
Help me.

1023
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:13,120
You need to.

1024
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:13,940
You piece of shit.

1025
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:15,280
Fuck you, by the way.

1026
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:16,120
Fair.

1027
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:17,680
But you got to keep your voice down kid.

1028
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:19,920
Can't be heard screaming like this.

1029
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,740
Just, ah.

1030
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:25,000
I reach my hands out.

1031
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,040
Birds?

1032
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:35,880
A flock of birds?

1033
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:37,680
A bunch of pigeons from the roof.

1034
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:39,360
No.

1035
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:40,480
Holy shit, dude.

1036
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,120
I don't think he can do it.

1037
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:44,360
He turns and looks at Cindy.

1038
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,340
All right, then you have to carry him.

1039
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:51,320
All right.

1040
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:57,320
And I, yeah, I pick his broken body up from the ground

1041
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:00,940
and, and like fireman carry him away from there.

1042
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:03,080
Yeah, let's get to the Bronco stat.

1043
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:04,780
You get him into the Bronco.

1044
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:05,960
The building is burning.

1045
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:09,120
It is a raging inferno now.

1046
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:12,360
You don't see Khan, no matter how loud you scream.

1047
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,840
But remember the town hall is right in the center

1048
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:19,240
of Grover'sville and around it,

1049
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:21,220
there was the Sheriff's office next door,

1050
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:23,200
the town library, the post office.

1051
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:27,920
Just as you're getting into the Bronco and the inferno,

1052
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:31,640
you're confident that pile of goo is thoroughly cooked

1053
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:32,480
at this point.

1054
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:35,780
It seemed as though fire is what really could damage it.

1055
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:40,420
But almost as soon as fire fully engulfs the upper floor

1056
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:44,260
of the building, you see people in town walking out

1057
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:46,780
of their places of business.

1058
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:49,780
You see the Sheriff, Dan Oakley, who you would talk to,

1059
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:52,940
some of his deputies kind of just walking out in front

1060
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:54,820
of the Sheriff's office.

1061
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:58,980
You see the presumably librarian walk out of the library.

1062
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:01,660
Some postal workers walk out of the post office.

1063
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:03,540
Murrell's auto and body is right there.

1064
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:05,220
Some of the mechanics walk out.

1065
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:07,140
And you can see even in the distance,

1066
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:09,660
some of the further businesses, everyone's walking out,

1067
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:12,460
but they're not walking out looking at the fire

1068
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:13,920
or looking at you.

1069
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:18,920
They walk out and you see them grasping at their necks

1070
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:24,300
and body as they just start uncontrollably vomiting

1071
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:28,740
and coughing so loud and violently.

1072
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:31,300
You can see almost their eyes go bloodshot.

1073
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:35,420
They're coughing so hard as capillaries burst in their eyes

1074
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:39,780
and slowly they all just keel over.

1075
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:41,500
And everyone that walked out,

1076
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:44,020
whether it's the Sheriff's librarian,

1077
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:45,780
you're sitting in the Bronco watching this

1078
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:49,580
within a couple of minutes, no movement.

1079
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:50,420
What about us?

1080
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:51,620
Yeah, how are we feeling?

1081
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:53,060
We don't give a shit about them.

1082
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:53,900
Yeah.

1083
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:57,460
No, that's fucking crazy though.

1084
00:46:57,460 --> 00:46:58,700
That's so fucking awesome.

1085
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:00,100
That's a really cool scene.

1086
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:04,060
Joe, unfortunately, and by Joe, I mean, Harlan.

1087
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:05,020
My partner, oh.

1088
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:08,740
Oh, Joe.

1089
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:09,580
Yeah.

1090
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:11,340
He starts to not feel good as well.

1091
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:17,020
There's something wrong.

1092
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:17,860
What happened?

1093
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:19,380
Did he fall out a fucking window?

1094
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:23,260
I should have shot him.

1095
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:25,380
He's angry.

1096
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:26,380
He's very mad.

1097
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:32,340
Joe, you start to feel inside your body in your lower back

1098
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:35,740
around where your kidneys are, your intestines,

1099
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:37,940
an intense amount of pain.

1100
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:42,580
And as you feel that pain, it starts to move further up

1101
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:46,340
almost as if your organs are reorganizing themselves

1102
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:48,740
up into your stomach, into your chest

1103
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:50,300
and it gets harder and harder to breathe

1104
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:55,020
and you can feel yourself also slowly asphyxiating.

1105
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:56,900
I imagine that he was in the back seat

1106
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:59,700
and he is now pushing himself against the back of the seat

1107
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:01,860
and he's now kind of going back over

1108
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:03,940
and he's now in the back of the Bronco writhing

1109
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:05,460
in that space back there.

1110
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:11,060
Presumably all over the shattered body of.

1111
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:13,220
Yeah, you stepped on me for sure.

1112
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:15,660
Does anyone do anything?

1113
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:16,500
No.

1114
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:18,140
No, I lay there.

1115
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:19,340
No one took medicine.

1116
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:20,700
No one took medicine.

1117
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:22,180
No one can do anything.

1118
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:25,700
I mean, I try to show him his own pistol.

1119
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:28,020
I ask if he wants this to end.

1120
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:29,740
I think yes, but I'll double check with David.

1121
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,500
Is this the kind of excruciating,

1122
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:33,380
am I experiencing death at this point

1123
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:35,460
or do I feel like I could do something?

1124
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:37,260
Having watched what happened to everyone else,

1125
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:39,740
it happened to everyone else much quicker,

1126
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:41,620
but you can feel those coughs coming on.

1127
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:44,740
You can feel your eyes, just the pressure against it

1128
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:47,940
from gasping for breath plus the coughs.

1129
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:49,940
You're not vomiting uncontrollably or anything

1130
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:52,380
at this point, but it doesn't look good.

1131
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:55,060
Through spasms in his body, wracking his body,

1132
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:58,060
he is trying his hardest to nod yes with eyes bleeding.

1133
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:00,460
Oh, woof.

1134
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:02,540
Cindy looks in the rear view mirror.

1135
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:03,500
Do it.

1136
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:05,060
I open the back of the Bronco

1137
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:08,340
and I just drag Harlan out like a sack of potatoes

1138
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:10,780
by the scruff of his shirt.

1139
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:14,780
I'm sorry, I liked your polos

1140
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:16,460
and he puts one between the eyes.

1141
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:17,540
I'm gonna roll dodge.

1142
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:21,620
Oh, the alien got him.

1143
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:25,940
Get in.

1144
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:28,100
We have to call.

1145
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:29,300
Where's the Crown Vic?

1146
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:30,140
It's at the hotel.

1147
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:30,980
All right, let's go.

1148
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:32,060
No, it's here, it's here.

1149
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:33,140
Let's ditch the Bronco.

1150
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:34,340
We get in the DEA car.

1151
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:36,900
We need to get on the phone and call Derringer, stat.

1152
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:39,820
And I put Harlan in the trunk of the DEA car.

1153
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:41,700
You really are fucking monsters.

1154
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:44,220
Get in the back and shut the fuck up.

1155
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:45,220
Jesus, too much.

1156
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:47,740
No, not really.

1157
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:49,140
Not really.

1158
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:50,020
Appropriate.

1159
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:50,860
It's fitting.

1160
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:53,940
And she's gonna call our handler Derringer

1161
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:58,700
at a number that is likely being listened to, she assumes.

1162
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:01,180
Bring, bring, bring, bring.

1163
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:03,380
Yeah, we knock and ring the doorbell, too.

1164
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:07,580
Yeah?

1165
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:08,420
Who is it?

1166
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:10,220
It's Woodabaga.

1167
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:11,340
We're leaving.

1168
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:13,060
Whoa, whoa, whoa, stop, stop, stop.

1169
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:14,060
Where are you calling from?

1170
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:15,740
The car.

1171
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:17,420
A car phone, nice.

1172
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:20,740
They haven't really learned to track those

1173
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:22,220
or listen to those as well.

1174
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:24,420
I'll keep that in mind as I tell you everything.

1175
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:26,980
Yeah, smart.

1176
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:27,820
What do you got?

1177
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:30,220
Grover'sville needs a cleanup crew ASAP.

1178
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:33,060
The cover story is that there's a drug

1179
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:35,180
called super meth in the area.

1180
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:36,380
Got into the water supply.

1181
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:40,460
Got into the water supply, took out damn near everyone.

1182
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:42,260
I would say literally everyone.

1183
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:45,460
Maybe we get some plants that say that they survived.

1184
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:46,300
What do you have, Joe?

1185
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:49,100
Well, when we say cleanup, first of all,

1186
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:51,220
hi, hello, hi, it's Joe.

1187
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:53,940
When we say cleanup,

1188
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:56,140
you might have to burn this place to the ground.

1189
00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:58,900
Yeah, we're talking 1199 bodies.

1190
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:00,180
And something needs to,

1191
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:03,900
you probably need to send a more specialist team

1192
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:06,380
to maybe investigate the water supply.

1193
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:08,780
Yeah, and a computer scientist.

1194
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:11,580
Oh yeah, we just shot our computer scientist.

1195
00:51:11,580 --> 00:51:15,020
We've got information, so we have a laptop.

1196
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:16,020
Wait, what do you have?

1197
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:16,940
Hold on, you have a laptop.

1198
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:18,420
All right, get the laptop here now.

1199
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:19,540
Memphis Field Office,

1200
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:21,620
I'll have a room set up with someone ready to go.

1201
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:24,620
The issue is I cannot get a team there

1202
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:27,820
for at least six to eight hours.

1203
00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:29,140
It has to come from DC.

1204
00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:30,700
We can't get those resources here.

1205
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:34,180
Well, Grover'sville is at the butt end of the locale,

1206
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:37,260
so I don't think anyone will show up for six to eight hours.

1207
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:38,180
Look, it's fine.

1208
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:39,860
You guys just get out of there.

1209
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:42,140
Hopefully the rest of you are fine,

1210
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:45,020
but just give me that laptop now.

1211
00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:48,460
No one is going to be there for at least six hours.

1212
00:51:48,460 --> 00:51:52,020
So just get out in case someone else gets there first.

1213
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:54,420
There's no one left in Grover'sville.

1214
00:51:55,340 --> 00:51:58,700
So I think the dead will be fine

1215
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:00,300
for the next six or eight hours.

1216
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:05,140
Joe like punches the fucking gas and-

1217
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:06,860
Are you speeding down the highway

1218
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:10,380
in a Crown Vic or a Ford Bronco?

1219
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:12,300
Thankfully, the Crown Vic,

1220
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:15,380
if you could let local authorities know to not pull us over,

1221
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:16,580
we will be speeding.

1222
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:19,900
And Tan is still sitting in the back of the Bronco

1223
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:22,860
that is just sitting in front of City Hall.

1224
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:25,540
Cause no one got me.

1225
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:28,860
Is his dead body in the back of the Bronco too?

1226
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:31,260
We took his dead body, but not your live one.

1227
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:35,860
Cindy was yelling shut the fuck up

1228
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:38,220
to no one in particular in the back seat.

1229
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:42,220
Shut up.

1230
00:52:42,220 --> 00:52:44,900
Okay, we're only like a minute outside of town.

1231
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:47,180
So we got to go get that fucking piece of shit.

1232
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:48,220
We saved him once.

1233
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:50,460
Turn around.

1234
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:51,300
I spared his life.

1235
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:54,260
So now I like owe him my air, whatever, how that works.

1236
00:52:54,260 --> 00:52:55,080
You know-

1237
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:55,920
Jar Jar Binks clause, I know.

1238
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:56,740
Yeah, exactly.

1239
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:58,220
It's a Jar Jar situation.

1240
00:52:58,220 --> 00:53:00,220
Who was a guy we know.

1241
00:53:00,220 --> 00:53:03,460
Also, I've given you no reason to dislike me.

1242
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:04,860
Yeah.

1243
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:06,180
We don't dislike you.

1244
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:08,140
It's just the mission.

1245
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:09,260
They called for it.

1246
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:12,740
You're lying in extreme pain in the back of this Bronco,

1247
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:16,180
just like looking at the felt on the roof of it.

1248
00:53:16,180 --> 00:53:17,580
Well, I was trying to get out,

1249
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:20,740
but the child blocks are on, so I'm like stuck in there.

1250
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:26,320
Yeah, you hear the Crown Vic like crunch back up

1251
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:27,160
and roll to a stop.

1252
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:28,260
As soon as I hear that,

1253
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:30,340
like all my energy has been expended

1254
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:31,420
trying to get out of here,

1255
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:35,320
but I hear you guys coming back and I just pass out.

1256
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:36,740
Cindy grabs him by the shoulders,

1257
00:53:36,740 --> 00:53:39,060
throws him into the back of the Crown Vic

1258
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:43,300
and we bust it to the Memphis field office.

1259
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:45,380
So that's Cindy in the front seat then

1260
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:47,660
and Jodine sitting shotgun.

1261
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:48,480
Yeah.

1262
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:50,580
And then a passed out tan in the back

1263
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:53,580
and then a dead Harlan in the trunk.

1264
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:54,500
That is correct.

1265
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:56,540
That's how all the green ops end.

1266
00:53:58,220 --> 00:54:00,980
As you get two miles outside of town

1267
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:03,780
and you're heading Southwest towards Memphis,

1268
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:06,980
lying low in the opposite direction towards town

1269
00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:10,540
are three Blackhawk helicopters.

1270
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:11,840
Fuck yeah.

1271
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:13,160
Broken Arrow boys.

1272
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:17,100
Heading the other way towards town

1273
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:19,940
as you drive towards Memphis and scene.

1274
00:54:19,940 --> 00:54:23,000
That's scene as far as you know it.

1275
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,500
Ooh, hit us with the next scene.

1276
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:27,660
Well, no, I mean, there's not really much of the next scene.

1277
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:28,760
It's kind of how much.

1278
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:32,380
What's the scene we don't know, David?

1279
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:33,500
Tell us secrets.

1280
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:35,780
Well, was that weird at all at the end?

1281
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:37,800
Dude, that was fucking rad.

1282
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:39,540
What doesn't add up at this point?

1283
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:40,720
And what do you want to know?

1284
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,420
Who called in that Blackhawk?

1285
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:44,620
What organization had the helicopters flying around?

1286
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:45,740
Yeah, what was that?

1287
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:48,340
So you get that computer back to HQ

1288
00:54:48,340 --> 00:54:51,260
and as long as it stays in Delta Green's hands

1289
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:53,100
and they correctly look at it,

1290
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:57,940
it was a communication device between the aldermen in town

1291
00:54:57,940 --> 00:55:02,940
and some other civilians, Majestic 12 and the Grays.

1292
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:04,080
Wow.

1293
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:05,520
Wow.

1294
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:07,720
It was the aliens the whole time

1295
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:10,680
abducting these citizens to form the experiments.

1296
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,440
And the government was just letting them do it.

1297
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:18,140
Yeah, there was an entire portion of this

1298
00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:20,200
where you could have actually confronted the aliens

1299
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:21,960
and fought the aliens themselves.

1300
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:26,100
I tried to ask the aldermen to behave themselves.

1301
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:28,880
They were not interested in discourse.

1302
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:30,320
Where would that have taken place?

1303
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:33,060
A small farm about three miles outside of town.

1304
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:34,740
Where you shot Jane Allen.

1305
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:40,060
That was converted into basically an experimentation area

1306
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:41,100
where all these people were,

1307
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:42,780
where they stored all the gray goo

1308
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:45,500
and they were just injecting this gray goo into people,

1309
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:47,420
more or less replacing people's organs.

1310
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:49,180
So that's what happened to Billy Ray.

1311
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:52,300
They replaced all of his musculature with this goo.

1312
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:56,340
Joe had his digestive organs replaced last night

1313
00:55:56,340 --> 00:55:57,580
while he was sleeping.

1314
00:55:57,580 --> 00:55:58,780
Jesus.

1315
00:55:58,780 --> 00:56:00,380
That was fun.

1316
00:56:00,380 --> 00:56:02,780
Because it was just him in a room.

1317
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:05,640
You guys didn't double up or anything else.

1318
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:07,620
They were able to just slip in, grab him,

1319
00:56:07,620 --> 00:56:09,740
return him afterwards.

1320
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:12,700
So that's why he died that horrible death at the end.

1321
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:15,980
Everyone else in town had some level of experimentation

1322
00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:17,900
or they just lived in town long enough

1323
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:20,920
that they had ingested enough of this material

1324
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:23,500
that it was just all in their bloodstream and everywhere.

1325
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:25,640
Even if they didn't replace a particular organ,

1326
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:26,940
it was all inside of them.

1327
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:28,020
To make matters worse,

1328
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:30,220
once you have that much of it inside of you,

1329
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:31,900
so none of you except maybe Joe,

1330
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:33,680
but maybe still not even Joe,

1331
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:35,780
the aliens can see through your eyes,

1332
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:37,400
the aliens can control you,

1333
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:39,500
and they use it mostly for security.

1334
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:40,980
And they know who your crush is.

1335
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:41,980
Don't tell.

1336
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:45,340
They use it for security.

1337
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:47,060
So they're often controlling the sheriff,

1338
00:56:47,060 --> 00:56:50,660
but they'll use other kind of senior people and stuff.

1339
00:56:50,660 --> 00:56:52,380
That's why everyone was being so weird

1340
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:54,980
about people not being missing.

1341
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:56,860
Yeah, I was gonna ask,

1342
00:56:56,860 --> 00:56:58,460
the people that we talked to,

1343
00:56:58,460 --> 00:57:00,140
were they just like lying to us

1344
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:01,860
and they knew about the alien stuff

1345
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:03,020
or did they not have any clue?

1346
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:04,820
There's just too much of it in them already?

1347
00:57:04,820 --> 00:57:06,740
It makes them like docile basically.

1348
00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:08,460
There's a sidebar in it

1349
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:10,220
and it's called work, work, work, work.

1350
00:57:10,220 --> 00:57:13,420
And basically everyone can just in their brain

1351
00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:15,540
reason as to why people aren't around

1352
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:16,460
and it's totally fine.

1353
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:17,300
Like the mom is just like,

1354
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:19,020
yeah, my daughter, like she's cool.

1355
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:20,260
What, like why should I be worried?

1356
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:21,100
Yeah, that was really sad.

1357
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:22,140
Or my husband's like, I'm a cool mom.

1358
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:23,100
She's a cool kid.

1359
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:27,380
But yeah, that's one of the questions, I guess.

1360
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:30,520
What is the most popular menu item at Mega Deuce?

1361
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:33,980
Well, they have a couple of different things actually.

1362
00:57:33,980 --> 00:57:35,980
And it's kind of a tier based system.

1363
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:37,920
There's the Single Deuce,

1364
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:42,920
which is a single cheeseburger and a small shake.

1365
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:44,660
The Double Deuce,

1366
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:47,660
which is a double cheeseburger with a medium shake.

1367
00:57:47,660 --> 00:57:49,680
And then the Mega Deuce,

1368
00:57:50,820 --> 00:57:53,940
which is eight patties.

1369
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:55,460
Yeah, it's like eight patties,

1370
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:56,980
extra large milkshake.

1371
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:59,060
And the slogan is, it's so good,

1372
00:57:59,060 --> 00:58:01,220
it'll make you take a Mega Deuce.

1373
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:02,060
Wow.

1374
00:58:02,060 --> 00:58:03,380
That is, it's a good slogan.

1375
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:05,420
David, you got me hungry.

1376
00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:06,260
It's catchy.

1377
00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:08,620
It's so much food, you'll shit a lot.

1378
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:14,980
And Merle, how is he the one who is in charge of it all?

1379
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:18,020
He really wasn't.

1380
00:58:18,020 --> 00:58:19,020
He was not.

1381
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:22,380
He was just an alderman, but all the alderman.

1382
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:25,740
He was just an alderman, but all the alderman.

1383
00:58:25,740 --> 00:58:26,700
Yeah, Alan Alda.

1384
00:58:27,260 --> 00:58:29,620
He was played by Alan Alda, actually.

1385
00:58:29,620 --> 00:58:31,380
We noticed that, yeah, but we did notice

1386
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:34,260
that it was all the alderman, we're all the men.

1387
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:36,780
And so we smashed the patriarchy tonight, boys.

1388
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:39,260
That's what we did, congratulations.

1389
00:58:39,260 --> 00:58:40,660
And killed everyone else down there.

1390
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:42,580
Don't break the glass ceiling

1391
00:58:42,580 --> 00:58:45,540
or David's dump is gonna pile all over us.

1392
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:50,540
Was, I assume, was Jane Allen pregnant with an alien baby?

1393
00:58:51,340 --> 00:58:53,420
Nope, that was just a normal pregnant teenager

1394
00:58:53,420 --> 00:58:54,240
that you murder.

1395
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:56,100
She would have died either way.

1396
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:58,020
They abducted Jane Allen.

1397
00:58:58,020 --> 00:59:00,540
You didn't really go around spraying the purple stuff

1398
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:02,320
on her or on Joe, for that matter.

1399
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:03,460
You probably would have realized

1400
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:06,060
Joe was actually completely screwed

1401
00:59:06,060 --> 00:59:10,620
had you sprayed it like a little more fully all over him.

1402
00:59:10,620 --> 00:59:13,520
Yeah, stripped down and started like spraying your bodies.

1403
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:15,300
You would have seen the same incision marks

1404
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:17,220
kind of on Billy Ray's arms.

1405
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:20,220
Oh shit, the one person whose arms we didn't look at.

1406
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:25,200
She was just recently pregnant with Billy Ray

1407
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:28,160
about a week before he went on his crime spree.

1408
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:30,240
She didn't even know, she was abducted.

1409
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:34,160
They took out her uterus with the baby,

1410
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:37,320
gave her this, it's called proto-matter, the goo,

1411
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:39,600
then put something, you don't know.

1412
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:42,280
So it's every single person in Grover'sville

1413
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:44,880
like coughed and died slowly?

1414
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:45,720
Yeah.

1415
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:48,000
Can you choose like one child out of the town

1416
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,820
and describe that in detail for us?

1417
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:53,660
Well, I can tell you about,

1418
00:59:53,660 --> 00:59:55,380
so a lot of people had experiments, right?

1419
00:59:55,380 --> 00:59:58,820
So the little kids that you met at the reservoir

1420
00:59:58,820 --> 01:00:02,580
that were pounding seven and a half pieces a piece,

1421
01:00:02,580 --> 01:00:04,740
they had work done on their livers.

1422
01:00:04,740 --> 01:00:06,020
They had super livers.

1423
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:07,420
Oh wow.

1424
01:00:07,420 --> 01:00:09,820
As these aliens know how to party.

1425
01:00:12,380 --> 01:00:15,020
David, thank you so much for running this game for us.

1426
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:17,500
This was such a blast and thank you for sticking around

1427
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:19,100
for this extended episode.

1428
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:21,420
All five weeks, yeah, we really appreciate it, man.

1429
01:00:21,420 --> 01:00:23,020
We're gonna open the cage now.

1430
01:00:23,740 --> 01:00:26,140
I wanted to get it to some sort of a conclusion

1431
01:00:26,140 --> 01:00:29,300
because we could have just thoroughly harassed

1432
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:30,860
citizens for presumably.

1433
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:31,700
So many more.

1434
01:00:31,700 --> 01:00:33,180
If we didn't even touch the bowling alley,

1435
01:00:33,180 --> 01:00:34,020
we could have like.

1436
01:00:35,380 --> 01:00:36,880
Have you ever run this before?

1437
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:37,720
No, not at all.

1438
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:40,320
I prepped this exclusively for this,

1439
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:43,500
largely because Zach gave me very few options

1440
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:46,140
as far as things he has not looked at before.

1441
01:00:46,140 --> 01:00:46,960
That's my way.

1442
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:47,800
I liked it.

1443
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:49,480
I mean, this is a shorter scenario.

1444
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:51,220
It's only like a dozen pages.

1445
01:00:51,220 --> 01:00:53,020
It's something you could hypothetically do

1446
01:00:53,020 --> 01:00:57,580
with efficient players who stay on track for things.

1447
01:00:59,060 --> 01:01:01,860
In under four hours at a con.

1448
01:01:01,860 --> 01:01:04,740
David, those are, that's just an urban legend.

1449
01:01:05,740 --> 01:01:07,340
Oh, those players don't exist.

1450
01:01:07,340 --> 01:01:09,740
I think they just play different games, maybe.

1451
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:13,940
But no, thank you very much for having me.

1452
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:16,260
This was a fun crossover event.

1453
01:01:16,260 --> 01:01:17,900
Like I said, I love you guys' stuff.

1454
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:20,040
Yeah, the pleasure was all ours, completely.

1455
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:21,480
Thank you for all of this.

1456
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:23,160
Thanks for everyone, I guess, who listened

1457
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:25,920
and put up with me for the last five episodes.

1458
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:27,200
Blessed with your presence.

1459
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:28,820
Those people who know me from elsewhere,

1460
01:01:28,820 --> 01:01:30,000
who followed along,

1461
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,580
hopefully I haven't totally ruined

1462
01:01:31,580 --> 01:01:33,400
Delta Green for you either.

1463
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:35,600
That would be on us, so you're in the clear.

1464
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:38,600
But if you like that nonsense,

1465
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:41,980
go to episode one of Pretending to be People

1466
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:45,780
and go ahead and start down that long path.

1467
01:01:45,780 --> 01:01:47,600
You've got plenty to catch up on.

1468
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:49,760
You can see where they cut their teeth

1469
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:52,480
by harassing random civilians.

1470
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:55,520
Yep, it's kind of our trademark.

1471
01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:00,160
Just authority figures abusing that power

1472
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:01,920
for petty reasons and little gain.

1473
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:04,720
It's an all lawful evil campaign.

1474
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:10,280
Okay, well, David, we're gonna open the cage now.

1475
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:12,360
Yeah, you are free to go.

1476
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:14,000
Creak!

1477
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,160
Oh, wow, he really took off.

1478
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:16,000
He's scampering.

1479
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:16,820
He's scampering.

1480
01:02:16,820 --> 01:02:17,660
Oh, wow.

1481
01:02:17,660 --> 01:02:19,500
When I make a scamper, that's what I think of.

1482
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:20,940
There's a little dust trail.

1483
01:02:20,940 --> 01:02:22,780
His calves are good.

1484
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:24,100
He did not want to be here.

1485
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:51,020
I can't get high.

1486
01:02:51,020 --> 01:02:53,440
I can't get high.

1487
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:57,700
I thought this stuff helped anxiety.

1488
01:02:57,700 --> 01:03:01,140
It must be something inside of me.

1489
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:03,140
Does anybody know why?

1490
01:03:03,140 --> 01:03:05,100
I don't know why.

1491
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:07,100
I can't get high.

1492
01:03:07,100 --> 01:03:10,580
I can't get high.

1493
01:03:10,580 --> 01:03:17,580
I can't see through, I can't, and I don't wanna try.

1494
01:03:18,580 --> 01:03:23,580
Please, my smile, won't you spare me something?

1495
01:03:23,580 --> 01:03:27,580
Where can you buy it?

1496
01:03:27,580 --> 01:03:36,580
Where do you begin when you don't know how?

1497
01:03:36,580 --> 01:03:45,580
Hallucinations held big time by spiders out the line.

1498
01:03:45,580 --> 01:03:53,580
Breathing in, breathing out.

1499
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:57,580
I've been hiding in low, low places

1500
01:03:57,580 --> 01:04:01,580
with some funny looking dudes with some fucked up faces.

1501
01:04:01,580 --> 01:04:06,580
And I can't help the feeling I'll always be at the bottom.

1502
01:04:15,580 --> 01:04:31,580
I think I'm allergic or something.

1503
01:04:31,580 --> 01:04:38,580
Better go on with nothing so I won't get high.

1504
01:04:38,580 --> 01:04:44,580
No, I won't get high.

1505
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:48,580
By all means, do it if it helps.

1506
01:04:48,580 --> 01:04:52,580
For me, it makes my brain melt easy.

1507
01:04:52,580 --> 01:04:55,580
Does anybody know why?

1508
01:04:55,580 --> 01:05:01,580
I can't get high.

1509
01:05:01,580 --> 01:05:09,580
I can't see through, I can't, and I don't wanna try.

1510
01:05:09,580 --> 01:05:13,580
Please, my smile, won't you spare me something?

1511
01:05:13,580 --> 01:05:18,580
Where can you buy it?

1512
01:05:18,580 --> 01:05:27,580
Where do you begin when you don't know how?

1513
01:05:27,580 --> 01:05:36,580
Hallucinations held big time by spiders out the line.

1514
01:05:36,580 --> 01:05:44,580
Breathing in, breathing out.

1515
01:05:44,580 --> 01:05:48,580
I've been hiding in low, low places

1516
01:05:48,580 --> 01:05:53,580
with some funny looking dudes with some fucked up faces.

1517
01:05:53,580 --> 01:05:58,580
And I can't help the feeling I'll always be at the bottom.

1518
01:06:06,580 --> 01:06:08,580
Thank you for watching.
