1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,420
Greetings my disciples, it is your leader in prayer and song, Wolf the Dog, and I am

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:11,540
here to preach the good word about all the happenings in this silly thing we call life.

3
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:17,760
I'm also here to tell y'all about how to attain true salvation and get y'all into dumps to

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,760
meet heaven.

5
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,240
The one true secret to life and happiness is...

6
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,920
Oh wait, before that we got a show to run here y'all, apologies.

7
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:31,300
This week's Howlin' with Wolf comes from Doug Blake, who recommended pretending to be people

8
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,300
on Facebook.

9
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:39,900
I mean, this week's Howlin' with Wolf is an Ari Manstein event review by ZomBenny2099.

10
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:44,680
The location for this event could not have been better, set among the classically themed

11
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:48,640
mausoleum littered venue that is the city cemetery.

12
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:54,260
The Samba Stone family plots lent a sense of reverence that most crawfish boils sadly

13
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:56,100
lack these days.

14
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:01,400
Upon my arrival I was instantly hit with sweet and savory smells that reaffirmed my hopes

15
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,960
that this would be a boil to remember.

16
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,220
But alas, the only thing I will remember is my disappointment.

17
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:14,320
First and foremost the service was terrible, there weren't even any eating utensils provided.

18
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:20,080
I actually witnessed a hip, well dressed young man, obviously from the city, resort to eatin'

19
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,660
straight from the pot as no one came to serve him.

20
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:27,440
Needless to say, I never actually got to taste any crawfish.

21
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:31,800
Equally as disappointing, the music was nonsensical.

22
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:37,000
I'm as down with new age music as the next city dweller, but this was just weird gibberish

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,560
that seemed to last forever and yet was over as soon as it began.

24
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:46,580
I was not alone in thinking this as several frustrated diners shot the DJ.

25
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:51,880
It was around this time that I took my leave, disappointed and hungry.

26
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:57,740
Still, all things considered, not the worst crawfish boil I've been to, two and a half

27
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,820
stars out of five.

28
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:04,980
You know, Wolf ain't never been to a crawfish boil that didn't have some kinda crazy shit

29
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,420
go down.

30
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:11,740
But all that crazy shit always leads to a massive reward at the end of the night when

31
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:18,820
they dump out all them shells into the trash, a treasure trove of candy red exoskeletons

32
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:25,040
discarded by the masses, all so your old little old wolf can take a Scrooge McDuck

33
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:31,280
dive into them, swimmin' around gettin' my fill with my mouth wide open.

34
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,620
That is the kinda spicy bug I like to eat.

35
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:40,480
So anyway, you need to remember, if you wanna write up somethin' for your wolf to how, tag

36
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,100
at PretendingPod on Instagram or Twitter, tag PretendingToBePeople on Facebook, or write

37
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:51,160
a five-star review and email us at PretendingPod at Gmail.com.

38
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:57,960
You are due to get bruised and lose your shoes if you choose to snooze on the news, baby.

39
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:01,840
Keith Vigna was shoved into a secret room in Jim Cook's house.

40
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:07,400
Clark Bishop found a well-worn VHS tape of his parents playing Wheel of Fortune and winning

41
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,080
a honeymoon.

42
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:14,400
John Lee Pettymore found an envelope with a letter from Jim Cook alongside three folders

43
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,700
outlining three different operations.

44
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:23,640
The group recovered at a walk-in clinic before toolin' up and enterin' Marvin Glass's playground

45
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,940
through a trap door like great in an alleyway.

46
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:33,940
Speaking of playgrounds, I hear those PretendingToBePeople boys are gonna be playin' around and loitering

47
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,820
on Twitch this Friday.

48
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:43,060
They can be found at twitch.tv slash pretendingpodstreams.

49
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:47,240
I hear one of those boys might sound a lot like me.

50
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,000
Yeah, right, that'd be crazy, y'all.

51
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,320
Aw, hell yeah, the thought of those boys streamin' has Wolf's face beamin'.

52
00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:01,200
But until then, I'll keep dreamin' and dreamin' of incessant screamin'.

53
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:07,280
It's Kudzu with no backbone.

54
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:40,800
Let it pop, pop, pop, pop, in your butthole pop.

55
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,840
Put all the poppers in your butthole now.

56
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,620
Put them up there and lick them real good.

57
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,620
Let me get that popper.

58
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,440
Make it a spicy butthole.

59
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,600
Spicy butthole in my pants.

60
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,480
Spicy butthole does my dance.

61
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,920
I like dancing with my butt.

62
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,080
You will like me when I strut.

63
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,080
Strut.

64
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,080
Oh!

65
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,080
Luke, what'd you do for your birthday?

66
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:06,640
I literally woke up, sat on my couch, smoked weed all day, and watched Twitch.

67
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,640
Nice.

68
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,020
What'd you watch on Twitch?

69
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:17,700
I watched, well, at 8 p.m. is when Lord Caboon plays Grand Theft Auto roleplay.

70
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:21,500
So I watched that from about 8 p.m. until 3 in the morning.

71
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,500
That's Mr. Chang.

72
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,580
That's Mr. Chang.

73
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:24,580
He's my favorite.

74
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:28,740
The voice is a fun character.

75
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:35,300
Anyway, he's also, I think, the most watched Grand Theft Auto roleplayer on Twitch.

76
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,300
He's a lot of fun.

77
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,780
Anyway, I did that, and I also watched.

78
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:38,780
It is a lot of fun.

79
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,940
I watched a movie called About Time.

80
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:46,060
Oh yeah, with Donal Gleason.

81
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,060
Is that his name?

82
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,060
That's Brendan Gleason's son.

83
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,060
No way.

84
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,060
Yeah, Matt I. Moody's son.

85
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,060
Which I didn't know for a long time.

86
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:54,500
Oh yeah, because he's also in a couple, or maybe one Black Mirror episode.

87
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,500
The fucking fairytale.

88
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,500
Yeah.

89
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:00,260
But no, it was an enjoyable movie, cheesy at times, but I also love Rachel McAdams.

90
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,260
Oh yeah.

91
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:04,380
And I forgot, well, didn't forget, but Margot Robbie was in it as well.

92
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,500
Oh, I didn't remember that.

93
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,260
Isn't Bill Nye the dad in that?

94
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,260
Is that how you say his name?

95
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:09,740
Wait.

96
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,740
I think it's Nye.

97
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:11,740
Nye.

98
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:12,740
Oh, I thought you said Bill Nye.

99
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:13,740
I'm like, no.

100
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:14,740
Bill Nye, the British guy.

101
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:15,740
Yeah, no.

102
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:16,740
I very much enjoyed it.

103
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:17,740
Bill Nye.

104
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:18,740
And before I watched About Time, I watched.

105
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,740
Peach, Bill Nye.

106
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:27,700
I watched some Chef's Table, and I watched a guy play this survival game, I don't remember,

107
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,820
something dark.

108
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:29,940
Long Winter or something like that?

109
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,380
The Long Dark is what it was called.

110
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,380
The Long Dark.

111
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,380
Nice.

112
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:36,180
But yeah, I ordered Postmates slash Uber Eats twice.

113
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,180
Oh wow.

114
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,180
Yeah.

115
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,100
Fucking birthday baby.

116
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,100
Yeah, you really hit it up.

117
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,300
And I was thinking about going to Cherry Picker later in the night, and I was like, you know

118
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,300
what?

119
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,300
Fuck it.

120
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,300
I'm literally not going to change out of my pajamas.

121
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,780
I had a great time.

122
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:49,780
Hell yeah.

123
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:50,780
Well, heck yeah.

124
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:51,780
And you can finally vote.

125
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:52,780
I can finally vote now.

126
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:55,780
Yeah, listeners, Luke is legal.

127
00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:00,780
You can vote at 16 in Missouri.

128
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:01,780
Yeah.

129
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:07,900
We've been trotting out this jail bait for you, but Lukey boys are all grown up.

130
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:12,860
When I was younger, I leaned very much to the left, but you know, my parents, a lot

131
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:16,580
of older people say like, once you get older, you'll be more conservative.

132
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:21,460
And yesterday I woke up and I was like, damn, I kind of want to vote for Donald Trump today.

133
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:23,500
Oh my God.

134
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,380
Well that's legitimately horrifying.

135
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,380
Happy birthday.

136
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,380
Yeah, thank you very much.

137
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,980
No, that'll never happen.

138
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:31,120
Listeners, I'm kidding.

139
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,120
Happy birthday.

140
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,460
Unless you like Donald Trump, then give us more of your money.

141
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:36,460
Yeah.

142
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,460
Pledge to us, not him.

143
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:43,740
So, uh, Joe, when Joe got into the home today, he opened up the fridge to grab one of the

144
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:44,800
beers that he brought.

145
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,380
And then he just started giggling like a madman.

146
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,380
I bought myself some long neck Coronas.

147
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:54,100
It turns out they weren't all long.

148
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:59,260
I had somehow bought the seven ounce Corona bottles that for some reason look like long

149
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:04,780
necks coming out of the top of the six pack, but they just got little stubby bottle bottoms.

150
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,580
Why did they make those?

151
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,580
For the light drinker?

152
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:08,580
I guess.

153
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,580
I don't know.

154
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,580
Well, wow.

155
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:11,580
It's for kids.

156
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:14,620
Well, I mean, what is the drinking age in Mexico?

157
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,620
21.

158
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:20,460
No, it's, I drank when I was like 14 there.

159
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,460
That's so cool.

160
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,460
Like two years ago.

161
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,460
Yeah.

162
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:27,660
I went to the swim up bar and I was like, I like, whatever that drink is, it looks good.

163
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:30,020
And it was like a, like a mudslide or a white Russian or something.

164
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:32,420
And I drink and I was like, tastes good, but kind of bad.

165
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:34,540
And then my dad was like, what the fuck are you like?

166
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:39,420
I didn't do it on purpose, but she didn't get a boner in the pool and that's why you

167
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:40,420
don't like big mouth.

168
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,420
All right.

169
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,900
So I forgot about that.

170
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:47,980
I mean, I don't hate it, but I mean, I've only, I've only seen like, all right, so let's

171
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:51,180
get into this episode 39.

172
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,180
That's a big number.

173
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:56,620
We're almost to a, almost a 30, 30 more to go.

174
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:00,940
We're almost at, if you listen to us, you could have worked an entire work week, but

175
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:04,780
instead you enjoyed it with us.

176
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,460
So let's kick it off the bat.

177
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:12,460
You guys were, I believe, falling through the, the grate in front of the dirty dog grooming.

178
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,460
Is that correct?

179
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:19,020
The giant building downtown that, you know, is the glass compound or some cool flowers

180
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,020
around.

181
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,020
Absolutely.

182
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:24,900
Maybe the last time you'll ever see flowers, you know, as you guys are falling, let's go

183
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:25,900
ahead.

184
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:30,660
And as you head into the den of sin, as you've been calling it, let's do it.

185
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:31,660
You called it that.

186
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:32,660
Yeah.

187
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:33,660
I certainly did.

188
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:38,980
As you guys have been calling it, we called it that because you learned it from watching

189
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:41,520
you.

190
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,980
And as you guys are falling, let's, let's do an equipment check.

191
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,700
Let's see what you guys have on you.

192
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,540
Who wants to start last episode?

193
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:50,100
I just bought, or I bought three pistols altogether.

194
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,700
I've got two in the waistband and one in my boot.

195
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:58,720
And then a John Lee Pettymore bought us all a couple of flash grenades, a couple of regular

196
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,480
grenades and a couple of smoke grenades.

197
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,480
Cool.

198
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:05,880
And you're also wearing an old school contention, police officers uniform.

199
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,880
Correct.

200
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,880
Anything else on you?

201
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,880
I might have one more pistol.

202
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,280
I guess I would still have the one that Maggie gave me to take out, you can have four on

203
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,280
you if you want.

204
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,280
It's a lot of pistols.

205
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,280
Yeah, sure.

206
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,280
All right.

207
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:20,640
Tell me if it's too meta, but I have giant pockets in my giant shorts.

208
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,640
I don't know.

209
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:24,760
Maybe I should be carrying your guns at first now.

210
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,760
That's fine.

211
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,760
I hate it.

212
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,040
If I would've thought about it last episode, I would have said it.

213
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,320
He throws it to you while you're falling midair.

214
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,320
Okay.

215
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,280
So what do you have on you Luke?

216
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:40,560
I have my small but powerful pistol, two frag grenades, two flash grenades, two smoke grenades.

217
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:46,000
And then on my back I have the giant fully auto machine gun.

218
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,240
Two ARs welded together.

219
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,240
Basically.

220
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,240
Cold fusion gun.

221
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,680
It's like a double neck guitar, but a gun.

222
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,800
That's fucking awesome.

223
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,800
What a great description.

224
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,800
It's balling.

225
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:02,320
And then, well, I'll ask this later.

226
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,320
And Thomas, what do you have on you?

227
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,840
What does John Lee, Kevin Pettimore have on you?

228
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:09,500
He's got his robot body.

229
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,760
He's got body armor on top of that.

230
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,740
All the grenades, same as the others.

231
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:19,760
He's got a powerful pistol with a large magazine and a semi-automatic shotgun.

232
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,760
Absolutely.

233
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,080
Armed to the veritable teeth.

234
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,360
To the veritable teeth indeed, my good sir.

235
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,720
Joe and I were talking.

236
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,240
I think maybe we should say what our health points are before we start, just so the listener

237
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,240
knows.

238
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,240
I think that's really smart.

239
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,840
Let's get a rundown of your health and your sanity.

240
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,320
I am currently at 16 hit points.

241
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:43,280
I had a maximum of 26 and my current sanity is at 18 with a breaking point at six.

242
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:51,400
I have 25 out of 25 hit points and my sanity is at 11 with a breaking point of eight.

243
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,400
All right.

244
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:56,960
That's 19 of 20 hit points and my sanity is at 18.

245
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,960
Good.

246
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,960
Pretty good sanity.

247
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,960
Yeah.

248
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,960
All right.

249
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,680
Does anyone have any final words?

250
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,800
We're here to eat ass and kill bubblegum and we're all out of bubblegum.

251
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,640
You know how that trap door opened at the last episode?

252
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,160
Clark clings to the edge, pulls himself up and leaves.

253
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:20,400
He just goes back to his house, watches Wheel of Fortune until he dies, until the end of

254
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,400
the world.

255
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:29,320
It starts out with all of us going, three Wilhelm screams.

256
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:38,200
Also while we were spot on, I forgot to add while we were at a, unbeknownst to pretty

257
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:44,260
much anybody at the gun shop, I had filled some of one of the cargo pants.

258
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:48,740
I went over to the bait shop of the, of the gun store and filled one of my pockets up

259
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,620
with a catfish food.

260
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,900
Oh, very small.

261
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:53,900
Why catfish?

262
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,100
Have you ever seen catfish food?

263
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,340
It's like real mushy and super stinky.

264
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,980
Is that what you cover your arm with?

265
00:12:58,980 --> 00:12:59,980
Yeah.

266
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,860
Have you ever gone noodling?

267
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:05,560
I think I might have told this story once, but I went with my dad or my uncle.

268
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,940
We went gigging and noodling one day.

269
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:09,940
Giggings fun.

270
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:11,260
You get to eat some frog legs.

271
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:16,060
Noodling sucks because a catfish bites your fucking arm and that's how you catch it.

272
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:18,460
So yeah, that sounds like garbage.

273
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:20,420
Yeah, I'll definitely allow that.

274
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:21,740
You're supposed to use your dick.

275
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,420
Oh, mine's not big enough.

276
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:24,420
It's recreation.

277
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,420
Boom.

278
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:30,820
I can only fold it in half once.

279
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:31,820
Call back.

280
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:34,180
Eight times if you really tried.

281
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,820
Uh, anyway, yeah, so I do have that.

282
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:42,680
As you fall downward into darkness, you almost immediately feel your body's slow and begin

283
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:48,420
to float gently like you're just hanging weightless in vast nothingness.

284
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:54,240
And then abruptly a bright light covers your entire field of vision and huge words appear

285
00:13:54,240 --> 00:14:00,520
in front of you in a spray painted font as a rumbling voice reads the massive tag that

286
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:05,520
says, welcome to the scrap it.

287
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:10,840
What you can only assume is the biggest Omnimax screen of all time fades to black and a video

288
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,480
begins to play.

289
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,880
It looks to be the inside of an enormous arena made of glass.

290
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:22,880
In the background, hundreds of screaming spectators in the foreground, a hole begins to form in

291
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,080
the floor and a shadowy form begins to emerge.

292
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:32,160
But before this person can even hit the lights of the arena, a giant metal tentacle erupts

293
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,620
into view, gripping the humanoid being and ripping it out of frame.

294
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:41,860
The screen fades to black and you feel your feet touch the ground, your weight coming

295
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:45,540
back down into your bodies.

296
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:52,520
You all are standing in a cube of a room 20 feet across, made almost entirely of the oily

297
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:56,000
obsidian you have previously seen in this building.

298
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,940
It is disorienting.

299
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:04,420
Across the room is a mouth of a concrete cave with the logo for the scrap pit spray painted

300
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,060
above its entrance.

301
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:12,160
To your left are two guards standing in front of a red, deep buttoned plush door.

302
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,500
The guards are in full brown jumpsuits.

303
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,720
They each have a large scythe strapped to their backs and the blade of each scythe is

304
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,760
shaped like an enormous fish hook.

305
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:24,640
A closer look reveals these men have unnatural matching faces.

306
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:28,360
Their eyes are far apart, almost on either side of their face.

307
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:33,560
Their noses do not jut out but are rather two slits above their two wide thick lipped

308
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:37,480
mouths and they have a few flaps on either side of their necks.

309
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:43,980
They turn and upon seeing you, press a button that lights up green and they move out of

310
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:47,700
the way to either side of the gaudy door.

311
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:48,700
What do you do?

312
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,780
Noodle them, Keith.

313
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:59,780
I think we just go, I think, I think, uh, I think we just go right through that door.

314
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:14,040
We do a little noodle and nod over at them and then we go right past.

315
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,280
Clark wants to look up.

316
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:19,600
Can I see where we came from or is it, is it a closed space that we fell from?

317
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,280
It is just darkness above you.

318
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,660
What do we see through the doors?

319
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:30,200
Through the doors is a, another smaller room made completely out of the same oily black

320
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,200
material.

321
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,280
I just feel like we're going to walk into another Marvin Glass stadium.

322
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:37,340
I mean, I don't really have any other options at this point.

323
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:41,200
I think we go through the gaudy doors and I mean they hit the green button.

324
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,820
Gotta be better than a hypothetical red button.

325
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:46,000
Can I see what you guys are picturing?

326
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,680
How are you arranged right now?

327
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,600
Are you two backing him already?

328
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,340
Do you have, he's in the middle and we're escorting them and I on either side.

329
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:59,760
He's got a gun wound that we literally gave him and I think we're just maybe have your

330
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,780
hands behind your back, but not like cuffed or anything.

331
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:07,600
And we're like, and we glued dog fur all over him, so he looks real Chewbacca.

332
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:12,120
But I think we just, we look like he's our prisoner and we're walking him.

333
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:15,480
I'll keep maybe a sullen head down kind of look on me the whole time.

334
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,480
I like you best when you look like that.

335
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:23,120
All right, so you guys march him into the, I might emphasize my limp even like look real

336
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,940
wounded and I'm non-threatening, but they've got me handily.

337
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:31,660
These total fish men absolutely pay attention to your hobble.

338
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:38,340
You guys march Clark Bishop into this room and the room's interior walls, floor and ceiling

339
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:44,220
are the same beautiful like onyx obsidian reflector and the door closes behind you.

340
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:47,900
There's nothing, just the shimmering black mirror on all six sides.

341
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,700
And then you feel the room begin to move.

342
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:54,760
Who has the lowest luck?

343
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,760
I have 35.

344
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,760
I got 60.

345
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,760
I've got 20.

346
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,760
All righty.

347
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,680
Thomas, go ahead and roll luck for me.

348
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,680
All right.

349
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,600
I'm going to use these dice that Joe got me for the first time.

350
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,600
Nice.

351
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,600
Hope they serve you well.

352
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,600
I'm going to open mine up too.

353
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,600
Oh, okay.

354
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,600
93.

355
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,600
All right.

356
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,600
That's my fault.

357
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,600
I'm so sorry.

358
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,600
Son of a bitch.

359
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,600
I loaded you up.

360
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,600
I'm so sorry.

361
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,600
That's my fault.

362
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,600
I'm so sorry.

363
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,600
Son of a bitch.

364
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,820
I loaded your guys' dice.

365
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,820
I'm the only one getting out of here alive.

366
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,820
I'm going to win.

367
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:32,100
I'm not going to win.

368
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:35,100
It's a me, Joe-io.

369
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:39,260
Wildy Joe.

370
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:47,760
One of the walls opens, and you are looking into this dark room lit by two lanterns on

371
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:53,640
either side of the room that have open flames coming from them.

372
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:59,240
Right in front of you, there are six individuals passed out all in their underwear.

373
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:06,640
Most are pretty rough-looking young children, and one is Oz, Mayhem, Wolf.

374
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:14,100
They are all unconscious as a group of what I can only describe as grandmothers.

375
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,940
They are older women.

376
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:23,780
They are all dressed in long skirts and cardigans, and they have their hair up in tight little

377
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:27,580
buns like Aunt B. How about that?

378
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:35,160
They are all humming and walking in a strange pattern around this room, pouring a strange

379
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:41,600
liquid into the mouths of these six passed out individuals.

380
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,900
Real quick, I just need all of you to roll Sanity for me.

381
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:45,900
Fail.

382
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:46,900
38.

383
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:52,820
Oh my god, I passed 14 on an 18.

384
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:53,820
Fuck.

385
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,580
I rolled a 33.

386
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,580
Crit fail.

387
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:57,580
Yeah.

388
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:04,100
Keith Vigna and Thomas John Lee Pettymore both lose one Sanity, and for this, Joe, I'm

389
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:08,440
going to have you just take your headphones off and plug your ear holes.

390
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,440
Okay.

391
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,040
And don't read our lips.

392
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:15,320
This is the first time we've mentioned Joe's embarrassing ear holes instead of ears.

393
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:18,520
He just has these weird, like a Voldemort-like sucky-

394
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:23,360
I'm nervous about all the laughter I'm seeing around the room.

395
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,360
He really plugged them.

396
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,360
His mom is a rhino.

397
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,040
Yeah, they are rhino ears.

398
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:40,660
So as you guys are looking into this room, the two of you see two ethereal spirits that

399
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:46,740
are hanging above these grandmothers, and one is a black dog and the other is a red

400
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:53,660
lion, and they are weaving in and out of these grandmothers as they're walking and pouring

401
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:59,940
this liquid into the mouths of the passed out individuals, and these spirits are diving

402
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:03,160
in and out of the bodies that are lying in front of you.

403
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:07,080
Does there seem to be any connection between their movements or who they're diving into

404
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,680
and who the grandmas are giving what it is?

405
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,680
Absolutely.

406
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,680
Okay.

407
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,320
Joe, you can come back now.

408
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:18,480
I saw some hand gestures coming from Zach over there, and I turned away real quick just

409
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,160
to make sure I wouldn't glean anything from the beautiful sign language you're providing.

410
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:28,500
Well, they say that you can put mute on a good story and still know what's happening,

411
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,840
but I don't know if that would work for this medium.

412
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,840
Not for this medium.

413
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,840
I don't know, listeners.

414
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,840
Give it a shot.

415
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:40,240
I am disturbed, and I look at Kevin John, who's like wide-eyed.

416
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,240
What the fuck was that?

417
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,240
I don't know, man.

418
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:49,020
As you guys are staring at each other, one of the elderly women just walks into the room

419
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:55,520
with you, and the door shuts behind her, and she just turns to face the door and stands

420
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,520
there.

421
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:59,540
Blergeith.

422
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:04,340
I don't say anything.

423
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:08,060
I just stand there hoping that this elevator goes to someone we can talk to.

424
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:11,660
It continues moving, and she turns around to the two of you.

425
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:13,620
Oh, do you have a prisoner?

426
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:14,620
We do.

427
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:15,620
Yes.

428
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:16,620
What did he do?

429
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:17,940
He betrayed Marvin Glass.

430
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:23,420
Well, that is not a good idea, young sir, she says to Clark Bishop.

431
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:24,420
That's why we brought him here.

432
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:26,180
He needs to be punished.

433
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,640
Well, we'll certainly make sure that he's punished, won't we?

434
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,640
I hope so.

435
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,640
You better.

436
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:34,600
But we'd like, yeah, we'd like to tell- We need him for a while first, though.

437
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:40,080
We need to tell somebody higher up, well, I was, I don't know who you are, but if you

438
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,120
could get us to somebody, I was tasked with a major-

439
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,120
He's new.

440
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:49,840
I was tasked with something major for Marvin, and he got in my way and made that task impossible.

441
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,880
Oh, I'm sure you were, honey.

442
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,080
This is Keith Vigna.

443
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:57,460
He's going to be around working for us for a while, why don't you go ahead and introduce

444
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,460
yourself?

445
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,460
Oh, hi Keith.

446
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:05,140
Kevin, thank you for making me aware of not introducing myself, I'm so sorry, that's such

447
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:07,540
rude manners of mine.

448
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:13,220
Keith Vigna, my name is Ursula, it's very nice to meet you, Ursula Oscythe, it's very

449
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:14,220
nice to meet you.

450
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:18,060
It's nice to meet you as well, I can't look, or I am looking forward to working with you

451
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,060
in the future.

452
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:23,160
Ursula, you could say it better than me, why don't you tell Keith a little bit about what

453
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,140
you and the others like you do here?

454
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,220
Oh, well of course, yeah, welcome.

455
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:34,980
So basically what we do is we carry on a very old tradition of making sure that the sacrifices

456
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,700
are ready to be useful.

457
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,920
And how do you go about that?

458
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:45,920
As you well know, it's a long drawn out process of lots of ingredients and lots of words and

459
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:53,100
lots of specific directions and maths, but after some time we're able to put together

460
00:23:53,460 --> 00:24:00,460
a nice sort of change of blood for those that we bathe in our fun time juice.

461
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:07,900
Oh, I think I've heard of, Kevin's been telling me about, it sounds like a fun time, you know,

462
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:08,900
all around.

463
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:09,900
It is, it absolutely is.

464
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:15,420
And I know that you seem to be looking for someone to speak to, Keith Vigna, is that

465
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,420
right?

466
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:25,180
Well, I had spoken with Marvin just earlier today and I was supposed to do something for

467
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:30,560
him and I need to talk with him and let him know what happened and ask him what I can

468
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,560
do next.

469
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:37,200
The door begins to open and she says, well, I'm sure you're going exactly where you need

470
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,200
to.

471
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,200
Nice to meet you.

472
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,600
And then motions for you to get off the elevator.

473
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,560
Have a good one, Ursula.

474
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:46,340
Good to see you, Kevin.

475
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:51,900
And then I think in my head, we're probably supposed to get off here.

476
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:52,900
Yeah, Keith.

477
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:53,900
Yeah.

478
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:54,900
Yeah, you get out.

479
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:55,900
Let's do it.

480
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:56,900
Let's do that.

481
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:57,900
Get the fuck out of the elevator.

482
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,460
I didn't say it out loud.

483
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:01,140
This is my elevator now.

484
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:03,740
She was totally hitting on me, right?

485
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:07,100
Dude, did you see the way she looked at you?

486
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,100
That was weird.

487
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,100
Wow.

488
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,940
She's kind of old, but she's not that bad looking.

489
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:13,120
Ursula, it's not maybe the name I would pick.

490
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,120
All that torturing kept her fit.

491
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,120
Okay.

492
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,120
We walk off the elevator.

493
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:22,640
You guys are still having this conversation and the camera zooms out and you are in a

494
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,200
massive room.

495
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:31,180
The door is already shut behind you and this room is dark and it is damp and you smell,

496
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:37,580
you know that like that kind of YMCA kind of aquarium kind of smell going on?

497
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:38,800
Nasty chlorine.

498
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,800
Yes.

499
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:46,060
It is endless and it smells fucking terrible and also extremely fishy.

500
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:50,020
If there was a place to do noodling, it would be here.

501
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:51,260
Get your arm ready.

502
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:57,580
Looking out, you see that there is a grid of catwalks that are absolutely infinite going

503
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:59,020
away from you.

504
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:09,020
Above them is a light fog and this is all hanging over dark greenish murky water below.

505
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:10,200
It's open water below us.

506
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:16,160
It is open water below you and in the squares of the grid in the opening where the catwalks

507
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:24,600
are not covering, hanging from the foggy darkness above are rusty moss covered chains.

508
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:30,200
Now some of the chains are just hanging like 10 feet out of the water and some of the chains

509
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,520
go all the way in the water.

510
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:39,780
In the distance, you see that a handful of these have people hanging from them.

511
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:43,140
Are they alive or are they corpses?

512
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,780
They are small in your view.

513
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:46,780
They're far away.

514
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:48,220
No, they're small.

515
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:49,220
They're just tiny people.

516
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:50,220
I mean, I've seen one of those.

517
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:52,820
They're hanging at the bottom of the chains.

518
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:53,820
Still above the water.

519
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:54,820
Above the water.

520
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:55,820
Still well above the water.

521
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:56,820
Gotcha.

522
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:57,820
Yes.

523
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:58,820
This is spooky.

524
00:26:58,820 --> 00:26:59,820
Let's keep moving.

525
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,460
Dude, that's a really cool image.

526
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:06,800
I just picture that so well in my brain and it's creepy and kind of beautiful in a weird

527
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,800
way.

528
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,800
Green fog, like on a swampy.

529
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:13,640
I mean, you said they're far away, but can we see movement from any of them that are

530
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,640
hanging?

531
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,640
Yeah.

532
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:19,680
And let's go ahead and roll alertness for me or search depending.

533
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,280
You can each roll on this one.

534
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:24,280
I'll give it to you.

535
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:27,760
Sixteen on a 60 for alertness.

536
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,760
Forty one on a 70 for alertness.

537
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,180
I got a 38 on 60 for alertness.

538
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:33,180
All right.

539
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:34,180
Did we all pass?

540
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,180
Mm-hmm.

541
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:36,180
Nice.

542
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,180
Group success.

543
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:38,180
We're alert as fuck.

544
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:39,180
You guys get to see everything.

545
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:43,500
Oh, you guys get to see everything.

546
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:47,060
Is that still Ursula talking?

547
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,620
Only for Kevin.

548
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:56,520
So you see there is only one guard in sight and it is one of these unnatural looking fish

549
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,500
men wearing a brown jumpsuit.

550
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:06,200
You also hear three voices in the unseen darkness across the enormous chamber.

551
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:12,640
And because you guys rolled so well, you're going to recognize the voices that you hear.

552
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,520
Keith, one of them is Francis Beans.

553
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,520
My niece.

554
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,520
Your niece.

555
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:21,240
The other two are voices that you guys haven't heard in a while.

556
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:24,920
It is Kathy and George Piston.

557
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,920
Oh.

558
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,920
Wow.

559
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,940
It's been a while.

560
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:29,940
Days even.

561
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:35,700
Now, if you'll remember Kathy and George Piston, George is Leo's brother, Leo Piston, and they

562
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:39,420
run the Piston Pig Farm and the Piston Junkyard.

563
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:40,780
Keith spent some time out there.

564
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,700
I believe Kathy shot him in the foot.

565
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:43,700
She did.

566
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:46,100
I got to take a little trip on her school bus.

567
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:49,260
Yeah, which was full of about a hundred homeless people.

568
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,260
Yeah.

569
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:54,080
It was also that junkyard that kind of started us on this entire path where there was a body

570
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,080
that showed up there.

571
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,080
Absolutely.

572
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:57,140
Where'd your pencil go?

573
00:28:57,140 --> 00:29:00,140
I just dropped it right down there.

574
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:02,100
Real fast, Keith, what was your brother's name?

575
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,420
Yeah, real fast, Keith.

576
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:04,800
What was your brother's name?

577
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,800
Was it not Francis?

578
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:08,300
No, Francis was my niece.

579
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:13,540
Fucking what was that?

580
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:14,540
Some knew him.

581
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:15,540
It has something to do with beans.

582
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:16,540
Oh, I know what it is.

583
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:17,540
I know what it is.

584
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:18,540
It's Fergie.

585
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:19,540
Fergie.

586
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:20,540
I was thinking it was Francis.

587
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,520
Go back and look at all the beans names.

588
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:29,020
There's a pattern there.

589
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:30,020
So yeah, Fergie makes sense.

590
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,020
Sorry.

591
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,020
Can we hear what they're saying?

592
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:37,120
You are a little bit too far away from them right now to actually hear what they're saying,

593
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,480
but you just recognize the tenor of their voices.

594
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,680
So we don't have eyes on them?

595
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:45,360
You can kind of see outlines that would help you realize who they were.

596
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,480
They are like 200 yards away from you.

597
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:50,060
There is some sort of light source in here.

598
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:51,360
It's not pitch black at all.

599
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,360
It is not.

600
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,420
No, there is some unseen light source.

601
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:56,480
Are they like in front of us or do they come from?

602
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,720
Yeah, they're in front of you.

603
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:02,000
As far as we can tell from here, are they just standing on a random catwalk or is there

604
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,680
something near them that they're maybe congregated near?

605
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:13,600
Well, it seems like based on those great roles that Francis Beans is standing on a catwalk.

606
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,280
Kathy and George Piston are both hanging.

607
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,280
Gotcha.

608
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,280
Oh wow.

609
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,280
Oh.

610
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:22,620
This is fucking cool.

611
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:28,620
I like whispered, do you guys want to, I mean, want to just approach them?

612
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:31,940
Is it just in front of us that we can walk or can we take other paths?

613
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:33,620
It's a big old grid, baby.

614
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:36,460
John, do you know where we are if you've been in here before?

615
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:38,140
No, unfortunately not.

616
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:41,820
Do you guys want to go straight at Francis?

617
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:43,660
We can just like push her over the rail.

618
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:45,340
I mean, yeah, we could.

619
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:46,340
One down.

620
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,780
Let her sleep with the fishmen.

621
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:51,800
We try to get around her, but I don't want to get lost in this place.

622
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,160
We might go talk to Francis, see if she can lead us.

623
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,160
That's true.

624
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:59,640
We could, if she starts to get violent, we can just three versus one.

625
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,880
She's a little girl.

626
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,880
Just throwing it out there.

627
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:05,640
We could also wait for her to leave and follow her.

628
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:10,280
Follow and also maybe rescue Kathy and George and have another, have an army with us.

629
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,480
I don't know.

630
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,080
But maybe also fuck these pistons.

631
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,080
Yeah.

632
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,080
That's also true.

633
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:18,420
I don't know what it would be to go talk to her, but we can also wait until she leaves

634
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:20,300
and try to follow her where she's going.

635
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:22,300
What do you guys think?

636
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,620
I'll do whatever you guys want.

637
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:25,660
I'm the prisoner right now.

638
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:29,060
But not in real life.

639
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:30,820
You can't have that mindset.

640
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:36,340
Oh man, we've already lost.

641
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:40,980
It's like when you were a kid and you were trying to get out of school, so you acted

642
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:44,100
sick, but acting sick made you feel bad.

643
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,800
And then you just wasted a day.

644
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:50,200
I just mean you guys captured me fair and square and I don't know.

645
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,440
I'm your prisoner, dammit.

646
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,920
I think we should just go, let's go talk to her.

647
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,920
Let's go talk to her.

648
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:59,760
Worst case scenario, we push her into one of these feed and fish tanks.

649
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,880
Just say, Hey, uh, Hey Frankie.

650
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,440
Uh, well let's, let's walk up and get closer to her.

651
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,440
I say that.

652
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,440
I say, Hey Frankie.

653
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:13,240
As you guys are walking down the catwalk, you would see you're getting into a section

654
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:16,100
where there are more people hanging.

655
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:23,180
Most of them are unconscious and they are all hanging from a fish hook that is going

656
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:26,780
through their crossed forearms.

657
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:31,600
So their arms are crossed and through the spot where they are crossing, there is a fish

658
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,500
hook going in both forearms.

659
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:41,340
I kind of awkwardly nod and wave as the people, as we pass, excuse me, sorry, passing through.

660
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:48,660
Just one of them sees Kevin and he's like, fuck you, you devil.

661
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:53,320
Every single mess you've ever made in your life is one more thing that's taken you closer

662
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,440
to hell fire and brimstone.

663
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,440
You absolute piece of devil witch garbage.

664
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:04,840
I get right up in his face and I say, yeah, I'm going to hell and I'll see you there.

665
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,360
And then I'd poke him in the eye.

666
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:11,280
Ow, ow, fuck, ow, shit, do you have any eye drops?

667
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:15,060
As you guys continue, you do see that one of the...

668
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:16,560
Can I scan other faces?

669
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,940
Is there anybody else here that I recognize or no?

670
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:26,540
Yeah, as you scan the rest of the faces, you do recognize the body of agent Trent Chad

671
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:33,300
also hanging from one of these fish hooks and his eyes rise up to meet yours and he

672
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:36,260
freaks the fuck out.

673
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,260
What?

674
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,280
What?

675
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:45,600
You guys were, you're dead, you're fucking dead.

676
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:52,800
He looks at Keith Vigna and Clark Bishop and he's like, what the absolute fuck happened?

677
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:58,080
The last time I saw you, you, you, you, and, and now you're...

678
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:03,520
And he kind of notices that Keith is walking a prisoner, Clark Bishop with Kevin.

679
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:07,120
He's like, you're working with these fucking assholes now?

680
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,300
What is wrong with you?

681
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:22,020
I stick my tongue out at him and go, wow, have fun DM.

682
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:28,180
I have absolutely no words for the wretch that you have become.

683
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:30,980
I say sayonara bitch and then we keep walking.

684
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:32,260
I want to shoot him a wink.

685
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:33,260
You can definitely wink at him.

686
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:34,260
I shoot him a wink.

687
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:35,920
Does he react at all?

688
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,660
He spits it, Keith.

689
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:39,060
I keep looking forward.

690
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:40,060
All right.

691
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:42,980
As you guys are going, you can hear Francis beans.

692
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:43,980
All right.

693
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:50,020
So like, seriously, I'm only going to ask you like one more time.

694
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:53,980
Who started the fucking outbreak in contention?

695
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:55,160
Who did it?

696
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,420
Kathy piston spits.

697
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:02,380
I told you, I don't know what that means.

698
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:04,100
I don't know what that means.

699
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,100
Where?

700
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:08,560
Okay, like where is the residue collecting then?

701
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,320
Like you've been in contention this whole time.

702
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,840
So like, just fucking tell me, is the residue collecting in any specific spot?

703
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:21,560
Kathy is shaking her head and she's like, I, I, and you see that Francis beans has a

704
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:27,720
lever and she is slowly lowering George piston toward this water.

705
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:33,920
George begins actually whimpering as he's lowered towards this water and Kathy looks

706
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:35,940
over at him and she's like, no, for real.

707
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:38,940
I don't know what residue you're talking about.

708
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:41,220
I don't know where it would be collecting.

709
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:46,700
I, I just, I don't think I have any of the answers that you're, and she gets cut off

710
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:47,700
by Francis again.

711
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:48,700
Who's like, yeah.

712
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:49,700
Okay.

713
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:53,260
Like seriously though, what is the circle of knowledge use the people for?

714
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:55,060
You of all people should fucking know that.

715
00:35:55,060 --> 00:36:03,780
And Kathy just spits at her client confidentiality and then Francis says, all right, well, or

716
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,880
she's making fun of her.

717
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:06,880
Yeah.

718
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:07,880
She's mocking her.

719
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,720
She's mocking her whale.

720
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:12,920
Have you seen any of them silver spares?

721
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:17,820
Francis says, were they, uh, like, you know, at the circle or were they in contention?

722
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:20,480
Have you ever seen any of these things?

723
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:24,040
And Kathy's just lowers her head.

724
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:30,000
I'm not gonna George, George, I love you.

725
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,320
I love you.

726
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:37,300
And George is being dipped slowly into the water and as his feet touch, he starts moaning

727
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,300
out.

728
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:44,100
He's like, no Lord, please God, if you're out there, I would be willing if you did me

729
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:47,300
a service right now and just let me.

730
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:51,620
And Francis is laughing maniacally as she's slowly lowering it.

731
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:54,700
And if you guys are still walking, you're approaching right now.

732
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:55,700
Wow.

733
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:58,500
Yeah, you do.

734
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:03,240
I don't do anything yet, but there's still part of my brain that was a police officer

735
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:06,320
that makes me just want to fucking stop this immediately.

736
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:10,120
I'm trying to get her attention and Francis turns around and the lever stops.

737
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:12,600
So George is feeder in the water.

738
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:16,440
She turns around and she's like, Kevin, Oh, God damn it.

739
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,440
Nope.

740
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,440
What?

741
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,440
Just talk like you normally do.

742
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,440
Yeah.

743
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,440
You know what your normal voice.

744
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,440
Here's act with.

745
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:29,540
Keith fucking Figna, if it isn't you and your new best friend, Kevin, and I see we have

746
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:33,180
company finally, wait, what the fuck is he doing here?

747
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:37,460
You were in the room when Marvin told me to, uh, bring Stan Manstein back, right?

748
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:38,460
Yeah.

749
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:39,460
He killed Stan Manstein.

750
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:40,720
What the fuck?

751
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:44,120
So we're bringing him to Marvin to have a little conversation, try to figure out what

752
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:47,480
we can do if we can, you know, I just, I didn't want to come back empty handed.

753
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,480
So I brought you something.

754
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,480
All right.

755
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,700
Well, like you were sent down here, weren't you?

756
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:52,700
Yeah.

757
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:53,700
Okay.

758
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:56,080
Then like, I guess hang him up and we'll talk to him now.

759
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,080
Give me a second.

760
00:37:57,080 --> 00:38:01,920
I'm trying to get something good out of these fucking contentioners.

761
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,920
God damn it.

762
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,920
Francis.

763
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:07,340
Marvin told me he needs to see you upstairs when that's a loose end.

764
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:09,920
I'm sorry.

765
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,120
Go about your business.

766
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:16,120
Wait, like what's the loose end?

767
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:18,300
Like when did he tell you that leaving?

768
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,300
I'm sorry.

769
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:24,180
I'm a little confused the past few days, but uh, the loose end I was talking about was

770
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:26,760
you leaving him here dangling, not tortured.

771
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:29,100
You should torture him a little more.

772
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:40,640
Roll persuade for me there, Thomas 37 on a 60 very nice.

773
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,660
I think you're right.

774
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:46,880
I think we should hang him up right now and fucking torture him until he starts talking.

775
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,920
So like, uh, just hold on.

776
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:50,920
Just hold on right there.

777
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:54,520
I'm seriously, I'm deadly in the middle of something right now.

778
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,360
And she begins lowering George.

779
00:38:56,360 --> 00:39:01,840
I use my metal hand to whack her in the back of the head and try to knock her out.

780
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,840
Ooh, doggy.

781
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,840
All right.

782
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:07,800
Uh, you're going to roll unarmed combat against her unarmed combat.

783
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,600
Can I get a plus for my heavy metal hand?

784
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:13,800
I'll give you a plus to damage for the heavy metal hand.

785
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,000
So I'm rolling a unarmed.

786
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Yep.

787
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,920
It's clearly armed though.

788
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:21,920
What did she roll?

789
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:22,920
She rolled a 10.

790
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:23,920
God damn it.

791
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,040
I rolled an 82 and a 40.

792
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:29,480
Keith, I'm going to have you roll dexterity.

793
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:32,320
It's going to be a pretty fucking important dexterity check.

794
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,320
What's your dexterity?

795
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,240
60.

796
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,480
And that's a 90.

797
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,480
Doesn't matter.

798
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,480
It's one 91.

799
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:47,160
Keith, as you go to whack your niece with your big old metal club hand, she uses your

800
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:51,440
momentum against you and throws you directly into the water.

801
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,440
God damn it.

802
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:57,520
Do I, can I do some sort of saving chance to cling onto the side?

803
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:01,120
That would have been the dexterity that you just rolled and failed.

804
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:07,080
So as you splash into the water, I need you to roll a sanity check.

805
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:09,120
Oh, just him?

806
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,120
Just him.

807
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,880
I've failed, but not over my power.

808
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:12,880
Okay.

809
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:13,880
26 on him.

810
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:16,600
Take one sanity damage.

811
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,600
Psychic water.

812
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:22,880
As you begin fucking panicking at the thought of what is underneath you right now.

813
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:28,880
Now with that sanity loss, what that reminds you of, do you remember what happened to your

814
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:32,080
little fish boyfriend, Peter Dieter?

815
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,080
Yes.

816
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:37,440
You realized that that was an extremely large tank of water.

817
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,040
Just like the one I'm in right now.

818
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:44,640
Yeah, which is crazy because that means that you are now swimming around with the thing

819
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,680
that you saw inside there.

820
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,640
Are these multiple tanks or one giant tank?

821
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:52,200
This is one giant tank, baby.

822
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:56,160
I want to start swimming over to the glass edge of this tank.

823
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,720
Oh, it is not even close.

824
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:59,960
You can't even see the edge.

825
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:03,320
I mean, how far above is the catwalk from where I am?

826
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,320
Five feet.

827
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,320
Help me.

828
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:09,360
Can I, in the confusion of his assail, heaven helps those who help themselves.

829
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,080
Yeah, so we are going to move on.

830
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,820
So Clark actually does get first action.

831
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:15,320
I would like to finish what Keith tried to do.

832
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:17,840
I want to try and knock her out.

833
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:18,840
Okay.

834
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:19,840
I'm rolling unarmed.

835
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,840
Hell yeah.

836
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:24,240
I rolled a six on a 70.

837
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,400
Describe what you would like to do.

838
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:30,440
Well, when Keith went for her and swung wide or whatever happened there, I just seized

839
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:34,780
that opportunity because she wouldn't have been looking at the prisoner and I just walk

840
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:37,460
up and wallop her.

841
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:40,540
It's just a straight punch to the side of her head.

842
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:41,540
Alrighty.

843
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:45,820
Go ahead and roll a D6 for damage here.

844
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:46,820
It's a two.

845
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:47,820
Alrighty.

846
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:49,060
You punch her in the head.

847
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:50,060
Jon, what are you doing?

848
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:56,260
I would like to use law to try and handcuff her.

849
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:57,260
Love it.

850
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:58,260
So you go to handcuff her.

851
00:41:58,260 --> 00:41:59,620
Roll that law check for me.

852
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:00,620
Fuck.

853
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:02,620
94 on a 50.

854
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:03,620
So you go to hand.

855
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:04,620
Okay.

856
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:06,460
You guys curse dice.

857
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:12,980
So you guys are all standing there and Keith goes to swing at her.

858
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:18,260
She uses his momentum against him and throws him into the water below.

859
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:23,540
Clark goes swings, punches her, makes a connection as Jon goes around the back and tries to get

860
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:25,040
her hands in handcuffs.

861
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:31,660
She wriggles out of his grasp and she kind of backs away and she goes to take off running.

862
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:34,260
She's going to run toward where you guys came from.

863
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:35,900
And it is Keith's turn.

864
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:36,900
What are you doing?

865
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:43,940
I pull the big, huge gun off my back and I try to use the magazine clips to reach up

866
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:48,380
to the catwalk and, you know, kind of hike it in there and pull myself up out of the

867
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:49,380
water.

868
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:50,380
That's super cool.

869
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:51,380
That's very smart.

870
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:57,420
So I'm going to have you roll athletics in order to kick your legs hard enough to lift

871
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:59,220
your body out of the water enough.

872
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:00,220
Fucking shit.

873
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:01,220
Oh boy.

874
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:02,620
It's a crit fail.

875
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:03,620
55 on a 50.

876
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:06,100
Oh damn.

877
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:07,100
Right there.

878
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:08,780
I'm going to use different dice.

879
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:18,500
Keith, as you move your gun into position, the clip lodges itself into the catwalk and

880
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:24,520
you accidentally click, I'm guessing, a button on a gun that makes a clip pop out and then

881
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:28,940
the gun slips out of your hands and falls into the water out of your...

882
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:30,940
It's strapped on my back though.

883
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:31,940
You rolled a crit fail.

884
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:35,220
And you took it off your back too.

885
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:39,060
I like where your head's at, but you done fucked up and you lost your gun.

886
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:44,720
It's in the water and it is floating down into the darkness past where you can see.

887
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:48,580
You can barely see your feet in this murky, dark green water.

888
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:51,700
And above you, this clip is lodged into the catwalk.

889
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:53,300
Clark, it is your turn.

890
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:55,260
I'm going to rush her again.

891
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:56,260
Okay.

892
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:57,260
She is running away from you currently.

893
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:58,260
Oh, that's right.

894
00:43:58,260 --> 00:43:59,260
I forgot she was running away.

895
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:00,260
Do you want to chase after her?

896
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:01,260
Yeah.

897
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:02,820
What kind of role would I need for that?

898
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:04,900
Do I have a run skill?

899
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:08,780
You would be, well, just tell me what you're going to do and then we'll figure it out from

900
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:09,780
there.

901
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:10,780
Well, okay.

902
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:11,780
The problem is that...

903
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:12,780
What would Clark do?

904
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:15,700
You can look at your athletics to know how well you'd hold up in a race.

905
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:20,980
I've got an idea of what Jon would do that wouldn't take any time or action away from

906
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:21,980
his turn.

907
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:22,980
I just want to shout at her.

908
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:23,980
Know what I'm going to do?

909
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:25,380
I'm going to turn and help Keith out of the pool.

910
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:26,380
Yeah.

911
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:27,980
Take that free action and go ahead and holler.

912
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:28,980
Francis!

913
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:29,980
Francis!

914
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:31,260
The blood just got riled up.

915
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:32,260
You know, family.

916
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:34,620
And he's just, you know, he was just trying to wrestle around.

917
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:35,620
Get back here.

918
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:37,220
You've got torturing to do.

919
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:39,060
All right.

920
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:40,660
So let's get that roll.

921
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:43,220
How are you helping Keith out of the pool?

922
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:47,020
I'll lay belly on the catwalk and reach my hands down toward him.

923
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:48,020
All right.

924
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:52,420
Keith, I'm going to have you roll luck for a timing situation here.

925
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:53,420
Nope.

926
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:54,900
54 and a 35.

927
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:55,900
Amazing.

928
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:58,400
And Thomas, do you want to do anything else with your turn here?

929
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,120
Can I do a persuade roll on yelling at her?

930
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:02,120
Yeah, absolutely.

931
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:03,120
Yeah.

932
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:04,120
51 on a 60.

933
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:05,120
All righty.

934
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:08,440
And she rolled a 98 to try to fight your persuade.

935
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:11,560
And so she stops and she turns around.

936
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:16,440
She's like, crushed her in my mind vice.

937
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:23,520
She's like, God damn it, Kevin, you know how much I like really like torturing.

938
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:24,520
Yeah.

939
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:25,800
And you know Keith's an idiot.

940
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:28,320
Why don't you come, you know, look, he's in this water.

941
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:31,000
Come get him, help get him out and then you can torture.

942
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:36,400
As she's running back toward you, she's yelling at you and she's like, get your prisoner,

943
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,600
handcuff him.

944
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:43,160
And so you, your attempt to handcuff her was so piss poor that she didn't even realize

945
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:45,440
you were trying to handcuff her.

946
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:49,560
And so she's now telling you to get ahold of the prisoner that you had.

947
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:50,560
Right.

948
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,720
The person I just tried to handcuff.

949
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:53,720
Exactly.

950
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:56,560
What a persuade roll you had and two in a row.

951
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,240
I'll definitely count all that.

952
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:03,960
So Keith, I swim over to the chain that George is hanging from.

953
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:04,960
So smart.

954
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:10,160
And I try to crawl up him and up onto the chain in order to at least one, get out of

955
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:12,620
the water, two to try to get to the catwalk.

956
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:20,100
And with that absolutely dog shit luck roll that you had earlier, that was for the timing

957
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:22,320
of the whole situation.

958
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:33,720
And looking down as you hold on to the body of George piston, you feel this movement from

959
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:41,940
underneath you and you can hear water moving at a rapid pace and looking down, you actually

960
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:45,480
see the creature.

961
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:51,440
It is moving so quickly toward you that all of the grime in the water that is in between

962
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:54,860
you and it is starting to dissipate as it's coming toward you.

963
00:46:54,860 --> 00:47:00,300
And you see a clear picture of one of these mutated fish men.

964
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:06,140
But like the one that you saw earlier, it looks exactly like the ones in the Brown jumpsuits,

965
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:09,780
but it is four times larger.

966
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:16,360
And both of its legs are kind of like welded together like this one giant fin.

967
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:21,720
It opens its maw and swims up right at you.

968
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:22,720
Clark it's your turn.

969
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:23,720
What are you doing?

970
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:26,660
You're hanging over the side, but Keith swim away from you.

971
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:31,240
Fuck, I guess I'm standing up.

972
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:33,740
I heard the exchange about the cuff thing.

973
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:34,980
And so I'm going to try and play it cool.

974
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:38,140
I'm just going to stand back up and that's it.

975
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:39,260
I mean, yeah.

976
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:41,940
I yell at Francis, he shot in the leg.

977
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:42,940
He can't get away.

978
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:44,300
Help me get Keith now.

979
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:51,540
She begins running up toward you and Kathy Piston is crying.

980
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:55,960
George Piston is hollering to his God.

981
00:47:55,960 --> 00:48:01,900
Keith Vigna is crawling up the body of George Piston.

982
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:07,420
Clark Bishop is standing on the catwalk with his hands behind his back.

983
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:11,920
And Francis beans is running toward Kevin in her eyes.

984
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:21,260
John Lee Pettymore to try to grab Keith when all of a sudden this giant fish mouth comes

985
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:30,300
up from in between the catwalk grid and grabs wholly on to George Piston's body, closes

986
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:34,880
its mouth and dips back into the water.

987
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:41,480
The fish hook is just hanging right above the water covered in blood.

988
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:46,580
And there's a giant splash in the water hits all of your feet.

989
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:54,200
And the four of you stand there in the wake of the disappearance of Keith Vigna and George

990
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:55,200
Piston.

991
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,200
Oh no.

992
00:48:56,200 --> 00:49:13,680
I bet I could have helped hear more.

993
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:55,880
How am I the only one trying to fool over How can you have enough trying to get me to

994
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:56,880
the end?

995
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:56,880
