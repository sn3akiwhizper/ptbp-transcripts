00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,520
Hello my cast and crew and adoring audience.

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:09,720
It's your theater director that brings that sweet sweet nectar, Wolf the dog.

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:17,540
And you know I'm blocking all the scenes here in contention from 694.2 PTBP like I always

4
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:19,120
do my babies.

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:24,080
This week's Howlin' with Wolf comes from a listener who tagged at PretendingPod on Twitter.

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,320
And your buddy Wolf appreciates that so fucking much y'all.

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,320
He writes.

8
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,920
Hello Mr. Wolf.

9
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:37,680
My name is Eidos Fillmore and I'm a proud but concerned resident of 45 years here in

10
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,680
contention.

11
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:43,640
First, I don't actually understand the program that follows your fine program.

12
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,520
I have no idea.

13
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,520
What I do have an idea about are all the pets going missing lately.

14
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,640
Hell, the families on my block are missing the dogs and the cats.

15
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,680
But who's the only citizen who also happens to serve on the city council to have a deputy

16
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,880
come out and personally assist her and her stupid dog?

17
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,840
Sir, you're a deputy.

18
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,720
Don't you have better things to be doing?

19
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:10,420
And then this fella Deputy Vigna coming home like some goddamn prodigal son.

20
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:13,960
Except he ain't no prodigal and we all wish he would have stayed gone.

21
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:19,880
I heard he almost laid hands on Leo Piston the day before he mysteriously goes missing.

22
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,880
Hmm.

23
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,240
Sorry for the long note, Wolf.

24
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,240
Signed, Eidos.

25
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,120
Damn, Eidos.

26
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,240
You bring up some solid complaints.

27
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,480
Maybe we should do something about these stupid coppers.

28
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:36,320
From what I can tell, the hip new spot for all the cool cats in contention is in the

29
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,680
creeks and ponds, my babies.

30
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:43,280
For all you cool cats listening, you too can submit a message to be read by your old pal

31
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:49,880
Wolf by tagging app pretending pod on social media or writing a five star review, screenshotting

32
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,800
it and sending it to pretendingpod at gmail dot com.

33
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,200
But either way, isn't it about time you left us a review?

34
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,120
You know what makes Wolf the dog feel so good.

35
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:06,080
I want to bathe in your five stars, my babies, help your little wolfy boy get all squeaky

36
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,080
clean.

37
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:10,920
However, now it's time to dig up some dirt.

38
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,380
It's the news.

39
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:16,080
The officers were last seen causing a fatal car crash.

40
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,640
A minivan was run off the road by Officer Betty Moore, a former teen sprint car racer

41
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:27,720
who was banned from the circuit after an accident that left multiple bystanders hospitalized.

42
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,320
The minivan flipped and caught fire.

43
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,480
Officer Bishop pulled a young boy from the fiery wreckage.

44
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,640
The boy is at the clinic in critical condition.

45
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:42,880
The minivan then combusted, killing the driver and the other passenger who were both trapped

46
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,440
in the vehicle.

47
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:50,240
The vigna made it out with a concussion, a broken nose and the memories of a particularly

48
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,920
traumatic childhood Christmas y'all.

49
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:59,400
Speaking of Christmas, I don't want a lot for Christmas, there is just one thing I need.

50
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,200
I don't care about the presents underneath the Christmas tree.

51
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:12,080
I just want five star reviews, take just a second on iTunes, make my wish come true y'all.

52
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,480
All I want for Christmas is kudzoo with no backbone.

53
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,680
Who did the scoop?

54
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,720
I have a hypothetical situation for you guys.

55
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:45,480
If you had the opportunity to have this magical ability, which is anytime you were done with

56
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:50,160
a piece of clothing that you were wearing, you could drop it on the floor and it would

57
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:57,840
immediately be pressed and laundered and back in your chest of drawers or your closet like

58
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,840
immediately or wherever you needed your clothes to be at that moment.

59
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,840
But in order to get this ability, you have to fuck a corpse.

60
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,560
Yeah, for sure. Two birds.

61
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,560
For how long?

62
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,560
Okay, good question.

63
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,560
To completion?

64
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,560
No, you have to fuck a corpse for five minutes.

65
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,560
Until it comes.

66
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,560
You have to make a corpse come, okay.

67
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,560
How fresh or old is the corpse?

68
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,560
The corpse is roughly your age.

69
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,560
When's the last time it was alive?

70
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,560
Right, yeah.

71
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,560
Oh, that's what you meant by fresh.

72
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,560
Still warm?

73
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,560
Uh, no.

74
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,280
Like days, weeks?

75
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,280
Like six hours.

76
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,280
Oh, yeah, for sure.

77
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:45,280
Wait, why does that matter? What if it was a day old?

78
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,280
Still, but if it was like six weeks.

79
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,280
Right.

80
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,280
It'd be harder to do.

81
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,280
Or three years.

82
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,280
Yeah.

83
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,280
Right, okay, well that would be much harder.

84
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,280
It'd be just like bones.

85
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,280
I don't know.

86
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,280
Rubbing your bones.

87
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,280
I would fuck a six hour corpse.

88
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:00,280
So he was baiting us into blackmail is what that was.

89
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,280
I have this recorded for posterity.

90
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,280
He just has dirt on his mouth.

91
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Is the question, I'm doing someone's laundry until they die and then I get to fuck them?

92
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Then yeah.

93
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I think a more interesting consequence is that your clothes would be perfectly folded,

94
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,000
pressed, put away, but a random person in the world's like comparable outfit just bursts

95
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
into flames.

96
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Like, is gone.

97
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Then double, yeah.

98
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Yeah, I would do that.

99
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It's like the opposite of Tom's.

100
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Yeah.

101
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,720
Like actually every time you do it, a pair of Toms.

102
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,720
Disappears.

103
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,720
Disappears.

104
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:45,120
Okay, so John, you are holding this wet black cat and you have just called it Doug and told

105
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,480
it you would help him.

106
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:50,120
I think you mean I'm holding a man.

107
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,120
I'm holding Doug.

108
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,760
I didn't just call this cat Doug.

109
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,760
This is basic.

110
00:05:53,760 --> 00:06:10,640
You're talking to my old man.

111
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,640
Radio?

112
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,640
The radio turned you into this cat?

113
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,880
Hey, I don't like, you guys see this, right?

114
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,260
This cat is definitely, I'm talking to this cat.

115
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,260
Is your name Doug?

116
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:23,140
Yeah, that's a yes.

117
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,520
Is your name Clark?

118
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,520
Meow, meow.

119
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,520
Okay, good.

120
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,520
We've got the twos and the twos.

121
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,520
No.

122
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,520
One is yes.

123
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,520
Is two no?

124
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,520
Meow.

125
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,520
Is one yes?

126
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,520
Meow.

127
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,520
Is two yes?

128
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,520
Meow.

129
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,520
Meow.

130
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,700
This is a smart cat because it's Doug.

131
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,700
I have a quick question.

132
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,060
Am I still at a negative 20 right now?

133
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,060
Meow.

134
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:46,500
Doug, do you know how this happened to you?

135
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,500
Meow.

136
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,700
So you could turn, you could fix it?

137
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,180
We could help you fix it.

138
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,180
You know how to fix it?

139
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,180
Meow.

140
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,220
Was that?

141
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:56,420
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.

142
00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:02,000
As you guys are talking to this cat, a crowd of people show up.

143
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
They're standing around.

144
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,740
A lot of them begin booing at you.

145
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:10,340
Many of them have their phones up and are taking videos.

146
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:15,860
And a young girl walks up to go ahead and roll luck against each other and see who rolls

147
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:18,380
the lowest or goes over the most.

148
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:23,820
Uh, I'd go pretty far over, 87 on a 55.

149
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:26,860
I'm really far under, I've got a 12 on a 75.

150
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:29,820
I got 69 on a 65.

151
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:30,820
Hell yeah.

152
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:37,340
A little girl walks up to John Lee Pettymore and she spits at you and a voice yells out

153
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:44,260
from the crowd, yeah girl, fuck the police, uh, hey guys, uh, I think we better get out

154
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,260
of here.

155
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,740
And Drew jumps into the back of Officer Vigno's cruiser.

156
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:51,540
Alright, come on, Doug, it's not safe for cop or beast.

157
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,860
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.

158
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,660
I also get into my cruiser.

159
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,860
Yeah, our cruisers are gone, right?

160
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,940
So I get into Vigno's cruiser with Doug.

161
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,220
I get in also.

162
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:05,100
Okay, I take off, I put my lights on and honk and...

163
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,620
What do you guys think that angry mob was about?

164
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,100
Is it that we let that lady and those kids die?

165
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,460
We saved one of the kids.

166
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,460
Meow?

167
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,500
Not let, it just happened near us.

168
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,980
Don't worry, Doug.

169
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,700
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.

170
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,700
Nothing's gonna happen to you.

171
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,700
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.

172
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:24,020
Well, that girl better be happy she did that to you, because if it was me, there'd be one

173
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,020
more dead kid.

174
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:30,300
Doug, you're gonna have to excuse Officer Vigno, he has a bizarre sense of humor.

175
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,020
I just, I saw a lot of weird shit today, I'm just trying to make up.

176
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,020
That's true, we all have.

177
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,180
We're talking to a cat right now.

178
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:42,820
This cat looks up at you and its eyes switch over from slits to full blown, like, black

179
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:51,180
pupils and it jumps out of your hands, John, and it jumps into Clark's lap and looks back

180
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:54,780
at you fearfully before its eyes move back into slits.

181
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:55,780
I'd stroke him gently.

182
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:56,780
It's okay, Doug.

183
00:08:56,780 --> 00:09:00,100
Vigno's the one saying scary shit, cat.

184
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,780
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.

185
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,500
This guy loves communism.

186
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:09,140
You fellas think we should go back to the station and see if we can do some body switching?

187
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,140
Yeah.

188
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,140
Would you like us to switch your body?

189
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,140
I think we have the technology.

190
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,460
That's it.

191
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:17,380
Let's go back to the station and we'll think about the angry mob later.

192
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,380
Meow.

193
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:22,620
You guys roll up to the station and outside of the police station there is a group of

194
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,940
people holding up signs.

195
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:29,140
They're walking around in a big circle and they seem to be chanting something along the

196
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:37,020
lines of, our cops are crooks, our pigs are pricks, if we could choose they'd lose their

197
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,020
dicks.

198
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,300
Oh well shit, yikes.

199
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:42,100
If only they knew that had actually happened to one of us earlier.

200
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,340
Hey, that's not funny.

201
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:49,740
There's a sign that says, justice for Tilde B in all caps.

202
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:52,820
Another says, where is Leo Piston?

203
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:58,300
One of the protesters is just holding up a tablet with a video of Officer Pettymore firing

204
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:01,280
into the air and yelling at civilians.

205
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,940
More signs say, that's completely taken out of context.

206
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:10,740
30 people went missing in one week and they blew up Chief Cook, I say we cook up the blue.

207
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,740
Wow.

208
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,380
Are you proud of yourself for that one, Zach?

209
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:20,340
I am so proud of myself for that.

210
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,340
Who was Tilde B?

211
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:22,900
Well, that was the girl, right?

212
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,040
The one that shot the gun and disappeared.

213
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,040
That is correct.

214
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,040
Okay.

215
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,040
Oh shit.

216
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,540
The woman across the street from John Peters house's daughter.

217
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:30,540
Milgram Mitchell.

218
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,540
Milgram Mitchell.

219
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:32,540
Oh it was Milgram Mitchell.

220
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:37,420
If Maggie had been here, she would have been having press conferences and I guess assuring

221
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,220
people that we had it under control.

222
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:42,420
I guess we forgot the public relations part of our job.

223
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:45,180
Whoever has the highest humant, who is that?

224
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,180
Me.

225
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:48,520
Can you go ahead and roll humant for me?

226
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,380
That's a crit success.

227
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:53,420
Drew is so nervous right now.

228
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,660
He is fiddling with his thumbs.

229
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:58,100
He's not holding eye contact with anyone.

230
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:02,420
He's trying to avoid any conversation.

231
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:05,860
Hey Drew, what's the matter?

232
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:11,180
Well, just, you know, nervous we got this cat in here that's I guess supposed to be

233
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:15,160
the cat of another cat and there's the people inside a cat and there's cats inside people

234
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:21,980
and there was a body from old and a body from new and there's just a lot of stuff going

235
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:26,480
on right now and I'm freaking out man.

236
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,480
This is crazy.

237
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:32,100
Drew, I think maybe you should go try to calm this crowd down out there.

238
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,100
Yeah?

239
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,400
Yeah, you're a good public speaker.

240
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,760
Go ahead and roll persuade.

241
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:42,040
That's another crit success.

242
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,320
Do you think that'll help?

243
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:50,240
Oh, that can't hurt.

244
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,840
So you pull up into the parking lot and Drew hops out.

245
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,960
You guys can hear him.

246
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:06,080
Hello everyone, members of the, the established population of contention.

247
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:11,400
I am here to tell you that nothing is wrong.

248
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:19,480
Everything is fine and you're all overreacting to the truths of the universe that are real.

249
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:23,760
Drew, Drew, Drew, Drew dial it back buddy, I go and grab it.

250
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,600
What is actually happening?

251
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:34,040
I fire my gun in the air a few times to distract people from...

252
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:39,480
There are people just like taking videos with their cameras of all of this happening.

253
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,320
I'm assuming you guys dip into the police station.

254
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,320
Immediately.

255
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,160
Okay, so you all run in there.

256
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,280
Uh, Drew, that, that didn't go so well.

257
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,320
Drew, was there a mob here when you left?

258
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,240
No, I didn't, I didn't see one.

259
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:57,240
Guys, I've been kind of overwhelmed recently and I mean, Florence hasn't checked in today

260
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:03,040
at all and you know, I'd figured she'd be helping out with, I don't know, here.

261
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,120
I grab Drew by the shoulders and I look him deep in the eye and I'm like, Drew, buddy,

262
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,480
I need you to keep it together today.

263
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,480
You understand?

264
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,600
Roll human.

265
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,240
Who's Florence?

266
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,800
15.

267
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:23,440
Florence is the police officer that works alongside you guys in contention.

268
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:29,000
They typically take care of most things that are happening around the town.

269
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,200
You rolled a 15?

270
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,280
On a 40 or 50.

271
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:42,920
Okay, so he calms down and he's like, okay, well this is, this is hard and I wanted to,

272
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:48,720
you know, tell you guys over time, you know, maybe this would all kind of fade away, but

273
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,440
and he reaches over his desk and he grabs this sheet of paper.

274
00:13:53,440 --> 00:14:00,480
He hands it to you guys and it says, remember to tell the guys at the top and then it lists

275
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:08,360
off like 20 names as missing persons and roughly 100 phone calls about the animals in the water.

276
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:13,720
There's also just a section heading called complaints and it has more tallies than you

277
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,120
could possibly care to count.

278
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:21,160
The last thing on the list just says feds left a message.

279
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,160
Who left a message?

280
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,160
What did the feds say?

281
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,160
Drew?

282
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,160
Let me find it.

283
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:29,880
And he messes with the phone and you hear the voicemail come over and it's like, no

284
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:34,480
new messages, all messages have been deleted.

285
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:40,320
And he's like, oh shit, um, I don't, I don't remember exactly what it was.

286
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:46,720
I think the general gist was like, Hey, what the fuck is going on?

287
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,440
The news media, I don't know something.

288
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,560
People are, guys, people are really upset.

289
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,640
That much is apparent.

290
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,200
How did you get so bad at your job so quickly, Drew?

291
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:05,120
I've always been pretty bad at my job, but chief, don't laugh at me.

292
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,200
Chief cookie has typically kept everything together.

293
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,400
She keeps me on time.

294
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,640
She keeps me keeping up with everything.

295
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,680
She would never let it get out of hand like this.

296
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:18,440
Drew, if chief were here, how do you think she would go about assuaging the fears of

297
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,440
the public?

298
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,440
Yeah, buddy.

299
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,440
What would chief do?

300
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,440
What would chief do?

301
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,440
What would chief do?

302
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,640
I don't know.

303
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,200
We've never dealt with anything like this before.

304
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:34,280
I think the first thing chief would tell you to do is to make yourself and us and Dr. Jacobs

305
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,840
and that cat man, a nice hot cup of coffee.

306
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:41,240
We're just going to take a step back and deal with this one thing at a time.

307
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:46,040
Drew, if Florence wasn't so hilariously inept at his job, he would have kept you on that

308
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,040
list.

309
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,040
I know he would.

310
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,040
You would have been on the ball.

311
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,040
This isn't your fault.

312
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,040
This is Florence's fault.

313
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,040
Where is he?

314
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,040
Are you okay, John?

315
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,200
Yeah, I mean, because I'm being nice to you?

316
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,320
No, it's just that Florence is a woman.

317
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,320
He knows that.

318
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:02,680
Yeah, it's just a joke between me and Florence.

319
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,680
Oh, does she think it's funny?

320
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,680
You know what?

321
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,120
I'll never stop to consider that.

322
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,960
All right, well, maybe we'll ask her.

323
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,960
You're right.

324
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,960
I'll just go make some coffee.

325
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:17,000
And he runs into the back room and gets a pot going.

326
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I'm holding Doug.

327
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,880
I say, Doug, we've got the radio.

328
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,160
Is that part of the process of getting you switched?

329
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,160
Meow.

330
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,160
Okay.

331
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,160
Is it safe for me to touch it?

332
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,160
Meow.

333
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,160
Okay.

334
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:32,640
I'm going to set Doug down and go back to the lockers and get the radio out.

335
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,640
He follows you.

336
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,640
Okay.

337
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,640
The cat follows you.

338
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,880
I want to take the radio.

339
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,920
The radio has a red light showing on it.

340
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:45,080
I want to take the radio, go back to the cells, and set it on the outside of the cells.

341
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,080
Okay.

342
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,520
Mildred assuming is there.

343
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,520
Dr. Marie Jacobs.

344
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,520
Oh, fuck yeah.

345
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,040
Dr. Marie Jacobs.

346
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,320
Doc, somebody here you may or may not be happy to see.

347
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,120
She's asleep and she kind of wakes up.

348
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,600
I kind of gesture toward the kitten.

349
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,600
Ah!

350
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,600
Oh.

351
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,720
So he made it alive, did he?

352
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,920
I just assumed the tar would have gotten him by now.

353
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,920
The tar?

354
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,920
Whatever.

355
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,920
Is that what you call the goo?

356
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,920
We've been calling it goo.

357
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,920
Have we?

358
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,920
We call it goo, right?

359
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,920
I think we call it goo.

360
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,960
I just had never heard anybody refer to it other than us.

361
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,960
Yeah.

362
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,960
How do you know about the goo?

363
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,560
I fear I've spoken out of turn.

364
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,560
What are you doing?

365
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,000
Well, we're going to put your husband back in his body.

366
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
No.

367
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Yeah.

368
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
No.

369
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Ma'am, I know.

370
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Why don't you want that to happen?

371
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I want to go home.

372
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,680
You should just let me go home with the man that I have now.

373
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:37,080
We've kind of got to let your husband go home from this cat's body.

374
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,360
You are talking like a...

375
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,560
We'll get him switched and you can go home.

376
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,560
Done.

377
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,560
You don't have to let him come with you.

378
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:47,620
It seems like this body switch has exposed some serious problems in your relationship

379
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:49,720
and maybe you two have a lot to work out, you know?

380
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,980
He can get a hotel, but he does need his body back, doctor.

381
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:53,980
Can I have the radio?

382
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:54,980
No.

383
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:55,980
No.

384
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,400
Why would you even think that was a possibility?

385
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,400
Why?

386
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,400
I bought the radio.

387
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,400
Did you want to do that to another man and cat?

388
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,400
No.

389
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,400
I wanted to do it to the same ones.

390
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,600
Ma'am, we can't let you...

391
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:10,540
I don't think there's a law on the books, but I know you can't radio your husband into

392
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:13,440
a cat and keep him trapped there for the rest of his life.

393
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,560
Like you just said, there's nothing on the books.

394
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,520
Also, how's it going to work?

395
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,200
Cats die within 15 years, 20 years.

396
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,200
I haven't thought about it that much.

397
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,200
How old's your cat?

398
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,200
You know?

399
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,760
And then, will the cat's brain die in your husband's body as he just gets older?

400
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,960
You haven't thought about this at all, man.

401
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,880
I certainly don't know the rules.

402
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,560
The rules are that you can't do this.

403
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:37,520
Well, I meant the rules of how long things would take to die within other bodies and

404
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,520
what have you.

405
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:42,920
I get the keys and open up the cell, get the husband out, and keep her in there and lock

406
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,920
it back.

407
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,920
Yeah.

408
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,920
That can go off without much of a head show.

409
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,920
What's he wearing?

410
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,920
He's wearing like...

411
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,560
He was in his underwear, and they were like SpongeBob underwear or something like that?

412
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,160
Or maybe a cartoon cat?

413
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,480
I hope it was a cartoon cat.

414
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,760
I can't remember now.

415
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,760
Underwear foreshadowing.

416
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,760
Pepe Le Pew.

417
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,760
Pepe Le Pew.

418
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:03,580
He also has a black collar around his neck, and he's got dried blood kind of still around

419
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:06,280
his mouth, but he's licked everything else clean.

420
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:15,580
I look at Doug, and I say, Doug, if he turns on the radio, will that do it?

421
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:18,200
The cat thinks for a second before saying, meow.

422
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,620
Will that have unintended consequences, perhaps?

423
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,280
There's only one way to find out.

424
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,080
I don't trust this cat.

425
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,080
Roll cat intelligence.

426
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,840
I don't want to turn into a cat standing here.

427
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,840
I don't either.

428
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:33,960
I think, okay, I think we need to approach Dr. Jacobs with some kind of deal.

429
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:37,160
We're going to have to try to persuade her to tell us how this happened and how this

430
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,160
worked.

431
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,240
Or we'll keep her locked here forever.

432
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,240
That's pretty good.

433
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,280
Yeah, hey, 30 people are missing in contention.

434
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,760
Nobody's going to miss one more.

435
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,840
We can go that route with it.

436
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,000
We can go pretty dark, or we can...

437
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,620
I wouldn't go that route.

438
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,120
You're not...

439
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,720
Shut up, Dr. Jacobs.

440
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,040
30 people disappeared in contention.

441
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,840
It would be easy for one more to go missing.

442
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,720
Now we're trying to think of how we're going to convince you.

443
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,720
I wouldn't.

444
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,720
I wouldn't convince me like that.

445
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,720
Shut up.

446
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,320
30 people have gone missing in contention.

447
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,320
Hey, Doc, how did this happen the first time?

448
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,320
It just happened.

449
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,320
I don't know.

450
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,320
Doc, how'd it happen?

451
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,320
What did the goo do?

452
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,120
The goo just ran out.

453
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,840
Followed the cat.

454
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:15,840
Your husband or...

455
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,920
Well, yeah, I guess he was a cat then.

456
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,440
Ma'am, we will let you free right now.

457
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,440
Okay.

458
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,040
With your cat body, husband.

459
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,160
Or with your man body cat.

460
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,160
Okay.

461
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,160
If you tell us how it happened.

462
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,160
Wait, no, that...

463
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,640
No, because if I tell you how it happened, you're just going to use it.

464
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,640
I promise I won't do that.

465
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,120
No, we're really scared to use it.

466
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,040
We don't want to be a cat, so just tell us.

467
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,680
That way we know to not use it.

468
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:39,080
Yeah, that way we know how to not do that.

469
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,200
Okay, which one of you has a better persuade?

470
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,200
I have a 70.

471
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,200
I have a 60.

472
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,440
All right, roll it up, Keith.

473
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,760
A 70 on a 70.

474
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,200
Oh, that's a success.

475
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,200
Yes.

476
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,200
Okay.

477
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,200
All right, tell us how it happened.

478
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,680
If you promise that I get to leave with Salem.

479
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,680
Of course, we promise.

480
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,680
In this...

481
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,680
Yeah, yeah, we promise.

482
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,680
Okay.

483
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,720
I turned it on and left the room.

484
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,480
With the cat and the man in there?

485
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,480
Yeah.

486
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,480
What station?

487
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,480
NPR.

488
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,480
Okay.

489
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,120
Uh, gross, first of all.

490
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,520
I didn't know they let you listen to that in contingent.

491
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,520
It's national.

492
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,520
Well, they got some good stories on there, Jon.

493
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,520
I mean...

494
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,520
Clark.

495
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,520
Okay, so...

496
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:26,600
Let's put him and the cat in a room together and turn that radio on and leave.

497
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,080
Do you believe her?

498
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,080
I do.

499
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,600
I think it's hilarious she believed us.

500
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,920
Clark, I rolled a 70 on my persuade.

501
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,920
Sometimes you just speak in mysteries, Keith.

502
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,080
I mean, what can it hurt?

503
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,320
Turn into a cat.

504
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,320
I'll do it.

505
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,320
Okay.

506
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,320
All right.

507
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,320
Okay.

508
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,320
I pat him on the back.

509
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,320
Thanks for taking this one, man.

510
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:53,440
I go into the solitary confinement cell that we have, right?

511
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,440
Probably not.

512
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,440
Oh, you can do the interrogation room?

513
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,680
Yeah, the interrogation room.

514
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,680
Perfect.

515
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:01,200
I bring the cat and Doug's body into the interrogation room.

516
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,560
Me and you are on the other side of the two-way mirror.

517
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,560
Yep.

518
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:08,680
Clark, Clark, either way, this could go real good for us.

519
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:14,920
So I'm gonna put Doug's human body in handcuffs, just, you know.

520
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,920
Sure.

521
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,920
Oh, wait, fuck.

522
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,920
Oh, sorry.

523
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,760
We can also check with the cat if that what she just told us is how it happened.

524
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,760
Oh, shit.

525
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,760
Yeah.

526
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,440
I've beeped in through the intercom on the two-way mirror.

527
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,440
Hey, cat.

528
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,760
Is what she said earlier what happened?

529
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,760
Meow.

530
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,760
Cool.

531
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,760
Cool.

532
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,760
Okay.

533
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:33,560
So Doug, I need you to sit on the table and then I'm gonna have your body sit right here.

534
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,160
Do we have any cat treats we can distract the body with?

535
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,560
I had a toy at one point.

536
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:41,360
I run out to my desk real quick, grab it out of the drawer.

537
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,800
I come into the interrogation room and I just kind of crack the door open and toss it in

538
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,800
and close it real quick.

539
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,680
Then I get back behind the two-way mirror.

540
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:53,520
I grab the cat toy and dangle it in front of Doug's face, Doug, the human body face.

541
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,520
Salem.

542
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,520
Salem's face.

543
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,360
And then I put it on the table in front of him and then I've got the radio.

544
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,360
It's a big radio.

545
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,360
Like...

546
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,360
He's dragged it into the corner.

547
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,360
How, like...

548
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,360
You can...

549
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,360
Like one of those big old, like...

550
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,360
Yeah, it's big.

551
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,200
Like you would be able to carry it, but it would, it would be a lug.

552
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,200
Yeah, it's awkward.

553
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,200
Okay.

554
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,200
I do that.

555
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,200
Put it in the room.

556
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,200
What light is on?

557
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,200
Red.

558
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,840
If I press buttons on it, does anything change?

559
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,840
Or turn it into not dials?

560
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,840
I peep the intercom.

561
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,840
Uh, Keith, do you plug it in?

562
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,840
I plug it in.

563
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:25,840
Red.

564
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,840
Turn it to NPR.

565
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,840
I turn it to NPR.

566
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,840
91.1.

567
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:31,840
Red.

568
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,840
I turn it to literally every station.

569
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,840
Red.

570
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,840
Put the cat on there.

571
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:40,840
I'm gonna just leave both these guys in the room for a second and leave.

572
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:41,840
What do you think, Keith?

573
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,840
I don't know what to do.

574
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,760
Do you guys have any thoughts?

575
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,760
The light's just red.

576
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,160
The radio's on, though, right?

577
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,160
Just left it on?

578
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,160
It's on, yeah.

579
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,680
I turned it on and pressed all the buttons, so.

580
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,680
We got shit to do.

581
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:55,520
Let's leave them in here if we fire our eyes and see if we come back with them switched.

582
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,680
Could work.

583
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:00,160
What if they switch and re-switch several times, though, and they're trapped in there?

584
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,160
We could just ask Doug and see if it happened.

585
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,160
Some kind of hell.

586
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,800
You know, once we get back, we can say, hey, did you switch and switch back?

587
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,200
Like some kind of hell.

588
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,480
Yeah, you know, this is one of the least of my concerns at this point right now, honestly.

589
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,480
We found Doug.

590
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,880
Yeah, there were a lot of protesters outside, and they got angry with a bunch of hornets

591
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,320
when I shot those bullets off, so.

592
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,320
Should we shoot at them?

593
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,320
No.

594
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,560
No, I think that would only exacerbate things.

595
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,880
Okay, how do we deal with this, then?

596
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,520
God, if only Maggie was here.

597
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,520
With the camera.

598
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,120
Can you remember anything we did that made those lights turn on?

599
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:33,560
The best of my recollection, every time something really fucking scary was about to happen,

600
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,560
they turned on.

601
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,920
Tell me a scary story.

602
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:40,560
Maybe we lock them up in a cruiser, take them with us, and any time we, you know, feel the

603
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:43,360
hair tingle stand up on the back of our necks, we can.

604
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,080
What if Doug's body runs away, though?

605
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,440
Oh, we got that toy.

606
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,440
Oh, what if we-

607
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,440
No, I don't.

608
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,440
That's not letting it work.

609
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,440
What if we try to get the doctor to do it?

610
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,440
She probably won't do it, though.

611
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,440
She won't do it.

612
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,160
What if we tell her we're gonna, I don't know, threaten her to-

613
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:58,440
Oh, hey, let's go ask her how, what color the light was and how, what the circumstances

614
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,440
were that it turned on.

615
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,440
There we go.

616
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,440
I go back to the doctor.

617
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,280
So tell me more about the night this happened.

618
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,920
Didn't work, did it?

619
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,160
I saw you bring that radio out here.

620
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,920
I saw the light was red.

621
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,680
Was the light not red when, uh-

622
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:18,640
The light was green when I used it, and I would imagine that it won't work again until

623
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,120
the light is green once again.

624
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,680
Do you know how to get the light to turn green?

625
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,680
No.

626
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:28,440
You said something that stuck in my craw, and I can't remember what it was, but it was

627
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,640
about the tar.

628
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,480
Joe, what's in your craw, Joe?

629
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,480
Spit it out.

630
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,480
In real life, I swear there was something about the ooze being near the radio.

631
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,120
Well, cause no ooze radio.

632
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,120
There was ooze coming out of the camera.

633
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,520
Remember the last time we took a picture?

634
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,520
It came out of the picture.

635
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,400
It came out of the picture?

636
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,000
Yeah, as I was holding it, it came out of the picture onto my hands.

637
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Or I was holding it from the camera.

638
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
So-

639
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
It was dripping from both.

640
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Yeah.

641
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,640
I don't know what to do.

642
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,640
Yeah, I think you're right.

643
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:58,000
Maybe just leave it on and see what happens when we get back some time later.

644
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I don't know.

645
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
I don't know if we should leave it on.

646
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,720
Maybe we should, cause what, I mean, actually the potential consequences of that are-

647
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,040
Yeah, but I mean, they're kind of just on all the time though, right?

648
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:09,960
Radios?

649
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,760
I mean, this isn't just a radio though.

650
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:16,840
Right, but it seems like these devices have to be activated once the green light is on.

651
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,600
So we should turn the radio off.

652
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,280
We have to take the picture to get it to go.

653
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,280
Yeah, that's true.

654
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:24,080
I think we lock them all up in that cell.

655
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,080
I'm sorry.

656
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,080
This is Thomas speaking.

657
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,120
This is John speaking.

658
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,040
I think we should all lock them up in that cell and let them spend some quality time

659
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,040
with each other.

660
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:37,080
And Dr. Jakes seems to fucking hate that guy and I'm not a big fan of hers right now cause

661
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,600
she's not a whole lot of help.

662
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:42,360
Maybe we'll come back and they're like screaming and she's like, meow, meow.

663
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:46,040
We should probably keep them in the interrogation room because the cat could probably get out

664
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,040
of it.

665
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,320
No, I think the cat can just have free.

666
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,320
I like that cat.

667
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,320
That's true.

668
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,320
I want the cat.

669
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,320
I want Doug.

670
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,320
Doug.

671
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,320
His name is Doug.

672
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,320
His name is Doug.

673
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,320
I want Doug to not be stuck with her.

674
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,760
I think she might kill him.

675
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,760
I think you're right.

676
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,760
That's true.

677
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,760
I think we should, yeah.

678
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:05,240
Okay, so let's lock the cat man back up and then put the radio back in the-

679
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,880
Let's put the cat man in a different cell so she can't be by it.

680
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:10,040
Give him a little time apart to think about things.

681
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,040
I like that.

682
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:15,160
You can't, you can't fuck your cat man while we're gone, Dr. Jacobs.

683
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,160
Yeah.

684
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,440
Okay, so where is everything?

685
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,520
You're letting Doug come with you guys.

686
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:23,440
I think Doug was just going to have free rein at the station, right?

687
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,440
Yeah.

688
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,440
Gotcha.

689
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,440
Doug can have free rein at the station.

690
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,440
He could be our sidekick.

691
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,920
Doug, do you want to be our sidekick?

692
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,920
Meow, meow.

693
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,920
Yeah.

694
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:34,000
So Doug, you can run around the station until we get back.

695
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,960
Oh, hey Doug, do you know anything about what's going on at the mill?

696
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,240
Anything about the ooze?

697
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,440
What happened to the chief?

698
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,640
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.

699
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,760
What's going on with the ooze?

700
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,760
Meow.

701
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,760
Oh yeah.

702
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:52,080
And then the cat jumps up on the table, it like bows a little bit and then it moves its

703
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:58,480
head up and then it falls on its back and it like widens its eyes really big and starts

704
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:03,420
moving its paws around and then it flips back over on top of itself and then it looks right

705
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:08,380
behind it and it like freaks out and jumps up in the air and then it starts running,

706
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:09,380
right?

707
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:15,340
And then it runs over to the sink in the kitchen that you guys have in the station and it like

708
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:16,800
paws at the water.

709
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,380
The ooze is afraid of water?

710
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:19,380
Meow.

711
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:20,380
Boom.

712
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,380
That's why the animals are in the creek.

713
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:23,100
The ooze is killed by water.

714
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,100
Meow, meow.

715
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,100
Meow, meow.

716
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:28,460
We don't know, but the ooze does not lack the water.

717
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:29,460
Meow.

718
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:33,180
So we're making a run to Walmart and getting a bunch of super soakers.

719
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:34,940
Water balloons.

720
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:35,940
Oh my God.

721
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:36,940
Those kiddie pool.

722
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:40,120
Those guys are such assholes, but maybe we have to call the contention fire department.

723
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:43,340
Those pricks, every time they win softball, they're just dicks.

724
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:49,260
We should issue like an announcement to the city to stay in your bathtub or a pool or

725
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:53,180
you'll disappear.

726
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,860
Or your life is forfeit.

727
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:57,980
They might help with these angry mobs.

728
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:01,820
No, we can't, we don't have anything we can...

729
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:02,820
Sorry.

730
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:08,180
You're just like crunching chips and like moving the bag around.

731
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,180
It's impossible.

732
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:16,980
Keith, I don't know how you can eat those chips at a time like this.

733
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:20,020
This feels like we're moving towards a final game plan.

734
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,020
Really?

735
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,020
They're about to go bad.

736
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,740
The fact that like...

737
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:24,740
Keith would be eating chips.

738
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:27,700
That's exactly what I was just thinking.

739
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:30,460
Of course you guys are talking like, oh, it's a cat.

740
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:31,460
Is it afraid of water?

741
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:37,460
And you look back and Keith's just like, ah, no, no, no, that's faffenating.

742
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:39,660
He's trying to fit into those pants.

743
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:40,660
Oh yeah.

744
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:43,260
Yeah, so what do we do with this information?

745
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,260
Doug is the ooze.

746
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:47,020
Do you know if the ooze has an intelligence?

747
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:48,020
My mom, my mom, my mom.

748
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,820
Should we go to the mill?

749
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:50,820
Or James's.

750
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:51,820
Oh yeah.

751
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:55,700
That's where a bunch of shit went down at the last time we were together.

752
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:59,140
Wait, what about John Peter's secret room or was it James's secret room?

753
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:00,140
It was James's.

754
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:01,140
Oh, it was James's, yeah.

755
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:05,500
It was James's house, found weird writing in blood and guns all around.

756
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,500
Let's go there.

757
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,500
I didn't write down secret room in particular.

758
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,580
I think it was just that the guy went in there and saw it all.

759
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:10,580
It was James.

760
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:11,900
He worked at the mill.

761
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:15,860
He was last seen going into Maggie Cook's house.

762
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:16,860
Which one was he?

763
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:19,460
The one who ate his own foot or the chief's foot or the one who...

764
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:22,020
He was first seen with a vacuum in his front yard.

765
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,020
Yeah.

766
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:24,020
Oh, he's the galoshes guy.

767
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,020
Yep.

768
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,020
Already.

769
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:28,860
And then he was the one with the bullet in his head sitting at the dinner table.

770
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:29,860
Yeah.

771
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:30,860
Okay.

772
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:31,860
It was James's.

773
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:32,860
Doug, can you hold down the fort?

774
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:33,860
Meow.

775
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:34,860
Okay.

776
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:35,860
We could leave him a little tray of water and...

777
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:41,220
By the way, this whole time Drew is just like staring at this cat with his big ass gums

778
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:42,220
hanging out.

779
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,220
Oh, oh, oh.

780
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,220
That's stupid for me.

781
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:45,220
So rude.

782
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,220
Hey, Drew, this is Doug.

783
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,220
Doug, Drew.

784
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,220
Meow.

785
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:49,340
And Drew's just like, hi.

786
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:52,260
His voice gets normal for a second.

787
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:57,280
Drew, I know you've been through a lot today and so have we.

788
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:01,520
So just look after this cat and make sure nothing happens to it, would you?

789
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:02,520
Just trust us on this.

790
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,800
I mean, have we steered you wrong yet?

791
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:04,960
I will.

792
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,160
Thank you for trusting me, Clark.

793
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,160
You got it, bud.

794
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,160
I pat him on the back.

795
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,840
Hey, Drew, what's our secret word?

796
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,840
Bubble gum tree.

797
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:13,840
Bubble gum tree.

798
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:14,840
Yeah, bubble gum tree.

799
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,840
You could have just told that to the clones.

800
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,320
Oh, next time.

801
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,320
I'll get it next time.

802
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,200
And he pulls out his phone and your phone starts ringing.

803
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,200
My phone starts ringing?

804
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,200
And he's like, oh, okay, good.

805
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,200
It's you.

806
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,200
I answer him, bubble gum tree.

807
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,200
You're so funny, John.

808
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,200
Drew.

809
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,880
Okay, let's go to James's.

810
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:37,600
On your way to James the millworker's house, it's in the suburbs.

811
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:42,800
And on your way there, looking up into the sky on this chilly moonlit night, you see

812
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:47,640
a crop duster flying with sparkly lights all over the wings and tail.

813
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:56,360
And behind it is a massive banner that reads in bright lights, contention PD equals imbeciles.

814
00:31:56,360 --> 00:32:00,760
I have never seen a protest get this fancy.

815
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,400
I've never seen contention united in such a way.

816
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,400
I know.

817
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:08,240
It would be heartwarming if it wasn't a united hate of us.

818
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,560
Fuck them.

819
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,560
That's impressive.

820
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,560
That's impressive, though.

821
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,760
I got to give it up to whoever ordered that plane.

822
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,320
Can I call Mr. Klinker?

823
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,320
Is it Harry?

824
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,400
Can I call Harry real quick?

825
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:24,800
The phone rings until you think that it's going to go to voicemail, and then it clicks

826
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,800
and you hear.

827
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,800
Clark.

828
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,800
Hey.

829
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,800
Hey, Harry.

830
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,800
It's Clark.

831
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,800
How you doing?

832
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,800
I'm well.

833
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:35,640
You, uh, you seen all that rabble outside?

834
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,640
People seem pretty mad at us.

835
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,640
You know about that?

836
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,640
Yeah.

837
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,360
I was hoping you might be able to put out the good word amongst the patrons there that

838
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,560
maybe we're onto something here and have some patience for us.

839
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,560
Hey, Officer Bishop.

840
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:49,440
You know, uh, Klinker's is always a safe place for you and your kind.

841
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,440
I dig it.

842
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,440
I was just...

843
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,800
I met you and, uh, the other officers.

844
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:54,800
Not bishops.

845
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,800
Oh.

846
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,800
I hate the church.

847
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,080
I knew what you meant, Harry.

848
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,080
I thank you for that.

849
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:04,200
I just, I just was hoping that maybe if anybody came in there and they were grumbling about

850
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,760
all the stupid pigs and blah, blah, blah, you might tell them that we're just some good

851
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:11,440
old friends of yours and that you trust us and that maybe...

852
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:15,400
Gary and I have been trying to put out the word that you boys are just trying your hardest

853
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,400
and, uh...

854
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,400
I appreciate that.

855
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:21,440
I've got an idea about another phone call we could make because I'm, I'm, this is, this

856
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,440
seems to have been...

857
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,440
Oh, are we still on the call?

858
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,440
Sorry, John was talking.

859
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,440
Sorry.

860
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,440
Uh, hey Harry.

861
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,440
Hey.

862
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,440
Tell Harry, hey.

863
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,440
Hey, John.

864
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,440
I mean, Clark.

865
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,440
Tell Harry I say hi.

866
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,440
How long have we been playing this game?

867
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,440
Uh...

868
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,440
Three days.

869
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:40,440
Harry, I'm glad to hear that.

870
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:48,440
I just, uh, just wanted to touch base with you and make sure that you knew we were doing

871
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,440
what we can to help out the town.

872
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,440
I appreciate that, Clark.

873
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,440
All right, good talking.

874
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,440
Bye.

875
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,940
I think maybe we should make one of those calls to the pastor too.

876
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:00,240
That's not me though, because I don't think he likes me that much.

877
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,560
That's exactly what I was about to say, you ideal steamed son of a bitch.

878
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,280
Well, he said it earlier.

879
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,280
He did.

880
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,280
Really?

881
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,280
Yeah.

882
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,280
Oh, well.

883
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,280
Okay, edit that part out.

884
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:13,280
Edit that part out, edit out the part when he said it earlier.

885
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,280
Yeah.

886
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,280
Hey guys, I think we should call the pastor.

887
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:19,280
Just edit everything out until we're at the...

888
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,280
Good idea, John.

889
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:26,280
Yeah, that podcast was fine until that weird episode just started with him yelling.

890
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:29,280
Yeah, Thomas was just yelling at everybody.

891
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,280
Yeah, call the pastor.

892
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,280
Oh, is it staying?

893
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,280
Call the pastor.

894
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,280
Okay, anyway.

895
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,280
Who's calling the pastor?

896
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,280
I'll call the...

897
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,280
Yeah, Keith shouldn't call the pastor.

898
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,280
No.

899
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,280
I'll call the pastor.

900
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,280
Bring, bring.

901
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,280
Bring, bring.

902
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:46,280
When you call his office and when you call his home, both calls go to voicemail.

903
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:49,280
Uh, hey, pastor.

904
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:54,280
Uh, this is John Lee Pettymore III from Contention PD.

905
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:58,280
Uh, just wanted to talk to you when you have a moment.

906
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:02,280
Please give us a call back regarding these angry mobs.

907
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,280
Thank you.

908
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,280
Bye.

909
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,280
Have a blessed day.

910
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,280
That was good.

911
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:10,280
Anyway, I do think that the pastor organized all this trouble against us because he seems

912
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,280
like he can get this town going.

913
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:18,280
He's got the resources and Keith did so horribly insult him and steal his helmet.

914
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,280
Let's go to James' house.

915
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,280
Alright, let's take a break real quick.

916
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:43,280
No, my penis is bigger than an eighth of an inch.

917
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,280
I'm pretty sure.

918
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,280
I don't think it would even be...

919
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,280
Prove it.

920
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,280
Yeah, prove it.

921
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:57,280
He thought so hard about showing us his dick for a bit.

922
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,280
Just ask around.

923
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:03,280
I feel like there was a 40% chance we almost saw Luke's dick there.

924
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:07,280
If I had a couple more schlitzes in me.

925
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,280
Or a couple more inches.

926
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:13,280
Okay, so you guys are...

927
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,280
Actually, the only reason I have back problems is...

928
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:20,280
Because of my massive tongue.

929
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:23,280
Dude, you know how I make my penis eight inches long?

930
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,280
I fold it in half.

931
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,280
Gross.

932
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,280
That would mean I have a flaccid 16 inch penis.

933
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:33,280
Horribly way too long.

934
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:37,280
I'm not going to try right now, but I don't think even totally soft I could fold my penis

935
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,280
in half.

936
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:41,280
Oh, well then my penis is bigger than yours.

937
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:45,280
No, I just mean I don't think it would fold back on itself that much.

938
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,280
I don't think it's pliable enough to...

939
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,280
I think mine would.

940
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:51,280
Yeah, I can do that.

941
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,280
I can definitely do that.

942
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,280
Can you guys go wash your hands?

943
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,280
I can do it.

944
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,280
I can do it.

945
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,280
I folded my penis in half.

946
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,280
Okay.

947
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,280
I took a shower right before I came over here.

948
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,280
It was actually really easy.

949
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,280
I guess a soft dick is very soft.

950
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,280
Zach, I didn't fold my penis in half.

951
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,280
Thank you.

952
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,280
Do it.

953
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:08,280
I like to tie mine in a ribbon.

954
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:12,280
So, your characters are having this conversation after...

955
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:17,280
It's a good thing Clark didn't because he would have taken his hands off the wheel.

956
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,280
Hey, I'm driving it, aren't I?

957
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,280
It's my fucking cruiser.

958
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,280
Well, we're in your cruiser.

959
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,280
I don't know if you're driving.

960
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,280
I think he's driving.

961
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,280
Yeah, I think I said that I was.

962
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,280
I was sick of you.

963
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,280
Are you driving?

964
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,280
Okay.

965
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,280
Okay.

966
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,280
And you guys are having this conversation.

967
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:36,280
Clark just wrapped up a phone call and then John called the pastor twice and left a message.

968
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:40,280
Guys, I don't think we can calm down this mob.

969
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,280
We can only incite this mob.

970
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:45,280
Yeah, well then what do we do?

971
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:49,280
The best thing we can do is solve this case.

972
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,280
I hadn't even thought about doing that.

973
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:57,280
If we get this case cracked, get these people found, or at least some answers for the good

974
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,280
folks at contention, I think that'll get them out of the streets.

975
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,280
I agree.

976
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,280
We can only push forward at this point.

977
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:07,280
Also, we need to get Florence on the phones calling everybody who called about a lost

978
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,280
pet and telling them to get their ass down to the creek.

979
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,280
And also, fuck, we need to...

980
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,280
You know what?

981
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,280
Okay.

982
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,280
Hold up.

983
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:20,280
We talked a little bit earlier about telling everybody to get into a bathtub full of water.

984
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,280
Oh shit, we need the feds.

985
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,280
Yeah, we need to get like a...

986
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,280
Because they don't trust our authority right now.

987
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:29,280
But if the feds came to contention or at least issued some kind of order...

988
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:33,280
If we could do like an emergency broadcast system...

989
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,280
And it would.

990
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,280
I mean, people do need to be in their bathtubs or in the creek.

991
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:39,280
They could get in the creek with the animals and have a little animal party.

992
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,280
Oh shit, it's December though.

993
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,280
It's starting to turn to...

994
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:45,280
You think it's going to get pretty cold in these next couple days.

995
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,280
How about this?

996
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:53,280
Let's see if we have some funds put back to buy big kiddie pools for contention.

997
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,280
Keith, let me stop you right there.

998
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,280
We don't have any funds allocated for that.

999
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,280
That is not in the budget.

1000
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:01,280
I know how we can get some funds.

1001
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,280
What you thinking?

1002
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:06,280
We do have a massive stash of...

1003
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,280
Guns.

1004
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,280
And white gold, if you know what I'm talking about.

1005
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,280
Keith!

1006
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,280
We're police.

1007
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,280
With no money.

1008
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,280
I can't believe you would suggest such a thing.

1009
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,280
I'm shutting down conversation on this right now, Keith.

1010
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,280
I'm not comfortable with this.

1011
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:24,280
More people will die in contention than will die from cocaine overdose.

1012
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:29,280
So we need to not be worrying about selling cocaine tonight and we need to be solving this case.

1013
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,280
If you say so.

1014
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,280
I do say so.

1015
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,280
Speaking of which, I pull a little baggie out of my pocket and...

1016
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,280
Well, okay, pass that over here.

1017
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,280
Roll a D6.

1018
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,280
Oh my god, guys, I haven't had a joint in like three days.

1019
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,280
Three hours.

1020
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,280
Alright, you're good for three more hours.

1021
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,280
You won't have the negative 20 anymore.

1022
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,280
Do I get a bonus if I take a bump?

1023
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,280
Or what's if John Lee Pettymore is gonna take a bump?

1024
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,280
But I don't know.

1025
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,280
Yeah, you get an actual bonus.

1026
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:57,280
Keith, because he's only at one willpower, his cocaine habit just negates.

1027
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,280
My minus 20.

1028
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,280
So yeah, I toss the baggie over to you.

1029
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:03,280
Maybe I should get a malice to charm though or something.

1030
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,280
That guy never shuts up.

1031
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:07,280
He's just talking and talking and talking.

1032
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,280
Is he on cocaine?

1033
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,280
Four.

1034
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,280
Alright, get four willpower back.

1035
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,280
Oh, that actually really...

1036
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,280
I forgot how down on willpower it was.

1037
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,280
That helps a lot.

1038
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,280
I went from six to eight.

1039
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,280
Oh, wait.

1040
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,280
I don't know.

1041
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,280
I went from six to ten.

1042
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,280
I'm back up to one, correct?

1043
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,280
That is correct.

1044
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,280
Math.

1045
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,280
Oh, I did not...

1046
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,280
Oh, and then I regain to two hit points, right?

1047
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,280
Yeah, you should be at 20 health.

1048
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,280
But I got one willpower.

1049
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,280
Cool.

1050
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,280
Clark.

1051
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,280
I'm stink eyeing the hell out of him from the backseat.

1052
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,280
Thank you.

1053
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,280
I don't say anything though.

1054
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,280
Okay.

1055
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,280
Because me and Keith already had our peace on that.

1056
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:42,280
So you guys are doing cocaine and Clark is stink eyeing you.

1057
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,880
Not speaking a word.

1058
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:44,880
As you guys pull up...

1059
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:48,280
I'm probably even doing some real passive aggressive...

1060
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,280
Bishop.

1061
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,280
Rolling eyes real hard.

1062
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,280
Hey, Bishop.

1063
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,280
Look at me, man.

1064
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,280
Tonight...

1065
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,280
Reluctantly kind of shifting on it.

1066
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:57,280
Tonight could be the last night of any of our lives.

1067
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,280
And there is an evil loose in contention.

1068
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:03,280
I mean, it's not the time for procedure, buddy.

1069
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,280
You know what?

1070
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:08,360
And this might be your argument and I can predict it and I'm on cocaine, but maybe now

1071
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:15,480
is exactly the time for procedure.

1072
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:18,680
The cocaine is going to John Lee Pennymore's head.

1073
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:19,680
Role playing's hard.

1074
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,960
I roll down my window.

1075
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,360
Just listen to J.J.

1076
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,360
Kale, buddy.

1077
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:36,800
And that plays as we pull up to James' house.

1078
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:42,880
Clark, just kick back and enjoy the ride, buddy, because life's not a guarantee.

1079
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:48,840
I look back at Clark, give him a kind of an I'm sorry look and then a wink and then sirens

1080
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,160
on speeding as fast as I can.

1081
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:54,720
Down the street that the house is on, where are you parking?

1082
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:58,760
In the yard.

1083
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,760
Describe it.

1084
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:05,280
I go into the driveway at an angle and just keep going all the way up to where the passenger

1085
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:11,240
door of the police cruiser is like you need to take a step and a half to get into the

1086
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,440
front door.

1087
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:17,040
I roll out of my door as the car is still moving a little bit and I preemptively fire

1088
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:21,000
two shots in the air to disperse any potential crowds.

1089
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,120
Okay, sounds good.

1090
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:27,440
People who actually do cocaine are like, you guys.

1091
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:33,640
The car pulls up to a very rough stop right in front of the front door.

1092
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:36,200
Everyone rolls out, fires two shots in the air.

1093
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,440
Oh, whoa, John, what the fuck?

1094
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:40,200
We're rolling, baby.

1095
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:44,600
Let's fucking survey the neighborhood.

1096
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,760
Like any reaction?

1097
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:49,360
Cocaine.

1098
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:53,360
As you look about the neighborhood, go ahead and roll search for me.

1099
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:56,760
Uh, fail, 98 on a 20.

1100
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,520
Uh, yeah, no, neighborhood is quiet.

1101
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:01,680
Dude, Keith and I get dope alertness bonuses.

1102
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,240
I probably just am normal.

1103
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:05,360
Keith gets a negative 20 to all roles.

1104
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:06,360
Gotcha.

1105
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:11,760
He gets to stand, he gets to stand up and talk and move around and stuff.

1106
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,480
I'm not at negative 20 still am I?

1107
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:14,480
Oh, that's correct.

1108
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:15,480
You're no longer.

1109
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:16,480
Because I did drugs.

1110
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,480
I am so sorry.

1111
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,760
But you're definitely not at a bonus.

1112
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:28,600
And the front door opens and you see an old man, a slightly bent over wearing a fancy

1113
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,280
blue three piece suit.

1114
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:31,280
Whoa man.

1115
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,520
I got to point my gun right at him.

1116
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,240
What are you doing in this guy's house?

1117
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:38,240
Answer right now.

1118
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:44,800
How do you know James?

1119
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,440
I shouldn't have told you his name, that gave you a valuable clue if you were trying to

1120
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:49,440
lie to us.

1121
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:50,440
I'm the...

1122
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:54,140
And he's having a hard time saying it because you got a gun pointed at him and he's a terrified

1123
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:55,140
old man.

1124
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:57,200
I don't see any threat so I raise the gun.

1125
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:01,400
As soon as you raise it, he spits out, I'm the estate salesman.

1126
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,880
Oh, hey buddy.

1127
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:06,320
Hey guys, he called us.

1128
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:07,320
Yeah, I remember.

1129
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:08,320
Oh.

1130
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:09,520
We were just goofing with you.

1131
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:10,680
Yeah, just new boot goofing.

1132
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:13,920
Oh, that was a very terrible joke.

1133
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:16,160
And you walk up to him, he is...

1134
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,520
We're cops, not comedians.

1135
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:22,920
He's holding a cane that has a big tooth on the top where he's holding it.

1136
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:23,920
Like a fake tooth or a...

1137
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:27,400
A big fake tooth, like a giant that fits his entire fist.

1138
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:28,880
Right, like a just molar.

1139
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:32,360
Yeah, it's huge and it's on top of his cane and he...

1140
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:34,360
Hey buddy, what's up with your tooth cane?

1141
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:38,840
Oh, well, my name is Randy Angst.

1142
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:40,040
And he hands you a card.

1143
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:41,600
I don't see how that...

1144
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:42,600
Yeah, I don't...

1145
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:51,560
Randy Angst, dentist, estate salesman, founder of the Contention Historical Society, lover.

1146
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:53,120
That last one's important.

1147
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:54,720
Are you hitting on us?

1148
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,360
I bet you get a lot of play.

1149
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,280
Then it's got his phone number and his email.

1150
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,280
This is his email.

1151
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,120
Hey guys, I think the founder of the Contention Historical Society might be able to give us

1152
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:03,120
some clues.

1153
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:04,440
Do we still have those pictures?

1154
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:05,440
Or do we have...

1155
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:06,440
Pictures of what?

1156
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:07,520
I'm talking to Zach.

1157
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:08,520
This is Thomas.

1158
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:09,520
I'm not Zach.

1159
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:10,520
I'm Randy.

1160
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:11,520
I'm sorry, Randy.

1161
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:12,520
I'm on a lot of cocaine.

1162
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:13,520
Who's Thomas?

1163
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:14,520
69.

1164
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:15,520
God.

1165
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:26,480
He actually rolled 69.

1166
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:30,320
Is it conceivable that we have copies of those pictures on our phones?

1167
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:35,240
I think you would absolutely have pictures of the pictures.

1168
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:36,240
Okay.

1169
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:37,240
Mr. Angst.

1170
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:38,240
Dr. Angst?

1171
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:39,240
DDS?

1172
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:40,240
It doesn't say DDS.

1173
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,240
It just says dentist.

1174
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:42,240
Nope.

1175
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,240
You can just call me Randy.

1176
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,240
Okay, Randy.

1177
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:45,720
These aren't real doctors.

1178
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:46,720
Wow.

1179
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:47,720
A self hating...

1180
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:48,720
An anti-dentite.

1181
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:49,720
An anti-dentite.

1182
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:50,720
Yeah.

1183
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:51,720
Yeah.

1184
00:45:51,720 --> 00:46:05,520
Why else was surprised that the John Lee Pettymore has seen Seinfeld?

1185
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:06,760
You thought I came up with that?

1186
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:07,760
I thought you did.

1187
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:08,760
Oh, gosh.

1188
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:09,760
It's just a reference.

1189
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:13,760
I was like, shit dude, Thomas is way funnier than I thought he was.

1190
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:19,480
Yeah, I would have been.

1191
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:26,640
Randy, I've got a picture here of a strange building and some people in old time of clothes.

1192
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:27,880
I'm not going to say it's essential to...

1193
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:29,880
Do you want to come in?

1194
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:32,160
No.

1195
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:33,440
I want to show you this picture right here.

1196
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:36,400
There's some very spooky stuff happening inside.

1197
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:39,520
I think you might want to come in.

1198
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:44,800
I don't know if these pictures are spooky, but I can guarantee you, there's some spooky

1199
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,520
doings in this hoose.

1200
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:47,520
Hoose.

1201
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:50,200
A very old school Anglo Saxon.

1202
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:51,200
Thank you.

1203
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:52,200
Yeah.

1204
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:53,200
Randy.

1205
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:58,580
Randy, there's spooky stuff inside that house, outside that house.

1206
00:46:58,580 --> 00:47:00,400
This whole town is beset with it.

1207
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:04,200
But do you recognize the building these people are standing in front of?

1208
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,920
And I show them the picture of the people in front of the jet black building.

1209
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:10,440
Okay, so basically that building, it's literally just a wall.

1210
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:11,560
It's just a black wall.

1211
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:13,840
You can't actually see the building at large.

1212
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:15,760
Do you recognize any of the people in this picture?

1213
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:18,440
Are they contention founders, forefathers?

1214
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:26,960
Well, I do see that the clothing is anachronistically correct with the time period of the founding

1215
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:30,200
of contention in many of these cases.

1216
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:31,800
As he points to some of the people.

1217
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:32,800
Anachronistically.

1218
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,840
It means it came from a tree.

1219
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:39,160
It means the time period was from a tree.

1220
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:40,160
It means it was wrong.

1221
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:41,240
It's like a family tree.

1222
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:46,080
Do you mean that people in this photo have clothing anachronistic to one another or to

1223
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:48,760
the time period of contention's founding?

1224
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:49,760
Both.

1225
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:50,760
Okay.

1226
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:51,760
Can you show us an example in this picture?

1227
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:53,360
Who's wearing clothes that they shouldn't be?

1228
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:58,260
These three are wearing clothes from a different time period as the rest of them.

1229
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:00,600
You can tell by the stitching.

1230
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:01,600
How different?

1231
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:03,640
Oh, a hundred years or so probably.

1232
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:05,760
This must be a reenactment of some sort.

1233
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:07,720
Mr. Anx, that's very helpful.

1234
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:08,720
Thank you.

1235
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:09,720
I'm a helpful guy.

1236
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,360
Just ask my lady friends.

1237
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:12,360
Mr. Anx.

1238
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:13,360
And my man friends.

1239
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:14,360
All right.

1240
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:15,360
We'll save it for NPR.

1241
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:18,100
Do you remember an old orphanage in town called Cole's Orphanage?

1242
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:19,880
Can we go inside, please?

1243
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:22,060
It's very cold out.

1244
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:23,360
You are quite old.

1245
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:24,360
Let's go inside.

1246
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:25,360
Thank you.

1247
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,300
I brush past.

1248
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:28,300
What is this guy's name?

1249
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:29,300
Randy?

1250
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:30,300
Randy Anx.

1251
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:34,020
Not waiting for him to get out of the way, I just kind of blow by him.

1252
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:35,020
Okay.

1253
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:37,780
I mean, he did just invite you in, so.

1254
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:38,780
Yeah.

1255
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:40,380
You're doing what he asked you to do.

1256
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:45,000
As he goes in, he kind of pats you, Clark, on the shoulder and he says, now as we're

1257
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:51,340
headed inside into the warmth of this nice home in this weird place, you asked about

1258
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:52,340
a orphanage.

1259
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:53,340
Yeah.

1260
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:55,340
It was called Cole's Orphanage.

1261
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:56,340
Yeah.

1262
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:57,340
Yeah.

1263
00:48:57,340 --> 00:48:58,340
I remember.

1264
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:00,300
And he always remembers.

1265
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:02,020
Do you remember?

1266
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:03,020
Can you?

1267
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:04,020
Keith.

1268
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:05,020
Come on, buddy.

1269
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:06,820
That song's a little after my time.

1270
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:08,140
You can see he's quite old.

1271
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:09,940
He doesn't know September.

1272
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:11,700
Can you tell me a little bit about it?

1273
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:15,100
We talked to some folks in town who had no recollection of it.

1274
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:16,100
Yes.

1275
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:17,620
It was not around for very long.

1276
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:24,340
It is a little piece of trivia I keep in the back just in case someone needs to know it

1277
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:25,740
at trivia.

1278
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:26,740
What about it?

1279
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:27,740
What is trivial?

1280
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:29,140
Well, everything.

1281
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:30,140
It opened.

1282
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:31,140
It closed.

1283
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:32,140
How quickly?

1284
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:33,140
Very quickly.

1285
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:34,220
I would say less than a year.

1286
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:35,220
What year?

1287
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:37,580
Oh, it was 25 years ago probably.

1288
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:38,780
Somewhere about then.

1289
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:44,620
25 minus the current year equals the early 90s and age.

1290
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:47,660
Do you remember who opened up that place?

1291
00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:48,660
Um.

1292
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:49,660
Cole.

1293
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:50,900
Well, no.

1294
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:51,900
She would have been...

1295
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:52,900
He would have...

1296
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:54,900
Either one of them would have been long dead by that point.

1297
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:55,900
The Coles?

1298
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:56,900
Yes.

1299
00:49:57,060 --> 00:50:00,660
They were dead by the time their namesake orphanage opened up?

1300
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:01,660
Oh, absolutely.

1301
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:03,380
Who named it for them?

1302
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:12,060
There are many things in our town named after our founder and his wife, Silas Cole and Mary

1303
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:13,060
Cole.

1304
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:14,060
I get that.

1305
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:15,060
I just wondered if you know who opened it.

1306
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:16,060
Oh, no.

1307
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:17,060
I don't remember.

1308
00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:18,060
Wasn't this town founded by beans?

1309
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:19,060
Well, that's a point of contention.

1310
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:20,060
Contention.

1311
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:21,060
Hell yeah.

1312
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:24,860
Did Silas Cole and what was his name?

1313
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:25,860
Was it...

1314
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:27,820
Cornelius?

1315
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:28,820
Cornelius Beans.

1316
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:31,900
Oh, what a mind you have on you, young sir.

1317
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:34,860
I read a book or two.

1318
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:37,240
I believe you read the right ones.

1319
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:40,620
Do you remember where in contention Cole's orphanage was?

1320
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:43,620
Well, the town has changed quite a bit since then.

1321
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:46,660
I don't remember where it was now.

1322
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:51,100
We could probably find more back at my research facility.

1323
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:52,700
A resource facility?

1324
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:53,940
Yes.

1325
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:57,060
It's where all of my research is hosed.

1326
00:50:57,060 --> 00:50:58,060
Sorry.

1327
00:50:58,060 --> 00:51:02,320
It's where all of my research is re- fuck.

1328
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:05,100
It's where all of my research is hosed.

1329
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:07,140
Try it one more time.

1330
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:08,260
Yes, of course.

1331
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:11,420
It's where all of my research is hosed.

1332
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:15,220
That makes sense to me.

1333
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:22,980
So come on in and you guys walk into this incredibly nice and clean house.

1334
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:26,500
And as you walk in there's a nice foyer in front of you.

1335
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:29,940
And then to the right there's this huge living room.

1336
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:37,260
And in the living room, well here in the foyer there is a statue of a man wearing a tuxedo.

1337
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:41,100
And also there is a suit of armor.

1338
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:45,780
And the helmet has been replaced with a white hard hat.

1339
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:48,620
In the living room there is an empty grand piano.

1340
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:52,960
And there's also a large oil painting of a red rose.

1341
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:57,100
And he brings you over to the statue of the man wearing a tuxedo.

1342
00:51:57,100 --> 00:52:01,200
And he says, check this sweet shit out.

1343
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:05,520
And he grabs the statue's bow tie and flips it.

1344
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:11,360
And the coffee table in the living room flips over showing an enormous stash of weapons,

1345
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:16,280
body armor, and a long plastic tube the size of a baseball bat.

1346
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:24,560
And written in blood where one of the guns should be, it says, stop her.

1347
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:28,080
I was pointing out the large plastic tube the shape of a baseball bat.

1348
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:30,980
The size behind you.

1349
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:35,160
There is an Ozzie Smith signed baseball bat in the room that we're in.

1350
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:37,560
It's in a tube that size.

1351
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:42,000
We are also in a completely St. Louis Cardinals themed room.

1352
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Fuck yeah dude.

1353
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,320
There's an old drawing of, is that Old Bush Stadium?

1354
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:47,320
No.

1355
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:48,320
No that's New Bush.

1356
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:49,320
That's New Bush Stadium.

1357
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:50,800
It's a seat from Old Bush behind me.

1358
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:51,800
There is.

1359
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:52,800
Cornelius?

1360
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:53,800
The third one.

1361
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:54,800
Not Cornelius, fuck.

1362
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,800
My name is Cornelius or is it?

1363
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:57,800
Ooh.

1364
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:58,800
Uh, guys.

1365
00:52:58,800 --> 00:52:59,800
Wait, is your name not Randy?

1366
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:00,800
No, it's Randy.

1367
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:04,520
Randy, uh, is your middle name Cornelius?

1368
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:05,520
No.

1369
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:08,040
Is this statue of somebody significant to the town?

1370
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:09,960
No, I don't know who this is.

1371
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:12,680
Can we huddle around real quick outside of Randy?

1372
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:16,680
I mean, he actually, Randy can hear this, but I think we need to document this all.

1373
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:20,920
Take some pictures real quick with our phones and then suit the fuck up with this shit.

1374
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:24,400
Yeah, I'm gonna put body armor, like weapons.

1375
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:25,400
Let's get loaded guys.

1376
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:30,880
Yeah, uh, Randy, we're gonna take this for, um, you know, purposes.

1377
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:31,880
Vital operations.

1378
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:32,880
I don't think he cares.

1379
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:33,880
Police purposes.

1380
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:34,880
Hey, the estate will be compensated.

1381
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:39,520
Honestly, hey, you know what Randy, I don't think this is in his will so that's why you

1382
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:40,520
called us, right?

1383
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:41,520
Oh, his will was very non-existent.

1384
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:42,520
Okay.

1385
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:43,560
Let's get into the game real quick.

1386
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:45,520
He did call us because he wanted to know if he could sell it all.

1387
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:46,520
The answer is a fucking no?

1388
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:47,520
Oh yeah.

1389
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:48,520
Hey man, I'm sorry.

1390
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:49,520
This is all part of an ongoing investigation.

1391
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:52,480
We're actually going to load some of this up in our cruiser right now so we can take

1392
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,320
it to evidence as quickly as possible.

1393
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:55,320
Oh no.

1394
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:57,320
He can sell the cool statue, buddy.

1395
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:58,320
Oh good.

1396
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:00,320
Hey Randy, do you like cocaine?

1397
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,320
Does the Pope shit in the woods?

1398
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:03,320
I think so.

1399
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:04,320
Yeah.

1400
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:05,320
Hey Keith, give him, give him some of that.

1401
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:06,320
Yay.

1402
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:07,320
Just share your cocaine.

1403
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:08,320
Just kidding.

1404
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:10,640
We are police officers of the law.

1405
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:12,800
Keith, this is the end of the fucking world.

1406
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:13,800
Give him some cocaine.

1407
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:14,800
Wait.

1408
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:15,800
You know what I mean?

1409
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:16,800
It's the what?

1410
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:17,800
Nothing.

1411
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:18,800
I feel fine.

1412
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:21,000
You're going to feel a lot more fine if Keith would learn to share.

1413
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,840
Five o'clock TV hour.

1414
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:24,520
You know what?

1415
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:29,520
It's probably past my years to do an upper like cocaine.

1416
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:30,920
It might stop my heart.

1417
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:33,000
It says lover on this card.

1418
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Yes.

1419
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,200
That says to me that you do cocaine.

1420
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:38,880
Do you know if cocaine reacts poorly with Cialis?

1421
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:41,480
Oh you want Cialis right now?

1422
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:42,480
I'll never not.

1423
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:45,840
Don't you see his raging erection under his very loose pants?

1424
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:48,000
It says lover right there on the card.

1425
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:54,480
There is a full blown sideways tint going on on Randy Yanks and he immediately turns

1426
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:56,400
and- Randy's got nothing to be ashamed of.

1427
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:59,760
He turns and shows you.

1428
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:03,920
Is sideways tint a tint that Merlot's not allowed in?

1429
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:04,920
Nice dude.

1430
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:09,960
That scene in fucking sideways tanked the Merlot industry for like a number of years.

1431
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:13,080
Because they didn't explain that- It's actually because it's all his ex-wife

1432
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:14,080
drank.

1433
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:16,080
I'm fine with all varieties of red wine.

1434
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:17,080
Hey did you know that Randy?

1435
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:18,080
Randy did you know that?

1436
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:20,040
Merlot's my third favorite.

1437
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:26,640
Now we are realistically role playing cocaine.

1438
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,960
Anyway I'm- I think we should also take that oil thing.

1439
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:31,280
So you're saying I can't sell these guns?

1440
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:32,280
No.

1441
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:33,280
They're ours now.

1442
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:35,720
Is this the only thing you wanted us to see in this house?

1443
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:36,800
You said it was spooky.

1444
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:42,400
He walks over and grabs the- or he like reaches for the oil painting and he's like can I sell

1445
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:43,400
this?

1446
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:46,840
If you move that painting is it gonna unveil another room?

1447
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:47,840
Another what?

1448
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:49,040
A secret place?

1449
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:50,040
Or anything?

1450
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:52,160
Yeah what happens when you move that painting?

1451
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:53,280
Why would you ask us that?

1452
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:55,980
Why would you want me to move- wait what is happening?

1453
00:55:55,980 --> 00:55:56,980
Can I sell it?

1454
00:55:56,980 --> 00:55:58,600
Why would you ask us if you can sell it?

1455
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:02,040
Because I'm wanting to know if all of these things are from an active crime scene or if

1456
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:05,920
I can sell the other stuff that isn't the guns, Keith.

1457
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,000
Oh you just got the angst.

1458
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:19,440
I grab one of the guns and I like am pointing at him and I'm like I don't see why you wouldn't

1459
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:21,520
be able to sell that painting.

1460
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:24,320
That's- what a weird vibe you're putting off there.

1461
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:29,200
You guys begin to smell the faint smell of shit.

1462
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:32,680
Give him some cocaine now man you made him shit his pants.

1463
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:33,680
Come on.

1464
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:34,680
I'm gonna excuse myself.

1465
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:37,160
Hey do you want to shoot some of these guns before we leave?

1466
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:39,160
Yeah do you want to do that?

1467
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:42,000
Yes but I do need to clean up a bit first.

1468
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
That's understandable.

1469
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,000
And he walks off to the bathroom.

1470
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,240
Wait wait Randy wait real fast before you leave.

1471
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:46,880
He pokes his head back around the corner.

1472
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:50,840
John did ask you like is there anything else here that you wanted us to see?

1473
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:54,000
What do you mean I'm just gonna point at a bunch of stuff and ask you if I can sell it

1474
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,640
as soon as I get out of the bathroom.

1475
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:57,220
Is anything else fucking weird?

1476
00:56:57,220 --> 00:57:00,860
Does anything else lead to a gun door or something of that ilk?

1477
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:03,300
That is the only trapsie that I found.

1478
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:04,300
You call them trapsies?

1479
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:05,380
What do you call them?

1480
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:07,060
I've never thought of the word I would call them.

1481
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:08,060
Go change your fucking britches.

1482
00:57:08,060 --> 00:57:09,060
That's just making me mad.

1483
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:13,880
Yeah it does smell like shit in here Randy so if you could come back we can do some cocaine.

1484
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:14,880
It's not my fault.

1485
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:15,880
And he walks away.

1486
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:20,380
You guys shitting himself just making me mad.

1487
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:26,700
This whole house smells like shit.

1488
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:29,020
What kind of guns are we dealing with here?

1489
00:57:29,020 --> 00:57:30,020
Well there's that.

1490
00:57:30,020 --> 00:57:31,020
Let's do that first.

1491
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:32,020
Long ones.

1492
00:57:32,020 --> 00:57:33,020
Short ones.

1493
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:34,020
Fat ones.

1494
00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:35,020
Tall ones.

1495
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:36,020
Red ones.

1496
00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:37,020
Brown ones.

1497
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:38,020
Sad ones.

1498
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:39,020
Clown ones.

1499
00:57:39,020 --> 00:57:40,020
I got sniper rifle.

1500
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:41,020
Assault rifle.

1501
00:57:41,020 --> 00:57:42,020
Six pistols and four body armors.

1502
00:57:42,020 --> 00:57:43,020
Yeah there's a bunch.

1503
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:44,220
Yeah there's that.

1504
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:47,620
Which should we let him shoot as a consolation prize for making him shoot his pants?

1505
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:48,620
Let's let him pick.

1506
00:57:48,620 --> 00:57:49,620
Yeah.

1507
00:57:49,620 --> 00:57:52,500
While they're going through the guns I want to walk over to that painting and run my hand

1508
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:56,060
around the edge of it and look for any kind of clicking mechanism.

1509
00:57:56,420 --> 00:58:02,220
Oh yeah let's move everything that's as conspicuous as a tuxedo statue or a rose oil painting

1510
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:03,220
in this house.

1511
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:09,940
Like Clark you walk over to the oil painting of the rose and as you put your fingers behind

1512
00:58:09,940 --> 00:58:14,220
it you actually feel space right behind the painting.

1513
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:18,380
I pull that bad bitch down off the wall.

1514
00:58:18,380 --> 00:58:24,020
Behind the oil painting is a small hideaway big enough for one or two people.

1515
00:58:24,020 --> 00:58:29,860
Inside there are multiple kinds of spray bottles as well as different types of gloves

1516
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:31,300
and materials.

1517
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:37,580
There's also a list and on this list is materials and those materials are inside.

1518
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:40,400
I got a room in here.

1519
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:41,780
It's got a whole bunch of stuff.

1520
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:46,940
It's got some tap water, some distilled water, some boiling water, some Windex, some CLR,

1521
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:53,660
some soap, some bleach, some vinegar, some Drano, the works, coca-cola, and oil.

1522
00:58:53,660 --> 00:58:58,260
It's also got a whole bunch of like cotton and latex and vinyl and plastic and aluminum

1523
00:58:58,260 --> 00:59:03,420
and neoprene and lead and salt and candy and meat and ammonium nitrate.

1524
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:07,060
I don't know about making bombs but...

1525
00:59:07,060 --> 00:59:10,020
Is there a chance that neoprene isn't in here?

1526
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:13,320
For some reason on this list neoprene is the only thing that isn't crossed off.

1527
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:16,760
This is the year of the terrible neoprene shortage.

1528
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:17,760
What is neoprene?

1529
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:19,100
I don't actually know that.

1530
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:21,060
Neoprene is just a synthesized rubber.

1531
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:23,780
Let me make sure that's correct.

1532
00:59:23,780 --> 00:59:28,980
Neoprene, also polychloroprene or PC rubber.

1533
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:34,020
It's a family of synthetic rubbers that are produced by polymerization of chloroprene.

1534
00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:35,020
Cool.

1535
00:59:35,020 --> 00:59:36,300
The more you know.

1536
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:40,940
Everything is labeled and there is a pair of neoprene gloves.

1537
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:43,300
So everything's crossed off except neoprene?

1538
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:44,300
Is there...

1539
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:46,540
I can't discern why that would be.

1540
00:59:46,540 --> 00:59:52,200
If we do a Google search for like a number of these ingredients in concert, does a recipe

1541
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:53,620
or anything pop up?

1542
00:59:53,620 --> 00:59:54,620
Nope.

1543
00:59:54,620 --> 00:59:56,060
Do you fellas know what CLR is?

1544
00:59:56,060 --> 00:59:57,060
Should I know what CLR is?

1545
00:59:57,060 --> 01:00:00,900
It's Calcium Lime and Rust Remover.

1546
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:01,900
It gets rid of that stuff?

1547
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:02,940
It gets rid of that stuff.

1548
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:03,940
Also the works cleans the toilet.

1549
01:00:03,940 --> 01:00:06,100
Hey, CLR is a great product.

1550
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:10,740
All listeners of pretending to be people, if you can go down to your local Walgreens,

1551
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:14,960
get some CLR, it'll clean your calcium, your lime, your rust.

1552
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:16,760
It's going to clean that bathtub up real good.

1553
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:19,440
Your sink, I think you can use it on metal too, right?

1554
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:20,440
That's the rust part.

1555
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:22,840
Yeah, you got any white spots on your taps?

1556
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:25,800
White spots, brown spots, yellow spots, red spots.

1557
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:30,680
Put some CLR, mix it in with some water and just soak your shower head.

1558
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:33,960
Your shower head's got some calcium on there, just soak it in there for a minute.

1559
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:34,960
Pretending to be people.

1560
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:38,520
You're going to have some good water flow here in about two or three minutes.

1561
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:39,520
Oh, yeah.

1562
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:41,220
You dip your shower head in some CLR.

1563
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:42,220
That's a dream, man.

1564
01:00:42,220 --> 01:00:43,220
High power.

1565
01:00:43,220 --> 01:00:44,760
Surely it doesn't work on grease spots.

1566
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:47,720
Oh, but that's where you would be wrong.

1567
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:50,920
Can you roll to see if that all makes it in?

1568
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:51,920
What am I rolling against?

1569
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:57,960
No, because if it shows it, I don't know what CLR is.

1570
01:00:57,960 --> 01:00:58,960
It's a brain name.

1571
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:02,440
Yeah, and it's not necessarily something you have to know.

1572
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:09,520
Okay, also, Jon, when you Googled these ingredients, you would find out ammonium nitrate is a common

1573
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:13,160
agricultural fertilizer and a deadly explosive agent.

1574
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:14,160
Yeah.

1575
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:20,320
It was used to blow up the World Trade Center the first time, I think, or was that the Oklahoma

1576
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:21,320
City bombing?

1577
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:23,080
Hey, Clark, why do you know so much about it?

1578
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:24,080
I am Keith.

1579
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:25,080
That's Keith.

1580
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:26,360
I don't know anything about it.

1581
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:27,360
I'm a cop.

1582
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:29,600
I learned this in cop school.

1583
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:31,560
It's the one thing you remember.

1584
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:33,720
Making bombs was the only thing that interested you.

1585
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:34,720
Which one was it?

1586
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:35,720
Timothy McVeigh, Oklahoma City.

1587
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:36,720
Yep, that piece of shit.

1588
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:38,680
Do you guys know a brand name called The Works?

1589
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:40,960
Yeah, it's used to clean your toilets.

1590
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:48,160
Also if you put The Works and balls of aluminum foil in a water bottle and shake it up, you

1591
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:50,000
can make a Works bomb.

1592
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,920
It's not really a bomb as much as it is.

1593
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:53,680
It just explodes and makes a really loud sound.

1594
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:56,840
It'll make the grass not grow in that spot for a couple years.

1595
01:01:56,840 --> 01:02:00,400
Because it's full of chemicals, but yeah, the chemicals in The Works that clean your

1596
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:07,280
toilet, also break the aluminum foil down into gas and then it explodes the bottle.

1597
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:09,440
If you put it in a two liter, it's even louder.

1598
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:14,560
I know this from lots of experience in Ozark, Missouri, where you do it and then you're

1599
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:16,080
like, oh, we got to get out of here.

1600
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:19,880
And then people call the cops and you're like, you've wasted resources.

1601
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:22,720
My dad showed us how to do that in our backyard.

1602
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:24,240
It's very fun.

1603
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:28,000
If I wasn't a little drunk right now, I would suggest making one.

1604
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:32,840
Hey, listeners at home, get a two liter bottle.

1605
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:35,480
By this point in the podcast, we're all three beers deep.

1606
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:41,600
Okay, so as you guys are talking about what kind of bombs you can make with these materials.

1607
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:44,280
Honestly, yeah, I think it's in character.

1608
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:48,000
John Lee Pettymore would know right away that you can make bombs.

1609
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:53,480
He and Keith might even be bonding over this for the first time.

1610
01:02:53,480 --> 01:03:01,360
And as you're bonding, Randy Angst comes caning back into the room holding his underwear aloft.

1611
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:04,840
Hey, Randy, could you not find a trash can, buddy?

1612
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:08,600
I can pull my sidearm at name and I'm like, why would you bring that in here?

1613
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:09,600
Go throw it away.

1614
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:10,600
Oh, no.

1615
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:11,600
And he looks really sad.

1616
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:12,600
God damn it.

1617
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:25,560
He looks so sad and then he says, it's not my fault and walks back out of view.

1618
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:26,560
Well, that's fine.

1619
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:30,040
Hey, Randy, I shout down the hallway, bad news, buddy, you can't take this oil painting

1620
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:31,040
either.

1621
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:32,040
Damn it.

1622
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:33,360
What's the coolest gun here?

1623
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:37,440
Oh, they're all pretty equal except for the sniper rifle, which should go to Clark because

1624
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:38,440
he has the highest firearms.

1625
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:41,480
No, but I mean, just like to make up for him, you know, doing what he did.

1626
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:42,480
Oh, well, the sniper rifle.

1627
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:43,480
Yeah.

1628
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:50,920
I take the sniper rifle, I kick the door to the bathroom open and I hand it over to Randy

1629
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:53,480
and say, here, let's go shoot this.

1630
01:03:53,480 --> 01:04:02,320
Randy is Winnie the Pooh-ing in the bathroom, AKA he's just wearing a shirt and his vest

1631
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:07,880
and his jacket and he's wearing no underwear and no pants, but his socks are showing and

1632
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:11,760
he just yells at you, what are you doing?

1633
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:15,480
No, I, I spent some time in the hospital recently in a gown.

1634
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:16,840
Don't be, don't be embarrassed.

1635
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:24,020
I've, you know, he starts peeing all over the floor and he's like, oh, actually thank

1636
01:04:24,020 --> 01:04:25,020
you.

1637
01:04:25,020 --> 01:04:29,120
I can use it to shoot this pee for solid piss I've had in months.

1638
01:04:29,120 --> 01:04:32,040
Oh, hey, pee is not supposed to be solid.

1639
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:37,700
Okay, well, uh, as soon as you get yourself cleaned up, come shoot this sniper rifle so

1640
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:38,700
we can leave.

1641
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:42,160
You just throw it at his feet and you're like, clean yourself up.

1642
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:45,240
Okay, sounds good.

1643
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:47,280
And Clark is still looking through this room.

1644
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:50,980
Uh, I want to see if there's anything that isn't immediately evident.

1645
01:04:50,980 --> 01:04:51,980
Search rolls.

1646
01:04:51,980 --> 01:04:52,980
Yeah.

1647
01:04:52,980 --> 01:04:53,980
You can roll search.

1648
01:04:53,980 --> 01:04:54,980
10.

1649
01:04:54,980 --> 01:04:55,980
Nice.

1650
01:04:55,980 --> 01:04:57,880
59 on a die don't pass.

1651
01:04:57,880 --> 01:04:59,280
Ooh, I crit failed.

1652
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:00,280
Okay, nice.

1653
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:01,280
99.

1654
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:08,880
Okay, so here I am about to open a trap door, stumble into me and break off the handle forever.

1655
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:11,120
You stumble into him and break his nose.

1656
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:17,100
Okay, so Keith, you come walking back into the living room, Clark and John began searching

1657
01:05:17,100 --> 01:05:18,100
over the house.

1658
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:24,220
John, you were in the kitchen and you actually see there's a faulty square of tiles in the

1659
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:25,380
kitchen floor.

1660
01:05:25,380 --> 01:05:26,420
What kind of tile?

1661
01:05:26,420 --> 01:05:29,600
They're like eight inch by eight inch and four of them are loose.

1662
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:31,640
I go lift up one of the loose tiles.

1663
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:38,040
Okay, so as you peel away these tiles, you would see that there is an empty cubicle space

1664
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:44,760
right beneath you that seems to be about a foot by a foot and it looks like something

1665
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:49,360
heavy was dragged on the tile from this spot toward the front door.

1666
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:52,280
Okay, I snap a picture of that and tell everybody about what I just found.

1667
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:58,260
Okay, so you're hollering about that as Clark is standing in the foyer and he's looking

1668
01:05:58,260 --> 01:06:02,420
at the suit of armor, which has this white hard hat on it.

1669
01:06:02,420 --> 01:06:04,860
I tap on it, knock on it.

1670
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:06,260
That's exactly correct.

1671
01:06:06,260 --> 01:06:10,340
As soon as you knock on it, I need you to roll dexterity.

1672
01:06:10,340 --> 01:06:13,600
Oh, holy shit.

1673
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:16,780
Some dark soul shit hasn't happened.

1674
01:06:16,780 --> 01:06:19,380
I pass with a six on a 60.

1675
01:06:19,380 --> 01:06:25,780
The floor drops out from underneath you and you grab onto the edge of a trap door that

1676
01:06:25,780 --> 01:06:33,580
leads to a pit beneath you and as you're holding on, you look down into the pit and you see

1677
01:06:33,580 --> 01:06:35,600
two dead bodies.

1678
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:37,900
The smell is overwhelming.

1679
01:06:37,900 --> 01:06:45,660
I need you to roll sanity in order to keep holding on.

1680
01:06:45,660 --> 01:06:47,540
I do not pass.

1681
01:06:47,540 --> 01:06:50,740
Okay, you're going to lose one sanity.

1682
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:51,740
I am at 29.

1683
01:06:51,740 --> 01:06:53,340
And now it's just me and you, Jon.

1684
01:06:53,380 --> 01:06:59,580
Yeah, sorry listeners that the most capable part of this team is about to die in a pit,

1685
01:06:59,580 --> 01:07:03,340
but blame Zach.

1686
01:07:03,340 --> 01:07:08,300
You fall down, however, you kind of brace yourself against the walls on either side

1687
01:07:08,300 --> 01:07:12,420
of you as you go down and you just barely come down a little awkward.

1688
01:07:12,420 --> 01:07:18,300
You lose one hit point, but you're now 12 feet down in a pit with two dead bodies.

1689
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:23,340
One is male, one is female, but they're basically indistinguishable outside of that.

1690
01:07:23,340 --> 01:07:24,660
Do they have clothes on?

1691
01:07:24,660 --> 01:07:25,660
Yes.

1692
01:07:25,660 --> 01:07:30,820
I'm going to holler up, boys, I'm falling.

1693
01:07:30,820 --> 01:07:32,580
Well I hear all of this like happening.

1694
01:07:32,580 --> 01:07:37,980
I don't see it, but I run over and I see the hole in the ground and look down and I see

1695
01:07:37,980 --> 01:07:38,980
him.

1696
01:07:38,980 --> 01:07:42,540
Hey, uh, there's, there's bodies down here.

1697
01:07:42,540 --> 01:07:45,100
I'm going to, I'm going to go through the pockets.

1698
01:07:45,100 --> 01:07:46,100
Can you guys start looking at it?

1699
01:07:46,100 --> 01:07:47,100
Get me out of here.

1700
01:07:47,100 --> 01:07:48,100
Yeah, dude, I can help you out.

1701
01:07:48,100 --> 01:07:49,100
I got an idea.

1702
01:07:49,100 --> 01:07:50,980
This shit smells worse than Randy.

1703
01:07:50,980 --> 01:07:54,980
Yeah, that's, that actually, that actually factors into my idea.

1704
01:07:54,980 --> 01:08:01,740
Um, I get Randy's shit pants and hold onto one leg and lower the other one down that

1705
01:08:01,740 --> 01:08:02,740
hole.

1706
01:08:02,740 --> 01:08:08,300
Okay, so Clark is stuck in the bottom of a viscerally foul smelling 12 foot deep pit

1707
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:14,420
next to two corpses looking up at Keith and John, who is lowering down one pant leg of

1708
01:08:14,420 --> 01:08:18,100
Randy Ang's shit spoiled slacks.

1709
01:08:18,100 --> 01:08:24,040
Just then a brutally loud noise erupts from outside in the front yard and items in the

1710
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:26,540
house begin shattering.

1711
01:08:26,540 --> 01:08:31,940
You are being fired on by some large artillery weapon.

1712
01:08:31,940 --> 01:08:37,500
Your ears are shot and your vision clouds as dust billows about the room.

1713
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:43,540
The drywall is ripped to shreds, letting cold air and moonlight into the house.

1714
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:18,900
How am I the only one trying to fool?
