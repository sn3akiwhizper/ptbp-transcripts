1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,600
Good morning, y'all.

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:03,480
How are y'all doing out there?

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,000
It is December 4th here in contention,

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,080
and it's been a jam-packed week here,

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,020
so I think it's good to remind y'all

6
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,360
what time it is every now and then.

7
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,760
Speaking of y'all, y'all done wrote me something

8
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,680
to read on the air again against my will.

9
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,520
Here is today's Howlin' with Wolf.

10
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,360
Up.

11
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,180
Ow!

12
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:27,120
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

13
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:27,960
Ah.

14
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:28,800
Ah.

15
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,640
Ah.

16
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:30,460
Ah.

17
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:31,300
Ow.

18
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,120
Ow.

19
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:32,960
Ow.

20
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:54,220
Ow.

21
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,120
Are you provides?

22
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:56,940
Ha ha.

23
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,620
Tess said that all you wolf pups out there

24
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,620
would know what that means.

25
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:07,640
To some of our Canine listeners, y'all already

26
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:11,380
know the drill to all other species,

27
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:14,500
I apologize for that small outburst.

28
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,700
Thanks Tess, for making me lose my shit on air.

29
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,940
Now for some mole shit, it's the news.

30
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:24,180
Officer Bishop learned that the chief's car

31
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,820
had been at the mill on the other side of the city

32
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,740
since the night of December 1st.

33
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:32,860
The county coroner reports that during the investigation

34
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:35,360
of an active crime scene, Officer John Lee

35
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,980
Pettymore of contention slipped and shoved

36
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:40,060
a possible murder weapon into the eye

37
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:42,380
socket of the deceased Maggie Cook,

38
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:44,980
fumbling and digging around atrociously

39
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:47,400
as the charred bones themselves began

40
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,180
to crumble to no longer be a part of the situation.

41
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,020
Also, anyone out there having some fucked up dreams?

42
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,260
Shit, I know I have.

43
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:00,900
Last night, I was eating cereal in my basement,

44
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:04,660
but it wasn't like my basement, but it was.

45
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:08,900
When I looked down, my spoon was made of wet tuna

46
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:12,740
and the Count Chocula had turned into forgotten memories.

47
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:17,740
Then I saw my dog, Wolf, and he had my face on his face.

48
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,940
What the fuck is up with that shit?

49
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:24,300
Well, you know what they say.

50
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:30,100
Now I'm gonna need y'all to wave your hands in the air

51
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:33,420
like you just don't care, because in contention,

52
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:37,820
nihilism reigns supreme and the points don't matter.

53
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,060
It's kudzu with no backbone.

54
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:40,900
Ah!

55
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:48,580
Ah!

56
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:57,660
Hey guys, howdy.

57
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,500
Ah.

58
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,620
Oh, this is my new character voice.

59
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:01,900
John's phone rings.

60
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:06,780
Real quick, roll a constitution check for me.

61
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:10,920
Pass.

62
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,760
Pass.

63
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,580
Fail.

64
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:16,140
Okay, so John, you will get one hit point back

65
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:21,140
and the other two of you will get a D4.

66
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:24,080
I was gonna say two D6 would be great.

67
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,300
I rolled a three, I get three back.

68
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,480
Good work, Clark.

69
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,460
That brings me almost to perfect health.

70
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:34,220
One back, I still am 21 out of 25.

71
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:36,780
I've got 25 out of 26 hit points.

72
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,260
Well, you guys have insane.

73
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,100
What are you at?

74
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:42,860
I'm 18 of 20, but 20's my max.

75
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,620
My willpower is at two.

76
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:50,340
Which means I need a little help from my friend.

77
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,740
Your willpower is at two.

78
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:54,220
You guys put a lot into con.

79
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:56,820
I went middle of the road, baby, 50.

80
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:01,060
John, your phone rings as you're getting ready.

81
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:02,740
It's Keith Vigna.

82
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:03,660
I don't answer.

83
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,940
Okay.

84
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,320
I send John a text.

85
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:11,540
Hey dude, can you bring a little bit of stimulants for me?

86
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:14,740
I'm having a real off day today.

87
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:17,660
I text him, I have no idea what the fuck

88
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,280
you're talking about and I put the Shrug Guy emoji in there.

89
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,980
I put two snowflakes and a winky face emoji.

90
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:26,380
I send back all caps,

91
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:29,020
I don't know what you're talking about, angry face.

92
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:31,780
I send back, bring me something

93
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:34,660
where I will explicitly text it to you.

94
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:35,500
I don't reply.

95
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,700
God dammit.

96
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,140
Okay, I drive to John's house then.

97
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,700
Oh, oh god.

98
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,540
Damn, I'm already on the way to work.

99
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:46,340
I mean, you can resolve it if you want.

100
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:47,500
What's the timeline?

101
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,220
Does he come to my house or?

102
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,020
Keith, do you leave early enough to like?

103
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:51,860
Yeah, I do.

104
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,740
I get up and I put my clothes on

105
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:56,880
and I drive out there and I'm pissed.

106
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,060
I just woke up mad.

107
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:00,860
Okay, I'm gonna have you roll luck at a negative 20

108
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:03,140
to see if John is still there.

109
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:03,980
He's not.

110
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,240
I'm gonna break into his house though.

111
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,080
It.

112
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,680
I'm desperate.

113
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,780
So instead of getting some five hour energy.

114
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:17,620
That's not gonna.

115
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:20,200
You're gonna break into your coworker's house

116
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,200
and steal cocaine.

117
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,720
Yeah, because that's my only option right now.

118
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,200
He told me that that's.

119
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,400
I did not say that cocaine was your only option.

120
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,240
Yeah, but you said coffee wouldn't work, so I assumed.

121
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,760
Just jump all the way to cocaine.

122
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:39,240
It's literally like the most readily available option

123
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,180
we have here.

124
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,760
I thought this was gonna be a quick one and done.

125
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,640
That's why you're all in the room right now.

126
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,000
Okay, I get to his house and he's not there, I guess.

127
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,820
Yep.

128
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:52,660
Okay.

129
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,920
Definitely break in if you wanna like

130
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,040
really upset John later.

131
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,560
Yeah, I mean, I'm already upset.

132
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,200
So yeah, I'm fighting mad.

133
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,580
So I.

134
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:05,220
Because John, do you wanna describe your house?

135
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,320
It's the first time we've seen it.

136
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,960
Yeah, so it's a nice.

137
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,400
Poopy trap till I get it home alone.

138
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,280
I slip on some marbles and fall down the stairs.

139
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,120
It's a nice little property north of town.

140
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,600
You come down like a quarter mile

141
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,480
of secluded gravel driveway

142
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,840
and you come into this little clearing

143
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,460
and there's a nice fucking, you know, older

144
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:29,000
but single story smallish home.

145
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,280
There are some, like there's a random truck

146
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,440
and a trailer around, you know.

147
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:40,320
And it really looks just peaceful and beautiful

148
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:43,120
and there's like rabbits and deers jumping around and shit

149
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,840
and you're about to, you know, disturb that harmony, so.

150
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,560
So I pull up and I have lock picking

151
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,400
so I'm gonna try to do that first.

152
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,540
Is that cool?

153
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,180
At his front door?

154
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,020
Yes.

155
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:56,840
Okay.

156
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,840
With a minus 20, that's a pass.

157
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,680
Okay.

158
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,900
26 on a 30, which I have 50, so.

159
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,120
Sounds good.

160
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,680
And then like struggling, just like get out of your car,

161
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,880
get up there and start work.

162
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,720
Just sweating.

163
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,360
Yeah, just work your way into the house.

164
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,000
I go inside and I look around for wherever it would be.

165
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,180
Okay, roll a search for me.

166
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,280
It's a crit fail.

167
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,920
Heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh.

168
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,640
John, what does he find?

169
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:37,640
He knocks over all my Smokey and the Bandit DVDs.

170
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,200
Ooh, doggy.

171
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,560
And almost tips over like the Dukes of Hazzard DVDs

172
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,220
right next to him.

173
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:47,460
Oh wait, hold up, Smokey and the Bandit is not a TV show,

174
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,300
it's a movie.

175
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,160
You had a bunch of copies of it.

176
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,560
Special edition.

177
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,380
Yeah, so every director's cut, yeah.

178
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,100
International releases.

179
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:01,440
And anything remotely related to the Smokeyverse.

180
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,920
Okay, well, I'm not leaving until I get what I need,

181
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,040
so I'll just go from room to room,

182
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:11,500
searching violently through everything till I find it.

183
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,660
Okay, is that how a crit fail search role works?

184
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,120
Yeah.

185
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,980
You violently turn over the house of John Lee Pettymore,

186
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:21,520
unable to find the cocaine that you know

187
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,700
is on the premises somewhere.

188
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:26,360
Wow, so this is what you want,

189
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,800
just our characters to get in an actual fight.

190
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,120
I mean, I'd be, I'm already pretty useless as a cop,

191
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,080
I literally could not do our job today without this.

192
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,520
So I don't find anything? Nope.

193
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,920
I text him one more time, I'm like,

194
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,280
dude, tell me where it is.

195
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,980
Tell you where what is, why, what are you talking about,

196
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:51,600
I've got, I brought some stuff for you,

197
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,800
it's at the station.

198
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,320
Oh, cool, thanks, see you there.

199
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:00,320
I try to put the DVDs back a little bit,

200
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,320
but then I just go, I give up and go to my car,

201
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,680
drive back to the station.

202
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,520
Okay.

203
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,920
I didn't want to do any of that.

204
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,920
You didn't?

205
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,680
No, but I had to.

206
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,200
I don't know if you know what those words mean.

207
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,680
All right, well, the three of you arrive

208
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,760
at the police station, rearing to go

209
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,760
on the morning of December 4th, you arrive at 9 a.m.

210
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,340
I sit at my desk and just put my head down.

211
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:32,360
Okay, you know that the FBI will be here in an hour

212
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:36,900
to meet with you, and as you are milling about the office,

213
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,480
as the day is beginning, you hear a news story

214
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:43,600
come over Drew's speakers at his desk,

215
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,640
and you hear the news story say,

216
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:49,280
10 people have died in a brutal fire at the city hospital.

217
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,640
46 more are in critical condition.

218
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,640
The fire started early this morning,

219
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,780
and the building has just now been cleared

220
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,880
after hours of fighting back the fire

221
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,900
and sweeping the premises for survivors after the evacuation.

222
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:05,040
We do not have any word yet on how the fire started,

223
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,520
but we will deliver updates

224
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,640
as they roll in here to the studio.

225
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,840
Hold your loved ones close today

226
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,520
as we send thoughts and prayers

227
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,640
to those who lost friends and family.

228
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,340
Stick around for our next segment,

229
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:18,900
experts say we're all showering too much.

230
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,560
With your morning update, I'm Yolanda Squat Pump.

231
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:26,560
And immediately following, Drew turns it down

232
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:30,120
to let you guys know that two children

233
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,840
were reported missing late last night

234
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,360
from a home in the suburbs.

235
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,480
Their names are Aiden and Alice Little.

236
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,760
Repeat those names, Drew.

237
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,680
Aiden and Alice Little.

238
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,620
Okay, we'll get right on that.

239
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:46,020
Okay, good, their parents are very worried.

240
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,640
I can only imagine.

241
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,740
I can only imagine.

242
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:50,920
Wait, where was that fire at?

243
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:51,940
I missed the first part.

244
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:52,960
The hospital.

245
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,800
Oh yeah.

246
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,620
The city hospital.

247
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,340
All right, what do you guys wanna do around the office?

248
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,180
I don't know.

249
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,040
I bet we have a lot of paperwork to do.

250
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:00,860
I bet you do.

251
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:01,700
Is there anything that you want to-

252
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,420
Good thing the chief's not here.

253
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,780
Is there anything you wanna take care of?

254
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,060
Oh, the chief's dead.

255
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:08,900
We should-

256
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:09,720
Yeah.

257
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,460
I didn't even, it's a new face.

258
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,460
Good thing the chief's not here.

259
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,140
Ugh, rip.

260
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:18,980
Hey, John.

261
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,940
Good thing the chief's not here.

262
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,180
John.

263
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,020
Yeah, Vigna.

264
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:27,080
Dude, can I, did you bring me any medicine?

265
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,020
Yeah, hey, you're smart enough to know

266
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:32,300
not to be texting about that shit on the open lines.

267
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,300
I just-

268
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,300
All right, I have some for you,

269
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,420
and I dangle a little baggy,

270
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:40,480
but I'm gonna need you to clean out

271
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,860
the cat man's cage first,

272
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:46,680
because he left a number of human-sized dudes in the corner,

273
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,140
and I'm not touching that.

274
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,140
Okay.

275
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:52,980
I'll get right on it.

276
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:56,500
Do you want a little bump first to help on these?

277
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,580
Okay.

278
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:58,700
I take a bump.

279
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,140
Roll a D6 for me.

280
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,200
Three.

281
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,100
All right, it is 9 a.m. currently,

282
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:04,940
and you are gonna-

283
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:07,300
So for the next 45 minutes, he'll have three.

284
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,440
For three hours, is that right?

285
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:14,100
For three hours, you will not be at a negative 20%.

286
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:14,940
Hell yeah.

287
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,860
Have the makers of this game ever done cocaine?

288
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:18,660
Yeah.

289
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,700
Yeah, you just roll a D6.

290
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,060
That's how it works.

291
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,580
Dictates the hype.

292
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:27,800
I happily go clean the shit out of the cell.

293
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,380
You missed a spot.

294
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,220
Is that true?

295
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:37,380
Dr. Jacobs says as you clean the cell

296
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,260
that she shares with her-

297
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:43,340
Hey, what charges are we holding her on again?

298
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,860
How long can we keep her here?

299
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,180
We looked it up at the time.

300
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:48,980
I think 24 hours, maybe 48.

301
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:52,820
It's because we wanted to investigate her.

302
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:53,660
Yeah, exactly.

303
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,340
And you know what, everything's in disarray.

304
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:56,740
Our chief is dead.

305
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:57,580
Oh, you know-

306
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:58,420
Our chief is dead.

307
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,240
And-

308
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,080
We got the FBI coming.

309
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:00,920
Is that what you're getting at

310
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,760
when they shouldn't have a Catboy in there?

311
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,780
No, if anything, I think that helps us.

312
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:08,180
That anything that can confuse and distract the FBI.

313
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,580
I'm just thinking further on down the road

314
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:14,500
when she brings a civil rights lawsuit against us.

315
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,340
Sure.

316
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:17,060
We'll call some imprisonment or whatever.

317
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:19,840
I think we're still within our rights for today.

318
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,500
Oh, that's what we'll tell the FBI.

319
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,520
Cool.

320
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,180
Before you ask, we're well within our rights today.

321
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,900
I cleaned the spot that I messed up

322
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:33,000
and I said, I would even eat off this floor,

323
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,120
but I'm not hungry.

324
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,220
Thanks for the input, Keith.

325
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,460
And then I come back up to John,

326
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,980
I'm like, can I please have that?

327
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,340
Yeah, I give him the baggie.

328
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:44,100
I stick it in my pocket and then I'm ready

329
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,180
to talk to these feds.

330
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:49,380
Fellas, we should maybe talk about our story here.

331
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:52,100
Do we want to tell them everything?

332
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:52,940
Tell them nothing?

333
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:57,060
No, I was thinking they're getting here in what, an hour?

334
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:59,340
I'll just roll out, I'll go get some,

335
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,300
you guys want me to pick you up some breakfast or something?

336
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,140
Have you guys eaten yet?

337
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,000
Oh yeah.

338
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,440
I go grab some food for us,

339
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,040
get back like right as they're getting here

340
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,540
and then act like, hey, I got our breakfast.

341
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,540
Also, anybody recognize this?

342
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:14,540
I don't know where it came from.

343
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,100
I found it in the trunk of my car.

344
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,060
That's the plan.

345
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:17,880
I like it.

346
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,060
And then I'll somehow remember that it's from John's house.

347
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,620
So when they were talking to me last night,

348
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,320
they seem to know a lot about a lot of stuff.

349
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,100
So if they start asking us about stuff,

350
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,620
are we gonna lie to them or?

351
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:28,540
I'm playing dumb.

352
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,120
I don't think we should let them know more than,

353
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,420
we're already giving them the one thing they wanted.

354
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:35,780
But what if they can help us?

355
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:38,180
Well, let's see how they, let's see how they,

356
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,020
let's read them.

357
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:39,860
Exactly.

358
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:41,300
Is that a skill?

359
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,540
Humant.

360
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,140
I got 80 humant, so.

361
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,800
And now I'm not at a negative 20.

362
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,100
So hell yeah.

363
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:51,260
Keith Vigna is fully aware of how much people despise him.

364
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,100
Yeah.

365
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,560
Also, John.

366
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,740
Yeah.

367
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:02,900
Later tonight, we'll have to have a personal talk.

368
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:03,740
What about?

369
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:07,740
In which I profusely apologize for what I did this morning.

370
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,540
Don't, we'll talk about it after the FBI.

371
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:10,420
I don't wanna worry you.

372
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:13,700
You don't have to apologize that much for those texts, man.

373
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:14,580
Okay, yeah.

374
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,420
Well, that makes me feel better.

375
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:16,580
I just wanted to.

376
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,420
Yeah, it's.

377
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,240
Yeah.

378
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,080
Okay, well.

379
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,140
Just try to maintain, you know,

380
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,940
discipline when texting about drugs.

381
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,940
Like, absolutely heard from now on.

382
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:24,980
Yeah.

383
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,920
What do you guys want for breakfast?

384
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,660
I want a supersonic breakfast burrito.

385
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:31,220
Okay.

386
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,020
Don't we, what's the local,

387
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,380
did we make a breakfast place?

388
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:35,420
Beans on Beans.

389
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,340
Yeah, let's go to Beans on Beans.

390
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,900
Because it's Bean Street, right?

391
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:39,900
Mm-hmm.

392
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:42,860
Yeah, I'm gonna head over to Beans on Beans.

393
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,800
Let me get that Big Bean special.

394
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,060
The Big Bean special?

395
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:47,940
You want the Big Bean Sonic burrito

396
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:50,260
that they import from the City Sonic?

397
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,740
I mean, Sonic's right around the corner.

398
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:53,940
If you could just stop at Sonic.

399
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:54,780
I'll swing by there.

400
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:55,600
That'd be great.

401
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,820
That'll kill me some time.

402
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,820
So you want the Big Bean breakfast?

403
00:15:58,820 --> 00:15:59,660
Yeah.

404
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:00,980
Do you want, what kinda,

405
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:02,240
you want black or pinto?

406
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,000
Black eyed.

407
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,820
Black eyed?

408
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:06,660
Yeah.

409
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,500
Okay, extra bacon?

410
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,320
Extra bacon.

411
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,160
I know you.

412
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,900
One piece soggy and one piece crispy.

413
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:11,740
Okay, I can do that.

414
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:12,580
Just tell them it's Clark's.

415
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:13,400
Order them now.

416
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:17,460
Oh, the Beans, Bishop's Beans breakfast.

417
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,300
That's it.

418
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,120
Gotcha.

419
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:19,960
Bishop's Beans breakfast.

420
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,920
They told me they were gonna add it

421
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,180
to the menu at some point.

422
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:23,020
I think it might be.

423
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,580
I haven't been there in a minute, so I'll check it out.

424
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:25,420
Okay, cool.

425
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,980
Clark, frankly, I find it disgusting,

426
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:30,340
and I'm not in a habit to comment on a man's breakfast,

427
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:33,220
but I find it disgusting that you let them

428
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:36,060
dangle one strip of bacon in the bean water

429
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,060
and leave the other strip.

430
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,020
Have you tried it?

431
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,840
No.

432
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,900
It's so good, buddy.

433
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:41,740
Haven't tried it.

434
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:42,740
All right, fuck it.

435
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:43,980
Screw it, make it two.

436
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,420
Two, okay, well.

437
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:46,840
I'll try it.

438
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,260
I'll be back in about,

439
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:51,060
let me know when they get here,

440
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:51,940
and then I'll be back then.

441
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,580
Just, they're getting here in an hour.

442
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,100
When you see their car pull in.

443
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,720
Heard, okay.

444
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,100
Keith, how do you feel about the street name Beans,

445
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,700
Beans on Beans?

446
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,460
I really try not to think about it too much.

447
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:06,900
You don't associate the two?

448
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,140
I do, but it makes me kinda sick of my stomach

449
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:09,960
the more I think about it,

450
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,680
so I don't wanna think about it.

451
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,520
Fair enough.

452
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,340
Why?

453
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:19,860
Keith's actual last name is Beans.

454
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:24,380
I forgot all about that, Beans.

455
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,320
I changed my name to avoid embarrassment

456
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,520
when I came back to town.

457
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,200
No offense to anyone named Vigna,

458
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,200
but kinda picked a dumb name.

459
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,960
I mean, Beans is a dumb name, but.

460
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,000
I think we're gonna.

461
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,200
Has that come out in character?

462
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,340
Well, I think you did mention something about.

463
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:41,840
Did you tell it to us, or just the?

464
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,680
I can't remember.

465
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,520
Yeah, it might have been out of character.

466
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,000
It was his dog.

467
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:45,840
His dog's name is Beans.

468
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,920
His dog's name is Bean.

469
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,300
Yeah.

470
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,300
That's weird if you're trying to escape it.

471
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,320
Yep.

472
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,640
I like to think that the dog has been around.

473
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,260
Before I was Keith Vigna.

474
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:02,360
Okay, so I go to my namesake street and breakfast joint.

475
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,200
It's technically your ancestor's namesake.

476
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:10,440
Okay, and the two of you are hanging around the office

477
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,020
waiting for the FBI.

478
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:15,400
Yeah, I actually, I need to talk to Drew for a minute.

479
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,240
Okay.

480
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,480
Hey, Drew, can I talk to you for a minute?

481
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,840
Yeah, sure.

482
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,440
Hey, so what time did Clark come by the station last night?

483
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,680
It was like 1 a.m.

484
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:38,840
That is about when we were meeting

485
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,400
with the people next door, right?

486
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,320
Yes.

487
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,320
Well, see, that's pretty strange, Drew,

488
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,120
because I was with Clark at 1 a.m.

489
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,760
Did you notice anything, besides the limp,

490
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,120
did you notice anything funny about him?

491
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,840
I mean, he looks kind of messed up,

492
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,800
like he'd been through some shit.

493
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,320
His uniform and everything seemed right.

494
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,120
Well, he wasn't wearing his uniform.

495
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,280
He had just come in earlier to change

496
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,800
into civilian clothes.

497
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,600
I guess he changed again into some other civilian clothes,

498
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,200
but yeah, no, he looked kind of messed up,

499
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,640
but he was wearing normal clothes.

500
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,840
And he warned you not to go to the Chief's house,

501
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,220
and this was before or after you were contacted

502
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,240
by the reporter?

503
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,000
This was before.

504
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,160
Jesus.

505
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,100
Okay, all right.

506
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,500
So from now on?

507
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,340
Yeah.

508
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:30,000
If you see one of us without any of the other of us,

509
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,240
that makes any sense?

510
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,520
Sure.

511
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,480
If I see any of you individually.

512
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,320
Yeah.

513
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,480
Just keep an eye out, because maybe it's not us.

514
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,640
What, what do you mean?

515
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,220
I don't rightly know,

516
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:46,980
but you know how we got that cat man in there?

517
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:47,820
Yeah.

518
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,660
Because he got Freaky Fried Ed with his cat?

519
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:53,400
Yeah, you guys keep saying that, but what do you mean?

520
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,560
What?

521
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,820
I mean, I get it that he wants to be a cat,

522
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,880
and he thinks he's a cat and stuff, but like-

523
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,400
Oh, shit, have we not put you in on this loop?

524
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,340
Maybe this is a bigger conversation.

525
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,000
Honestly, I'd like, yeah.

526
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,360
Once Clark gets out of the bathroom,

527
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,560
I think he should know about this too,

528
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,640
but I just wanted to go over it real quick.

529
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,400
Oh, yeah, well, while we're here,

530
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,880
you guys moved all the cocaine?

531
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,720
Oh, yeah.

532
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,980
Oh, shit, did we not tell?

533
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:21,760
Also, the FBI is gonna be here in about 20 minutes.

534
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,720
What?

535
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,640
Yeah, so we had to get the coke out of here.

536
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,240
Okay, yeah, good thinking.

537
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,440
It's all on my property.

538
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,360
Oh, that's amazing.

539
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,440
That's even better than it being here.

540
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,660
Yeah, oh, yeah, it's buried in a secure vault.

541
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,440
Perfect.

542
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,280
Okay.

543
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,920
Hey, that cake is safe, buddy.

544
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,920
Oh, yeah, it autocorrect messed up this morning.

545
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,880
Oh, I thought you were just being discreet, unlike Vigna.

546
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,700
What?

547
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,320
Oh, Vigna was texting me for some coke

548
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,200
because he knew it was at my house.

549
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,060
He's very tired and an idiot.

550
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,000
He is certainly that.

551
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,880
But hey, you know what, from now on,

552
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,920
why don't you call it cake or just anything besides coke

553
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,760
if we're texting?

554
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,600
I really like that.

555
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,880
We'll call it cake.

556
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:07,080
You know, I don't know how well that's gonna stand up

557
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,280
in a court of law, you know,

558
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,600
if they were viewing those texts.

559
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,100
Like, I think that's kind of one-to-one,

560
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,000
so we might wanna circle back and think of some.

561
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:13,920
But for right now...

562
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,600
If we're talking about kilograms of cake.

563
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,240
Yeah, that's gonna tip him off.

564
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,760
Man, this is a lot.

565
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,700
Honestly, I am in this.

566
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,700
I'm like, let's make some money,

567
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:28,460
but goddamn, this is a lot on top of all this

568
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:32,200
goo monster nonsense and the chief dyin'

569
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,840
and all the other things we haven't followed up on.

570
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,840
I'm gonna miss her.

571
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,800
Yeah.

572
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,860
Yeah, me too, buddy.

573
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:50,900
Clark comes back from the bathroom

574
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:55,060
and Drew and John Lee Pettymore are at Drew's desk talking.

575
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,500
Hey, Clark, could you come here a minute?

576
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,820
Yeah, what's up?

577
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:01,320
Hey, so I got a text from Drew this morning.

578
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:06,740
It seems while you and I were at the donut shop,

579
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:10,940
another you was at the station talking to Drew here.

580
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,520
What do you mean another me?

581
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,980
You heard that right.

582
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,300
Another you.

583
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:20,920
Like, somebody who said they were me?

584
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:24,380
No, so I saw you...

585
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:29,940
You came to the station last night at 1 a.m.

586
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:34,300
and you told me not to go to the chief's house.

587
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:36,120
And you were limpin'.

588
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:39,880
I'm really sorry that I went.

589
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,820
Now, I wish I would've listened to you,

590
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,060
but was that not you?

591
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:48,140
I mean, you must've been confused.

592
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:51,600
It was somebody that, it looked like me, maybe.

593
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:54,100
He said he was you.

594
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:58,380
Well, Drew, I was up at the donut the whole last night.

595
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:00,420
That was one o'clock, wasn't it, wasn't it, John?

596
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,260
Oh, yeah. We were there.

597
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,620
I was with, that's why I brought you in.

598
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:04,780
That's why I'm telling him, Drew,

599
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:06,260
because I was with the man.

600
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,580
So you must be mistaken.

601
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:08,500
It wasn't me.

602
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,980
Drew rolls a sanity test.

603
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:11,820
All right.

604
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:13,660
Nah, I don't...

605
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:14,500
Should we roll it?

606
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,860
Yeah, what's Drew's sanity?

607
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:16,820
He crit fails.

608
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:19,300
He's dead. Drew explodes.

609
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,380
Drew has a 100 power.

610
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:22,580
No.

611
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:23,900
I can see it.

612
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:25,700
It's like Kenneth from 30 Rock.

613
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:26,780
Yeah, exactly.

614
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,220
He rolls an i8.

615
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,060
Wow.

616
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:30,100
So he's sane as hell.

617
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,420
My boy's sane as hell.

618
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,260
Don't be telling him

619
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:33,940
that he's not seeing what he sees.

620
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:34,780
Clark.

621
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,100
Yeah, for the sake of the argument,

622
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,420
what else do I say?

623
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:39,500
You just came in, you were limping,

624
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,020
you were acting really weird, and you...

625
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:42,860
Acting weird how?

626
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,020
Was I mumbling?

627
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,140
Was I falling over?

628
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:47,940
You were kinda talking to yourself as you came in,

629
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:50,220
and you were wearing different clothes

630
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:53,460
than you were when you left with your CVs on,

631
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:56,380
and you were wearing normal clothes,

632
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:57,940
but you came in, you were limping,

633
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:59,340
you looked really haggard,

634
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,780
and you'd been through some stuff,

635
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:05,660
and you exasperatedly told me

636
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:08,020
not to go to the chief's house,

637
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:10,140
and I asked you why,

638
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,260
and then you were mumbling something,

639
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:15,300
and you walked away, and you just left.

640
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:18,780
And I was busy here, so I didn't worry about it.

641
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:21,020
I figured I wouldn't go to the chief's house.

642
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:23,620
I didn't understand why you didn't want me to go there,

643
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:28,500
but later when Mr. Dorsey came by,

644
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:32,180
when Harold stopped by and he wanted to go there,

645
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:34,460
he wasn't gonna take no for an answer,

646
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:35,620
and so I...

647
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:40,100
I went with him, I wanted to let him,

648
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,580
I didn't wanna just give him the chief's keys,

649
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:43,900
but he wasn't gonna leave,

650
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,740
and I was just trying to be nice.

651
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:46,660
Drew, you did good.

652
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:48,620
You did good there, don't worry about that.

653
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:51,180
Did you, I walked out the door,

654
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:53,740
but did you see if I got in a car and left, or?

655
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:55,060
I just stayed inside.

656
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,220
How about we check the tapes?

657
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:58,400
Can I see myself walking in, maybe?

658
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,620
That's a great idea. That's a great idea.

659
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,100
Forgot we had the...

660
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:08,460
Okay, so you guys go over to the security tapes,

661
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:10,860
and as you are watching them,

662
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:14,220
you see a figure limping,

663
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:19,220
wearing a hoodie and jeans,

664
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:22,380
limping their way into the police station

665
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:24,220
just from around the corner on foot,

666
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:27,460
then not even a minute later,

667
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:31,300
the same figure leaves around the same corner on foot.

668
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:34,380
We've probably got cameras inside the station, right?

669
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:36,660
Real world, probably, a police station would.

670
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,940
They would have cameras inside, yeah, sure.

671
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:40,840
Yeah, you got cameras inside.

672
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,700
Let's check that tape next.

673
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:46,340
Okay, so then you would see Clark Bishop

674
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:50,300
walk in to limp into the police station,

675
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,920
wearing the same clothes you saw the figure wearing outside,

676
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,860
say something to Drew,

677
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,580
Drew doesn't get up from his desk,

678
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,580
and then Clark leaves.

679
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:01,200
If you could both roll me a sanity check.

680
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,220
Fail.

681
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:06,840
I crit pass with an 11.

682
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,900
Okay, that is not you.

683
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:09,980
No way.

684
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:12,140
Not a chance that that's you.

685
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:13,420
Fail.

686
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:15,060
Would a crit pass?

687
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:15,900
I don't know.

688
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:18,860
Shouldn't he be like, that's me and I know it.

689
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:20,280
That's me and I know it.

690
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,240
That's an interesting perspective.

691
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,500
From my point of view,

692
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,920
the reason that I said there's no way that's used

693
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,080
normally when we do sanity loss,

694
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,340
the losing of a sanity.

695
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:31,820
Is from seeing the unnatural.

696
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:33,020
Yeah, so.

697
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,660
If I saw this and didn't lose sanity,

698
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,140
it probably didn't seem unnatural to me.

699
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,980
Exactly, yeah, if you lose no sanity,

700
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:41,760
you would deny its existence as being unnatural,

701
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,240
whereas you are wholly convinced

702
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,340
that that is Clark Bishop and you lose a D4 of sanity.

703
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,660
What do you think about, I mean.

704
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:49,920
That's in line with how we've been playing.

705
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,040
There was that guy who called me

706
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:54,100
and told me that the body was older on the inside

707
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,180
than it was on the outside,

708
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:57,440
and I crit passed a sanity check on that,

709
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,240
and so I just chalked it up to bad test results.

710
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,600
Yeah, that doesn't make sense.

711
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,280
It just seems like it's a little,

712
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:08,680
you wanna maintain your sanity for game reasons, right?

713
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,560
And then.

714
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,520
You wanna push the plot forward.

715
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,480
And understand more by passing rules,

716
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:19,140
but I actually like the discord between the two,

717
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:24,060
where not losing the sanity is good mechanically,

718
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:26,960
but not understanding the truth

719
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,720
is also technically good for your character,

720
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,920
even though we all know that learning more

721
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:38,200
about the unnatural causes the game to move forward.

722
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,040
Does that make sense?

723
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,440
But learning more about the unnatural

724
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:43,160
causes you to lose sanity, yeah.

725
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:44,880
One.

726
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,120
All right, so you only lose one?

727
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,640
You could also say, I know it's not me

728
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,440
in a more literal sense that I'm like so,

729
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,880
there's some tell that I'm so sure

730
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,320
that that's an imposter or something like that.

731
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,680
What do you think that would be?

732
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:00,720
I don't mumble, but I do mumble a lot.

733
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,480
You don't have a limp?

734
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,880
Yeah, right.

735
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,000
You don't own a hoodie?

736
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,920
Obviously it's not me, because I ain't limping.

737
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,720
Well, I think you're arguing past each other.

738
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,840
I'm not suggesting it is you, Clark,

739
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:15,320
but that's someone with your face.

740
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,720
Can I tell from the tape maybe what gave me my limp?

741
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,080
Are the pants ripped or any blood,

742
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,760
anything on them or anything?

743
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,600
Nope.

744
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,940
Maybe this is asking too much,

745
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:26,760
but given that this has been three or four days

746
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:31,600
of game time and this has been four months of game play,

747
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,020
have we in the past week encountered anybody limping

748
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:37,360
or heard about anybody?

749
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,200
Just Keith.

750
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,240
What the fuck?

751
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,080
Yeah.

752
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,680
John and Clark slowly look at each other,

753
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:50,780
realization passing between their eyes.

754
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:51,620
It's fucking Keith.

755
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:52,460
It's Keith.

756
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:53,280
He's a shapeshifter.

757
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,960
I'm a face taker.

758
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,400
Drew is looking at you.

759
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,860
Guys, I'm really scared.

760
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:03,960
I tell Drew, I put a hand on his shoulder

761
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:07,280
and I say, Drew, all I can tell you is that that wasn't me,

762
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,460
but maybe from here on out,

763
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:11,520
if you are talking to one of us, you might text us also.

764
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,440
I told him the same thing.

765
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,620
Yeah, that way we can be sure.

766
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:18,320
That way we'll know where you are?

767
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,960
Yeah, if it's not me, I'll text you back.

768
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,960
I'm not at the station, for example,

769
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,760
and then you should grab that person in front of you

770
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,720
and hold them.

771
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,560
Okay.

772
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:30,480
Unless somehow the imposter gets a hold

773
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,280
of one of our cell phones and knows about this arrangement

774
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,860
and then orchestrates a double switch.

775
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,000
That's unlikely.

776
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,960
Yeah, what if they get your cell phone?

777
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,880
No, it's the best plan we have,

778
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,440
but I'm just saying, be aware for anybody who comes up

779
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,000
asking to look at your phone or anything.

780
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,760
We can make a covert.

781
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:51,240
What if we handcuffed our phones to our hands?

782
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,320
No, that's stupid.

783
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,800
Drew, every time I see you,

784
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,940
I'm gonna say bubblegum tree.

785
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:58,840
Okay, yeah, I love that.

786
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,900
And I'm gonna say lollipop bush.

787
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,740
Okay, and I'm gonna say bubblegum bush.

788
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:07,700
Well, see, you should have your own thing.

789
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,400
You just kind of took our things.

790
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:12,420
Yeah, but I took the two that made it alliteration.

791
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,260
I like it.

792
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:14,800
Okay, hey, yeah, you do you, buddy.

793
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,640
What was it again?

794
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,860
Bubblegum bush.

795
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:18,720
I'm not gonna remember that.

796
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:23,380
And yours is lollipop bush and his is bubble tree.

797
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,200
Bubblegum tree?

798
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,300
We got it, we nailed it.

799
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,140
We definitely have this.

800
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,940
What if we all just say bubblegum tree?

801
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:29,300
Oh, that would make more sense.

802
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,140
Okay.

803
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:31,140
We all have the same word.

804
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,540
That sounds good.

805
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:35,180
Flash, thunder.

806
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:37,040
That's from D-Day.

807
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:37,880
Bubblegum tree.

808
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:38,980
Okay, so it's you.

809
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,020
Yeah, bubblegum tree.

810
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,060
Okay, so it's you.

811
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:42,300
Yeah, you got it.

812
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,120
Nailed it, buddy.

813
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:43,960
Bubblegum tree.

814
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,800
Hey, Drew.

815
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,620
Hey, Drew.

816
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:46,460
All right, cool, hey.

817
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,700
Okay, well.

818
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:52,100
Hey, do you mind texting the entirety

819
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,600
of that conversation to Clark?

820
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,240
Could you do that for us, buddy?

821
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,660
I mean, Keith, I'm sorry.

822
00:30:58,660 --> 00:30:59,980
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

823
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:00,900
I'll let him know.

824
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,180
It's probably about time for us

825
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:04,380
to get him back here, right?

826
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:06,360
It's 11, 15, or what time is it?

827
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,200
It's like?

828
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,020
9, 15.

829
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:08,860
Did you mean Keith?

830
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:09,700
Yes.

831
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:10,520
Okay.

832
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,540
I thought you were saying Drew texts Clark

833
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:13,220
because we don't know if this Clark is the Clark.

834
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:15,060
I was also confused by that.

835
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:20,160
Oh, fuck, what if we just gave the password

836
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,060
to the fake Clark?

837
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:25,160
You're just gonna have to think that, I guess.

838
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,660
My eyes narrow and I just.

839
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:30,440
Hey, Drew, is there, can you think at any time

840
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,280
that maybe one of us came in here

841
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,200
and said something to you

842
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,280
and then never talked about it ever again?

843
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,560
Could this have happened before?

844
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:42,260
I mean, Clark, that happens literally all the time.

845
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:43,800
You guys talk about a lot of stuff

846
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,420
that you never follow up on again.

847
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:47,260
Fuck off, Drew.

848
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:49,640
There's only so many hours in a day, Drew.

849
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,480
God damn it.

850
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,840
Drew, I didn't ask your professional opinion

851
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,960
on our prowess in the copping world.

852
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:54,800
Did you get at the fucking,

853
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,720
God damn it, yeah, what are you, Detective Drew now?

854
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,560
You think you could do our job?

855
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,480
I hand Drew my gun and my badge

856
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:04,640
and I'm like, be me, motherfucker.

857
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,320
Walk a mile in these boots.

858
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,800
He gets a very serious look on his face

859
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,240
and he reaches out slowly for your gun.

860
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,200
I slapped his hand away.

861
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,780
God damn it, Drew.

862
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:16,760
Oh, okay, it was a joke.

863
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:19,800
I text both guys in a group message,

864
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,920
hey, it's cheaper to get this with an egg.

865
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,520
How do you want your egg cooked?

866
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,700
I text back, scrambled.

867
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:30,580
I didn't see the, I don't respond to the group text.

868
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:32,160
Okay.

869
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,180
I met beans on beans.

870
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:37,300
I ordered all three of the same thing with scrambled eggs

871
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,880
and I'm on my way back.

872
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:44,880
Oh, Joe is asking, did Clark recognize the clothing

873
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,060
that the other Clark was wearing?

874
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:47,540
Is it stuff that I knew that I owned?

875
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:50,420
It is not stuff that you own.

876
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:51,240
Okay, cool.

877
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,600
And that is one of the reasons

878
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,540
you found it hard to believe that that was you.

879
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,900
So I pull up to the police station

880
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,700
and I wait to see the FBI.

881
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:04,700
There is a large black SUV that pulls up next to you.

882
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:07,660
The windows are completely blacked out

883
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:10,720
and Agent Kennedy and Agent McKinley

884
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:15,720
make their way out of the shotgun and backseat of the SUV.

885
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:17,820
So they got a driver.

886
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:21,940
Or it's a self-driving Tesla FBI van.

887
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,400
Okay, I wait for them to go inside

888
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,520
and then I wait like 30 seconds

889
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:28,580
and I go around to the back of my trunk,

890
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:32,240
get that bag out and bring in my three bags of beans

891
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,820
and the black Nike bag.

892
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:35,820
Okay, sounds good.

893
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,100
Three, two.

894
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:48,880
Okay, so.

895
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,280
You didn't say one.

896
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,640
Son of a bitch.

897
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:56,000
So Clark and Drew and John are all standing around

898
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,700
Drew's desk right at the entrance of the police department

899
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:02,200
when Agent Kennedy and Agent McKinley walk in.

900
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,300
Clark, you are the only one out of the three of you

901
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,900
who has seen these two before.

902
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,040
So I'll describe them again.

903
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:09,640
Agent Kennedy is a short, young woman

904
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:13,080
and Agent McKinley is a tall, old, gruff man.

905
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:17,880
She has a bit of a spark in her step, glint in her eye

906
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:21,140
and he has very slow steps

907
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:22,740
and very dead eyes.

908
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:26,280
And they walk into the police department.

909
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:29,000
Agent Kennedy says,

910
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,860
well, hello there, Agent Kennedy FBI.

911
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:32,820
Good to see you both.

912
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:33,740
Hi, how are you?

913
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:37,240
And immediately upon looking at you guys,

914
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:42,220
Agent McKinley scans you and freaks out.

915
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:45,280
This is the tall, old, gruff man.

916
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,740
And his eyes get enormous

917
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:50,900
and he looks at Agent Kennedy

918
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,320
and he goes,

919
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:56,900
and then he sprints out.

920
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,580
He turns and he dips.

921
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:00,540
He runs straight out of the police department.

922
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:03,220
So Keith Vigna, you will actually see

923
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:05,500
as you're walking in with this stuff,

924
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,620
Agent McKinley running out,

925
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:12,620
going and gets back into the SUV

926
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:14,740
and slams the door shut.

927
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,920
When you say he scans us,

928
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,620
or would it take that he's some kind of robot?

929
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,040
No, I don't think so.

930
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,060
I just use that word.

931
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:24,740
So he's for sure a siren.

932
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:25,580
He's a robot.

933
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:27,020
He's a robot, 100%.

934
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:28,520
Cool, cool, robot.

935
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:32,060
It's an octo, octo, octo, octo?

936
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:32,900
Ocular.

937
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:33,720
Ocular.

938
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:34,560
Ocular pat down.

939
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,400
Ocular pat down.

940
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,240
I'm gonna get the word out sooner when it helps.

941
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,780
That was incredible.

942
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:41,420
Some kind of obstacle pat up.

943
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:44,980
Optic, but octo, octo, octo.

944
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:46,820
Optical.

945
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:50,140
So Agent Kennedy immediately starts apologizing

946
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:52,020
and she's like, oh yeah, no, oof,

947
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:53,900
I am so sorry about that.

948
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:55,880
I mean, he is just off his,

949
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:58,460
our last mission went very poorly

950
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:01,500
and he's just all over the place these days.

951
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,460
So did you?

952
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:04,280
Never mind him.

953
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,020
Where the hell are you from, lady?

954
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:08,920
Oh, I'm from Minnesota.

955
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,540
Minnesota, Ireland?

956
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:12,020
No, just Minnesota.

957
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:15,900
It's in the United States of America.

958
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:20,380
So you're from the Netherlands.

959
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:21,700
Is that what I'm getting?

960
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,100
No, it's in the US.

961
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:25,020
I am from up north.

962
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,240
This is how we sound up there.

963
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,560
I guess you haven't been.

964
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,500
I guess not.

965
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:34,200
So I walk in and I'm like, what's that dude's deal?

966
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:37,220
Oh, he's just had a real rough go of it the past few days.

967
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:40,180
Hey guys, I got your breakfast.

968
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:41,020
Oh, thank you.

969
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:44,140
I toss each of them the bag of breakfast.

970
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:46,980
Ms. Kennedy, this here's a, this is a officer.

971
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:48,300
Agent Kennedy.

972
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:49,900
Agent Kennedy, sorry about that.

973
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:50,720
Agent Kennedy.

974
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,580
This here's Keith Vigna.

975
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:53,700
He's an officer here with us.

976
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:57,160
Agent like Mr. Anderson.

977
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,580
I watched that movie the other day.

978
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:00,820
Keith, Keith, no, it's a, this is a,

979
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:02,100
This is a real live FBI agent.

980
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,180
It's a real agent.

981
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,860
Oh, you're real, you're real.

982
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:06,140
Yeah, she's not from The Matrix.

983
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,100
She's from.

984
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:10,220
Oh, oh yeah, you told me that she's gonna,

985
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:11,620
I forgot to get you breakfast.

986
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:13,500
Do you want some of mine?

987
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:15,180
No, I am good on the breakfast.

988
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:17,580
You don't like black eyed peas and bacon?

989
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:19,540
One soggy, one crispy.

990
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:20,380
That sounds.

991
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:21,220
Some scrambled eggs.

992
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:23,900
That just sounds deeply unappealing on all levels.

993
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,060
That's what I'm saying, lady.

994
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:25,880
Have you tried it though?

995
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:26,720
No one's.

996
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:27,560
No?

997
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,380
No one's tried it, Clark.

998
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,220
It's good.

999
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:30,860
Hey guys, also, I can't remember if one,

1000
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:33,420
like if you guys, if this belonged to either of you guys,

1001
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:34,940
I found it in the trunk of my car.

1002
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:37,140
I was cleaning all the shit out of my trunk and.

1003
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:39,580
Here, let me take a look at that there, Keith.

1004
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:42,460
Well heck, this is a, this is a black Nike bag.

1005
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:43,660
Isn't that what you were looking for?

1006
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:47,180
I comically slap like hands on both cheeks

1007
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:51,340
and I'm like, oh my God, what a coincidence.

1008
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:52,700
What do you mean?

1009
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,140
She is elated.

1010
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:57,380
She is like clapping her hands together very quickly

1011
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:59,220
and jumping up and down and.

1012
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:01,300
We fooled her guys, we fooled her.

1013
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:03,660
And she's like, oh my goodness,

1014
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:05,840
I've been looking just all over for this.

1015
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,780
Oh my, you have no idea.

1016
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:10,520
I got bad news for you, Agent Kennedy.

1017
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,360
It's empty.

1018
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:14,180
Perfect.

1019
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:17,340
And she will reach her arm out to grab it.

1020
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:24,140
Hold on, hold on, just for the listeners.

1021
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:31,660
Luke was nodding his head very intensely up and down

1022
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:34,820
and Thomas was vehemently shaking his head no.

1023
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,460
I hesitantly, go ahead and hand it to her.

1024
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:41,020
Hold on, I put my hand out.

1025
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:43,820
Hey now, what did you, what's this bag worth to you?

1026
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:44,940
I go ahead and start pulling it back.

1027
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:49,380
She stops clapping, stops jumping up and down

1028
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:52,680
and gets a very serious look in her eye.

1029
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,740
I don't think you'll want to be doing that.

1030
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:57,940
That's all I need.

1031
00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:00,860
We just want a little information is all

1032
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:02,220
we're really aiming for here.

1033
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:05,620
A little quid pro quo between quid pro quo

1034
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:08,000
between fellow officers of the law.

1035
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,500
Okay, if you're looking for information,

1036
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,060
how about this?

1037
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:17,060
Let me use that bag and then I will give you information.

1038
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:18,300
What are you going to do with that bag?

1039
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:20,000
I just need to put something in it.

1040
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,900
All right, this might sound like a strange question,

1041
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:27,100
but it gets to the heart of what we're after here.

1042
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:29,260
Do you want to put something strange in it?

1043
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:33,060
Oh, sorry.

1044
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:34,340
I'm pretty hungry.

1045
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:36,400
I'm just going to go ahead and,

1046
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,100
go ahead and start eating on this.

1047
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:43,100
I sit down at my desk and start eating my beans

1048
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:47,580
while I watch this unfold.

1049
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:50,660
I suppose yes, officer petty more.

1050
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:53,540
It would be something quite strange.

1051
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:55,060
What sort of strange.

1052
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:58,560
She reaches into her back pocket and pulls out

1053
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:03,560
a small lock box that is two inches by two inches

1054
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:06,980
and it has a combination lock on it.

1055
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:09,860
And she starts messing with the numbers.

1056
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:14,020
Now I'm not going to open this until I can drop

1057
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:16,300
what's in here directly into that bag.

1058
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:19,940
All right, can you open it up for me officer Bishop?

1059
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:23,420
Sure, I go and I reach out and I hold it open underneath.

1060
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:26,900
She clicks the numbers into position

1061
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:30,740
and then holds this lock box right above the bag.

1062
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:36,620
And then she opens it and there inside is

1063
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:42,260
a small metal sphere about an inch in diameter

1064
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:45,540
and she immediately just tilts it

1065
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:50,420
and it drops right into the black Nike bag.

1066
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:54,140
And she closes up her packet and puts it in her back pocket

1067
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:57,500
and breathes the deepest sigh of relief

1068
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:00,320
you've seen someone breathe in some time.

1069
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,660
With the bag still being held open by me,

1070
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:06,500
I pull up to where I can see into it.

1071
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,180
Do I see the ball at the bottom of the bag?

1072
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:09,020
No.

1073
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:09,940
That's a heck of a trick lady.

1074
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:10,780
Thank you.

1075
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:14,460
Now I appreciate you finding that for us

1076
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:16,220
but I'm going to have to take it

1077
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:18,860
and we're going to leave you to it here.

1078
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:23,680
Real quick, that little ball, what was that?

1079
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:30,920
That was why Agent McKinley is so unintelligible these days.

1080
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,600
That little ball caused us so much trouble.

1081
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:37,680
Huh, I'm good to finally be rid of it.

1082
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,800
What kind of trouble did it cause you?

1083
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:43,280
Officer Bishop, we can't really get into that.

1084
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:47,280
You see, we have you a bit over the barrel here

1085
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:51,320
with all the goings on and I happen to hear

1086
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:54,080
that your chief's home blew up last night.

1087
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,760
Now, we're not sure what kind of a situation

1088
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,760
that that puts you in here but I'm not sure

1089
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:01,000
of a situation that that puts you in here

1090
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:05,920
but with all the strange happenings here in contention,

1091
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,160
I would think that you have far more important things

1092
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,280
to be worrying about.

1093
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,440
I think actually, you're right

1094
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:16,100
and we're in agreement there but where we might not see

1095
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:18,380
eye to eye is that I'm not so sure

1096
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:20,300
this ain't both of our problems.

1097
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:23,320
Eye with a mouth full of beans, I've.

1098
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:27,160
What, what was that, Keith?

1099
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,520
Get over here, I gotta ask you something.

1100
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,740
Oh, all right, I'll hook over.

1101
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Should I tell her about that silver ball that we found?

1102
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,600
I was just gonna see if we could keep the bag

1103
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:41,480
in case we need it.

1104
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:44,480
Yeah, okay, I was gonna say something

1105
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,640
but I thought you guys might get mad if I did

1106
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:47,840
so I'm not going to.

1107
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,440
That was a good instinct.

1108
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,600
I was more than the bag.

1109
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:54,920
I was gonna see if we could keep this FBI agent

1110
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:57,080
in case we need it, you know what I mean?

1111
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,840
Get her to help us out.

1112
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:02,520
She seems to know about strange shit.

1113
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:05,480
What are y'all talking about over there?

1114
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:07,720
You're the next part of my plan.

1115
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,280
Holler, just keep your voice down.

1116
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,600
You're not needed yet.

1117
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,040
Just shut up in there.

1118
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:15,520
Stop your husband from pissing so much if you wanna.

1119
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:16,360
It's her cat.

1120
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:20,780
That's, it's like we said, it's confusing

1121
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:22,200
as to what that is.

1122
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,200
That's her husband's body, pissing like a cat

1123
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,140
all over our goddamn prison walls.

1124
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:29,540
But if it was her husband, it wouldn't be him pissing.

1125
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:30,980
He wouldn't piss in there.

1126
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:33,580
The cat is what pissed in the cell.

1127
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:34,940
I got you, I understand.

1128
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:35,780
I know what you meant.

1129
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:37,500
I was just making sure we remembered what happened.

1130
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:39,180
Yeah, yeah.

1131
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:40,020
It's thorny.

1132
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:42,700
Signing blame in this scenario.

1133
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:46,500
Hey, anyway, Agent, are you staying in contention

1134
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:47,340
for a while?

1135
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:50,340
We could show you around the night life.

1136
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:52,020
What she just told us is that she's not.

1137
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:52,860
So we gotta work through it.

1138
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:54,860
Oh, see, I was too busy thinking about

1139
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:55,700
balls and beans. You got a mouth?

1140
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:57,600
You got a mouth full of beans.

1141
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:01,340
Just balls and beans.

1142
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:03,140
It's all it ever is with you, Keith.

1143
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,860
Why don't we, we should call you beans.

1144
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:08,100
No, we shouldn't.

1145
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:09,940
Keith beans is what we should call you.

1146
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:10,780
No, don't call me that.

1147
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:11,620
He does love him so much.

1148
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:12,440
Don't call me that.

1149
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:14,020
You love beans so much, we're gonna call you

1150
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:15,940
Keith beans. Let's talk about something else.

1151
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:16,940
Okay, beans.

1152
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:22,700
Hey, Agent, FBI person.

1153
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:23,540
My Lord.

1154
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:24,940
My Lord.

1155
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:29,060
Yeah, hey, you.

1156
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:32,680
Yeah, come over, take a look at our cell real quick.

1157
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:35,660
She begins walking over where you are.

1158
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:39,020
So I was imagining Keith's desk is way back

1159
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:39,860
in the bullpen.

1160
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:41,440
You guys definitely stuck him in the back

1161
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,660
of the department.

1162
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:46,300
And so he is the closest one back to the cells.

1163
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:49,420
So she begins walking across the station

1164
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:51,120
and makes it to where you guys are

1165
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:53,380
and peeks her head in and looks at the cells.

1166
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:56,020
Hey, you see that man pissing in the corner like a cat?

1167
00:44:56,020 --> 00:45:01,020
She looks over and she sees the body of Doug Jacobs

1168
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:06,580
on all fours, but with one paw just like up on the wall

1169
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:11,580
of the cell and he is pissing kind of back behind him

1170
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:18,500
and then he starts to kick up his feet onto the like nothing

1171
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:23,740
to cover the urine that is on the cell floor.

1172
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:25,500
Hey, hey, Dr. Jacobs.

1173
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:26,380
Yes?

1174
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:29,660
Could you tell our guest here exactly what happened

1175
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:31,220
to your husband?

1176
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:33,940
My husband believes he is a cat.

1177
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:35,940
What the fuck, lady?

1178
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:39,020
All right, no, your husband was turned into a cat by radio.

1179
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:44,020
Ma'am, these men keep telling me these crazy stories

1180
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:47,660
and they've locked me up in here with no proof

1181
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:48,940
that I belong.

1182
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:51,940
They did not read me my Miranda rights properly

1183
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:53,300
when I was arrested.

1184
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:58,200
Yeah, you got no proof of that and we did, by the way.

1185
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:02,100
I'm almost positive we always do that.

1186
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:04,060
We do that every time.

1187
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:06,700
So just don't stop your hearsay.

1188
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:09,860
Are you a federal agent of the law?

1189
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:13,660
And Agent Kennedy is just kind of staring

1190
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:15,220
at this whole situation.

1191
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:16,540
She looks at you guys.

1192
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:19,980
All right, she's being uncooperative.

1193
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:21,660
Obviously anybody would be pissed off

1194
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:24,100
about being stuck in a jail cell with their cat husband

1195
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:26,860
for however long we've kept her in there.

1196
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:31,860
But hey, that is a cat man and a radio did it to him.

1197
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:34,500
A weird radio and there's a weird gun

1198
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,120
and there's a weird camera

1199
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:39,220
and there's all this oil all over the place

1200
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:42,800
and this shit is frankly scaring the hell out of me

1201
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,740
and I don't know what's going on and I need you to help.

1202
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:48,880
I'm standing next to John and hearing him say it all,

1203
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,900
like that is kind of a relief for me

1204
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:53,520
and I'm kind of like nodding earnestly.

1205
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:57,620
And that is a fucking cat man and what do we do?

1206
00:46:57,620 --> 00:47:00,420
Agent Kennedy looks at you all

1207
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:05,420
with a deep knowing sadness in her eyes

1208
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:09,000
and she says,

1209
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:14,920
Well, I guess that means that

1210
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:18,260
you guys are in.

1211
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:23,020
I'll be right back.

1212
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:28,920
And she walks out the door of the police station

1213
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:35,040
and walking back in is Agent Kennedy

1214
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:40,040
along with a young bald fit man with sunken intense eyes

1215
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:44,680
wearing a black t-shirt and jeans

1216
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:48,700
and you would all recognize him as Billy Harrison,

1217
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:50,680
the man that was tied up in the back

1218
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:53,300
of Charles Donovan's car.

1219
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:56,560
Oh shit, Keith, it's that guy who made a fool of you.

1220
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:58,480
I don't think I rush him,

1221
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,940
but I am like hand toward the gun.

1222
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:02,220
That's a wanted fugitive.

1223
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:03,060
Yeah, same.

1224
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:04,680
Hey, hey, you stop right there.

1225
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:09,680
So as he walks in, he is carrying Keith's uniform

1226
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:14,920
pressed and folded in a pile in one of his hands

1227
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:18,980
with Keith's service revolver sitting on top of it.

1228
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:21,400
I look down at my uniform that I have on

1229
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:23,240
and there's black beans just spilled,

1230
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:25,560
or black eyed peas just spilled all over it

1231
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:27,840
and I'm like, okay, I could use that.

1232
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:31,720
I get up and I stink eye him and I walk up

1233
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:34,120
and I grab my clothes out of his hand

1234
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:37,420
and I am red faced with embarrassment and anger

1235
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:39,480
and I walk back to my desk.

1236
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:46,060
As you walk away from him, he says to you,

1237
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:49,420
I sure hope that you're feeling better.

1238
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:51,420
Yeah, I mean, no thanks to you.

1239
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:52,260
I did everything.

1240
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:53,700
What the hell was that?

1241
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:58,700
I did everything that you asked me to do, Officer Vigna.

1242
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:02,260
Keith, what the hell did you ask him to do?

1243
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:06,900
I just didn't ask him to attack me.

1244
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:08,740
That's what he did.

1245
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:12,900
John and Clark's heads are turning back and forth

1246
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:14,260
between each person.

1247
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:15,340
Yeah.

1248
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:17,620
This man looks incredulous

1249
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:21,580
and he looks over at Agent Kennedy.

1250
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:25,780
He's like, I don't know what you're talking about,

1251
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:29,820
Officer Vigna, if you wanna keep what happened

1252
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:32,880
between you and I private, that's one thing,

1253
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:34,980
but don't go spreading rumors about me.

1254
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:38,500
Keith, Keith, what happened in that hospital?

1255
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:40,740
I told you what happened already.

1256
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:41,980
He told us.

1257
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:44,180
Hey, he may look as dumb as he is,

1258
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:46,640
but he's our friend, kinda, so.

1259
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:50,420
Well, your friend made me at gunpoint

1260
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:52,540
change into his clothes

1261
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:55,800
and then handcuff him to a hospital bed

1262
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:58,040
and then prance around the room

1263
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:01,740
yelling about some Keith beans

1264
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:05,260
and he wanted me to smack him in the face repeatedly,

1265
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:07,340
but very lightly.

1266
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:12,020
It was deeply uncomfortable for me and I.

1267
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:13,500
Stop, just stop right there.

1268
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:15,620
I don't know what the hell you're talking about or how.

1269
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:18,700
No, no, that all scans.

1270
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:22,500
If it's some Dom sub thing that you're into, that's fine,

1271
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:26,460
but I didn't like being dragged into it personally.

1272
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:27,300
Yeah, Keith, you gotta keep that.

1273
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:28,940
I don't know who the hell you think you are, but.

1274
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:29,780
Hey, buddy, that is,

1275
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:31,740
you gotta keep that person alive personally,

1276
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:33,100
you know, not on the job.

1277
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:34,060
I just. Let you free.

1278
00:50:34,060 --> 00:50:34,900
Hey, you know.

1279
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:37,460
I just go sit down and eat the rest of my beans,

1280
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:38,780
fuming, angry.

1281
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:40,340
That's why we call them beans.

1282
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:46,620
Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh.

1283
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:50,860
Hey, okay, so who the hell are you people?

1284
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:51,900
What's going on here?

1285
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:53,960
Yeah, what'd you mean by we're in?

1286
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:54,800
I knew it.

1287
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,540
You're a goddamn X-man.

1288
00:50:56,540 --> 00:50:59,540
Agent Kennedy looks at Billy Harrison and says,

1289
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:03,580
they've seen a lot of shit,

1290
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:07,540
so I say we just let him keep the bag,

1291
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:09,180
give him the number and bail.

1292
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:10,300
You wanna get home, right?

1293
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:12,820
And he's like, I need to get home.

1294
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:14,420
Does she noticeably lose that accent?

1295
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:16,180
Oh yeah, it's gone.

1296
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:17,540
Okay.

1297
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:20,060
I pull my gun out and point it at Billy Harrison and say,

1298
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:22,260
if you leave right now without telling us what's happened,

1299
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:23,300
I will kill you.

1300
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:25,540
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1301
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:28,100
Keith, Keith, Keith, that conversation we had about guns.

1302
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:29,040
I don't care right now.

1303
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:31,640
He is, I don't know who this guy is, but I don't like him.

1304
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:32,480
Hey, hey, Keith.

1305
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:33,960
All right, keep your gun on him,

1306
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:35,540
but also come over here for a second.

1307
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:37,840
I stand exactly where I am, I'm fighting Matt,

1308
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:38,960
I'm furious, looking right at him.

1309
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:40,120
I'm gonna come over there.

1310
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:41,560
I'm gonna whisper here, okay?

1311
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:42,400
Okay.

1312
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,640
All right, hey, guess what?

1313
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:46,680
Like I won't tell Clark, but it is what he's saying, Drew.

1314
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:47,520
No.

1315
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:48,340
Are you sure?

1316
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:49,180
I swear to God.

1317
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:50,020
Are you sure, buddy?

1318
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:50,860
That's why I wanna shoot him.

1319
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:51,680
I wanna shoot him right now.

1320
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:54,040
Okay, well think about if maybe you haven't done

1321
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:55,760
anything today that somebody wouldn't get

1322
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,160
shooting Matt at you for,

1323
00:51:57,160 --> 00:52:00,440
and if anybody needs to die, you know what I mean?

1324
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:02,520
While you guys are having this conversation,

1325
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:04,600
he speaks up and he says,

1326
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:09,600
and I would like my gun and my ID back, please.

1327
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,520
We do, I think we have those, right?

1328
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:12,620
Yeah, go ahead and go.

1329
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:13,460
Pick it out and evidence.

1330
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:14,880
Go get it out of the evidence bags, yeah.

1331
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:16,600
Don't give him his gun back again.

1332
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:21,200
So when you, Clark, when you walk back into the room,

1333
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:25,740
Keith has his gun trained on Billy Harrison,

1334
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:30,740
and John is whispering sweet nothings into Keith's ear,

1335
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:33,460
and Billy is just standing there looking at you

1336
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:34,820
as is Agent Kennedy.

1337
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:38,300
I'm gonna kinda edge my way if I can in front of that gun.

1338
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:43,140
I do the, I put my hand way over and aim it over him.

1339
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:47,900
I'm doing exaggerated fake yawn, and put my hand up.

1340
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:50,040
You can't, don't leave here without,

1341
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:51,220
I don't know who you are,

1342
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:53,900
how you know what you know about me or us,

1343
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:56,820
but just tell us something before you go.

1344
00:52:56,820 --> 00:53:00,660
I take, I'm taking the badge and I have his gun, right?

1345
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:02,540
You have, yeah, his ID and his gun.

1346
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:03,380
I'm gonna just.

1347
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:06,180
Well, wait, Clark, before you give him that gun,

1348
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:07,460
let's have a little pow wow.

1349
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:09,740
No, I still, I go walk up to him,

1350
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:12,520
and I have the clip out of the gun,

1351
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:16,220
and I hand him the ID and just the clip,

1352
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:18,260
and I'm holding onto the gun, and I'm saying,

1353
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:19,500
I'm not gonna let him shoot you,

1354
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:22,860
but the sentiment does ring true.

1355
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:24,860
We wanna know what's going on around here.

1356
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:31,060
Okay, well, what is going on around here?

1357
00:53:31,580 --> 00:53:34,580
She kicks in and she's like, you're fucked.

1358
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:38,660
Each and every one of you are completely fucked.

1359
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:42,240
Guys, the world does not work in the way

1360
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:45,540
that we all grew up knowing it to be,

1361
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:50,540
and you are now charged with understanding that.

1362
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:55,860
That understanding of the world will cause your life

1363
00:53:55,860 --> 00:53:57,980
to crumble before your eyes,

1364
00:53:57,980 --> 00:54:02,260
but the thing that keeps us going is that daily,

1365
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:05,520
we are saving the human race

1366
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:08,200
from getting wiped out of existence.

1367
00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:13,180
We're going to give you the same information newcomers get,

1368
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:17,260
which is a phone number, and he reaches in his pocket,

1369
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:20,340
and he pulls out a card, and it's got a phone number on it,

1370
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:23,220
and she says, now you give them a call

1371
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:26,220
if things get completely out of hand,

1372
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:28,900
or they will call in 48 hours if you don't.

1373
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:33,900
I hate to do it like this, but this is your problem now.

1374
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:35,940
I'm gonna leave this bag here with you.

1375
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:40,260
Anything you put in it disappears.

1376
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:44,860
This bag, we do not know what it does

1377
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:47,720
or what it is capable of outside of that,

1378
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:51,120
but we do know that it seems to make things

1379
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:55,940
that we need to not be on this world anymore.

1380
00:54:55,940 --> 00:54:57,740
It makes them gone.

1381
00:54:57,740 --> 00:55:00,600
Very few have heard of it, even fewer believe it,

1382
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:03,840
but we've all seen today, all of us for the first time,

1383
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:07,800
that Agent Victor's Nike bag is legit.

1384
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:09,460
I'm going to leave it with you all,

1385
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:11,400
and you can drop it at a secure location

1386
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:14,300
when the job is done, and he says,

1387
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:16,880
and I'd like my gun back, please.

1388
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:20,080
I turn and look back at Keith.

1389
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:21,480
The whole time she was talking,

1390
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:25,440
I was just slowly lowering my gun and jaw dropping.

1391
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:28,220
I'm kind of slowly realizing what's been going on

1392
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:29,800
the past few days and putting it together,

1393
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:33,720
and gun is holstered, and I'm kind of just staring off.

1394
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:36,840
I turn back and go ahead and hand him his gun.

1395
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:39,160
Good luck, and they walk out.

1396
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:44,120
Guys, we're fucking X-Files now.

1397
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:49,120
["How Am I the Only One Trying to Pull Over"]

1398
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:05,400
How am I the only one trying to pull over?

1399
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:13,040
How can you have enough drowning out

1400
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:18,920
of the noise?

1401
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:23,000
There's no one more home.

1402
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:27,600
No one more home.

1403
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:31,000
No one more home.

1404
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,080
Fly, fly, to the stream.
