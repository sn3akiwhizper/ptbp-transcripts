1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,760
What's up everybody? It's Zach. I am Zach and I want to pop in here real quick before this,

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:12,720
the finale of season one with a few announcements. First, this is the last episode. I worked really

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:18,480
hard on it. We've had a stupid amount of fun making this show and we are super proud of what

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:24,560
we've created together this season. Thank you each and every one of you for listening, telling your

5
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:30,320
friends, posting about the show, creating art based on these characters. I really truly didn't

6
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:37,280
expect it. This community absolutely rules. Next, we're going to do a couple Q&A episodes here on

7
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:45,120
the main feed. So please comment your questions in the stickied post on the subreddit or you can tag

8
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:54,400
at pretending pod on Twitter and use the hashtag PTBPQ. That is hashtag PTBPQ in order to give you

9
00:00:54,400 --> 00:01:00,080
time to ponder what questions to fling at us and in order to give me some time to catch up on some

10
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:07,040
things. Those Q&A episodes should come out October 22nd and October 29th. So if you have any

11
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:13,120
questions, comments, or compliments, find that post in the subreddit or tag us on Twitter at pretending

12
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:22,480
pod with the hashtag PTBPQ. Hashtag PTBPQ. Finally, we are changing one of our Patreon tiers.

13
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:29,680
A Splashylvania Fastpass is still only $5. You still get access to all 24 of our bonus episodes

14
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:37,680
and it's still only $6.66 if you want the same stuff but also you're rad. The cover charge at

15
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:44,240
the Den of Sin is still $15 if you dare join us behind the scenes as we record our Patreon bonus

16
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:49,040
episodes and we finish out those streams by hanging out with the chat and playing some Jackbox.

17
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:57,760
But there's a new tier in town. For $25, you can join the Circle of Knowledge Shirt Club.

18
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:03,120
Once you're in the Circle of Knowledge Shirt Club, you can choose and receive a Patreon exclusive

19
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:09,680
shirt from a rotating pool of designs like the Splashylvania Vampire on a Surfboard shirt,

20
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:17,040
the four items from the Trunk shirt, and the Den of Sin Juice Box shirt. These pieces were created

21
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:24,400
respectively by Sean McFarland at slide.whistle and Andy Corbett. Check him out on Instagram,

22
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:30,000
Twitter, Facebook, or Patreon and then follow these dope artists and support them too.

23
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,840
And here's a sweet little deal for those of you listening as this is being released. If you join

24
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,840
the Circle of Knowledge Shirt Club or a higher tier in the month of October,

25
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:47,360
we'll count this month as your second month in that tier. A whole month closer to that sweet,

26
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:55,520
sweet t-shirt. And extra finally, we are going to do a live stream for all our patrons over at

27
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:03,200
patreon.com slash pretending pod this upcoming Tuesday, October 12th at 9pm central time. Taylor

28
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:08,560
and I brought back some snacks from Korea for the boys to try, so join us for a super relaxed hang

29
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:14,080
for a couple hours. We'll try some snacks, shoot the shit, and answer some questions. That stream

30
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:22,000
and a link to the playback will be available to all patrons. So, make it happen. And as Wolf says,

31
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,400
all the links are in the show notes. Now, back to you, Wolfie. Wolfie, Wolfie.

32
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:37,520
Well, well, well. Look who finally showed up to the grease pit. It's you, my beautiful child.

33
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:46,080
Join me in the barrel. Take a load off. Uh, wait, no, don't. Get hyped. Because you are

34
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:55,040
tuned into the biggest, baddest radio station on this dimensions block. 694.2 PTBP.

35
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:03,520
We got a new Howlin' with Wolf this week, and it comes from someone named Curtain Plastic,

36
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:09,360
who did the most damnedest, gosh darn dirtiest, delicious, dutiful thing you can do.

37
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:17,520
She wrote us a five-star review on Apple Podcasts. Hell yeah, dude. She writes,

38
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:23,200
I would like to shout out my D&D group, who I hope will soon dive into the world of Delta

39
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:33,120
Green with me. Shout out to my two amazing DMs, Zach and Nick. To my fellow player, Will,

40
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:40,960
and to the love of my life, who I'm honored to roleplay in more than one way with Lucas.

41
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:47,520
Also, shout out to Zach, Luke, Joe, Thomas, and Justin for all the hard work and time

42
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:55,360
y'all have put into this. Y'all are fucking killing it. Well, thanks, Curtain Plastic.

43
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:02,960
But I, uh, can't help but notice that you didn't include little old Wolfie in your shout out list.

44
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm gonna assume it's because, uh, we all just know who really makes the show so great.

45
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:17,200
It's, uh, me is who. And my producer, somewhat, I guess. And now I want to let it be known,

46
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:25,200
I have never been invited to a D&D group. Not a single time. And I still don't really know

47
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:32,160
what the hell y'all are doing in these groups. And honestly, it freaks me the freak out. So I never

48
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:39,200
ask. Y'all, when Instagram went down, a part of me rejoiced because finally all of y'all were living

49
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:45,600
in Wolfie's world. The other part of me that is bound by my producer's contract is here to tell

50
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:52,560
you to follow along and tag the show at pretending pod. There's even a handy link in the show notes

51
00:05:52,560 --> 00:06:04,640
for now. Because the internet, Gambino Nice, might go down again. Ooh, spooky.

52
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:13,920
We're proud to have a new sponsor here at 694.2 PTBP. I think this sponsor is very good and

53
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:21,680
necessary. So this week's news segment is brought to you by Fuck Mark Zuckerberg. It's time for the

54
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:29,600
news. Last time, Keith turned into Keith's and eliminated the threat of the wormy ceiling.

55
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:37,040
Pretty straightforward stuff, I'd say. And now for the last time, an absolute banger.

56
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:41,200
It's Dragon in Three with What Kind of World Are You Living In?

57
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:55,600
Bad girls on top of the water. Mary and Caroline, I'm on the borderline.

58
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:04,320
Leaving my mind at your altar. Crossing the double line, doing it every time. Tell me what

59
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:17,440
kind of world are you living in? What kind of world are you living in?

60
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,880
Was that your fingers? That's like definitely 30 seconds.

61
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,640
I didn't think it was going to be that loud.

62
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:34,800
Dude, why would you do anything that made sound?

63
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,440
Because I was like, I don't know. In the only 30 seconds.

64
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:48,000
This will be an excellent time to pop my nuts. Honestly, that's the thought that went through

65
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,280
my mind. I'm like, I'm going to do it right now. It's nice and quiet now.

66
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,160
It's going to be so loud. I think maybe subconsciously I was like,

67
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,080
let's see how loud it is. When you were a kid at school and

68
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:05,120
they made you do 30 seconds of silence at school, did you pop your knuckles during that?

69
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:11,440
No, I was a super follow the rules kind of kid. Before they recorded your glasses?

70
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,040
What the fuck are you talking about? Well, you got to get room noise.

71
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,800
Just one day out of the year really needed room noise.

72
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,840
I'm recording you all. Class, as you know, it's September 11th today and we need to get room

73
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,960
noise. Class, as you know, this is a two-party consent state, so I am informing you that you

74
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:34,240
are being recorded. If any of you little fuckers have a problem with that, you speak up now.

75
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,920
And then they read Where the Redfern Grows audiobook. They're recording the audiobook.

76
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,000
Yeah. Damn it.

77
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,680
All right, you guys ready to start? No.

78
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,520
Am I on a big TV again? Yeah.

79
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,760
Yeah. Am I full screen?

80
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,560
You are. You're like almost life-sized. You're like three-quarter Justin.

81
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:02,000
Your beard mustache looks incredible. There's not really a beard anymore, right?

82
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,800
Well, it's like chops. Chops mustache.

83
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,000
Yeah. Burns mustache.

84
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,920
When this is gone, is a beard a beard if there is no chin in the hair?

85
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,280
You don't have a beard. No, you have long side burns into a mustache with a little dopey.

86
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:17,120
Dude, your mustache connects to your burns. I think you've got a beard.

87
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,560
I don't think you have a beard. Oh, is that the differentiator?

88
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,440
I would call what you have right now. I wouldn't call it a beard.

89
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,240
Almost a beard. I don't know. I would call it a beard.

90
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,360
I disagree. You don't have a beard right now. It's a variety of beard.

91
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,200
I like it though. This internet website

92
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:38,880
claims that that style of facial hair is called Friendly Mutton Chops.

93
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,960
Oh, I don't like that name at all. I do.

94
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:47,920
I feel like mutton chops, once you've got chops, that's a beard, not just sideburns.

95
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:57,040
I feel like mutton chops are not grown down. If your hair was longer, you know what I mean?

96
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,120
If you think of a dude with a mutton chop thing. I'm thinking Red Dead style mutton chops.

97
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,160
We'll have to take a group picture. If you take the mutton chops down to a two,

98
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,840
then you've got what he's got. Those are lamb chops.

99
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,000
You've got lamb chops. I like lamb chops.

100
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,880
Gentlemen, lamb chops. We'll have to take a group picture with the TV.

101
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,760
Yes. That'll be fun.

102
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,240
Oh, goodness.

103
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,880
Oh, it just froze on Zach whenever you went, like when you started laughing and it faded.

104
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,920
It went like... You went like...

105
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,320
Get a good Jimmy Carr laugh in there.

106
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,080
That's not... It's a little bit...

107
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:48,080
It starts... He's hawking from the beginning.

108
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,400
It's more staccato though. There's bigger breaks.

109
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,840
It sounds so fake.

110
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,640
Not knowing what Jimmy Carr's laugh sounds like.

111
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,200
Did we nail it?

112
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,160
That was great.

113
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,480
It's a weird thing, but I didn't even notice that was a thing until I saw that video,

114
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,600
like compilation of it.

115
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,680
I was like, he's got a hearty laugh. He's a jovial man.

116
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,920
And then I saw that and I was like, oh yeah, that's fucking weird.

117
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,960
We've come to the end, guys.

118
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,760
I mean, we're not there yet. We have an episode to go.

119
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,320
But this is that.

120
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,360
This is that episode.

121
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,000
Is this 113?

122
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,080
I bet we can drag this out for two or three more.

123
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,920
I don't think so, man.

124
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:41,680
When we started, I don't know what number I had in my head, but I don't think it was this many.

125
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,680
For one season.

126
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,320
I think I told you guys in the forties, mid forties.

127
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,320
I'm glad it's been this long, though.

128
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,360
We've done a lot of stuff.

129
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,960
It's also been a running thing that you would often say to us,

130
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,360
okay, this next part's going to take an episode.

131
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,520
And then that next part would be five episodes.

132
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:05,840
That's also a running thing from our very first role-playing games together,

133
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,600
where you're like, I think this will take an evening.

134
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,040
And then it took a month.

135
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,160
Exactly, yep.

136
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:10,960
Oh yeah.

137
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:14,720
Yeah, I forget if it was like a couple episodes ago or whatever,

138
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,960
but listening to it where it was like, yeah, this whole time, five days.

139
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,600
Five days, yeah, right.

140
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,240
Which thing?

141
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,080
We did go back in time a couple times.

142
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,440
That's true.

143
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,800
It's more like a few hundred years.

144
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,520
We had to offshoot.

145
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:30,960
This one in particular makes sense for as far as five days ago.

146
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,240
We relived that one afternoon.

147
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:34,740
A lot.

148
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:40,560
At least we never went to a Waffle House and made our orders in character,

149
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,200
like we made Zach listen to one time at our home session.

150
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,080
It was like the first campaign that we were running,

151
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:52,080
and before you even dove into the scenario at hall,

152
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,080
you were like, our characters are probably hungry.

153
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,360
It was when we thought about sleeping and eating food.

154
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,960
So I was like, okay, let's go to this Waffle House.

155
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,800
And I wanted pancakes.

156
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,040
You guys want to go to Waffle House after this?

157
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:05,540
No.

158
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,360
Luke wanted pancakes, so then they had to go across the street.

159
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,400
I think it was the pancake palace, I'm pretty sure.

160
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,720
Yeah, it wasn't a Waffle House, it was a pancake palace.

161
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:21,440
And then we went through a full round of ordering breakfast foods and drinks

162
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,960
where I just played your server.

163
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,680
Did you like that?

164
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,960
Yes, it's my favorite role-playing moment of all time.

165
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,240
I wish I was at Waffle House right now,

166
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,640
and I'm pretty pissed Luke said he didn't want to get it after this.

167
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:40,880
You didn't want to celebrate the end of recording season one with a trip to Waffle House?

168
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,760
That is so incomprehensible to me.

169
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,040
I eat Waffle House for lunch sometimes,

170
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,040
because it's like right down the street from my work,

171
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,200
and I'm sad every time I do.

172
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,640
Are you getting dope waffles and eggs,

173
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,960
or are you getting a sensible lunch meal?

174
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,640
No, I get breakfast food every time.

175
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,600
Breakfast food.

176
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,720
Breakfast food.

177
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,760
Breakfast food?

178
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,960
If you don't like their eggs, hash browns, and waffles...

179
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,120
Hey, I'm not saying I don't like it.

180
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:15,120
I'm saying when I go there by myself at 12 30 on a Tuesday,

181
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,400
I'm a little bit sad.

182
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:16,960
You get the blue mood.

183
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,680
Yeah, but is that like a pre-existing condition or...

184
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,840
I get the blue mood and the waitress comes up she's like,

185
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,960
you got sweaty blood.

186
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,040
Okay.

187
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,960
I know, give me the fucking hash browns.

188
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:32,080
You're telling me you still have the blue mood after the waitress calls you hun.

189
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,680
Yeah, I say I want the hash browns chopped and screwed.

190
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,760
What is your Waffle House hash brown order, Joe?

191
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,840
Smothered, covered, diced, I think is what I do.

192
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,240
Luke?

193
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,920
Smothered, covered, capped.

194
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,720
Smothered, covered.

195
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,760
Scattered, covered, smothered.

196
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,320
What, scattered?

197
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:51,520
Crispy.

198
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,440
Where it's all crispy, yeah.

199
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,800
So I think that's a holdover, because you can ask for ring also.

200
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,800
I think you get scattered if you don't ask for ring.

201
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,800
No, it specifically says scattered like crispy.

202
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,920
Because they make it thinner so that it all gets the even coating.

203
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,440
I like the crisp on top and I like that little mushy underneath.

204
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,680
I like a little mush to it.

205
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,200
I like almost like a cake, like a latke.

206
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,240
Justin, do you have a Waffle House hash brown order?

207
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,160
I just get them extra crispy and then I throw salt and pepper and ketchup on them,

208
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,120
because I'm a monster.

209
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,960
I throw a Tabasco sauce on there.

210
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,080
Tabasco, that's right.

211
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,600
A little hot sauce too, yeah.

212
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,200
I generally like to mix them up with my over-easy eggs

213
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,640
and get all that yolk up in the hash browns.

214
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,600
There's your problem, dude.

215
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,760
You're not getting them scrambled cheesy eggs.

216
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,400
I'm a big mix all your food together type of guy.

217
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:38,880
Hard saying.

218
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,920
Yeah, my eggs go right on top of those hash browns as soon as it arrives.

219
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,720
Flop them.

220
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,600
Flop them on top.

221
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,680
Dude, I went to W.F. Cody's for lunch today.

222
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,720
Love W.F. Cody's.

223
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,840
I ordered a half pound Larry Burger, which is-

224
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,720
That's the one to get.

225
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,200
Yeah, with American cheese, fried egg.

226
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,960
It was packed in there.

227
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,200
I had to like sit at the bar at a-

228
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,520
You found this tiny chair that was just sitting in the corner.

229
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,480
Well, I was sitting right next to the touch tunes thing,

230
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,080
which is super fucking annoying,

231
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,800
because there was a bunch of drunk people in there at-

232
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,600
This is lunch?

233
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,640
This is 1230.

234
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,920
Oh, it's W.F. Cody's.

235
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,420
Yeah.

236
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,240
Bunch of drunk people playing pool like trying to like shove me out of the way

237
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,160
so that they could play their touch tunes next.

238
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,360
Anyway, she brings out the full pound burger and I'm like,

239
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,880
I didn't order that.

240
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,160
And she's like, oh, sorry.

241
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,760
I just rang it in wrong.

242
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,240
Did you want to eat all this meat?

243
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:37,600
I'm like, I eat it, but I don't want to pay seven extra dollars for it.

244
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,520
And she's like, just eat it.

245
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:43,120
I ate the whole fucking thing and I felt like shit all the rest of the day.

246
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:43,760
Yeah, dude.

247
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,120
Half a pound is like too big.

248
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,080
Half a pound is a lot, man.

249
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:50,400
I ate a whole one pound burger and most of the fries that came with it.

250
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,160
Well, I guess it's a double quarter pounder.

251
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,120
Hungry boy.

252
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,160
I ate a quadruple quarter pounder.

253
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:56,660
Yeah.

254
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:05,040
I actually celebrated my 21st birthday at W.F. Cody's when I was 18 years old.

255
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:09,040
At 1230 in the afternoon.

256
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:14,640
We went in and like, they just sang me happy birthday and we did the whole thing

257
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,640
and they brought shots out for us.

258
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,400
Well, you just said you were 21.

259
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,920
We could probably go do that now.

260
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:23,520
Who's turning 21?

261
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:23,920
You?

262
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,320
Sure.

263
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:24,560
Yeah.

264
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,120
Whatever.

265
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,720
As long as you're singing happy birthday.

266
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,480
I mean, if anybody's turning 21, it's me.

267
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,600
Yeah, it would be Lukey.

268
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,480
And I would say just give me a full one pound burger.

269
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,360
I'm down to eat two pounds of meat today.

270
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,720
Two pounds of burger today.

271
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,800
Okay, so we've got you guys in this realm that you've been in.

272
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,920
I think that was good for an episode.

273
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,760
Okay, yeah, let's wrap it here.

274
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,960
Let's 113.

275
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,080
We'll see you all.

276
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,840
It'll be a couple of weeks before 114.

277
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,960
Actually, I think finale 120.

278
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,840
That sounds good.

279
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:57,680
I think finale 120 and the next, what, six episodes recap of the whole thing.

280
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,200
And then we'll do the finale.

281
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:03,760
The actual finale.

282
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,640
Well, no, no, no.

283
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,520
What I think we should do is this should just be the finale.

284
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,160
We'll see how that goes.

285
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,720
We'll put that out and be like episode 113 is the finale and then never release an episode.

286
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,760
Oh, that's fun.

287
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,880
That's a lot of fun.

288
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:28,000
That would really fuck with some people disappear and become like insurance salesman and

289
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,400
bankers, bankers, bankers.

290
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:40,480
It's so, so, so dark in this waffle house.

291
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,720
I feel God.

292
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,880
In this waffle house.

293
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,920
I'm going to be an asshole and say, I got to, let me just piss before we actually

294
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:55,760
get into the, we're in a good, like we're rolling here.

295
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,320
It's been hot.

296
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:10,400
It is so dark here and you feel so content and so strange this whole time you felt this way,

297
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:18,640
but there was so much going on, so much stress, so much noise, so many threats challenging

298
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,400
what the rest of your lives, your existence will be.

299
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,480
Not only your existence, but the existence of everyone you've ever known.

300
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:31,120
And not only the individuals that you've come into contact with, but every version

301
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,840
of those individuals and every version of yourselves.

302
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,600
That's all been at risk until now.

303
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:46,880
The voices of the Keiths ring out almost infinitely.

304
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,720
It's just one of them eating it.

305
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:58,000
They've somehow manifested it into all of their hands.

306
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:58,880
Okay.

307
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,280
Now it brought the Oreo McFlurry in the first place.

308
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,800
You think myriad can't get itself an Oreo fucking McFlurry.

309
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:10,240
So Keith, as myriad, have you changed the physical appearance of

310
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,040
these creatures?

311
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:18,960
As a myriad was popping in, they were popping in in the form of Keith.

312
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:29,120
Keith, who was in the body of the myriad that he had switched into within seconds, minutes,

313
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,880
had switched forms.

314
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:40,240
Every myriad is Keith, but Keith's body, inhabited by myriad, is also still Keith.

315
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,040
Right.

316
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:45,600
So do you know where that is, or has he wandered off into the crowd of Keiths?

317
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,400
Oh, no.

318
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,320
He's the only one without a McFlurry.

319
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:48,560
Yeah.

320
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:49,920
Yes.

321
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:57,120
The only Keith without a McFlurry is myriad Keith, and Keiths are keeping an eye on it.

322
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,320
As he was copping about trying to get used to his body,

323
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:06,240
Keith in the body of myriad just slides by and lifts the McFlurry out of his hand.

324
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,840
Oh, yeah.

325
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:14,480
Well, as soon as myriad Keiths took the McFlurry out of Keith,

326
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,560
then every myriad Keith had a McFlurry in there.

327
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,160
Had a McFlurry, of course.

328
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,440
What are the Keiths wearing?

329
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,440
Refer back to episode one of pretending to be people.

330
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,320
I just did.

331
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,200
Police uniform.

332
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,080
Pants are too big.

333
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:30,720
Big old bridges.

334
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,600
Big old bridges.

335
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,280
Well, most of them are wearing that.

336
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:39,120
Some of them are wearing too tight polo with way too big cargo shorts.

337
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:44,320
Some are wearing the other things that Keith has worn throughout.

338
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,200
Are there any other classic Keith outfits?

339
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,920
Well, are there any Dan Flashes Keiths as a little wink to Keith's creator, Luke?

340
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:55,120
Some of the Keiths look at some of the new ones popping in and they're like,

341
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,040
that's a really complicated shirt.

342
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:02,320
As Keith gets more confident in manifesting the myriads, he's getting fancier and fancier.

343
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,320
They're becoming more like the true vision that Keith has of himself.

344
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:14,240
And literally by the second, there's 10, 20, 40, 1,000, 10,000 Keiths popping in.

345
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,640
But the one Keith without the McFlurry is copping around.

346
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,480
And main Keith sits him down on the ground.

347
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,360
And Keith is like pointing his two fingers at his eyes.

348
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:36,820
Yeah.

349
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:44,740
Okay.

350
00:22:48,640 --> 00:23:03,600
And when you look around at the boys, you see a chanting luminous land liturgy still keeping up

351
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:08,560
with overclocking this Clark Bishop that has become the overseer.

352
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,680
And you also see Clark Bishop standing nearby.

353
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,600
You see Planet Juggernaut who is being topped by...

354
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:21,360
That's not what I meant.

355
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,880
Did you mean perhaps mounted?

356
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,380
Mounted.

357
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,720
Yeah, ridden hard by...

358
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,120
A word with no connotation whatsoever.

359
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:38,880
Mounted by this John that has been created out of himself, out of this muck that is dark

360
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,840
and just wondrous collection of colors.

361
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:46,160
Some of which the human eye, your specific human eyes have never been able to comprehend

362
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,840
before are twisted in.

363
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,400
You know what?

364
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:54,000
As much as it sparkles and flashes, there's two little extra bright spots for his eyes.

365
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:54,800
Oh, I love that.

366
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,800
And he's got a cowboy hat mounting his head.

367
00:23:59,440 --> 00:23:59,940
Yeah.

368
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,360
Topping his head.

369
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,760
That is the group that you see.

370
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:13,200
The only people who are here who are not chanting, the bodies of both Drew Pages...

371
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,400
Fuck me.

372
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,760
Drew Pages and Carrie...

373
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,000
Drew Andrews and Carrie Pages.

374
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,680
Keith is looking around for people that aren't Keith and he's getting pretty fucking confused

375
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,760
because he's seeing lots of different kinds of Keiths.

376
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:31,520
He's seeing fancy Keiths, expensive shirt Keiths.

377
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,960
He's seeing big pants Keiths.

378
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,960
And he's like, sits down, closes his eyes.

379
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,160
All of a sudden there's only one Keith.

380
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,360
Cool.

381
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:41,920
Nice.

382
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:45,520
Don, you have just, I mean...

383
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,400
Well, so the John sacrificed itself.

384
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,080
So I think that was the ball.

385
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:50,560
Yeah.

386
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,600
So that ball is torched.

387
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,960
I think you're released.

388
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:53,360
Yeah.

389
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:57,760
Don is his own man now, once again.

390
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,640
Yeah, as you see that skeleton of your brother or nephew.

391
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:05,040
What does it look like when a, when a ball burns out?

392
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,400
Has that happened before?

393
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:11,200
No, it's just this charred one inch in diameter sphere.

394
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,200
Like a bad marshmallow.

395
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,840
I'm thinking of like, you know, when you burn one of those snake fireworks.

396
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,440
That's what the whole deal looks like.

397
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,160
Yeah.

398
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:23,360
That's what I was imagining because as the huge legs, I was wondering if it just like...

399
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:24,640
Yeah.

400
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,240
It's all been kind of floating above you.

401
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,640
And then it just, it just collapses to the ground.

402
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,400
All made out of that snake firework material.

403
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:32,880
Yes.

404
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,600
Pure carbon.

405
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:40,720
Don is like absolutely exhausted and kind of like on his hands and knees on the ground

406
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:45,920
after using all of his, as much magic as he's ever used in that short amount of time

407
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,120
in his entire life.

408
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,840
Just emotionally overwhelmed by everything.

409
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:55,920
I think he's kind of taken a breather in this second after just the complete,

410
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,160
completely overwhelmed by everything.

411
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:02,880
The wand is still in his hand and he feels a fiery glow from it for a moment.

412
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,000
And then that fiery glow.

413
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,000
No, he's alive in that one.

414
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,080
Not alive.

415
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:10,960
There's something.

416
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,400
He's got a special magic wand now.

417
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,640
Special John, a magic John wand.

418
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,520
If you want a wand, you get your magic John wand.

419
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,200
I know the discord said they liked when we sing,

420
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,280
but it doesn't mean it's just like always good when we sing.

421
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:25,600
Wow.

422
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,840
Magic John, if you want to John have your magic John one.

423
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:35,120
If you had a John ever magic John one, if you want to John have your magic John one.

424
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,300
Wow.

425
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,720
That was impressive.

426
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:44,320
Keith is sitting there like he's hearing this from some like alternative plane.

427
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,280
He's like, what the fuck is going on here?

428
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,240
He's hearing the magic John one song.

429
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:57,120
Amongst every other song that we've ever sang.

430
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,880
Yeah, key that up now Zach.

431
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,380
Fuck you.

432
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:06,480
Can Don in fact feel like the presence of John in this?

433
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,840
Yeah, you can feel John in this wand.

434
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,120
I feel God in this waffle house.

435
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:12,560
Nailed it.

436
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:15,600
I think it's just, you feel, you know, you've got like a magic sword.

437
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:21,520
I think Don clutches it close to his chest kind of as he's like crumpled over a little bit

438
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:25,840
with like the little embers still burning a little bit from the wand.

439
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:26,900
Drew!

440
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,060
Drew!

441
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,400
Don't you know everything?

442
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,600
Can't you just look at him?

443
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,440
Keith is not.

444
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,200
He's not grown accustomed to.

445
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:44,640
It's been literally seconds or minutes since he's been in this.

446
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,840
The body of Kerry pages runs up to you and is like, hello.

447
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,640
Hello, sir.

448
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,280
Oh my God.

449
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,640
Oh my God.

450
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,840
It is so good to see.

451
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,720
And they'll shut up.

452
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:59,120
And Keith is just like rubbing his head because in Keith's mind he's just hearing things from

453
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,400
different planes of reality and it's really fucking him up.

454
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,040
And he points at the radio.

455
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:08,960
Get Kerry.

456
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,160
Get Kerry.

457
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,800
Councilwoman Kerry pages here.

458
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,440
And if you are willing to make.

459
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:15,940
Shut up.

460
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:22,320
And Keith pops up and just hands the radio to Drew.

461
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,080
Pushes the two together and flips the switch.

462
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,200
How are you powering it?

463
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,280
It's still broken technically.

464
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,880
So it needs some ooze inside.

465
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,320
Three or four Keith's pop up handfuls of ooze.

466
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,680
They slam some ooze into this glass chamber that's shattered.

467
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:46,000
But they put the ooze just in enough to where the light flips.

468
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:46,800
Turns green.

469
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,720
Green light lit on this radio.

470
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:57,440
A bright flash lights up and you see shadows of each of you in the endless horizon.

471
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:04,560
And because there's nothing to stop the light really for an almost indeterminate amount

472
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:11,280
of space away from you, your shadows all light up and look enormous.

473
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,160
Surrounding this place.

474
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:14,720
That's cool.

475
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,640
And in the darkness.

476
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:20,660
Fellas.

477
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,520
Oh my God, it's me.

478
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,960
It's me and I'm inside me.

479
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,960
The younger of the Clarks goes running up to him and grabbing him by the shoulders.

480
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,400
And he's smiling big.

481
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,280
Drew, Drew.

482
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,320
Bubblegum tree.

483
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,520
Bubblegum tree.

484
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,240
But we did it.

485
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,520
It gives you a huge hug.

486
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,160
We did it.

487
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:43,360
Muck John descends down in front of him and tips his cowboy hat and says, welcome back.

488
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,080
John, John, you're, you're amazing.

489
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,760
I know, bud.

490
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,480
Look at you.

491
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,120
Oh, look at all of you.

492
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,800
Oh, you did so good.

493
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:56,960
Oh my God.

494
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,920
And then he starts transforming before your eyes.

495
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:05,120
And his tentacles come out of his head.

496
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,240
Drew Thulu.

497
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:16,560
A million keys come out and just suffocate.

498
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:20,880
Thank you.

499
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,160
Thank you so much.

500
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:29,280
Officer Bishop, you have, and she's crying and you hear through this darkness, these

501
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,160
licks, these.

502
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,920
Oh, Oh Tyler.

503
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,560
Oh Tyler.

504
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,440
You're so good.

505
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,240
Oh my goodness.

506
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,600
I put a hand on her shoulder.

507
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,080
I told you I'd find him.

508
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:42,880
Oh, thank you.

509
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,520
You've saved my contention.

510
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:48,720
Okay.

511
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,280
So if we're here, are we here forever?

512
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,240
Do we set up?

513
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,680
What's first a post office?

514
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,000
Overseer starts walking over.

515
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:04,240
Well, I, I guess, I guess it's up to us at this point, what happens now.

516
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:11,200
But, uh, I think with the help of Mir, Mir, Miria, Keith here, Keith, Keith Reed,

517
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:16,720
Keith, Keith is like sitting cross-legged on the ground, like rubbing his temples.

518
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,480
Like looks like he's in pain.

519
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:23,200
I think with, uh, with his help here, I think, I think I can, I can handle some, some rebuilding

520
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,560
and I think he can probably navigate better than I can.

521
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:29,440
I think we can set things right at this point.

522
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,600
Because Keith beans is, is now a Heinz mind.

523
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:35,540
Yeah.

524
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,260
Yeah.

525
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,280
Close enough.

526
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,080
Close enough, Drew.

527
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:44,640
Or maybe he's, when there's a bunch of them, he's the creatures of the black legume.

528
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,840
No, that was actually great.

529
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:46,880
Because of the beans.

530
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,160
That's a good, that's a really good one.

531
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,200
You like that one?

532
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:49,840
That's really good.

533
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,040
Those are the only two I have.

534
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,240
God, it's good to see you again.

535
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,600
And Overseer gives him a hug.

536
00:31:55,280 --> 00:32:01,520
Oh, and Drew is just like, oh man, in this like triangle hug between the two Clark Bishops.

537
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,880
His face is just poking through and between their shoulders and looking up to this muck

538
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,520
John.

539
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:12,240
Who slips a tentacle of who's in there and like pats his back.

540
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,240
You know, you, uh, you didn't do what I told you to do.

541
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,520
You ended up going to Maggie's and he looks angry for a second.

542
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,240
Yeah.

543
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,440
And then he smiles.

544
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,120
It brought us here though, I guess.

545
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,760
Uh, I'm sorry.

546
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,840
All's well that ends well.

547
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,800
I was really scared.

548
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,320
I've been scared for so long.

549
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:37,760
Five days.

550
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,240
It's a long time when you're trapped inside a council woman.

551
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,520
A lot of responsibility.

552
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,480
Oh my goodness.

553
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,280
The meetings.

554
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:53,600
As, as everybody's talking, Keith is like starting to turn pale and like sweating.

555
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:59,520
And the whole area is starting to kind of rumble a little bit.

556
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,600
Keith, you, uh, you okay over there?

557
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,640
We got to get out of here.

558
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:03,840
Why?

559
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:04,080
Why?

560
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,160
This can be our home.

561
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,520
This, I mean, it's not much to look at.

562
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:16,880
I can hear so many things from everywhere and I think we just need to get back.

563
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,280
I just don't want to hear all of this anymore.

564
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:22,240
It's your old Keith almighty situation.

565
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,000
I hope it's Bruce and not Evan.

566
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:30,400
I mean, yeah, I guess you, you're kind of are the sequel to myriad though.

567
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:34,880
So you might be Evan.

568
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,800
I myself, John Lee Pennymore.

569
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,440
I liked them.

570
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:43,440
Keith's eyes open up wide and he's like, we have to get out of here.

571
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,160
I will not be Evan almighty.

572
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:51,920
All right, well let's Steve corral everyone up and then let's get out of here.

573
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:52,800
Wow.

574
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:54,800
You're really laying them down.

575
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,320
You're positively giddy to be back in your body.

576
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:02,000
Boys, boys, boys, boys, what do we want to do?

577
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:04,800
Where do we want to go?

578
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,360
We can do anything.

579
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:12,720
We being me, but also we being us.

580
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:19,280
Overseer saying, well, yeah, uh, we, we, we can, we can do, we can do whatever, whatever

581
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,720
we, we want.

582
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,880
And he turns to younger Clark.

583
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:32,720
I'm, uh, I'm not, I'm not sure that you can, I think, uh, I think you need to do the things

584
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:36,560
that I did because that's how I ended up here.

585
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,600
Somebody, somebody has to be the overseer when this all happens.

586
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:45,680
When it happened, it's, it's the short end of the stick.

587
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:52,000
It's, uh, it's not, uh, it's not ideal, but, uh, as he's saying all this to Clark, there's

588
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,520
not a single thing in his face that gives away anything.

589
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,840
He is smiling broad and big.

590
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,800
And he goes, yeah, dude, no, of course.

591
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:05,200
Uh, that's, uh, I had already thought about that and I'm, I'm looking forward to it.

592
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,680
I, I, I, I'm the, I, I win.

593
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,720
I'm the, I'm the savior.

594
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,240
I'm the, I'm the guy who does everything.

595
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:16,400
I, it's, I become you and then you work with me in the future and cool.

596
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,520
Send me where you need me to.

597
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,720
Just, just shoot me away.

598
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,120
I'm good.

599
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,720
I'm I've got plans.

600
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,840
I know I need to run and to tell Drew something sometime.

601
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,720
I'll, I'll write them down.

602
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,760
I'll write down all the notes.

603
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,240
I got it.

604
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,440
I got it.

605
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,240
Just shoot me on.

606
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,480
I'm ready to go.

607
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:36,160
As soon as he says that, a, a Keith pops up behind him with like this, uh, kind of almost

608
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:41,760
like golden robe with a very long hood and just, you know, the one you've been seeing

609
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:46,080
the overseer wear this whole time and places it over.

610
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,400
Clark said, well, that's, that's an upgrade.

611
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,400
It looks good on you though.

612
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,240
The Keith pops out of existence.

613
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,120
Clark, that just, uh, just take it easy out there.

614
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:04,160
It's a, it's a long, long, long road, but I got you set up over in that tower over there.

615
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,920
You should be, you should be, have all the things you need there.

616
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,200
That's kind of your home base.

617
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,240
That's where I set up.

618
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,400
It's a, it's up to you now.

619
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:11,360
Cool.

620
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:11,680
Right on.

621
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,960
I'll, I'll, uh, you guys, uh, Hey, it was great working with you guys.

622
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,360
Uh, I'm glad, I'm, I'm glad it ended up the way it did.

623
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:24,480
Uh, Keith, uh, congratulations on your new found powers and John.

624
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:28,240
And it's been the ride of a lifetime or several.

625
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,560
Is this it Clark?

626
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,280
That's it.

627
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:31,840
Yeah.

628
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,720
Afraid so.

629
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,080
I mean, I'll see you guys a lot coming up.

630
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:40,800
Uh, there's a lot of, a lot of looping and resetting and I, I kind of, I kind of twiddle

631
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,440
my fingers in there.

632
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:45,280
You guys remember, but I guess you won't know that it's me then.

633
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:46,800
It's it's all right.

634
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,880
I'm, I'm sure I'll get used to it.

635
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:56,320
Keith stands up and feeling pretty emotional thinking that he might not see Clark for maybe

636
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:01,840
not ever again, but maybe not for a little while and kind of loses control of his emotions

637
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:08,480
and hundreds of thousands of Keith's appear behind him and they all, you know, our little

638
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:13,600
tear running down their face and Keith reaches his hand out to Clark.

639
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:17,120
Clark slaps it away and brings him in for a big old Clark bear hug.

640
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,800
And Keith just hugs him as tight as he can.

641
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,680
Two or three other Keith's come in and hug him too.

642
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,640
It's a dog pile.

643
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,640
John, John, get on in here.

644
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:39,120
Like iridescent tears are streaming down his face and, um, he, he makes himself look a

645
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,160
little more like John.

646
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:46,720
It's less the goo, the goo world, John, and he kind of manifests the John you knew on

647
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:50,800
the first day of all this, at least, you know, in the bust.

648
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,520
Right.

649
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,280
But it's still mostly a goo body.

650
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,960
But it looks like John Lee Pettymore the third.

651
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,680
Oh, it's, uh, it's good to see.

652
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,960
I haven't seen that face in a while.

653
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,280
That's a, that's a good, that's a good.

654
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:03,520
Yeah.

655
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,400
Well, shut up, baby.

656
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:04,720
I know.

657
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:11,840
A fifth, a fifth Keith comes in behind John and pushes him into the group hug.

658
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,800
John breaks down.

659
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,600
He hugs back, but he's just like heaving.

660
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,000
You can't hear him crying, but he's just convulsing.

661
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:20,320
Yeah.

662
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:26,800
Uh, the extra Keith's fade away and it's just the three, the three of us group hugging.

663
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:33,200
And then Keith steps back and, well, if you're gonna, if you're gonna stay here, John, what

664
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:33,840
are you gonna do?

665
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,440
I'm of this world.

666
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:41,600
I think I might try to go back through one of those doors and see where the next ones

667
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:41,840
lead.

668
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:47,200
Will we, uh, will we see you again?

669
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,640
Keith, you're, you're God.

670
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,520
You'll see all of us whenever you want.

671
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:59,040
Well, I know what I'm going to do and I'm going to stay where I go.

672
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,680
I don't plan on visiting other worlds or other planes.

673
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:09,920
Is there, is there anything I can do for you guys before I go?

674
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,800
Is there anything you want?

675
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,640
Uh, the overseer steps up.

676
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:20,080
Well, um, if you're, uh, if you're offering, I feel like my job's kind of done.

677
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,880
I think I might be in for a reward of some sort.

678
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:28,080
Is that, can I ask you to, you kind of control reality now, right?

679
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:33,360
As far as I understand it in the past 45 seconds to two minutes.

680
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:33,600
Yeah.

681
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:38,880
I think, I think you can, uh, you can, can you, can you slot me in somewhere where I'm

682
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:43,680
a, I'm like a, like a detective from like those books or movies.

683
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,720
I want to be a noir style detective somewhere.

684
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:54,000
I don't know if this sounds, uh, I don't know if this sounds up your alley, but, uh, I've

685
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:54,800
got an idea.

686
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:56,640
Do you trust me?

687
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:58,640
Sure.

688
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,000
Of course we did.

689
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,960
We did it together.

690
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:01,520
Yeah.

691
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:05,360
Come with me and, uh, we'll be happy.

692
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:06,640
All right.

693
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:12,720
And Keith reaches out his hand to the overseer and three up and down handshake.

694
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:17,280
And then he motions them to like, just like stand right beside it.

695
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,880
Wait real fast before we go.

696
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:23,120
And, uh, the overseer is going to do a, uh, something he's going to do a spell or something

697
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,720
to send the liturgy.

698
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:29,600
Uh, he wants to drop them doing their chance and send them back to where they are from.

699
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:30,560
Okay.

700
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:40,480
So as soon as the liturgy breaks and the chanting whispers have dissipated.

701
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,480
Thanks for all your help, everyone.

702
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:43,600
Good show.

703
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,800
Clark Bishop.

704
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,600
Oh my God.

705
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,040
Oh my God.

706
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:50,800
Gary Daley falls to his knees and just begins weeping.

707
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,520
Endlessly.

708
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:55,840
Harry.

709
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:07,280
A Keith pops up behind him and starts like just kind of rubbing his shoulders a little

710
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:07,840
bit.

711
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,960
I can't go on.

712
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:09,920
I can't do it.

713
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,200
Gary.

714
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,880
I'm, I'm, I'm terribly sorry that we can, we can save Henry.

715
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,720
That's a Harry.

716
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:17,440
Oh fuck.

717
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:26,160
And he grabs, he grabs, uh, he grabs onto your uniform, the shoulders on both sides

718
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:33,280
and gets real fistfuls of cloth, you know, on either side and just buries his face into

719
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,000
your chest.

720
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,880
It was like that old turkey.

721
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,240
Next name was Harry.

722
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,000
I'm, I'm sorry.

723
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,800
It's been, it's been a century since I've seen him.

724
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,680
I'm sorry about that.

725
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:48,240
He's mine and I can't do it without him.

726
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:52,320
And he, uh, he looks up into your eyes with just plea.

727
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:56,560
If you're going to take me somewhere, can you take me where he's there?

728
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,600
Yeah, yeah.

729
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,280
We, uh, I look over at Keith.

730
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,360
Yeah, we can, we can, we can do that.

731
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,920
That's, that's something I can do and he can do it together.

732
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,600
We can make sure that for sure happens.

733
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,560
He's easy.

734
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:11,280
If I go there and he's there, would I also be there?

735
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,720
And Keith puts his hand on his shoulder.

736
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:21,280
Hey, look, Keith reaches out with his hand and in his hand is a little tiny figurine

737
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:26,480
of Harry with a big bowl of pho in his hands.

738
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,040
We're all going to a good place.

739
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,520
As soon as we get done here, we're going to a good place.

740
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,200
Overseer turns to the crowd.

741
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:39,200
As a matter of fact, if anybody, if any, if anybody wants to go anywhere, that's, we can

742
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,960
just do that, right?

743
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:41,600
Isn't that right?

744
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:45,120
I think we can, I think we can just send you back to a better place.

745
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,560
Keith roll unarmed combat.

746
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,560
Oh, what?

747
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:53,520
64.

748
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,680
Pretty sure that's a fail.

749
00:42:58,640 --> 00:42:59,120
Yeah.

750
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:07,440
Mildred Mitchell catches you with a sneak attack from behind puts her tiny frail old

751
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:13,520
lady arms around your neck from the back and she's trying to choke you out.

752
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:25,920
10 Keith's pop out and gently remove her.

753
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:40,160
And then until the bee pops up in front of her and they just run to each other and embrace

754
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:43,200
in this dim, dim light of this world.

755
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:47,360
And the till they be like looks around at all the other case and does a shrug.

756
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,040
Wait, so it's just, it's just key.

757
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,320
It's just fucking key.

758
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:56,820
Yeah.

759
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:01,520
Okay.

760
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:09,280
So Mildred starts hugging her and is like, are you, are you okay?

761
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:13,600
Um, I'm super okay.

762
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:18,880
Grandma role persuade weirdo.

763
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:36,560
That's a success or the 57 on a 60 and Mildred is so happy and relieved to finally be reunited

764
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,440
with her granddaughter till DB Mitchell.

765
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:40,560
Keith looks at him.

766
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:45,040
Hey, you guys have got a place in, uh, at my place.

767
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,160
Same as the overseer.

768
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:51,440
Same as anybody else here that doesn't want to go back to their, their plane.

769
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:54,320
I'm going to let that persuade roll over.

770
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:57,840
Yes, we can be together.

771
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,680
We can be a family again.

772
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:02,640
Jack Pearlman.

773
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:07,700
Jack.

774
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:15,120
Jack Pearlman, Everett pace.

775
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:23,120
Look at each other and also see Greer Hilfintop Kermunker now and a bartender and a piano

776
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:25,120
player and a gambler named Thomas.

777
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:28,240
They're all from the same time period and contention.

778
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:29,680
They all recognize each other.

779
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:34,560
You're saying I can go anywhere that I want.

780
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:37,280
Don't have to be back where I came from.

781
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,200
Yeah, I think that's what we're saying.

782
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:42,240
I think, I think we can get you, get you set up any way you want.

783
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:49,680
I used to have a ranch with the, with all these horses and I just love, love just a

784
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:54,960
big old ranch with a big old herd of horses that need tendon to that I can take care of

785
00:45:54,960 --> 00:46:01,440
surrounded by beautiful nature, lakes, a seller full of good whiskey, couple of dogs to keep

786
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:04,640
me company, a room devoted to all kinds of good books.

787
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:07,040
I think that's a life I could love.

788
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,400
Keith speaks up.

789
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,000
What was your name again?

790
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:11,760
Jack Pearlman.

791
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:12,260
Jack.

792
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:17,360
Jack, if you come with me, I can give you, I can give you everything you want.

793
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,520
Everett comes toddling up.

794
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:24,320
Hey, uh, Jack, uh, that sounds pretty nice.

795
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:28,080
You think maybe I could have a, have a little shack out there on the edge of your property?

796
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:29,840
I think that'd do just fine Everett.

797
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:33,600
Hey Everett, have you ever wanted more than a shack?

798
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:34,400
Oh, hell no.

799
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,600
I just want my shack.

800
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:36,560
Duly nobody.

801
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,560
It's what I contend to is what I like.

802
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:48,160
Oh yes, and I would very much like, uh, some sort of building where I could do my workouts

803
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:51,040
and squash the watermelons with my thighs.

804
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,080
Come with me.

805
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:53,200
My name is Greer.

806
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:57,120
I don't, I didn't ask what your name was, but, uh.

807
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:00,240
Yeah, he just promised you watermelons, man.

808
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:01,440
He didn't ask the fuck you were.

809
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:06,800
Hint up your monger now, and I will, if you are willing to, to furnish watermelons for

810
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:07,300
me.

811
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:12,480
As I said, Jack over here, if you come with me, I can give you whatever you want.

812
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:13,200
Okay.

813
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:18,080
Everett turns around to the Thomas the gambler and the bartender and piano player.

814
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:21,200
You guys are welcome to come with us.

815
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:24,800
You're, you're, you're, you're part of our career as far as I'm concerned.

816
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:30,160
Oh yeah, I sure, I sure would like to come with y'all if we could get some sort of tavern

817
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:30,560
set up.

818
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:31,520
Sir, what's your name?

819
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,200
Oh, my name's Sparkin.

820
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:33,920
Sparkin?

821
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:36,000
What do you want?

822
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:37,920
Oh, you know me?

823
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:41,440
I just love having a, having a bar to slide glass down, you know?

824
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:48,960
If you come with me, you can slide glass all day and all night.

825
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,160
Oh, I like the sound of that.

826
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:54,720
And he slaps the piano player on the back and is like, Hey, does that mean that I, that

827
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:58,480
it'll be a piano there for me to tickle the fun, tickle the, tickle the operates?

828
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:07,200
Keith has a, another Keith pop up in front of him and like get down on all fours and

829
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,800
Keith steps up on his back.

830
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:14,480
Anybody here that wants to come with me, you'll have a place.

831
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,800
Anything you want, I can give to you.

832
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:22,080
If you come with me, gesture over to Clark.

833
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:26,000
So, uh, make your decision.

834
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,520
I guess I won't be mad.

835
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:28,400
He won't be mad.

836
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:35,600
This is that scene in every dog movie where the bad guy and the main characters stand

837
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:38,560
on opposite sides and like call the dog for them.

838
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:39,060
Yeah.

839
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:46,400
And in this case, we've got a raccoon, a chunk kitty, a distinguished gray dog and old chunky

840
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:47,600
proud chipmunk.

841
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:54,880
We've got Tyler, the excitable black lab, a friendly woodpecker, an old gray squirrel,

842
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,080
a golden retriever.

843
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:57,600
Bean is there as well.

844
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:05,840
Salem, the cat's body has been mewing constantly at the radio, just pawing at the radio and

845
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:09,600
mewing over and over Archie and taco joined the group as well.

846
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:16,080
And that whole mess of fun time, content your contention, create a career coalition

847
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:21,840
animals all swarm toward Keith Clark.

848
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:29,120
I stepped down from the Keith that's bent over and motion you toward to like step up

849
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:29,920
on there.

850
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,360
Please call me, call me overseer.

851
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:34,000
I'm no, I'm no longer Clark.

852
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:35,380
Over.

853
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:47,520
Keith, uh, rolls his eyes a little bit, but he's like, uh, well, I've, I've said my piece,

854
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:50,240
uh, overseer say what you must.

855
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:53,600
I'm going to need your help here, Keith.

856
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:54,100
Yeah.

857
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:55,680
Everybody ready?

858
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:59,280
We're going to send you Clara Blankenship and Casey Kristoff.

859
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:01,280
The only two that I haven't mentioned yet.

860
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:07,840
Also go and join the group that is standing over by the Keith's who's in a Clark slash

861
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:09,600
overseers group.

862
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:13,040
I don't, I don't picture us dividing like that.

863
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:13,600
Do you?

864
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:18,960
Uh, no, but that's, what's funny is that Keith is seeing as, as a competition and everyone

865
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:22,560
goes to Keith side and he just looks at you at this smug face.

866
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:23,780
Okay.

867
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:25,760
Yeah, they're all this fucking eyes.

868
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:30,720
I guess they all, I guess they went with God.

869
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:35,040
Your wife kissed me on the cheek earlier tonight.

870
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:36,400
Wait, what is that from?

871
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,800
I think you should leave and look at you now.

872
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:42,400
Everyone's coming to party in my house.

873
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:50,240
I will say, uh, I was not picturing it like that at all.

874
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:53,520
I was thinking like, if you want to go back to your old life, go with him.

875
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:59,040
If you want to follow a, uh, have you heard of Jesus, a Jesus like character?

876
00:50:59,040 --> 00:50:59,600
Come with me.

877
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:07,360
Overseer has been in concert with you because I think that the deal is that the overseer

878
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:10,640
is going to be able to help like create portals, but you're the one who's going to be able

879
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,080
to create realities.

880
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:12,580
Yeah.

881
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:16,160
The Clark is staying here to wait his time in the tower.

882
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:16,960
What's Don doing?

883
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:17,920
What's John doing?

884
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:22,640
He's rolling off almost into the sunset on planet juggernaut, but he looks down at

885
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:28,160
Don as he passes and he says, uncle Don, you've been in this world a lot longer than

886
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:32,400
me and I plan on bringing some law to it.

887
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:37,360
You want to ride the juggernaut across these cosmic planes with me?

888
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:41,680
Don like formally crumpled over hugging the thing.

889
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:47,440
Did not know that you were John because he thought the John he was with was the John.

890
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:50,240
Oh, Hey, there were three of us, bud.

891
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:54,000
Hearing the voice because he's heard it so many times come from the spheres.

892
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,400
Now he's like, you're a hell yeah boy.

893
00:51:58,400 --> 00:51:58,880
Hell yeah.

894
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:01,200
And he's like, starts like getting super pumped.

895
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:07,360
He puts the wand into his pants pocket and like runs up to the planet juggernaut and

896
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:10,000
he's like, let's bring some law to this lawless land.

897
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:11,520
Yeah, fuck yeah.

898
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:20,000
And whose arm shoots down from like high atop planet juggernaut and your nephew, your

899
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:26,640
whose nephew like flings you up on top next to him and together you top planet juggernaut

900
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:28,640
into the sunset.

901
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:29,140
Yes.

902
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:33,520
Oh, I want to read that comic.

903
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:42,320
Oh my God, brother Nick Nichols is that planet juggernaut about to head the fuck out of here

904
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:43,920
out into the sunset forever?

905
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:49,280
My brother, it does appear he's heading off into a sort of sunset if I had to put a word

906
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:49,760
to it.

907
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:50,400
Oh my God.

908
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:55,120
Well, before he quite leaves, let's go ahead and get our question in.

909
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:56,320
They keep calling him Keith.

910
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:58,000
What do you think about this fellow so far?

911
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,280
Now, is this the Keith that we like or is this another Keith?

912
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:06,160
I would say that we definitely like this one because he seems to be granting people's

913
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:08,640
wishes and my wish to this Keith.

914
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:09,840
Are you listening Keith?

915
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:10,800
Hundreds of voices.

916
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:22,160
I don't know about you Nick, but for me personally, I would love for Richard Dick Nichols to join

917
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:26,880
us here of this very last treasurable time in our lives.

918
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,480
What do you think about getting them here?

919
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:30,880
The wildest versions of them that are-

920
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:36,640
I'd love to get all of the family back together.

921
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:43,600
As you're talking and looking at each other, you can see on either of your necks, something

922
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:47,200
start to like kind of start poking out.

923
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,120
Oh my goodness.

924
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:50,720
Oh, heavens.

925
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:52,160
Oh, Dick Nichols.

926
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:52,880
Is that you?

927
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:55,280
I believe it is, brother.

928
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:58,240
Haven't seen you in forever, my dear.

929
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:00,960
Oh, clasp hands with me, brother.

930
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:02,560
Oh, yes.

931
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:04,880
And our hands are tiny little hands that are what?

932
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:05,840
Poking out of skin?

933
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:11,440
No, your heads just grow like on your neck and shoulder.

934
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,200
So you're like two-headed.

935
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,040
Should we nuzzle our-

936
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:15,540
Yes.

937
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:18,240
Oh, nuzzle with me, brother.

938
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:20,800
Yes, our nipples will touch forever.

939
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:27,840
You know, when I first heard those characters, I thought they were just, you know, like British

940
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:31,920
or something, you know, like all the classic movie villains.

941
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:35,920
But then I realized they were actually queer coded, like all the classic movie villains.

942
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:40,640
So aren't you the classic movie villains, Zack and Justin?

943
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:43,920
I would say that we're the heroes of this story, my dear.

944
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:46,160
Oh, everyone thinks different.

945
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:48,080
They don't know what they're talking about.

946
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:50,720
Oh, this simpleton talking to us.

947
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:52,080
Oh, my goodness.

948
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:53,600
He knows none of what he speaks.

949
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:58,000
Well, I personally think it's really nice to have the nickel nickels.

950
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:03,600
There's all the four nickels, quad nickels, all together here, coming up right now.

951
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,760
We're all walking up here, all playing and jogging on.

952
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,120
Oh, my goodness.

953
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:07,920
Oh, look at him.

954
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:08,960
He's round.

955
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:10,400
He's round, brother.

956
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:12,640
He's a round bound of something, I tell you.

957
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:14,320
I want to work.

958
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:17,120
Wait, what do you want to do?

959
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:22,160
Well, what are we going to do now?

960
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:24,800
Should we ask him if we could come with him?

961
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:25,440
Hold on.

962
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:28,960
He holds both his microphones out and walks directly towards them.

963
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:30,560
Nick walks out.

964
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:31,200
Ting, ting, ting.

965
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:34,800
Mr. Juggernaut.

966
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:37,280
So Goo John feels like a tug at his shoulder.

967
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:40,400
And it's this little tendril from Planet Juggernaut.

968
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:45,520
And they stopped their dramatic mosey into the sunset.

969
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:47,680
And John looks down.

970
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:49,840
And he sees the nickels far below him.

971
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:54,880
And there's this little Planet Juggernaut tendril right next to him in the shape of

972
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:58,960
a hand with its finger out, given the just a minute hand gesture.

973
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,600
What do you need, boys?

974
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:02,960
Ask him, Nick.

975
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:05,520
I don't know if I can, Nick.

976
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:06,320
Oh, come on.

977
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:07,760
I bet you can do it.

978
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:09,920
Oh, we believe you must do it.

979
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:11,780
Okay.

980
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:14,160
Do you think we could...

981
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:17,280
I'm holding both the microphones up, and I'm pressing them against him.

982
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:22,640
Can we follow you and, like, you do stuff and we say stuff in the microphone?

983
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:23,840
Ellie, talk about it.

984
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:27,520
Follow me, boys.

985
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:31,680
And then a little, like, vacuum hose comes out.

986
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:36,160
And the microphones are ripped out of your hands.

987
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:39,520
And almost the skin is nearly ripped off your hands.

988
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:42,480
And then you are sucked into Planet Juggernaut.

989
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:50,480
Okay, Jon, we can go.

990
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:56,800
But before you really can go, this whole time, Drew Andrews has been making his way

991
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:03,440
assertively out toward Planet Juggernaut and Jon to say one final farewell.

992
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:04,800
Jon sees it.

993
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:05,840
He doesn't need...

994
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:08,800
He sees Drew strutting out towards him.

995
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:09,600
Oh, nay.

996
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:11,680
Whoa.

997
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:19,440
Horse things.

998
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:22,000
Hold on, Planet Juggernaut.

999
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:27,040
Do you have any cool BDSM stuff on Planet Juggernaut to, like, hold on?

1000
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:28,800
Like horses have?

1001
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:33,040
Horses do have cool BDSM stuff on, don't they?

1002
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:34,560
I never thought of it that way.

1003
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:35,360
Horses are rad.

1004
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:37,520
Horses are freaks, yeah.

1005
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:43,380
No.

1006
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:45,360
Asked and answered.

1007
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:46,740
I know.

1008
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:48,160
So there is, like...

1009
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:50,800
It doesn't look like it's even attached.

1010
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:57,200
It's the right size, but it looks so comically small on the top of Planet Juggernaut.

1011
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:03,280
But you just have a perfect just, like, cowboy saddle made out of the shifting, starry,

1012
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:08,000
ethereal, incandescent, iridescent star, like, muck.

1013
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:08,560
Beautiful.

1014
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:10,640
It is beautiful.

1015
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:11,760
From inside you here.

1016
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:14,720
Well, that was wonderful.

1017
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:18,720
So, yeah, he pulls on some, like, imaginary reins.

1018
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:20,640
He's sitting on the saddle, but there are no reins.

1019
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:23,840
He and Planet Juggernaut are pretty much as one.

1020
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:25,040
They're both ball.

1021
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:27,200
You can't see the tendril going from...

1022
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:28,880
Oh, God.

1023
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:30,800
Butthole to butthole.

1024
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,440
Like a merry-go-round horse.

1025
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:37,280
But you're the horse.

1026
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:38,820
Um...

1027
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:40,080
Do you like that?

1028
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:40,320
Nope.

1029
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:42,240
No, I was thinking more like some kind of...

1030
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:47,920
So Drew Andrews joins you on the plane.

1031
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:56,080
John, I just wanted to say thank you before you go.

1032
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:57,680
For what, Drew?

1033
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:00,960
Thank you for always being there for us.

1034
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:02,720
You taught me a lot.

1035
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:08,560
You taught me how to shoot a gun and how to be a man.

1036
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:13,200
And also, some of those lessons were, like,

1037
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:17,360
those kinds of lessons where you learn from one another not to do stuff.

1038
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:20,240
But I think that you're, like, a really...

1039
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:22,320
I think you are always trying your best.

1040
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:23,280
And I really...

1041
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:24,240
I think that's cool.

1042
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:26,560
Hey, I think you're pretty cool too, man.

1043
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:30,880
Just remember what I taught you, though.

1044
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:34,880
You remember where the clitoris is, right?

1045
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:39,920
Adios.

1046
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,640
Jesus Christ.

1047
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:49,120
A beautiful moment and pretending to be me.

1048
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:58,160
Unless, Drew, would you want to come with me?

1049
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:04,000
Yeah, I think that I have more to learn because I didn't know when you just said that.

1050
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:05,920
I don't know.

1051
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:11,360
You're gonna have to tell me again as we go.

1052
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:17,440
And Agent Trent Catt, the beautiful black cat that was once called Salem,

1053
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:22,880
but now is embodied by the spirit of Agent Trent Chad,

1054
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:29,600
is running around the ankles and rubbing against the ankles of Drew Andrews.

1055
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:34,800
And so Drew picks up this black cat and throws the cat up on his shoulders.

1056
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:38,960
And the cat kind of wraps himself around Drew's shoulders.

1057
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:42,720
And he's like, what do you say, Agent Trent Catt?

1058
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:44,640
No, he can't come.

1059
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:45,120
Oh, okay.

1060
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:45,920
I'm kidding.

1061
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:46,560
Oh, okay.

1062
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:49,440
Oh, every time with this guy.

1063
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:52,160
Yeah, I mean, like, my brothers used to do stuff like that a lot to me.

1064
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:56,560
And I just can't, like, you know, they go out for a cheers with a beer bottle

1065
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:59,840
and they whack the top of real hearts so it flows out the top, you know.

1066
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:00,320
What?

1067
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:01,440
It makes you go out the top?

1068
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:04,160
Well, that's yeah.

1069
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:04,160


1070
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:07,040
Will you do that to me soon?

1071
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:10,880
Okay.

1072
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:14,400
It's sad.

1073
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:16,560
It's sad how we write.

1074
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:17,920
Hold on.

1075
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:19,760
I think that was perfect.

1076
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:23,920
All right, great.

1077
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:24,480
Moving on.

1078
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:27,680
That's a series wrap on Drew Andrews, everybody.

1079
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:29,360
Oh, yeah.

1080
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:33,760
Wow, really good job, Drew.

1081
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:36,480
As Planet Juggernaut and friends write off...

1082
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:39,360
Get as far away from Jesus, Keith, as they can.

1083
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:43,440
Some may ride with that boy.

1084
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:48,400
Yeah, I don't trust this messianic message of his.

1085
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:52,880
As they write off into the mostly pure darkness,

1086
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:57,360
Keith pops the sun up so that they can ride into the sunset.

1087
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:59,200
Oh, fuck yeah.

1088
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:06,240
And as they do, Keith takes special note of Planet Juggernaut's shape.

1089
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:07,760
I like it.

1090
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:08,800
Ominous.

1091
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:14,080
Well, Clark, I think we're about to get out of here.

1092
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:16,960
Are you gonna be okay?

1093
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:19,840
Is there anything you need or want from me?

1094
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:22,560
He's had a grin on this entire time.

1095
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:26,000
This is his own personal wish fulfillment.

1096
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,960
He's serving this purpose that he's always wanted to.

1097
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:31,440
I'm good, guys.

1098
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:36,400
I thank you all for your help and I'm gonna thank you 10 times over

1099
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:40,640
because I know how this all ends now, but it's good to know at least.

1100
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:42,560
I'm happy.

1101
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:43,280
I'm good.

1102
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:44,640
Well, I'm happy to hear that.

1103
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:50,240
And then Keith puts his hand on Clark's shoulder and there's like a sudden,

1104
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:52,560
almost like a sound wave or something.

1105
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:57,920
Something kind of pushes coming from the tower that you're going to be residing in.

1106
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:07,680
And Clark won't know it, but every single cabinet drawer filled with microwave dinners.

1107
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:12,640
Yes.

1108
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:19,440
But no microwave.

1109
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:21,760
Or freezer.

1110
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:23,120
So they melt immediately.

1111
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:25,760
It's a horror game.

1112
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:29,840
Hell in the rotten tower.

1113
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:42,240
Keith takes his hand off Clark and gives him, you know, one of those kind of last looks

1114
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:45,680
where we both know, like, it might be a while.

1115
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:46,720
Solid nod shared.

1116
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:53,040
Keith is content knowing Clark's going to find a way to heat these microwave dinners up.

1117
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:58,800
Hey, Clark, if you ever need anything from me, like,

1118
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:03,520
you ever get hungry and need to eat in 30 seconds, let me know.

1119
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:08,320
Clark, if you ever need anything from me, just think it.

1120
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:09,040
I'll feel it.

1121
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:12,400
You, you, you, you gotta, but I mean, I'm going to need a lot from you eventually,

1122
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:14,080
but it's in the past and you've already done it.

1123
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:15,120
So it's all, we're all good.

1124
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:15,920
Thank you.

1125
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:22,960
Keith gives that one last look to Clark and he kind of turns around and looks at the

1126
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:26,160
so many last looks.

1127
01:04:29,120 --> 01:04:31,600
Well, I mean, you know, it's a big moment.

1128
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:33,120
It is a, it is a big moment.

1129
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:34,400
It's a big moment, Keith.

1130
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:39,440
I mean, on the horizon, uh, John, Don and Planet Juggernaut take a last look back at

1131
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:40,000
you guys.

1132
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,840
And John raises his ooze hat.

1133
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:49,760
And then Keith Keith's returns to his congregation.

1134
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:56,240
Y'all ready?

1135
01:04:56,240 --> 01:05:06,240
And then they blip out of this existence and they blip into contention, which at this

1136
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:12,320
point has been just completely destroyed by, can you Zach, can you give us a quick rundown

1137
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:15,280
of why and how contention has been destroyed?

1138
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:18,960
Looking over top at the town of contention.

1139
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:20,160
We're topping contention.

1140
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:25,120
Contention's such a power bottom, guys.

1141
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:34,240
This story ends on an unseasonably cold December 6th in a small town called Contention.

1142
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:40,240
A snow flurry can be seen under the street lights on an empty country road.

1143
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:44,880
I don't want to, I don't want to tell you how to do your job unless it's like super

1144
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:46,400
important that it's snowing.

1145
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:48,880
Wouldn't it be perfect if it's unseasonably warm?

1146
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:51,440
No, I already wrote it all like this.

1147
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:53,920
I like it.

1148
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:56,560
Was it unseasonably warm when we started playing?

1149
01:05:56,560 --> 01:06:00,880
Yeah, now it's like I described snow on like half the shit in this.

1150
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:03,760
That's me talking about snow.

1151
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:05,840
Let's just take out the snow stuff though.

1152
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:06,880
Yeah, what if you didn't?

1153
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:07,680
What if it was-

1154
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:08,180
Okay.

1155
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:09,600
Can you rewrite it really quick?

1156
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:10,000
You know what?

1157
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:10,800
Hey, how about this?

1158
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:11,520
Let's try it out.

1159
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:14,480
I'm gonna, I'm gonna say what I prepared.

1160
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:16,880
We'll plug in no snow.

1161
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:17,760
No, I'm gonna, I'm gonna-

1162
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:25,680
Every time I say something about snow, you guys all say no snow.

1163
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:25,920
Okay?

1164
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:27,520
Are you ready?

1165
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:27,760
Yeah.

1166
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:29,680
That's not, that's not ruin what you've written.

1167
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:32,960
Yeah, I want to hear it in its, in its wholeness.

1168
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:34,640
Well, you guys aren't playing along.

1169
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:35,360
Thomas will fucking do it.

1170
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:35,920
I'll play along.

1171
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:43,040
This story ends on an unseasonably Jack Pearlman.

1172
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:54,560
This story ends on an unseasonably cold December 6th in a small town called the Contention.

1173
01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:55,520
A snow flurry-

1174
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:56,080
No snow.

1175
01:06:56,080 --> 01:07:00,720
Can be seen under the street lights on an empty country road.

1176
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:07,520
A snow flurry is a light snowfall that results in little or no snow accumulation.

1177
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:08,400
He said the thing.

1178
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:14,320
Ahead, there's a blockade made of splintered church pews obstructing the exit

1179
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:19,280
and the sign from Subtropolis has been torn down and spray-painted with instructions.

1180
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:22,640
Says detour, please keep right.

1181
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:29,200
In the quiet parking lot of Hotel Motel, an empty dunking booth sits alone.

1182
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:34,080
The door to Keith's room is open and the door to Keith's safe is open as well,

1183
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:41,280
revealing the empty place where he kept the watch he stole from his brother's cold wrist.

1184
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:48,320
At the corner of a desolate intersection, the burned-out husk of a truck is wrapped

1185
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:55,920
around the base of a billboard for a wild business called Owls, Tires, and Tigers.

1186
01:07:55,920 --> 01:08:00,720
But the word tiger and the picture of the tiger have both turned to ash,

1187
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:03,680
making the business look far more mundane.

1188
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:08,240
Out north of town, John Lee Pettymore's house sits abandoned.

1189
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:12,640
Two sizable holes had been dug deep into the property.

1190
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:15,040
Inside, the house is still a mess.

1191
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:18,800
There wasn't much time to clean after Keith turned it inside out,

1192
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:21,120
looking for cocaine that was buried.

1193
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:30,720
And Thomas, what does any Pettymore who knows anything know about what John left here?

1194
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:33,600
Well, John left his millions of dollars.

1195
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:36,080
Fives of millions of dollars.

1196
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:40,320
Five million dollars hidden somewhere on this property.

1197
01:08:40,320 --> 01:08:44,000
Across town is a small vacant baseball diamond.

1198
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:47,760
Little bits of snow fall and melt on the metal bleachers,

1199
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:53,360
which are lit by a concession hut neon sign for the contention trucks.

1200
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:54,480
Trucks bring it.

1201
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:55,360
Trucks bring it!

1202
01:08:57,360 --> 01:08:58,480
Trucks bring it!

1203
01:08:58,480 --> 01:08:59,440
Trucks bring it!

1204
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:06,400
Clark Bishop's parents' house exists, barren as ever.

1205
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:14,400
Light flickers out the open front door in a way which shows the television is still on.

1206
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:19,040
At the twice-forsaken vampire-themed water park, Splashylvania,

1207
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:24,160
the spiraling duet of slides that are the two-fanged plunge

1208
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:30,480
have been stained brown with the blood of Leo Piston and Julie Maxwell.

1209
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:36,480
Curiously, the sign for Klinker's local drinking hole and unrivaled daycare

1210
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:41,120
seems to be missing seven letters from its list of happy hour bottle specials.

1211
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:44,880
Corona is missing an N, so Coroa.

1212
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:49,200
Bush Lite is missing an L, so Bushite.

1213
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:52,560
Past Blue Ribbon, which is missing S-T-U-E-N.

1214
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:55,360
Pab- Pable Ribbo.

1215
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:56,080
Pable Ribbo.

1216
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:58,480
I have one, Pable Ribbo.

1217
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:01,360
Is it perhaps R-S-T-L-N-E?

1218
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:01,920
It is not.

1219
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:05,280
It is N-L-S-T-U-E-N.

1220
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:09,120
The contention woods are silent.

1221
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:10,640
There are no people.

1222
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:12,480
There are no animals.

1223
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:17,120
There's only a slight chilly breeze pushing on the trees gently

1224
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:21,280
as the flurry of snow falls at an angle.

1225
01:10:22,240 --> 01:10:22,880
No snow.

1226
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:26,560
Back in the suburbs.

1227
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:30,400
Looking through the busted front window of James the Millworker's house

1228
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:34,400
treats the viewer into an empty grand piano.

1229
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:37,440
Not a string to be hit with a hammer to be found.

1230
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:42,720
However, scratches on the tile leading out the front door

1231
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:48,640
show that something heavy and metal was pulled up from a hiding spot

1232
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:53,040
under the kitchen floor and dragged out of the house.

1233
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:58,560
Over at A Plus Storage, three storage units, G10, G11, and G12

1234
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:03,120
sit unlocked, open, and completely empty.

1235
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:09,440
The halls of the First Church of Contention are flooded by two feet of water

1236
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:13,920
and countless fish swim contentedly from the Sunday School classrooms

1237
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:18,080
to the chapel to the baptism tank, which is still filled with water.

1238
01:11:18,160 --> 01:11:22,160
Alternatively, Chief Maggie Cook's home burned to the ground

1239
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:28,720
is just a plot of carbon debris that looks out on a sloppily refilled beans pond

1240
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:32,800
next to which lays the lifeless body of Anne Love

1241
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:39,120
dressed to die in an emerald green suit with a black silk bow tie.

1242
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:44,880
Her face is frozen in a cold, vacant smile

1243
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:49,920
behind icy asymmetrical bangs covering one of her eyes

1244
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:55,040
and a big chonky fluffer of a snowflake floats down

1245
01:11:55,840 --> 01:12:01,920
and lands directly on Agent Karen's exposed blood-red eyeball.

1246
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:08,720
The delicate solid slowly dissolves, fills the convex reservoir,

1247
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:15,200
and a single crimson drop pushes over the edge of the eye-skin basin

1248
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:20,800
and runs down the face of the woman who killed Clark Bishop's parents.

1249
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:30,000
As we zoom out, we see the knife he plunged well through the top of her shattered skull.

1250
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:35,200
And we continue to zoom out over the quiet town of Contention

1251
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:42,800
until Keith, he gets everybody that's coming with and just snaps his fingers

1252
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:48,560
and they all show up in the pretty much decimated Contention.

1253
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:54,160
Keith pops back into hundreds of Keiths and shouts

1254
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:59,600
Clean up, clean up, everybody do you share?

1255
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:03,360
A montage of... Hell yes!

1256
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:09,520
Cleaning montage. How does Jack Pearlman clean, Justin?

1257
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:12,800
I mean, handsomely.

1258
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:19,280
We can all agree on that. Whatever he's doing, it looks good.

1259
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:24,240
I picture Everett Pace like fully hunched over but going like a million miles an hour.

1260
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:29,200
Does he have like a little tiny broom with a dust pan?

1261
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:33,040
No, yeah, I was gonna say he's not going 100 miles an hour.

1262
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:38,240
He's actually really focused on like one little patch of dirt that he can handle himself.

1263
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:41,680
Get this right in here, alright?

1264
01:13:41,680 --> 01:13:48,480
You literally get one little like intersection median just looking fucking excellent.

1265
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:49,600
You could eat off of this here.

1266
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:53,120
It's grass and dirt and like flowers and shit.

1267
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:57,440
As the sun goes down, Keith pops back into one Keith and

1268
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:04,560
Okay, it's probably about six more days of this and then we'll be set in Keith tension.

1269
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:07,840
Rinse and repeat for six more days and then...

1270
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:15,120
Okay, so during this time a few people have heard tell that you are giving away things.

1271
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:18,640
Your reward, yeah, you're giving away wishes, of course.

1272
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:20,880
Thank you for rebuilding Keith tension.

1273
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:22,640
Exactly. Fucking great.

1274
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:25,680
You've got like a campaign slogan, there's signs up.

1275
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:26,640
Keith Vermeer.

1276
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:28,400
Already?

1277
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:34,560
Well, first off, Gary Daley is going to approach Keith with enormous eyes and a sort of reverence.

1278
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:37,920
He almost bows as he holds up.

1279
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:38,960
Don't be silly.

1280
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:44,160
He holds up this figurine of Harry Klinker that you gave him.

1281
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:51,280
I've been working real hard for the past four days and we only got two more to go and I know

1282
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:56,960
Harry'd be real good at working alongside us and getting Keith tension all up and ready to go.

1283
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:59,600
If you could, if you could do me that favor.

1284
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:00,800
You want me to bring him back?

1285
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:03,040
Well, I want one.

1286
01:15:04,160 --> 01:15:05,600
I know that's bad.

1287
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:13,200
I know that that means that I'm taking him from one of me, but I'm me and I want, I want one.

1288
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:13,920
Can I have one?

1289
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:17,760
I don't see how anything could go wrong.

1290
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:18,240
Yeah, no.

1291
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:19,620
Okay.

1292
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,680
Keith thinks real hard.

1293
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:25,920
Oh wait, can you give me one that was like really close to like the same kind of world

1294
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:30,000
that I lived in where all this stuff went nutty, but then like at the last minute, maybe he's like

1295
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:33,760
saved and different or maybe one where I'm dead.

1296
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:34,640
Oh, that'd be good.

1297
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:35,520
One where I'm dead.

1298
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:36,880
Keith's like, yeah, sure.

1299
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:39,920
But it's just the first one that opens up.

1300
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:41,680
He gets that, gets that one.

1301
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:42,080
Okay.

1302
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:44,400
So do you want to roll for me?

1303
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:44,800
Yeah.

1304
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:45,120
Okay.

1305
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:50,320
So what is, what would be good for me and what would be numbers?

1306
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:53,200
A one out of 100 shot that this is a good.

1307
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:54,480
You tell me numbers.

1308
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:56,800
Any number or like a range of numbers?

1309
01:15:56,800 --> 01:16:01,040
I would say any number will do, but that would mean the range.

1310
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:02,640
Like I roll under a certain thing.

1311
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:09,280
Oh, under 49, under 50 or over 50.

1312
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:12,240
Okay.

1313
01:16:12,240 --> 01:16:14,400
So under 50 is good.

1314
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:15,280
Under 50 is good.

1315
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:15,780
Okay.

1316
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:18,260
Fuck.

1317
01:16:18,720 --> 01:16:19,280
92.

1318
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:20,160
Okay.

1319
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:21,120
So shitty.

1320
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:22,160
The world that opens up.

1321
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:23,520
This is what it feels like to be a player.

1322
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:24,080
And I hate it.

1323
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:25,120
The world that opens up.

1324
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:26,880
Welcome to hell.

1325
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:31,040
They, they are super close with each other.

1326
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:37,600
Nothing bad has really happened in their lives until one day.

1327
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:38,000
Okay.

1328
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:49,840
Keith just shows up, grabs him off the sofa, blips back and it puts him in key tension.

1329
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:52,400
Harry, Harry.

1330
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:53,520
I miss you so much.

1331
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:56,480
What the oh, oh no.

1332
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:57,840
Oh shit.

1333
01:16:58,640 --> 01:16:59,680
I rolled sanity.

1334
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:01,840
11.

1335
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:02,800
Chris success.

1336
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:05,680
Harry clinker completely understands the situation.

1337
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:08,000
God, God, that's you.

1338
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:08,400
Keith.

1339
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:09,200
You can call me Keith.

1340
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:09,760
Oh my God.

1341
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:10,960
Little hot dog boy.

1342
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:12,640
What little hot dog became God.

1343
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:17,680
What kind of sick world you bring me into?

1344
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:18,880
I like this a whole lot.

1345
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:19,920
Hey, Hey.

1346
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:21,280
This worked out so well.

1347
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:21,920
Oh my God.

1348
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:22,640
You rolled bad.

1349
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:23,200
I wrote good.

1350
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:25,920
Hey, I love that.

1351
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:27,280
Can we open up clinkers here?

1352
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:28,800
That way we can get a good time rolling.

1353
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:33,760
I've snapped my fingers in a hundred Keith's instantly rebuild clinker.

1354
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:34,260
Fuck.

1355
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:37,760
Daycare's open.

1356
01:17:42,160 --> 01:17:47,920
Mildred Mitchell comes in hot, dragging her Tildy B Mitchell by the ear.

1357
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:53,680
This Tildy B is now wearing a pair of big bull britches.

1358
01:17:54,720 --> 01:18:00,800
And Mildred looks at this Keith and is like, you're going to make this right?

1359
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:01,440
How?

1360
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:01,920
I can.

1361
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:05,440
This is you, right?

1362
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:06,640
I can get you.

1363
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,960
I can get you your Tildy.

1364
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:12,480
You did what to my daughter?

1365
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:13,760
And then you do this?

1366
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:15,280
Do you know what happened to your daughter?

1367
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:17,920
She starts crying immediately.

1368
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:24,080
Let's go of this fucking Keith, pushes her away, falls to her knees and starts crying

1369
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:24,880
onto the ground.

1370
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:30,080
I saw what happened, what you did to her.

1371
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:30,720
She's okay.

1372
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:32,400
I'll show you.

1373
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:36,240
And he, uh, gets her Tildy.

1374
01:18:36,240 --> 01:18:37,520
You fucking piece of shit.

1375
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:38,640
Oh my God.

1376
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:40,160
All right.

1377
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:43,360
Ask and ye shall receive, Mildred.

1378
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:44,000
Oh no.

1379
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:50,240
I love when given the chance to be a good person with godlike powers, Keith is still

1380
01:18:50,240 --> 01:18:55,280
like, what could I possibly do to make this person be happier?

1381
01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:56,880
I don't understand emotion.

1382
01:18:56,880 --> 01:19:04,720
It makes a lot of sense to me that once there were infinite keys, he understood so much

1383
01:19:04,720 --> 01:19:05,040
less.

1384
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:14,880
Walking through this portal is a skeletal creature with skin so thin, her bones protrude

1385
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:15,680
into view.

1386
01:19:15,680 --> 01:19:24,320
Her nail beds are empty, bruises and lesions cover her body and with pure hatred in her

1387
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:28,560
eyes, Tildy B. Mitchell shrieks.

1388
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:39,920
Okay, I'm gonna try some magic on her.

1389
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:46,720
And he like kind of reaches his hand out and as you reach your hand out, go ahead and roll.

1390
01:19:47,680 --> 01:19:48,960
That's a thorny vine.

1391
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:51,680
Yeah, that's a success.

1392
01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:56,640
So what happens to her skin and body to make her look normal again?

1393
01:19:56,640 --> 01:19:58,960
Fingernails grow back immediately.

1394
01:19:58,960 --> 01:19:59,680
It's a great start.

1395
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:06,640
Her skin plumps up, gets some color to it.

1396
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:09,520
Her hair quickly grows out.

1397
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:11,360
It's almost too long now.

1398
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:17,520
You're doing great.

1399
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:18,080
You're doing great.

1400
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:19,200
What else happened to her?

1401
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:29,760
Her scream turns into like a little girl's cry and everything else is better.

1402
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:41,520
The two of them run off in a warm embrace, crying and speaking to each other like they

1403
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:42,560
haven't in days.

1404
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:43,440
You're welcome.

1405
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:49,920
The old west folk get their saloon.

1406
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:56,560
Everett Pace gets his little shack at the edge of a vast tract of land owned and roamed

1407
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:58,640
by one Jack Pearlman.

1408
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:06,800
The sun is hitting the dew on the long grass of this pasture and you see a couple horses

1409
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:14,000
and you see, you see, uh, Oh my God, my brain doesn't work right now.

1410
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,840
Are you trying to say Jack Pearlman?

1411
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:16,480
Jack Pearlman.

1412
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:16,980
God.

1413
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:21,680
We're all like sitting here like, is he going to fucking say?

1414
01:21:23,680 --> 01:21:24,180
I'm blue.

1415
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:25,920
Teasing you guys.

1416
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:31,760
You see Jack Pearlman riding on his horse past the little shack.

1417
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:33,520
He looks very content.

1418
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:34,320
Shun.

1419
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:40,720
And he's like morning Everett and Everett's out there on, on his, his parcel in the yard

1420
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:42,720
there in his long John's.

1421
01:21:42,720 --> 01:21:47,760
And, uh, he's, he, he had just gotten out of a tub of water that he had been bathing

1422
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:48,260
in.

1423
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:53,680
And, uh, the, uh, the top of the long John's is hanging off and he's all skin and hunched

1424
01:21:53,680 --> 01:21:54,480
over bones.

1425
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:59,200
And, Oh, Hey, Hey Jackie, you just, you just caught me in the, I was getting out of the

1426
01:21:59,200 --> 01:21:59,700
tub.

1427
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:02,480
Thanks again for this plot of land here.

1428
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:05,920
This is, this is, this is what this is all I ever dreamed of.

1429
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:07,280
Anytime Everett.

1430
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:08,400
Anytime.

1431
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:13,360
He gets back to buttoning up his, uh, long John's and he's, he's going to go back inside

1432
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:17,120
and, uh, go and check the stock down in his, uh, his root cellar there.

1433
01:22:17,120 --> 01:22:19,040
He's living a simple life out there.

1434
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:20,240
Investing in stocks.

1435
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:21,540
Yeah.

1436
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:25,200
S T A L K S

1437
01:22:30,160 --> 01:22:30,660
Nice.

1438
01:22:31,060 --> 01:22:35,700
And finally, Luke, tell me what Keith has been up to.

1439
01:22:35,700 --> 01:22:43,060
Um, he stands at the, is it pulpit pulpit, pulpit, pulpit.

1440
01:22:43,060 --> 01:22:52,180
He's got a choir of Keith's off to the side, kind of singing like that behind him is stained

1441
01:22:52,180 --> 01:22:58,980
glass with various depictions of Keith, his dog beans, some other characters.

1442
01:22:58,980 --> 01:22:59,480
Oh yeah.

1443
01:22:59,480 --> 01:23:03,320
You know, so many other story of Keith in stained glass.

1444
01:23:03,320 --> 01:23:03,560
Yeah.

1445
01:23:03,560 --> 01:23:06,280
But everybody kind of looks like Keith a little bit.

1446
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:06,780
Yeah.

1447
01:23:07,480 --> 01:23:16,920
Even beans kind of looks like a man face dog, man face dog.

1448
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:18,520
That's the villain of the next season.

1449
01:23:19,480 --> 01:23:20,600
And yeah, the camera.

1450
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:32,920
Pans, pans, pans, the camera pans to the pews and it's filled with everybody that came

1451
01:23:32,920 --> 01:23:36,040
back to contention and a lot of people that kind of look like Keith.

1452
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:38,200
There were a bunch of people from the city too.

1453
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:41,960
So they would all be here from the city and Keith's up there like, yeah.

1454
01:23:41,960 --> 01:23:46,520
So that's basically how, um, how this all happened.

1455
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:49,800
Uh, you guys have any questions for me?

1456
01:23:50,600 --> 01:23:57,080
Then we pan up and out of the first church of contention and we see the sign that says

1457
01:23:57,720 --> 01:23:59,560
welcome to Keith tension.

1458
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:05,320
I've got right here something I'm calling the loose threads montage.

1459
01:24:07,160 --> 01:24:09,160
Are you ready for the loose threads montage?

1460
01:24:09,160 --> 01:24:10,680
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

1461
01:24:10,680 --> 01:24:12,920
You could have called it a cop out.

1462
01:24:16,360 --> 01:24:18,040
We didn't have any loose threads, did we?

1463
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:23,960
It's going to be a short segment.

1464
01:24:28,200 --> 01:24:29,800
Loose threads montage!

1465
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:33,000
Loose threads in the world's tightest RPG podcast.

1466
01:24:36,760 --> 01:24:42,600
Two United States senators stood arms crossed behind a thick pane of glass.

1467
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:44,440
Oh wait, it's threads we never even touched?

1468
01:24:44,440 --> 01:24:51,960
This is acts like, Hey idiots, here's the parts of the game you never, you could have

1469
01:24:51,960 --> 01:24:54,520
met senators, you fucking morons.

1470
01:24:54,520 --> 01:24:57,080
But like, Nope.

1471
01:24:57,080 --> 01:25:01,560
He did say every time, you know, he's like, I've got these characters and they're moving

1472
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:02,440
while you're moving.

1473
01:25:02,440 --> 01:25:04,840
And if you interact with them, that's what happens.

1474
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:07,640
But otherwise they're still following their own agendas.

1475
01:25:07,640 --> 01:25:09,960
We just didn't know it included the fucking president.

1476
01:25:09,960 --> 01:25:11,720
Two United States senators.

1477
01:25:11,720 --> 01:25:13,480
We could have called the president.

1478
01:25:15,320 --> 01:25:25,800
They stood arms crossed behind a thick pane of glass as they watched an entire lab full

1479
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:32,280
of gaunt, tall men in white lab coats over black suits work with unnatural efficiency.

1480
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:37,880
And one said to the other, so that's what I've been trying to convey to you.

1481
01:25:37,880 --> 01:25:40,840
I'm not saying you have to vote yes on the bill.

1482
01:25:41,480 --> 01:25:46,280
These things are telling you that you have to vote yes on the bill or they'll kill you

1483
01:25:46,280 --> 01:25:47,400
and your husband.

1484
01:25:47,400 --> 01:25:52,600
You remember that couple, that bar corp guy's parents, they were found at home with their

1485
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:53,560
head smashed in.

1486
01:25:53,560 --> 01:25:57,720
That's what William and Lena beans got for having spines.

1487
01:25:57,720 --> 01:26:03,640
So now, and he kept talking as all these translucent skinned lab coated creatures, one by one,

1488
01:26:03,640 --> 01:26:07,960
began popping and morphing into myriad types of Keiths.

1489
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:12,520
And just as suddenly they each blipped out of existence entirely.

1490
01:26:13,800 --> 01:26:20,760
We zoom into the back wall of this now empty lab and focus in on the myriad logo, four

1491
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:26,040
double helices forming a capital M as in myriad.

1492
01:26:26,040 --> 01:26:34,280
And the M logo fades and reveals an ink M formed by a typewriter that has also finished

1493
01:26:34,280 --> 01:26:36,760
the name that follows, which is Marvin.

1494
01:26:36,760 --> 01:26:43,480
We're in a dark smoky room and a shaky pair of hands has just placed a transparency of

1495
01:26:43,480 --> 01:26:50,760
this file on the glass family crime boss on a dusty old overhead projector.

1496
01:26:50,760 --> 01:26:54,760
A grumbling man says, Marvin Glass is dead.

1497
01:26:55,480 --> 01:27:00,760
The other voices in the room, rhubarb, peas and carrots, and someone says, who will take

1498
01:27:00,760 --> 01:27:01,560
over the business?

1499
01:27:02,120 --> 01:27:10,120
And the same shaky hands replace Marvin Glass's overhead sheet with one that shows a picture

1500
01:27:10,680 --> 01:27:15,320
of Keith's genius niece, Francis beans.

1501
01:27:15,320 --> 01:27:21,960
This picture of Francis on the wall of this murky room morphs into the bloated lifeless

1502
01:27:21,960 --> 01:27:29,880
face of the Francis beans you all left to drown face down in Marvin Glass's fish tank.

1503
01:27:29,880 --> 01:27:37,480
But the long wobbly fingers of a strangely shaped woman and wonky goggles slowly tap

1504
01:27:38,200 --> 01:27:41,320
against this corpse currently dead face.

1505
01:27:42,040 --> 01:27:50,200
With her other hand of equally long wobbly fingers, this mad scientist types out a to

1506
01:27:50,200 --> 01:27:56,920
do list in her phone's notes, which is like a notebook, but on your phone.

1507
01:27:57,880 --> 01:28:08,440
And she types to do kill Kennedy, kill Harrison, kill McKinley.

1508
01:28:09,720 --> 01:28:11,800
Triangle shape screen wipe!

1509
01:28:11,800 --> 01:28:17,480
Agent McKinley, the old man with dead eyes, is secured to a chair by his straight jacket

1510
01:28:17,480 --> 01:28:19,960
in the middle of a small padded room.

1511
01:28:20,040 --> 01:28:28,120
The door opens and agents Kennedy and Harrison on either side make way for Donovan Westhaven

1512
01:28:28,120 --> 01:28:31,000
in a new black suit.

1513
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:38,120
Donovan walks up to the room's threshold, raises his pistol, fires, and the three agents

1514
01:28:38,120 --> 01:28:44,600
walk away down a hall and into a spacious, well decorated office.

1515
01:28:46,840 --> 01:28:49,320
A woman welcomes you into her office.

1516
01:28:49,320 --> 01:28:55,640
She has shoulder length, curly hair, and a mouth that not only takes up half of her face,

1517
01:28:55,640 --> 01:29:01,080
it is showing an amount of unbridled pleasure you can barely comprehend.

1518
01:29:01,880 --> 01:29:03,240
Donovan!

1519
01:29:03,240 --> 01:29:05,800
We're almost out of these code names.

1520
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:12,680
So go ahead and choose between Agent Taylor or Agent Garfield.

1521
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:13,960
I guess I'll be Taylor.

1522
01:29:13,960 --> 01:29:15,880
Agent Taylor it is!

1523
01:29:15,880 --> 01:29:16,920
Okie dokie!

1524
01:29:17,320 --> 01:29:19,480
Okie dokie, yeah.

1525
01:29:19,480 --> 01:29:23,800
Your next mission is to retrieve a missing person!

1526
01:29:23,800 --> 01:29:24,300
Yay!

1527
01:29:25,160 --> 01:29:31,560
And she opens up a folder to reveal a picture of the man who disappeared at his daughter's

1528
01:29:31,560 --> 01:29:34,840
funeral, Stan Manstein.

1529
01:29:35,560 --> 01:29:42,200
Cut to Stan Manstein as he picks up the receiver of a phone and begins talking into it.

1530
01:29:42,200 --> 01:29:45,880
Cut to whatever is on the other end of that phone.

1531
01:29:46,120 --> 01:29:49,560
That would be the Myriad in Keith's body.

1532
01:29:49,560 --> 01:29:50,360
Yes.

1533
01:29:50,360 --> 01:29:51,560
That's in a cage.

1534
01:29:51,560 --> 01:29:51,960
Yes.

1535
01:29:51,960 --> 01:29:53,560
Forced to answer that phone.

1536
01:29:53,560 --> 01:29:54,200
Where?

1537
01:29:54,200 --> 01:29:56,520
In the contention police department.

1538
01:29:56,520 --> 01:29:57,640
The Keith tension?

1539
01:29:57,640 --> 01:30:00,600
The Keith tension keith department.

1540
01:30:04,600 --> 01:30:11,240
That Myriad that's trapped in Keith's body is in a cage in the Keith tension police department

1541
01:30:11,240 --> 01:30:12,920
and it answers the phone.

1542
01:30:12,920 --> 01:30:20,120
It writes down notes into a notebook, rips off the page, and hands it, pokes it through

1543
01:30:20,760 --> 01:30:28,280
one of the small holes of its cage to the noir overseer here in Keith tension.

1544
01:30:32,040 --> 01:30:33,160
What does he look like?

1545
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:35,560
I mean, picture a noir detective.

1546
01:30:35,560 --> 01:30:38,600
He's wearing it because that's what he did when he designed it.

1547
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:39,640
I don't know what that means.

1548
01:30:40,200 --> 01:30:45,320
That's exactly how he did it when he put together this costume.

1549
01:30:46,680 --> 01:30:52,120
It's a long trench coat with a fedora and just a button-down shirt with a tie that's already

1550
01:30:52,840 --> 01:30:55,480
haphazardly tied around his neck.

1551
01:30:56,440 --> 01:30:58,280
He's already had a day, it looks like.

1552
01:30:58,920 --> 01:30:59,880
He's got stubble.

1553
01:31:01,160 --> 01:31:05,320
Yeah, this is the overseer as a noir style detective.

1554
01:31:05,320 --> 01:31:06,360
Yep, I love it.

1555
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:06,840
You love it.

1556
01:31:06,840 --> 01:31:07,720
We're all here for it.

1557
01:31:07,720 --> 01:31:08,840
This is his reward.

1558
01:31:10,520 --> 01:31:16,040
He takes the piece of paper out of this myriad's hand that's still in the form of Keith for

1559
01:31:16,040 --> 01:31:17,960
some fucking reason and in this cage.

1560
01:31:17,960 --> 01:31:19,960
No one will ever see him anyway, it doesn't matter.

1561
01:31:19,960 --> 01:31:24,360
Blips out to solve his case in a blink of blinding light.

1562
01:31:25,160 --> 01:31:27,880
Okay, yeah, so contention is rebuilt.

1563
01:31:27,880 --> 01:31:30,280
Everybody is having a great time.

1564
01:31:30,280 --> 01:31:31,320
Seemingly happy, yeah.

1565
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:36,200
I've granted wishes to anyone that asked them of me to the best of my ability.

1566
01:31:36,200 --> 01:31:39,400
Everybody's having a great time in this weird

1567
01:31:40,440 --> 01:31:40,440


1568
01:31:41,400 --> 01:31:49,320
Every time the overseer gets back from one of his cases, he describes it to Keith, who

1569
01:31:49,320 --> 01:31:51,560
is doing a true crime podcast.

1570
01:31:51,560 --> 01:31:55,400
Do you do the podcast live every Sunday from the pulpit?

1571
01:31:55,400 --> 01:31:58,920
Yes, yes, it's recorded and mandatory.

1572
01:32:02,120 --> 01:32:07,720
In order to be a citizen of Keith Tension, you have to go to story time on Sunday night.

1573
01:32:07,720 --> 01:32:09,080
Oh my God.

1574
01:32:09,720 --> 01:32:14,440
Um, and after, you know, a few weeks of this, everybody's getting settled in and it's kind

1575
01:32:14,440 --> 01:32:15,960
of a Keith-topia, really.

1576
01:32:20,920 --> 01:32:23,240
Well, literally, if you know what that means-

1577
01:32:23,240 --> 01:32:25,160
Shut up, Thomas!

1578
01:32:31,240 --> 01:32:31,960
Appropriate.

1579
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:42,840
Fucking, anyway, yeah, one day Keith is finishing his Sunday morning service and everybody goes

1580
01:32:42,840 --> 01:32:48,600
outside the church and there's a big dark something in the sky and everybody's like-

1581
01:32:48,600 --> 01:32:52,040
It's a bird, it's a plane, it's a Keith.

1582
01:32:52,040 --> 01:32:59,240
As it gets closer, you can tell it's like thousands of Keiths carrying a giant iron

1583
01:32:59,240 --> 01:33:02,920
dome and Keith is like waving them in, like they can-

1584
01:33:02,920 --> 01:33:03,960
Oh my God.

1585
01:33:03,960 --> 01:33:11,000
Yeah, and he gets- make sure it gets centered and they put it over the town of Keith Tension

1586
01:33:11,720 --> 01:33:13,960
and so now everybody can enjoy the darkness.

1587
01:33:15,720 --> 01:33:17,400
Oh my God.

1588
01:33:17,400 --> 01:33:22,520
Luke, that's literally what Mr. Burns did to Springfield in the Simpsons.

1589
01:33:23,960 --> 01:33:25,160
And we're from Springfield.

1590
01:33:25,160 --> 01:33:27,080
Yeah, but it's an iron dome.

1591
01:33:27,800 --> 01:33:30,600
The Simpsons- I'm just saying, the Simpsons predicted-

1592
01:33:36,600 --> 01:33:37,560
Oh shit.

1593
01:33:37,560 --> 01:33:43,080
Over the centuries, this town develops no eyeballs, but they can, you know-

1594
01:33:43,080 --> 01:33:44,680
No more of that, no more of that.

1595
01:33:44,680 --> 01:33:47,080
The cave people who keep tension.

1596
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:52,520
I don't want to think of the mole people who love contention.

1597
01:33:53,400 --> 01:33:54,920
You don't go to the dome.

1598
01:33:57,480 --> 01:33:59,560
You'll not date a dome girl.

1599
01:34:01,240 --> 01:34:02,520
She has no eyes.

1600
01:34:04,920 --> 01:34:06,520
But father, I love her.

1601
01:34:06,520 --> 01:34:08,360
I'll hear no more of this.

1602
01:34:08,360 --> 01:34:11,160
She sees more than any other girl I know.

1603
01:34:11,160 --> 01:34:14,360
She sees more than you, you blind old fool.

1604
01:34:27,080 --> 01:34:31,160
Mary and Caroline, I'm on the borderline.

1605
01:34:31,160 --> 01:34:38,920
Leaving my mind at your altar, crossing the double line, doing it every time.

1606
01:34:38,920 --> 01:34:44,360
Tell me what kind of world are you living in?

1607
01:34:47,720 --> 01:34:53,400
What kind of world are you living in?

1608
01:34:53,400 --> 01:34:56,840
And the channel changes, and we see the tops of trees,

1609
01:34:56,840 --> 01:35:02,760
thick enough to obscure any view of what is below and covered in a layer of kudzu.

1610
01:35:02,760 --> 01:35:05,080
They seem to go on endlessly.

1611
01:35:05,640 --> 01:35:09,400
Up and down, over hills and valleys, mountains and gorges,

1612
01:35:09,400 --> 01:35:13,240
there is nothing but dense, verdant forest.

1613
01:35:13,240 --> 01:35:19,400
A circular, calm lake finds itself somewhere in the midst of this lush wilderness,

1614
01:35:19,400 --> 01:35:26,040
and in the middle of that lake, a small island with less than a quarter mile from shore to shore.

1615
01:35:26,840 --> 01:35:33,400
Stunningly gorgeous flowers in every shade and shape fill varied gardens and planters

1616
01:35:33,400 --> 01:35:37,960
that somehow both overrun the terrain and complement it perfectly.

1617
01:35:38,680 --> 01:35:45,560
There's a small welcome sign that reads, welcome to calm, comfy campground.

1618
01:35:46,120 --> 01:35:52,840
At the edge of the water, Maggie Cook sits on top of a bulky metal box.

1619
01:35:53,560 --> 01:35:56,840
Based on the path left in the wake of this thing,

1620
01:35:56,840 --> 01:36:01,640
it took some real elbow grease to drag this hefty container all the way out here.

1621
01:36:02,200 --> 01:36:06,520
But Maggie doesn't look tired from hoofing this thing out to the lake.

1622
01:36:07,240 --> 01:36:12,120
She looks mentally exhausted, emotionally brutalized.

1623
01:36:12,680 --> 01:36:13,720
She looks done.

1624
01:36:14,600 --> 01:36:24,280
Her dad is dead, Fergie is dead, Leon is dead, Anne is dead, and Clark isn't coming.

1625
01:36:25,240 --> 01:36:28,760
She failed everyone, she failed herself.

1626
01:36:29,800 --> 01:36:36,600
Maggie Cook stands up and walks toward the large, equally cute and cozy,

1627
01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:39,400
hexagonal building in the middle of this island.

1628
01:36:40,360 --> 01:36:47,800
Inside, she finds a thick manila envelope, and her own handwriting is scrawled,

1629
01:36:48,680 --> 01:36:51,880
New Maggie in black marker.

1630
01:36:53,240 --> 01:36:59,880
She picks up this envelope, holds her new life against her chest, and opens a door

1631
01:36:59,880 --> 01:37:07,160
into a room completely filled with stunningly gorgeous flowers in every shade and shape.

1632
01:37:07,240 --> 01:37:12,360
Maggie Cook takes a deep breath, and shuts the door behind her.

1633
01:37:16,760 --> 01:37:17,260
Welp.

1634
01:37:20,600 --> 01:37:26,040
Looks like it's about time for me to leave this newfangled contention.

1635
01:37:26,040 --> 01:37:29,960
One Keith was too much for me, much too much.

1636
01:37:29,960 --> 01:37:35,800
But more than that, I can smell that I might be needed elsewhere in some dimension.

1637
01:37:37,720 --> 01:37:43,480
I've sopped up all the grease a growin' boy like me can round these parts.

1638
01:37:43,480 --> 01:37:46,920
It's time to move on to greasier pastures.

1639
01:37:47,480 --> 01:37:53,240
Me and my dog, Wolf the dog, will always be there when you need us.

1640
01:37:53,240 --> 01:37:58,600
Just look for us to be, uh, grabbin' a bite at your local diner's dumpster.

1641
01:37:59,160 --> 01:38:05,400
Remember, y'all, this ain't goodbye, it's smell ya later, my babies.

1642
01:38:06,120 --> 01:38:12,200
My children, my most trusted confidants, my mortal enemies.

1643
01:38:12,920 --> 01:38:18,840
But before I go, I do have a brand new song here hot off the presses.

1644
01:38:18,840 --> 01:38:21,800
Too hot to handle, ouchie ouchie.

1645
01:38:22,360 --> 01:38:30,680
It's time to premiere this fresh track, this tasty, toasty sonata of a new release.

1646
01:38:30,680 --> 01:38:33,480
You never heard this song before.

1647
01:38:33,480 --> 01:38:47,400
It's kudzu with no back bone.

1648
01:38:50,920 --> 01:39:01,400
Hot dog.

1649
01:39:03,480 --> 01:39:14,920
How am I the only one tryin' to pull over?

1650
01:39:14,920 --> 01:39:23,400
How can ya have enough drownin' out of the noise?

1651
01:39:23,400 --> 01:39:37,960
With no back bone, no back bone, no back bone.

1652
01:39:37,960 --> 01:39:45,160
Fight, fight, street me down, takes me back to where you're from.

1653
01:39:45,720 --> 01:39:56,200
Don't stop, a dime of devotion to only one.

1654
01:39:56,200 --> 01:40:15,240
With no back bone, no back bone, no back bone, no back bone.

1655
01:40:26,200 --> 01:40:53,240
Don't give up, don't give up, don't give up, don't give up.

1656
01:40:53,240 --> 01:41:20,280
Don't give up, don't give up, don't give up, don't give up.

1657
01:41:23,240 --> 01:41:30,280
Don't give up, don't give up, don't give up, don't give up.
