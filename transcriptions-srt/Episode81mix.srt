1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,920
What's up everybody, I'm Zach, this is Pretending to be People, and Black Lives Matter.

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,600
Thanks to the generosity of so many of you supporting us on Patreon,

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:16,080
we were able to match donations this week up to $1500 in support of The Bail Project,

4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:21,040
which is a national revolving bail fund on a mission to combat mass incarceration and

5
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:26,560
reshape the pretrial system in the United States. We chose this group specifically because this

6
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:33,440
money will support those in our country who are protesting systemic racism and police brutality.

7
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:38,960
These people are begging for justice, and we support their fight. We were absolutely

8
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:46,480
elated by the response from this community. Y'all raised $1500 in just 15 hours. Incredible.

9
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:53,200
As of this recording, together we have raised $3600 for The Bail Project. Let's keep this

10
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:58,960
thing going. For every $5 donated, you'll receive an entry for a chance to win one

11
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:05,040
of the first official PTBP shirts. There will be five winners, the first of which

12
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:12,640
will be announced right now. Brendan DiPinto, congratulations, you just won

13
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:18,400
a Pretending to be People shirt. Boom, four more to go. You can find the link to donate in the

14
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:25,680
show notes. And while I don't think saying Black Lives Matter is a political statement,

15
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:31,840
what is a political statement is this, please register to vote. The presidential election is

16
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:37,680
five months away, and it is very likely that two seats on the Supreme Court will be filled by

17
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:45,040
whoever wins. This is not the time for third party candidates or write-ins. If Donald Trump wins

18
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,320
again, the Supreme Court will have a 7-2 conservative majority, which I believe will

19
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:56,960
lead to inhumane restrictions on abortion, disgusting removal of LGBTQIA plus rights,

20
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:02,640
absurdly loose gun control, furthering of the corporatocracy, and the continuation of the

21
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:09,360
death penalty. Fuck all of that, and fuck Donald Trump. Back to you, Wolf the Dog.

22
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:15,760
Top of the morning to you, pupperinos. It's your toilet diving canine, Wolf the Dog,

23
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:24,080
and I'm back stroking like Michael Phelps all up in y'all's toilet water live from 694.2 PTBP.

24
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,920
This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Matt Fagel, who tweeted about the show and tagged

25
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:37,440
that pretending pod. They right. I'd like to send love and support to my hometown of Minneapolis.

26
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:43,360
I don't live there anymore, but I'm so fucking proud of them for standing up the way they have.

27
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:49,120
My old friends, classmates, and neighbors have been taking care of each other and refusing to

28
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:55,680
back down. They could now give masterclasses in crisis management to any other city in the

29
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:02,960
country. It's scary times, but I'm so damn proud of them. Damn, baby Matt. I'm proud of you for

30
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:09,760
sending this in the internet mail, and I'm proud of any who stand up to those who would diminish

31
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:16,240
the freedoms of others. Wolf bless you, Matt, and Wolf bless you all for the work y'all are doing

32
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:23,040
out there on the front lines, the back lines, and lines we don't even know about. We all fight

33
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:29,440
battles in our own ways, but what's important is that we keep on battling for a better future

43
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:40,320
mustard, it's time to catch up with the news. Last time in the fucked up puddle-filled ghost town of

44
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:47,760
contention, Keith Vigna finally collected his $3 from Terrence Liquor, who was out collecting

45
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:56,640
for daddy with Luca Fade Fadswigs. They had a picture of Keith Vigna in liquor's truck with

46
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:03,360
a note that said, collect alive. John Lee Pettymore the third has ooze just dripping

47
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:11,840
constantly out of every orifice in his head. Keith saw this, lost his shit, accidentally shot Fade in

48
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:18,320
the dome and threatened John with the same if he didn't get back in the truck's waterbed.

49
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:24,640
Randy Angst isn't who the boys remember him being. Randy's cane had a Rubik's Cube on the

50
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:31,600
grip instead of a big tooth like Clark remembered because Randy isn't a dentist. He runs the

51
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:39,600
Children's Museum of Mathematics and Randy didn't remember fighting any sort of android robot man.

52
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:46,880
This baron stain on my memory has me all baron steamed up and ready for some mother

53
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:53,360
creatin' father fuckin' kudzu with no backbone.

54
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:27,920
Hello everyone and welcome to pretending to be people. I am Zach and I am here with Luke

55
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:35,200
and Thomas and Joe. How is everyone doing this evening? Doing good, how you doing my bud? Good.

56
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,720
You feeling all right?

57
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:47,280
I got rid of it all. Our boy just revealed in a flurry of a hat pull a shaved head baby.

58
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,560
Whoa wow so I uh yeah I was definitely on another screen.

59
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,800
Oh it looks like something.

60
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:07,680
Yeah you should go you should go maybe less on the parts that are still here.

61
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,560
I've got a lot on the sides. You do.

62
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:24,000
You've got a nice hat collection that's for sure. Hell yeah I do. It's a good shine on the top

63
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:29,440
there I dig that. Yeah thank you thank you. We're getting towards the mirror you know but I want

64
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,320
when we finally hit that Patreon level to where I get hair plugs I want people to fucking know.

65
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,920
Yeah it's a mark of success for sure.

66
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,680
Have you guys uh pulled the trigger on any uh things that you've been thinking

67
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,960
about for a while during this quarantine? Yeah I did the I did a bidet I bought a bidet

68
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,080
that's 100% the thing that I never would have done before this quarantine.

69
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,480
I gotta tell you though I don't exactly know what it's all cracked up to be because I was

70
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:08,880
brushing my teeth just fine without it. Does it help a little bit with that though? If I get my

71
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:15,280
mouth right on it it helps a little. How is it so far though? Uh for real I dig it it works.

72
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:21,920
Did wait so you did you get it specifically to avoid the toilet paper issue? Uh not directly

73
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,880
but it's because like Twitter was blowing up with people talking about how much they love their

74
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:32,640
bidets because they weren't in the throes of the toilet paper mayhem so I saw a bunch of feedback

75
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,160
about how much people loved them so I thought I'd try one. Well I can't wait to try it out

76
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:44,640
sometime. I don't want my own I just want to try yours. Even if I don't have to poop I'll try it.

77
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,360
Yeah can does it work when you're standing? I can get I can get real far away from it yeah.

78
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:00,240
Thomas Luke life normal. Same old shit. Well if you get a bidet yeah then you'll have something

79
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,120
to talk about on this goddamn podcast. And you won't have the same old shit. It will be new

80
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:12,000
shit yeah if I get a bidet. I'm sorry listeners that I haven't done anything uh interesting with

81
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:18,000
my butt this quarantine. Wait really though like you're not experimenting or anything?

82
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,840
With like yeah home hemorrhoid remedies but nothing else. Yeah I think I have hemorrhoids

83
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:30,720
I've developed hemorrhoids from sitting so much no joke. Welcome to the club I believe the

84
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:37,680
Preparation H wipes are my go-to personally. You can keep yours in Taylor's purse too if you want

85
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,720
uh it works for when you're on the go. Thanks.

86
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,360
Tell her thank you. Hemorrhoids are dope.

87
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,240
I've been coloring my own toilet paper.

88
00:09:54,400 --> 00:10:00,080
And with that let's kick into gear Clark Bishop just tackled Randy Anx through the door of his

89
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:09,120
own house into the foyer of the angst home while Keith Vigna is standing over Terrence T. Licker.

90
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:17,360
Terrence Elizabeth Licker who is on the ground below him. The corpse of Luca Fade Fudgevitz is

91
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:25,680
leaning up against the garage door and bleeding down the driveway of the angst home while John

92
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:32,480
Lee Pettymore the Thirth is in the back of the truck that is in the driveway along with his

93
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:41,280
soul's cousin or his mind's cousin but his body's nephew Jimmy Sanders and I believe where we left

94
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:49,200
off Keith Vigna was hollering. I was ordering John to get back in the water. Yeah and he did

95
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:57,040
if I recall. Yeah and he did indeed. Oh no Mr. Sir Bishop please I don't and his head is just

96
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:06,240
like slamming into the linoleum of the entryway of this old home. Oh god no I just. Clark is starting

97
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:12,880
to calm down some that he has slammed this old man into the ground so hard and feeling bad about it.

98
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:17,520
He starts to he starts to come to his senses and and maybe recoils and panic a little bit and kind

99
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:24,320
of backs out the door leaving him on the ground. Oh no why did you came in? As the door closes

100
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,840
behind you as you go back in. I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry Randy I'm sorry

101
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:35,760
I'm sorry. And you exit out the door back into the front yard of Randy Yanks home where you back

102
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:40,880
up into Keith Vigna. I uh my back hits you and your gun is still pointed at John right? Yeah.

103
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,240
I look over at him is he looking normal to me?

104
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:55,440
No man. I mean I mean his face is white and his hands are red from the blood that is rushed to

105
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,960
his fingertips as he's been using his hands to jostle this old man's head into the floor.

106
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:07,280
But other than that he's good to go. Yeah he's probably like crying and shit but he's fine. Okay

107
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:13,040
I look back at John as he like dunks underneath the water when he comes back up what do I see?

108
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:24,800
He doesn't. He's laying low for a little bit. I look at Clark. John had the ooze all coming out

109
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,440
of him all over him coming out of him. I had to get him in the water. You just saw it just now?

110
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,680
I just saw it. I told him to get in the water. What were you doing right before

111
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:39,440
that right before you saw it happen? Uh well I kind of gesture over to

112
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,920
Luca. Oh my oh my god. I kind of freaked out there for a second. You fucking saw him man you sawed

113
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:54,400
him. You got another body T. Keith did you did you did you did you kill him did you kill him?

114
00:12:54,400 --> 00:13:01,600
I kind of I lost control for a second and yeah I tried to I tried to kill him and I shot at

115
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,000
Terrence and I shot at Jimmy. Clark wants to start as he's explaining reaching out to try and

116
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,480
pull the gun down lower to the ground so it's not pointed at anything right now. Yeah I'd let it

117
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:19,440
happen. Terrence Liger is backing up like into the the house. He's like trying to get into Randy's

118
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:30,480
house. Clark make sure he doesn't get away. Hey hey Terrence you stay you stay out here we don't

119
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:35,520
want you going in there with Randy. He just like leans up against the door on the ground still he's

120
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:42,320
like scooched backwards crab crawl and then he leans up against the front door and there's a

121
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:48,400
shot where you can see in the foreground you've got Terrence Liger leaning up against the front

122
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:56,880
door and in the background you've got a dead fade leaning up against the garage door. John you in

123
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:02,000
there? Before any we do any of that who the you're gonna have to remind me who Fade was

124
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:10,960
and Terrence Liger. It was Rocky Balboa was Fade. Hey Luca Fajovitz. Hey I'm Luca. Hey everybody

125
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:17,520
calls me Fade. He's a little guy he's really wide he was a bodybuilder and he was sent to collect

126
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:28,240
alongside Terrence Licker who owns Lickers Lickers Lickers and he has had beef with Keith Vigna but

127
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:33,360
I think it's been solved with three dollars of that three single dollars right they were sent

128
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:43,360
to collect Randy Yanks by the church by Pastor Adam Kane. Now go Joe. John you in there you can

129
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:49,360
come out. John cautiously pokes his head up and and looks around this is a pickup truck right

130
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:56,000
with water in the bed so he you just see his eyes like come up above the bed and he kind of scopes

131
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,600
it out and he he ducks down you can't see his eyes anymore but you can still see um the top

132
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,800
of his head. I got Keith to put the gun down you you can you can come up. Clark he he when I saw

133
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:11,200
his eyes he didn't have he didn't have goo coming out of him anymore I think the water worked.

134
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:16,160
Keith says Keith says you're all right now. Yeah okay you got the gun from him he's not gonna.

135
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:21,200
I've got the gun in my hand but I'm not pointing it at you anymore. Gun is down and he seems to be

136
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:26,160
uh clear-eyed and clear-headed at this point I don't I don't know. I holster my gun and walk

137
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,920
back and put my hands up a little bit. He's holstering his gun and walking back with his

138
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:35,680
hands up a little bit. Don't get that guy he's crazy man he's crazy you can't get him out of

139
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:41,920
there leave him in there let's go let's bail. Go where? I don't I mean we need to get you

140
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:48,720
to the F C F C that way we can save the world right like you are our prince. I don't think

141
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:54,240
that's gonna be happening. Uh what's the F C F C F C the was it the first church of contention?

142
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:59,440
The first kreek family is contented. First kreek right first kreek family? First kreek family

143
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,920
contention you know we're just a big family we're trying to go back and save the world but we need

144
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:10,160
we need bodies and we need peace. You guys you guys of all people should want to go buy it we

145
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:15,520
we're you're out here trying to trying to save everything but we have a plan to save everything

146
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:20,800
so I don't understand why you're fighting against it you can help we can save the world together.

147
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:26,960
It's just your plans has not been clearly enunciated to us and uh also the fact that

148
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:32,480
you need bodies and our friend is a little weird but our friend did just create a body.

149
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:38,880
Yeah you can take Luca back and have that and that's our little gift to you and we'll think

150
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:43,440
about giving you Keith maybe later. Well and I think we're gonna end up back at the church

151
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:48,960
we're just it's not our first stop yet we got other stuff to do to help. Well you certainly

152
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:54,480
didn't seem like you're helping earlier I mean are you even on the side of daddy? We don't know.

153
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:02,480
I want to say yeah but yeah we don't know yet I mean yeah we are yeah we gotta go somewhere

154
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:08,320
get some more fish and water to help out first. We know but we're good on fish and water. No there

155
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:14,640
was a it turns out there was a leak yeah late breaking news you probably haven't heard about

156
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:20,480
it since you got sent out but there was a big old leak in a bunch of the fish uh plumb dried up

157
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:26,800
there they spilled into the end of the out of the out of the wall of water and into a parking lot

158
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:34,720
of a grocery store uh and unfortunately there they uh they were baked uh in the in the daytime sun.

159
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,200
Yeah so we need we need we're going we're going to take this truck full of water to go get more

160
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,040
fish naturally look we've already got a head start you can see some fishes in there.

161
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,480
Everybody go ahead and roll alertness for me.

162
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:58,640
I pass a 42 on a 70. 20 on a 60. Alertness I got a 50 on a 60.

163
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:06,400
Everyone succeeds the ground is kind of vibrating you can hear in the distance

164
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,640
the low rumble of vehicles more than one.

165
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:25,760
And it is growing increasingly louder and it is heading in your direction.

166
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:30,400
Boys I what you want to get out of here. I thought I think I think we ought to you feel that.

167
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,560
Terrence you you stay here get inside lock yourself in there don't touch

168
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,880
anybody or anything and and don't come out till we talk to you again.

169
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,480
You leave Randy alone in there too he doesn't want to go with you so you don't get to take

170
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,320
order get inside and stay there lock all the doors.

171
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:52,880
He listens to everything you've said and he's like yeah all right and he uh backs up he kind

172
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:58,240
of opens up the door behind him you know behind his back and then he slides through it and you

173
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:10,240
see him slide back on his on his butt and then he kicks the door closed and you hear uh you know

174
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:16,320
how conversation sounds. Right guys I think we should hop in this get back to

175
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:22,000
carry and go to the pond what do you think? I've never even seen a number two without cucumber at

176
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,040
a time like this you couldn't fight me to not put oil on a sandwich you hear me because what

177
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:31,120
I'm saying is that and I guess we'll keep we'll keep Jimmy in the back too.

178
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:35,600
Just want to remind you that Jimmy Sanders is still yeah he's just he's all wet so we

179
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:41,200
thought we'd just keep him back here. He's also a uh a goo detector for us if if they're using

180
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,120
them the same way we might as well too. John are you gonna stay in the back or are you gonna come

181
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:50,880
get in the cab? Uh I'm pretty wet I should probably stay back here maybe I don't want

182
00:19:50,880 --> 00:20:00,160
to make a mess. Okay uh Clark how's are you good at driving? Oh also if nobody is I can drive I

183
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:07,440
guess. Also I'm really wet but I am the best driver. I'd say I'm just below average at driving.

184
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:12,080
I tell you I'm exactly average at it. All right all right move over move over let me show you.

185
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,960
It doesn't matter if we get the seats wet it's not our truck anyway.

186
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,880
As Clark is walking around the back of the truck he's gonna look in the bed and see those fish

187
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:28,400
and say hey I'll ride back here and jump right in. Okay boys. Hey does Clark does Clark seem to be

188
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:34,160
real interested in all these fish? Yeah he's running his hands over some of them back there

189
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:38,080
and kind of giggling the whole time. He's like a goddamn fish whisperer. He's actually pretty

190
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:43,920
strange. Also sorry I pointed my gun at you but I saw goo coming out of your eyes and all over

191
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:48,960
again I just freaked out. I don't see it anymore but I don't know what happened. Keith you ain't

192
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:54,480
got to apologize for being an irresponsible thank you. I appreciate that. Just take it in stride

193
00:20:54,480 --> 00:21:00,720
when you're riding with Keith Vigna. I opened the like back window thing to where we can talk to

194
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:05,360
Clark in the back of the truck. Clark is holding up a trout. They got trout back here man.

195
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:12,240
Sweet uh well if if you're gonna be safe back there what's our next step? Should we go should

196
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:17,360
we go straight to the pond or do we need to get carry? What do you think? Clark drops the fish.

197
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:23,520
I mean we were headed toward the pond kind of independent of the carry thing. Wasn't the carry

198
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:28,400
more of a church thing and we were gonna maybe do that later? Well we got her in the back of the

199
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:33,680
car. We were I thought we were just dropping keeping her there while we went and got my watch

200
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:38,320
but whatever you guys think I don't know. Yeah but then that turned into a whole thing so. Yeah should

201
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:43,200
we just head to the pond and leave her be? Nobody's probably gonna find her. She's shackled up in

202
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:50,240
there. Plus I'm sure this will just be a 15-minute jaunt. That's true. Let's get there. Nothing ever

203
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:57,920
takes too long. No no it never it never takes days or anything so. It's almost like I warned us that

204
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:03,360
this might happen but. All right I gotta go pee. Well we have the opportunity right now to change

205
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:10,640
our fates. All right go pee and I'm gonna look at the map and see what makes sense. We could also

206
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:15,680
not wait until he gets back and just do it so that when he gets back we're already at the pond.

207
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:20,480
Yeah okay we pull up to the pond and then now we gotta wait for him to tell us what to do.

208
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,320
Yeah there we go. We've been waiting we described a bunch of stuff that happened. Where are we at?

209
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:30,080
We're at the pond now. Oh sick did you guys see all the really cool stuff on the way there? No

210
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:39,200
we closed our eyes and went. We discovered a new item that lets us teleport. Whoa what was it?

211
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:44,320
It was in Fade's pocket. Yeah it was the keys to the truck and the truck is a teleportation device.

212
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:51,440
Also one thing that happens if you're not inside the teleportation device everything within five

213
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:57,120
miles gets dies so we beat the game too. Yeah good game Zach that was cool. Yeah yeah cool

214
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:02,400
thank you everyone that's been pretending to be people I guess. I hope that was the end you were

215
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,480
looking for. Everything's resolved.

216
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,760
Thanks bye. So press stop and I'll ask it. Yeah.

217
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,280
Just upload it right to Google Drive. Okay. Have a good night guys. Okay.

218
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:42,880
I think that we're leaning toward the idea that we're going to navigate back to our car

219
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:48,480
and try and take it around to the south of the city and come up toward Bean's pond from the

220
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:53,280
south. Yeah yeah that absolutely makes sense. Did you guys just do do do do we want to try and take

221
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:56,960
the truck with us or do it on foot? Let's take the truck. If we take the truck are we gonna have to

222
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:02,000
go by that crane barrier thing? Presumably if we're turning the car around and trying to go

223
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:09,360
somewhere to head south it looks like the road just south of the hotel also leads leads west.

224
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:15,760
East? Yeah east yeah so presumably it's um like go all you're wanting to avoid the barriers so

225
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:20,640
we're talking about turning the car around on the highway. Okay yeah. And then driving somewhere

226
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:26,960
east to get to a longer way around town. Yeah. But you weren't you asking about how to get the truck

227
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:33,200
out though? Right we take it east and take it by the library. Oh gotcha. And then off the map to

228
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:38,880
the side there to wherever we're going to. And then go it actually just pac-mans and you come

229
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:43,120
back through on the west side. Okay then we'll. Oh cool then we just pop straight down.

230
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:51,280
We'll go up until we're down. No but yeah let's do that east until we intersect with the highway

231
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:59,200
go west. Okay. And at that exact moment you see that on each side of the street down on the east

232
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:05,680
and west side of the street of this house heading toward your direction there is just a front half

233
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:12,400
cab of a truck with a trailer on the back with a hot tub situated and strapped in onto the trailer.

234
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:20,800
And then on the other side coming down is a impala and the back has been also tarped into

235
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,560
an appropriate. You're thinking of a. No do impalas not have that? You're thinking of an

236
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:28,640
El Camino? You're thinking of an El Camino. I was thinking of an El Camino. Yeah it's still cool.

237
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:35,200
On the other side there is an impala coming down and it has a refrigerator that's strapped to the

238
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:41,280
top of it with its door ripped off then there's someone like inside the refrigerator on top of

239
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:48,000
the impala. Nice. Guys Sam and Dean Winchester are here to save us. Yeah who's who's impala and

240
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,800
El Camino are these? Do we recognize them as the vehicles of townsfolk? No longer an El Camino.

241
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:59,200
Just an impala. It's a truck with a trailer and an impala with a refrigerator. Do we recognize

242
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:06,000
the impala? Weirdly enough you guys never you didn't meet a whole lot of people in contention.

243
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:11,440
I mean we're from here though. I don't mean on our time in the podcast I mean in our time

244
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:22,000
spending our entire lives as citizens of this small town. Yeah. Does somebody drive an impala?

245
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:30,640
Uh you know the impala belongs to a very nice couple who live in the suburbs and they are

246
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:37,520
members of the first church of contention and their names are Asher and Avery Little. Nice

247
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:44,080
married couple who recently had two children who are twins. I mean you can try to pull at

248
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,360
our heartstrings but it doesn't mean we're not going to start shooting the second these people

249
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:55,920
pull up. There are no strings to pull at my dear sir. So are they blocking us in on this street

250
00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:00,640
basically? That is the attempt yes. Well boys what do you want to do? I mean these cars like

251
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:05,200
these vehicles are way cooler and more capable than what we're trying to get so maybe we just

252
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:11,760
take one of theirs. Take both of theirs. You want to try to get that truck then or the fridge

253
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:17,200
doesn't look like it's too stable. Yeah but that's a fucking cherry impala. It's up to you you're

254
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:23,920
driving you go that way and then I pull my gun out and I'll shoot. Wait wait wait what if what

255
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:28,080
if you just hit reverse and we get out of here perpendicular to them both through the through

256
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:33,200
the field? We could I just I kind of wouldn't it be cool to drive that big mad max truck around?

257
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,640
I don't want to kill anybody though we've done enough of that today.

258
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:43,280
That's true okay well I punch it in reverse. Okay roll drive. Reversing north and then I want to

259
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:51,280
yeah spin around and head the right way. 59 we're heading back to our car. Okay sounds good you have

260
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:58,320
a couple tails. Are they cutting across the field at us? Okay so as you back up through the yard and

261
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:03,840
the bumps bumps and you hear jimmy sanders in the back just like oh I can't put a needle on that

262
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:09,280
and like water's just like spilling out there's fish flying out you see in the rear view mirror

263
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:14,800
but you you bumble on through and the truck is boom boom boom back and forth and back and forth.

264
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:19,280
Clark you were just like slipping slipping from side to side in this water. Holding on for dear

265
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:26,960
life yeah. And jimmy is too and the two of you are uh I can only imagine is just like the wildest

266
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:33,840
wave pool the tiniest wildest wave pool of two grown ass men inside. Just fish slapping him in

267
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:43,120
the face. So john puts it in reverse um guns it hard says sorry fish he's peeling he's peeling

268
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:51,520
straight back does a sweet e-brake turn full like uh 180 facing the other direction peels out again

269
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:57,280
leaves a bunch of disgusting tire smoke uh in everybody's faces and probably some squished fish

270
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:05,120
oh and it fucking reeks uh as this uh this incredibly bad smell just gets fouled around

271
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:15,440
through the the december cold air of contention and you leave a wake of rancid fish smell in your

272
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:22,080
dust. And now as you hit this road you're coming up along the the road that hotel motel is on.

273
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:27,840
Are you just jumping the curb straight up onto the side road or? Yeah like if it seems feasible

274
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:33,440
I'm just heading straight for the highway again. Kerry pages is our only bargaining chip here.

275
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:40,320
This truck is like what are you just like throwing the axle up into the air every time you

276
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:47,920
hit another hill to jump another curb and go up onto the the side road and then up onto the

277
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:54,320
highway. Thankfully the the metal gate broke away from a crash that happened three years ago it just

278
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:59,280
doesn't exist anymore right there on the exit and so you drive right up onto the highway from the

279
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:04,400
opposite side and you would be driving into oncoming traffic but you can cut across through

280
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:10,480
the median the grass in between two lanes of traffic on the highway and then on to when I

281
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,760
said you would be going in oncoming traffic you wouldn't be you'd be on the right side.

282
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,080
I was in Britain in my head. Oh fuck off.

283
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:25,920
You've never been to England? Oh yeah Thomas have you never been to England? Cheers mate.

284
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,640
Worse I've been to Italy.

285
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:38,160
Cheers mate. I could out obnoxious you in a heartbeat. Well I believe that so you

286
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:45,440
cross the median of the highway. I'm confused about the logistics of the roadblock previously

287
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:53,120
is it just not on this exit or is this? If you're looking at the exit of contention as a T the

288
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:59,680
roadblock would be on the northeast side and you're coming at it from the southeast side and

289
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:06,160
then going way more east. Once we do that we're heading back to our car. Yeah that's where we

290
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:10,000
just went. Did we make it to our car? Here I'll put it to you this way John Lee Pettymore as

291
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:16,720
you're driving on the highway which you would be just off of the exit leading out of contention

292
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:23,040
toward the city as you're on this strip of the highway you see behind you the truck and the

293
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:29,520
El Camino are in pursuit and they're following so you have the option. It's an Impala. Fuck.

294
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:38,960
You have the option to head to the 2001 Mitsubishi Eclipse or to not head to the

295
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:44,720
2001 Mitsubishi Eclipse but currently you have a truck and an Impala on your tail.

296
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:51,200
I head to the 2001 Mitsubishi Eclipse I yell to Clark in the back be ready to grab pages.

297
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:56,400
I kind of swing alongside and have him hop out and then I immediately flip him around

298
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:03,200
and like start driving the truck forward and backwards menacingly near the Mitsubishi. I do

299
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:07,440
that I jump out but as soon as I jump out I start going keys keys keys keys keys I need somebody to

300
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:11,920
and I'm holding my hand up somebody's got to throw me the keys to the trunk. Like an Edgar Wright cut

301
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:16,720
you just see the keys zoom straight into your hands from my pocket.

302
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,520
Thomas knows how to have me not call for a check.

303
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:29,440
I get the keys and I pop open the trunk. Boy I hope she's still in there. Yes.

304
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,960
Yes.

305
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:41,600
Yes. Sweet. I pulled the body of Drew out and like chuck him into the back of the truck

306
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:47,680
and I get around to the side. Oh wait do we have Tyler with us? No we have him on a leash.

307
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:52,400
He's in the cab. He's in the cab. Yeah we did let him right in front. And I jump back into the back

308
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:58,720
of the pickup. Well here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna do a check. Their drive versus

309
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:06,080
Clark's. Either athletics or dexterity in order to see if they can arrive in time. I'd like to

310
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:10,800
aid him with my drive as I'm trying to fend them off. I like that. Yeah so you go ahead and roll

311
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:19,840
the drive first. 96. So that's not gonna help uh as you're just spinning out.

312
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:30,640
Oh shit dude. No. 98. Damn. I rolled a crit success. Oh boy. Of course. 44 baby. Oh boy.

313
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:36,400
What happens? Where where in the sequence of events did this did the critical success occur?

314
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:46,080
Exactly. So so I'm imagining that just off the highway there's a slight ditch curved down which

315
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:52,480
is where the 2001 Red Mitsubishi Eclipse is and you're alongside of it and Clark hops out of the

316
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:58,320
truck bed and is like keys keys keys. Toss him the keys. Edgar Wright cut. He runs over. Opens up the

317
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:06,080
trunk. Edgar Wright cut. Drew is inside and as soon as you grab Drew and toss him onto the ground you

318
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:13,760
see above you on the highway in front of you and behind you have pulled up this big truck. Trailer

319
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:19,440
on the back. Hot tub strapped into the back and a cherry Impala with a refrigerator strapped to

320
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:31,040
the top. I have to go pee again so sorry. We uh we blew up the truck and the Impala while you were

321
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:37,440
gone. Sick. Oh man did everyone die? Yeah. Not us though. Yeah we were good. Oh right. We we we got

322
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,760
a super jump ability while you were gone also so we just jumped above the explosion and then landed

323
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:47,520
back down. Was there a cool object that gave you super jump ability? Yeah. Well also Tyler Gerwings

324
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:51,760
and we can ride him wherever we want now. That's that's what it was I forgot. Yeah the jump thing

325
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,840
was something we proposed but then we decided to just ride Tyler. Yeah. Right. You guys are really

326
00:34:55,840 --> 00:35:01,040
good at this. What else happened? Oh we all got a billion dollars. Yeah. And the and the medal of

327
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:08,960
honor. Well that's pretty easy to get these days. Yeah. We got Rush Limbaugh with us now. Oh good.

328
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:14,000
Rush what should we do next? As an Eagles fan and an American. Not a fan.

329
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:20,880
What else happened? The whole zombie subplot we just nipped in the bud. I used to think that

330
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:25,920
that phrase was nipped in the butt. Like you bite its butt. Yeah. Just bite the butt. Yeah just a

331
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:34,880
little nip it in the bud. Was that was that Andy Griffith show? Yeah it was. That was pretty that

332
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:42,160
was pretty solid. What's that dude's name? Don Knotts. Don Knotts that's right. What was the

333
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:47,040
character's name? No I'm totally. Yeah okay fuck off because I was just gonna let it sit there.

334
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:51,120
That was it Barney. Barney. I was just gonna let it sit there because I couldn't remember either.

335
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:55,120
Yeah uh-huh Barney Fife. Barney Fife. Do you think Thomas is pooping?

336
00:35:55,120 --> 00:36:07,120
Can everyone hear me? Yeah. Yep and immediately you all hear this

337
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:12,320
hooping and hollering coming from the person who's in the refrigerator on top of the Impala

338
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:22,800
and coming from the hot tub you just hear this and then all of a sudden you hear glass shatter

339
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:29,360
as a body comes flying out of the shotgun side of the truck and it is lifted up in the air

340
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:35,760
and then slammed into the ground. Holy shit just the once? Well we're now in initiative order.

341
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:40,480
Clark it is your turn you are outside of the truck bed and you are outside of the 2001

342
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:45,120
Mitsubishi Eclipse and you have Drew's body with carry pages inside of it on the ground next to

343
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:50,480
you what do you do? I just want to use my turn to hook Drew's body into the back of the truck.

344
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:55,360
Done. Keith what are you doing? Do I recognize the person? It seems to be one of the homeless

345
00:36:55,360 --> 00:37:02,240
people they have got the similar vibe as the the homeless people that you were hanging out with

346
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:07,760
just like BFFs with in the back of that school bus. Right can I see who's in the driver's seat

347
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:14,640
of the truck and the Impala? Go ahead and roll uh search. Uh fail. Okay well I already told you

348
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:21,040
you can't see who's driving the truck but you do know that the Impala is the little vehicle and

349
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:27,760
yeah you know you can kind of tell that it's their outlines. Shit I don't know what to do um. Okay

350
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:34,000
Thomas what are you John Lee Pettymore doing? John Lee Pettymore is just like slamming his hand

351
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:40,560
on the side of the truck yelling at Clark to load up and hop in. Very cool uh you guys actually if

352
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:46,560
you're looking around you can see the driver of the truck like climbs out of the window

353
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:54,000
and jumps up into the hot tub in the back. As the driver of the truck is climbing out the window

354
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:00,880
of the cab trying to climb back onto the trailer and get into the hot tub you see he jumps for the

355
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:07,760
hot tub and right before he lands in the water his body is lifted above the hot tub. I need everyone

356
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:18,240
to roll sanity. Oh no. I fail. I fail over my power I think. Let me check. I crit fail but

357
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:28,400
under my power. Motherfucker. Yeah I failed 61 on a 60. I'm at a 55 on a 13. My power is 60.

358
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:35,680
Yeah I rolled over my power 80 on a 13. You can't see the ooze right now? Previous to losing the

359
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:42,560
sanity you only saw the body moving and you don't know where the ooze is? Lose one sanity.

360
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:49,920
You see this guy as he's jumping you see him catch and nothing seems to catch him but he's just like

361
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:57,200
hanging in mid-air and then you see it. You see the ooze that's holding him up in the air and it

362
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:08,320
is a wave and it is the most it is the thickest it is the largest amount the quantity the volume

363
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:14,480
is clearly growing this is the most you've seen in one area and it is holding this guy up in the air

364
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:22,880
as the same mass is slamming the person who is sitting shotgun into the ground as they are folding

365
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:30,800
into this oily substance and the person who is hanging above the hot tub they reach out and

366
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:37,920
they're trying to grab onto the the man who is inside the hot tub and they're they're pulling

367
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:43,760
and they're pulling and they're pulling and then you see the ooze just consumes the person who is

368
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:49,680
hanging in the air and grabs onto the person who is in the hot tub as well lifts them up out of

369
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:55,840
the water and the two who are holding on to each other are then being thwacked thwack thwack kind

370
00:39:55,840 --> 00:40:04,400
of like uh what the hulk did to loki yeah that classic gif from the marvel talkies spreading

371
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:14,720
everywhere and with that the impala begins backing up clark bishop what are you doing i am now

372
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:19,360
joining drew and jimmy sanders in the back of the truck done keith vigna what are you doing

373
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:25,840
i'm trying i see that and i try to crawl out the window that's in the back like between the

374
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:32,640
cab and the bed of the truck and i get like my top half of my body out but my big pants get caught

375
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:39,440
so i'm like halfway in and halfway out and i'm grabbing jimmy and trying to hold him underwater

376
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:44,160
while i'm yelling like why are you doing this why are you doing this if he's holding jimmy

377
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:49,520
under the water and i'm back there can like part of my turn be to try and help jimmy not die under

378
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:53,600
the water like i'm trying to get keith off of him but maybe also help keith through the window or

379
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:59,440
something i don't know maybe next turn uh john lee pettymore what are you doing john is is freaking

380
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:05,040
out it's like he's woken up from a bad dream and he sees all of this uh playing out in front of them

381
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:11,680
he sees the wave coming towards them and even though being in this body makes his brain want

382
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:19,200
to vomit he still he recognizes that he's behind the wheel of a vehicle and that like shit is

383
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:27,760
coming and he just like the one thing that he can get through from his brain to his body is is brush

384
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:35,680
yeah he just fucking pedal on the floor peels straight away from the wave in the rear view

385
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:43,440
mirror you just hear bloodcurdling screams and the smell of like that nasty fishy smell just

386
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:49,600
barely kind of tinged behind you as you see the camera is just reversing reversing reversing

387
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:58,640
and then all of a sudden you cut through tree line and you are face to face with this crane that has

388
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:04,720
all these tubes on the end of its payload there and it's ready to lift them up off the ground

389
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:10,000
and there's actually no one there

390
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:17,840
and looking around you see no one maybe they got good if i look behind us do i see is the goo

391
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:23,440
a still there or be giving chase have we driven so far that we're it's it would it would normally

392
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:27,600
be out of sight at this point i don't know what do i see when i look behind me you see the goo

393
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:33,920
is just like racing it's like almost like hands that are inside of it are dragging it across and

394
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:39,040
along the back there's a wave that's coming along the back end and crashing down that's causing more

395
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:43,520
hands that seem to be crawling toward you and then another wave comes around the back and crashes

396
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:48,880
forward and it's just moving slowly but way quicker than you've ever seen it move before

397
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:57,040
so we're rocking seven miles an hour right now but it is steadily just if it had a noise it would be

398
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:05,120
i like the idea of hand waves uh coming out of goo that's really gross and fucked up so cool

399
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:12,080
thanks time man i'm still halfway out the window trying to drown jimmy oh yeah that's fun clark

400
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:19,760
what are you doing to try to help jimmy sanders survive uh i just want to try and wrench keith's

401
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:25,200
hands off of him and that's my only goal is to make sure that if jimmy wants to come up he can

402
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:32,560
yeah and i'm fighting back against it roll them roll them dice against each other the highest one

403
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:37,840
did not go over wins would i do strength or unarmed combat you can do either one

404
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:47,760
i got a 54 out of 65 on strength i did a 61 on a 70 for unarmed combat nice voice good

405
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:58,480
uh yeah i pry your hands off of him number four oil if i have any any momentum left in my turn i'm

406
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:02,400
maybe trying to calm keith down get a hold of yourself get a hold of yourself if you want to

407
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:06,480
come back in here come back in here but get a hold he's he's trying to he's trying to kill us with

408
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:11,040
the with the goo it's he's not doing anything keith look at him he's he's scared him he is

409
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:15,600
scared too he's he almost got drowned just now and i i look at jimmy and look at clark and then

410
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:22,240
you know stare at the goo coming towards us and i like oh my oh fuck we got we got to get out of

411
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:29,680
here and you feel two dog paws on your butt cheeks just boop and you right head first into the water

412
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:39,840
in the back so after i push him through um i i say uh keith we've all wanted to strangle jimmy god

413
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:46,000
damn it but now's not the time now look down there ain't that a beansco crane think you could

414
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:52,080
operator well i used to have a toy one of these when i was a kid so yeah you're you're our only

415
00:44:52,080 --> 00:45:00,800
hope hey luke what is keith vigna's heavy machinery skill oh my heavy machinery is ten percent

416
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:04,640
tight

417
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:13,200
how far away from the crane are we coming up fast but john lee pettymore the successful drive check

418
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:20,000
could easily maneuver around out of the way of these tubes and continue on the path oh well

419
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:26,800
why don't i just try driving through first i guess but you got me pretty excited to use that crane

420
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:30,320
i know maybe later if we have time let me just see if i can't

421
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:33,520
move on okay let's give it a shot we gotta act quick

422
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,560
yes did you do it yes

423
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:50,720
as you whip and you try to pull the e-brake and be really fucking cool you're in a truck

424
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:55,200
you've never driven before and you catch an edge on one of the tires because it's too

425
00:45:55,200 --> 00:46:01,680
bald and old and you hit a rock or some shit and you flip this mother and as soon as the truck

426
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:07,840
flips everyone in the back just flies out and i need everyone to roll constitution in order to

427
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:14,160
avoid taking damage for this car crash including pass john lee pettymore so i have that i have a

428
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:18,800
thing that makes it so that i basically can't lose a con but i went ahead and rolled and i got a 69

429
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:26,640
so i technically could succeed i got a 33 no you oh my god i cannot wait to describe this

430
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,800
hell yeah man success

431
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:40,080
fuck yeah freeze frame the truck is perpendicular to the ground the driver's side only about six

432
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:46,640
inches from the crunchy december grass and the water and fish filled truck bed is erupting

433
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:56,240
sideways yeeting keith out at the speed of john's insane out of body recklessness heavy on the wreck

434
00:46:56,240 --> 00:47:02,960
but with a success keith lands right on top of jimmy sanders who gets squished into the now

435
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:10,000
wet and fish covered ground john's critical allows him to grab a hold of tyler and tuck and roll

436
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:17,040
smoothly out of the driver's side window and as the truck rolls we see john and tyler huddled

437
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:26,000
together somehow unscathed by this chaos field machine but most importantly with a 69 clark

438
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:33,760
leaps out of the truck bed allowing it to roll underneath him as clark's legs begin churning at

439
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:41,120
the speed of the crash he lands mid sprint and continues to chase the tumbling truck as it rolls

440
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:50,080
wildly into the exit for contention's intersection directly toward there's a big sign what would the

441
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:55,760
sign be for there's a big sign that says owls tires and tigers i'm gonna suggest

442
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:03,280
and it's got a big arrow pointing to the right to the north and it says like one mile

443
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:10,960
on your left keith vigna john lee pettymore jimmy sanders are all just like on the ground

444
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:19,360
andrew carrey oh andrew carrey oh shit uh i'm gonna roll for drew carrey yeah roll for drew carrey

445
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:28,880
i can't read it 77 77 ooh what does that mean

446
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:36,160
okay we're good drew carrey takes a fair amount of damage but not enough

447
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:44,640
it's uh five hit points of damage as drew carrey oh let's see constitution check to stay conscious

448
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:55,680
passes fails shit so drew carrey unconscious on the ground laying in a just a wet puddle with uh

449
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:02,400
with fish just flapping around on the ground and keith vigna and jimmy sanders are also in this

450
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:09,680
wet mess john lee pettymore and tyler are huddled with each other on the ground having just rolled

451
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:16,800
out of this insanely dangerous situation and clark bishop is standing just watching this truck

452
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:25,360
just erupt into flames in this intersection as it destroys a sign for owls tires and tigers

453
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:31,200
i guess we don't really need to move the crane now i need an alertness check from everyone

454
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:42,640
fail eight pass i pass a 15 on a 70 zach just rubbed his head for good luck

455
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:45,360
yeah put the fucking hat back on american history x

456
00:49:56,320 --> 00:50:02,720
oh zackie poo that hurt so you uh

457
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:10,080
you should have left more or taken more i don't know

458
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:18,320
you gotta go full lex luther or your dad both of whom are hot bald dudes just to the right of the

459
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:24,320
sign that is just exploded up into truck flames because that's what happens when

460
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:29,280
vehicles roll they all explode every time right not a chance that they wouldn't for sure to the

461
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:37,200
right of that you see that there is a storm drain that leads down into the sewers and there are arms

462
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:43,600
that are crawling out of the storm drain and you see a very brightly colored shirt and a man pokes

463
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:54,880
his head up out oh my god gary gary y'all need to come with me right now

464
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:20,880
oh

465
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:54,880
oh
