1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,520
What's good, my little buttercups?

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,280
It's your cow grease producer wolf, the dog.

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,320
And I'm here to deliver all the full fat milk

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,760
to all my hungry little babies

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:18,480
who can then shake that cream around until it turns solid.

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,600
That's how the butter is made.

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:25,600
Or so I'm told, I am coagulating live from 694.2 PTBP,

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,640
the only radio station that artisanally crafts

9
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,880
its own butter for its host to eat.

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,080
Speaking of cream, grease, and being told stuff,

11
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,840
we got ourselves a new Howlin' with Wolf.

12
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,280
This Howlin' with Wolf was sent in by Wes from PA,

13
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,640
who tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending pod,

14
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,760
which is the quickest way to make a notification appear

15
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,840
in the notifications tab,

16
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,600
of the app pretending pod Twitter account.

17
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,320
They write, I just want to thank the beautiful bastards

18
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,760
who make one of the best podcasts out there.

19
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,320
You guys are killing it, may all your balls be smooth.

20
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,320
Well damn, thank you Wes from PA.

21
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,280
I do however, not appreciate how you seem to prefer

22
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,560
smoothness over the feel of beautiful bristles.

23
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,600
What's wrong with petting something that got the feel

24
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:26,520
of a wire-haired brush dipped in a vat of Vaseline?

25
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,600
Remember, if you want to write up something

26
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,280
for your milk-producing wolf to howl,

27
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,920
tag that pretending pod on the internet.

28
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,240
Come on, you know you want to make me say some silly shit,

29
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,520
like bum-fuzzle, accubation, clique,

30
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,160
and click right down there on those show notes

31
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,800
to find links to all of my videos.

32
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,920
You know you want to make me say some silly shit,

33
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,480
like bum-fuzzle, accubation, clique,

34
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,920
and click right down there on those show notes

35
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,480
to find links to all our ramshackle internet gobbledygook.

36
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,560
Goggle with hogwash and swallow lickety-split,

37
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,680
it's time for the news.

38
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,680
Ahem, I, Wolf the dog, do hereby relinquish my duty

39
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,680
to read the news for this episode,

40
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,920
and that this will be done by an old friend,

41
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,560
Mick and or Nick Nichols.

42
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,680
We met in college where we all studied

43
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,800
talking at people real good.

44
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,360
I got my damn MFA even,

45
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,920
so technically I could be Professor Wolfie,

46
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,480
but y'all know that my heart belongs with the people,

47
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:40,080
specifically the people whose minds are easily penetrated

48
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,880
by my all-powerful aura.

49
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:47,640
For one, cannot simply take over the world by just teaching.

50
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,800
You must be able to control them

51
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,760
with the most modern communication vessel of the century,

52
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:59,760
the most cutting-edge technology, FM radio babies.

53
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,760
Also, the community college I applied to

54
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,600
never got back to me about the job.

55
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,640
Now, slop yourself up enough rubber-boo

56
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,960
to feel the collywobbles and fight the whamble.

57
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:18,960
It's Dragon in 3 with What Kind of World Are You Livin' In?

58
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,320
["Bad Girls"]

59
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,760
Bad girls on top of the water

60
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:32,960
Mary and Caroline, I'm on the borderline

61
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:37,040
Leaving my mind at your altar

62
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,680
Crossing the double line, doing it every time

63
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:45,680
Tell me what kind of world are you living in?

64
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:54,480
What kind of world are you living in?

65
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,320
Whoa, hello, hello, everybody,

66
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:04,320
and welcome back to the Scrap-O.

67
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,800
Nick Nichols, is this not the,

68
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,160
I'm Nick Nichols and this is Nick Nichols.

69
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,800
Yeah, hey there, brother.

70
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,160
Oh, Nick Nichols, I love that everything I do

71
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,720
just makes you giggle like that.

72
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,080
When your cheeks get rosy, my heart gets fozy,

73
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:21,520
and that's a word that I mispronounce, like fuzzy is fozy,

74
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,640
and you love it, I love it, we're all here.

75
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,880
We're all here for Nick Nichols, what do you think about that?

76
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:31,320
Well, I just love you, my elder brother.

77
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,080
And I love you too, my elder brother.

78
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,760
We were both born right before the other one.

79
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,480
I think it's Eldritch brother.

80
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,240
What have you been up to since two seconds ago, Nick?

81
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,160
Well, I've just been watching this cool,

82
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,640
is it a fight, is it a battle, is it a war,

83
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,680
is it, what is it exactly that we're watching here?

84
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,840
I'm not too sure, but it is darn entertaining.

85
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,400
And it's darn entertaining for sure,

86
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,280
and I do think that part of it

87
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,120
might determine the outcome of our futures,

88
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,960
whether it be us in our lives

89
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,880
or the future of humanity, all right, all right, all right.

90
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,480
At least in this reality.

91
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,160
What happens in this reality?

92
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,480
What?

93
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,320
Go on.

94
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,200
Are you saying that there might be different realities, Nick?

95
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,600
I'm just saying we were hugged

96
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,480
by that big old robot friend of ours.

97
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,720
Can you say that again for the folks at home?

98
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,280
Wow, what a way to say a thing.

99
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,800
Well, let's get back to the moment at hand.

100
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,760
You were saying that there might be extra dimensions

101
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:49,880
or other planes of existence, different realities.

102
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,840
Is that true?

103
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,600
That's just a little theory of mind

104
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,880
that I've been cooking up.

105
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:58,880
And I like to dabble in metaphysical theories in my off.

106
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,240
Oh, did we lose Luke?

107
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,200
Ignore him.

108
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,320
Okay. I'm still here.

109
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,160
I don't know what happened to my camera.

110
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,000
I got scared.

111
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,040
He switched positions to it frightened me.

112
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,080
I'm back.

113
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,720
And he's back. Hey, we're back.

114
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,400
What is metaphysical?

115
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,440
Have you heard of the physical realm that we all live in?

116
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,120
Not even a little bit.

117
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,000
So there's another one called the metaphysical realm

118
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,160
and it's different.

119
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,240
All right, and so we're gonna give you

120
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,560
a quick recap of last time here.

121
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,880
Last time, that big fucker on the left,

122
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,920
this thing that I've heard a few people on the ground

123
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,400
call the giant dumber up in the case

124
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,600
it reached up and touched the sky,

125
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,480
turned the sky up into an ocean.

126
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,000
Ocean with black starts swirling all around

127
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
like a dark lake or a lake or something up there

128
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,240
that you might look into.

129
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,240
And then, blah, and then juggernauts shot and rose M-A-R-Y

130
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:52,080
and cut that thing in half with its laser eyes.

131
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,000
Oh, God, a bunch of other stuff happened.

132
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,520
Don was in the room up there that we can't see,

133
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,840
but we know what's going on.

134
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,680
Yeah, we know, we know.

135
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,520
Isn't that right, The Giggles?

136
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,520
Yeah, we know what's going on.

137
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,520
He's watching Keith talk through the phone.

138
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:08,040
And then these creatures, these tall skeletal creatures

139
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,240
that kind of look like Bobby Glass showed up.

140
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,760
I've heard someone here is calling them Myriad.

141
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,000
Well, what a name and what a season.

142
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,760
There's more than one of them, but there wasn't now.

143
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,600
Now we're down to one, and its hand is all shrunk down weird

144
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,440
because this old version of the Clark Bishop

145
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,280
sees through it.

146
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,400
A bunch of them popped like some sort of zits.

147
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,240
Oh, God.

148
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,280
Yummy.

149
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,400
That's right, The Giggles, like some sort of zit.

150
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,480
Oh, God, I definitely threw up just a little bit.

151
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,680
Just enough, and then Clark Bishop

152
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,120
blasted a wide bar of them down the road,

153
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,440
down to one, and out, and out, and out, and out,

154
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:52,160
and Dawn came running outside, Dawn D. Pennymore.

155
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,360
We got John Ball, Ball version of John D. Pennymore,

156
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,000
lunged at M-A-R-Y, and her top half

157
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,040
is the body of the Rosemary, cut in half,

158
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,880
starts shuffling all back.

159
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,680
John Ball plunged up into the gut,

160
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,680
and then Keith Ligna with his frozen peashooter

161
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,680
comes down and freezes her bottom half

162
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,160
and then smashes off the bottom half.

163
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,560
It's going, it's going, man.

164
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,640
Oh, keep on, keep on, go, go, go, go.

165
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,040
The bottom half shattered into multiple pieces.

166
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,800
Clark Bishop tried to pull out his gun,

167
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,120
accidentally blew his own head off,

168
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,240
and then Blana Juggernaut comes down, boom,

169
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,040
lands all next to Keith's jaw to wheel Pennymore,

170
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:36,640
fired his gun in the air, hit one of these new sea creatures

171
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,360
that was pretty much in the air.

172
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,280
And then John Ball comes down and blows his own head off,

173
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,200
and then Blana Juggernaut comes down, boom,

174
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,800
lands all next to Keith's jaw,

175
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,760
and then these new sea creatures

176
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,360
that was pouring out of the sky,

177
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,080
the sky that is slowly rising

178
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,440
from its own plane of gravity,

179
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,720
which means that it's lowering slowly towards us.

180
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,800
Yeah, a reality that is truly terrifying.

181
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,480
That's almost like we're gonna be squished here

182
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:05,200
in a few rounds by this water

183
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,880
with these crazy little worm guys coming out the top.

184
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,520
They're squamish, they're squabish, they're segmented,

185
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,140
and they are purple, brown, and black.

186
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,340
It is getting goopy up in here.

187
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:21,620
I like that there's panic rising in his voice.

188
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:27,300
He's like, I haven't thought about the words I'm saying.

189
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,140
Something that really scared me personally, Nick,

190
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:33,340
is that when John leave Will Fortune more,

191
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:36,780
shot his gun into the sky and hit one of those worm things,

192
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:39,820
that worm did not react at all.

193
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:43,540
Yeah, it's quite, it seems like they might be immune

194
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:46,340
to physical bullets and such.

195
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,500
Well, that'd be something to keep in mind moving forward.

196
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,940
And we got M-A-R-Y.

197
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,300
This thing plugged in one of its metal sigils

198
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,500
into the ground, seemingly starting to form

199
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,100
some sort of portal.

200
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,980
Over there in the pitch-blark room,

201
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,020
being pitch-blark-roofed,

202
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,860
Keith thinks to ask Muriad on a phone

203
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,820
to get rid of the big thing out there

204
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:09,680
and bring two McFlurries, one Oreo, one M&M.

205
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,460
That is about Wayne Clark.

206
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,800
This is the older version of Clark,

207
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,040
the overseer told him,

208
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:20,520
shriveled the last Muriad hand back to its elbow

209
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,920
and tailored its suit so we can all see the results there.

210
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,700
And then Clark Bishop seems to have some sort

211
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,400
of conversation happening with this last little

212
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,100
long-gone translucent beast,

213
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,840
and they seem to agree on something.

214
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,600
It appears to me that Clark is a fan favorite,

215
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,840
and there's so many of them.

216
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:41,840
You have your own to choose, one without a head,

217
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,240
the old creepy one, and that one,

218
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,320
the good one, I think.

219
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,440
Is any of the Clarks good?

220
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,280
Who can say?

221
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,440
Who can say?

222
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,600
But we do know that Keith Vigna is good,

223
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,480
for he has used his jumping boots to leap up

224
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,440
into the alternate gravity of the world above.

225
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,600
He is shooting his frozen gun right up

226
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,280
into one of these worm's mouths.

227
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,880
The mouth, I have turned green now,

228
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:14,120
you see him with the mouth inside of mine.

229
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,320
The mouth is completely frozen,

230
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,520
and Keith Vigna dived in, feet first,

231
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:24,360
like Joda or Elsa, both of them into this worm,

232
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,240
and he has got one from view.

233
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,120
What is happening?

234
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,160
Are you still there?

235
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,560
Uh-oh, Zach, are you still there?

236
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,840
I don't think he is.

237
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,880
Oh no.

238
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,960
Are you happy that I'm still here?

239
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,240
There you go, you're back.

240
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,560
Oh yeah, you're back.

241
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,960
I've turned green.

242
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:50,840
And with a yee-haw, Keith Vigna disappeared

243
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,160
into that worm up there.

244
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:56,320
John Ball went and tried to merge with him,

245
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,240
A-R-Y, was repelled like a magnet,

246
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,880
and then Wheel of Fort John here,

247
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,800
we're finally at the end of things, Nick Nickles,

248
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,560
so calm down, you are like, calm down, hey,

249
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,640
sit over there, calm down.

250
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,000
Do not tell me to calm down,

251
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:11,280
and I am simply pissing my pants in excitement.

252
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:14,280
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

253
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:18,760
Wow, and Uncle Don comes running up to Wheel of Fort John,

254
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,400
they're yelling, they're pointing guns,

255
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,240
they're waving around, they're discussing

256
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,240
the reality in nature, much like we are now, reality.

257
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,320
It's just another day in the Pettymore Clan,

258
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,720
as far as we know.

259
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,280
As far as we know, and then John's little tendrils there

260
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,560
at the back of his neck, poked out and seemingly

261
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,800
patted Don on the shoulder to reassure him.

262
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,960
And that's where we'll begin this episode.

263
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,960
Welcome to Pretending to Be People.

264
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,240
I wasn't listening, if you'll just do-

265
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,440
Yeah, could you do that again?

266
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,560
Yeah, please do it again.

267
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,360
I think that'll be handy for all the listeners

268
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,920
who didn't hear Wolf's recap,

269
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,480
and then also didn't pay attention

270
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,840
to what you just said, like us.

271
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,880
Hello, everybody, my name is Frank Nickles,

272
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,600
and with me today is Nick Nickles.

273
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,600
Let's give a quick recap of what happened last time.

274
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:10,960
Are you ready?

275
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,600
Should we do it again?

276
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,400
Yeah, more recaps is what this podcast needs.

277
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,280
I know it's just fan service,

278
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,520
but, you know, give the people what they want.

279
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,080
Now hear me out.

280
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:33,920
Oh, this huge lumbering beast that is just towering

281
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:42,200
story upon story upon story above you all.

282
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:46,320
It's limbs forming and reforming, shaping and reshaping

283
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,280
in a way to where you can't exactly tell it's the,

284
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:52,000
oh no, it's there, it's not there.

285
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,520
It is both in this world of this world and nowhere at all.

286
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,400
And it is dripping with this dark ooze,

287
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:03,200
is it boom, boom, boom,

288
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,600
lumbers across the ground,

289
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,120
always just shrieking out with this.

290
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,600
Every time you make a sound like that,

291
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,880
it just completely cuts out on this chord

292
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,880
from the noise gate filters.

293
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,480
We get the perfect faces for it.

294
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:27,080
Yeah, there's amazing faces and no sound

295
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:30,440
except for occasional like, and then, yeah.

296
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,720
And then when the episode comes out,

297
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,240
we get to hear what you wanted us to hear.

298
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,720
My neighbors must be so confused.

299
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,240
Neighbors are like, oh Lord.

300
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,080
It's not even eight in the morning.

301
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:42,920
Oh God.

302
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:49,480
The faces are very like vinegar stroke faces.

303
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,120
Jesus.

304
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,320
What's that Luke, for the children listening.

305
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,920
And the Gigantumber pithicus, unbeknownst to you,

306
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,720
is about to come.

307
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,760
I want you guys to really visualize this moment

308
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,040
because the Gigantumber pithicus, last you saw,

309
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,920
had just reached up into the sky,

310
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,840
turned the entirety of the sky into a swirling ocean

311
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,640
with waves coming across it.

312
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:28,680
And then these like massive worms

313
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,000
started poking their heads out of it.

314
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,120
Next round, this ocean started rising

315
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,360
from its point of view,

316
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:42,360
which means that it is lowering slowly down onto you.

317
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,160
The Gigantumber pithicus is so tall

318
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:49,040
that this ocean is now rising almost to its head.

319
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:54,040
So it bends over and it puts its enormous knot hands

320
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,800
kind of on its joints, down by its legs

321
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:04,120
that are now the size of skyscrapers themselves.

322
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:08,240
I mean, we're talking tens of stories tall at this point.

323
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,640
It bends over and it erupts.

324
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,480
Something from deep within it

325
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,920
begins making this horrible noise.

326
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,800
And it's almost as if you hear the souls

327
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:26,520
of every single person that it has ever engulfed

328
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:30,600
cry out as its mouth opens

329
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:35,600
and you see a bevy of skeletons

330
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,920
begin to fall out of its mouth.

331
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:43,920
They are all dripping with this same black residue,

332
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,520
this puke, this resipuke

333
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:51,000
that is just covering each of these skeletons.

334
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,280
And they're all being held by their backs

335
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:58,200
as they're free falling by like a bungee rope,

336
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:01,120
like a marionette doll, like they're marionette dolls,

337
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,560
but what the strings holding them

338
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:08,560
are the same strings of like thick, mucusy residue.

339
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:12,160
And these things are crying out in pain,

340
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,760
but also they're grabby.

341
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,080
They're real grabby with their hands

342
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,760
and their arms and their legs.

343
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,480
And they are falling down toward this battlefield.

344
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,440
Are there like tens of these or thousands of these?

345
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,640
Let's go ahead and roll.

346
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,400
Let's go ahead and roll and see how many there are.

347
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,960
Let's roll like 2D4.

348
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,120
Yeah, yeah, do that.

349
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:36,960
There's 12.

350
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,960
Oh, okay, so this is like a commando team

351
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:43,320
of skeleton souls, not a horde.

352
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,920
That is correct, that is correct.

353
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:49,920
It is a highly trained para skeletal team.

354
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,440
I'm imagining, you know, like the angler fish

355
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,480
or whatever that has like the little light on its head.

356
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,400
Is it kind of like that, but with skeletons?

357
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,240
Yeah, okay.

358
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,200
Well, no, I don't know what that meant.

359
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,040
I don't think so.

360
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:03,880
It's not like that.

361
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,880
But I was just saying, yeah, that's a fish.

362
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,600
It's more like these skeletons make a giant frog's tongue

363
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,280
that's coming out and getting ready to come out

364
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,360
and like grab a fly.

365
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,000
Yeah, there's 12 frogs tongues.

366
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,680
Gotcha, okay, that makes more sense.

367
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,640
And on the tip of each tongue is a fun little skeleton

368
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,840
doing a little dance as it comes toward you.

369
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,880
Yeah.

370
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,320
He's coming to give us a hug.

371
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,640
I wanna hug the skeleton.

372
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,800
Next is Rose M-A-R-Y,

373
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:32,000
which is currently half embodying.

374
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,000
It's got one tendril plugged up inside the head of Rosemary

375
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:41,040
and it's been using her mouth like a weird puppet

376
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,640
as it's been dragging her body backwards

377
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,720
to avoid more hits.

378
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,040
It's got one of its other metal tendrils

379
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:51,520
plugged into the luminous land below

380
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,440
and to the left of you all

381
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:58,440
and is forming a sort of swirl of technicolor light

382
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,440
that is emitting now from the ground.

383
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,400
You've seen this before and you know that she is creating

384
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,640
or it is creating a portal.

385
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,640
M-A-R-Y is going to roll a dodge

386
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:15,440
because she is going to try to keep this portal going

387
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,520
for this entire round.

388
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,320
And so she's gonna roll a dodge at a negative 20

389
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,040
to contest any rolls against her

390
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:26,920
to try to stop this attempt at a portal opening.

391
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:31,480
And she has succeeded with a roll that I will keep to myself.

392
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,080
She had a negative 20.

393
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,680
Yeah, she was at a negative 20 and she still passed

394
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:40,280
which makes you think, oh, maybe this is kind of low.

395
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,880
Maybe this is beatable, yeah.

396
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,000
Maybe it's beatable.

397
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:43,840
Beatable.

398
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,040
If you say it three times, you'll beat it.

399
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,480
Beatable.

400
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,720
Like Beetlejuice, nice.

401
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,560
I've never seen that.

402
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,080
Carry on, it is Keith Vigna's turn.

403
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:56,200
Can you describe exactly where Keith is right now?

404
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,240
What happened last time?

405
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,480
No, so I'm inside the worm right now, right?

406
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,680
Holy shit, yes.

407
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,080
Let's die for you.

408
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,600
No, no, no, sorry, this Keith Vigna.

409
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,160
Sorry, it's Keith Beams' turn.

410
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:12,320
Okay, right, I just got off the phone and I laid back down.

411
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,840
Is Don in the room with me still or did he leave?

412
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,720
You're not sure, it's pitch black in there.

413
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,120
You called out to him last time

414
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,160
and asked what kind of McFlurry he wanted.

415
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:24,040
He did not respond and so you assumed him in it.

416
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,800
Okay, yeah, so as Keith is, he's laying down on the ground

417
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:30,520
just really having a great time, super relaxed.

418
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,200
He's laying down there for a while

419
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,840
and then he remembers.

420
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,760
He's like, oh yeah, I just asked for a McFlurry.

421
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,920
I guess I better go out and meet him.

422
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:43,060
And so I try to find my way out of this room.

423
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,320
All right, so I've got a mini game here.

424
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,720
It's gonna take about three episodes to play

425
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,600
of you getting out of this room.

426
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,560
So Justin, you're gonna be Keith Beams' left leg.

427
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:00,120
Joe, you're gonna be Keith Beams' left hand.

428
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,520
Thomas, you're gonna be the left foot.

429
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:06,500
And then Luke, you're gonna be Keith Beams' nose.

430
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:11,500
So if you could each roll a D7 and then add negative I.

431
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,560
D7, right, got it.

432
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,080
Yeah, I'm at six I.

433
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:15,900
Oh, perfect.

434
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,800
So you kind of feel your way with your,

435
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,840
well, you bump into the side of the room with your nose

436
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,920
but only half of your nose gets bumped

437
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,480
and you're like, oh, perfect, I'm right at the doorway.

438
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,920
And you reach out with Thomas and Justin's left hand

439
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,440
and feel around the corner

440
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,360
and you kind of feel the stairwell of this enormous room.

441
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,680
The enormous room, you feel the stairwell leading down

442
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,680
from this towering building.

443
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:43,260
Is there still no light or is there light in the hallway?

444
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,920
There's slight light coming down

445
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,160
from the bottom of the stairwell

446
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,800
and so you make your way down the stairs

447
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:51,680
and out of this towering dark building and you see.

448
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,220
Okay, so if he's making his way out,

449
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:56,480
then we'll start with me, left foot.

450
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,240
That's right, yes, go ahead and roll.

451
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,860
Let's see how that first step goes.

452
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:03,980
Now I rolled a D, I've got my foot character sheet here

453
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,260
and anyway.

454
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:07,860
Please tell me you rolled well.

455
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,980
I've got a 14, I have to roll higher than a 14 on a D20,

456
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,380
I rolled a six, all right.

457
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:13,820
Thanks for like trying to play

458
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:15,580
in the dumbest thing I've ever said.

459
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:18,820
It means a lot.

460
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:21,060
This is, you think the dumbest thing you've ever said?

461
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:29,180
All right, since Keith's left foot failed the foot roll,

462
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:31,060
I stumble down the stairs,

463
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:33,740
just head over, rolling down the stairs.

464
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:34,580
Head over what?

465
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:36,820
Rolling, rolling.

466
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:39,220
Probably butt, because that's fun.

467
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:43,460
Nice, Keith Beans rolls head over butt down the stairs

468
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:45,500
and you land at the bottom of this.

469
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,500
Ouchie, ouchie.

470
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:51,460
The last two stairs slapped you

471
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:56,620
and you land ace first

472
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,820
down at the bottom of these stairs

473
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:01,620
of the base of this towering tower,

474
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:04,980
this dark building that was first shown

475
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:08,300
in a Polaroid picture from Julie Maxwell's car

476
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:10,900
way back in episode one.

477
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:15,180
And so you look out onto this battlefield ahead of you

478
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:18,900
and you see just pure fucking nonsense.

479
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:23,220
And right about then, Keith has a flashback.

480
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:28,220
You remember you're on the Beans' estate.

481
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,180
The alarms start blaring

482
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:35,740
and these creatures begin falling from the sky

483
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:38,540
and hitting the ground with a thud,

484
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,820
but they don't seem to be affected

485
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:43,900
by falling from however far they fell.

486
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:48,900
They're tall, gaunt, translucent, wearing black suits

487
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:52,180
and looking out onto this battlefield,

488
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,940
darkness surrounding you,

489
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:57,180
light completely illuminating the land.

490
00:23:57,180 --> 00:24:01,060
These same creatures are falling from the sky.

491
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:06,060
That memory reminds Keith of Fergie

492
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:11,740
and Keith just kind of breaks down a little bit

493
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:16,180
and he just starts crying, but it's like an angry cry.

494
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:19,300
Wow, he seems to really be having a moment there, Nick.

495
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,060
What do you think about that?

496
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:23,580
It's a great emotional time for all of us here,

497
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:26,020
but we're powering through, buddy, am I right?

498
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,540
I don't deserve to live.

499
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,860
Now they're both just standing

500
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:32,220
on either side of Keith Vigna.

501
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,380
Just holding microphones down on his face.

502
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:38,900
Look at Nick and Mick Nichols

503
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,660
with both of their microphones held at my face

504
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:44,720
and I'm crying.

505
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,740
I've just yelled, I don't deserve to live.

506
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,500
I've been thinking about all the atrocities

507
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:51,340
that I've committed throughout my lifetimes

508
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:56,660
and I just start running at one of the men in black.

509
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,380
It's the overseer's turn.

510
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:04,580
Clark, Joe, you are become the overseer

511
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:11,140
in that last round, wherein you literally beamed out

512
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:16,580
this same light from your face that you saw him do first

513
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:20,860
and in that moment, something in your consciousness flickered

514
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:24,860
and there's something strange about it.

515
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:28,500
It's like Clark Bishop is still controlling Clark Bishop

516
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:31,300
and the overseer is still the overseer,

517
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:36,300
but you, Joe Terry, author of your own story,

518
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:38,700
have now taken control.

519
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,680
Through becoming the overseer,

520
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,700
you have become the overseer.

521
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,020
Yeah.

522
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,100
Yeah, okay.

523
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:54,260
You are floating about 10 feet above

524
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:57,460
the luminous land liturgy that is weaving in and out

525
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:59,900
of itself in a circle, chanting,

526
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:02,060
Shaak Ti Felicha.

527
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,560
This is a little bit of a Nick Pex hack,

528
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,820
but I don't think you're using liturgy correctly.

529
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:07,380
I never have.

530
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:09,780
As long as you know.

531
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:14,520
I did it for the alliteration.

532
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:20,440
It's just like, let's give this fucker a quick look up

533
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,280
because I don't know what it means.

534
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,680
Oh, what a liturgy is?

535
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,240
It's just like the service.

536
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:29,680
It's the body and texts and songs of the service,

537
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,520
I'm pretty sure.

538
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:33,040
Yeah, a form or formulary according to which

539
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:36,920
public religious worship, especially Christian worship,

540
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,040
is conducted.

541
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,960
It's the ritual, the service, the ceremony.

542
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,200
Yeah, I'm good with that.

543
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,360
So this luminous land liturgy is just like weaving,

544
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:50,140
bobbing and weaving in and around in a circle around you.

545
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:53,040
And it's just liturgying all over your liturgy.

546
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,860
And you feel the liturgy within your liturgy.

547
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,600
You're liturgid.

548
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:04,880
And you feel this immense power that is being given to you,

549
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,980
granted to you by this song, by this chant.

550
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:11,200
And it is flowing within you and giving you what you think

551
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,440
is an unnatural score of at least 85.

552
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,960
No, sorry, 86.

553
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,800
Now I'm going to put down 85.

554
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,280
That's what I said and that's what I meant.

555
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,920
That's what you said and I said sick after it

556
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,820
so it's official now.

557
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:27,720
Yes, it's like in a meeting we don't second things.

558
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:31,360
We just say sick and then it's not only seconded,

559
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,120
not only voted on, it's finished.

560
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,360
Okay, I have a sick, do I have a righteous?

561
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,960
I have a righteous, the motion carries.

562
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,760
It's like when Jesus was dying on the cross

563
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,960
and at the very end he was just like, sick.

564
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,120
And then he got to die.

565
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,460
Best thing he ever did.

566
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:51,960
Terrible timing but I have to poop

567
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,200
and I'll make it very, very quick.

568
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,400
But I am going to shit my pants.

569
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,840
It was just starting to feel liturgical.

570
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,600
Oh man, oh God, he's doing it.

571
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:07,560
Oh, he's pooping right, oh Thomas.

572
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,800
Stop staring right into the camera.

573
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:13,360
You're gonna regret this man, you're gonna regret this.

574
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,760
Oh no, he's showing it to us now.

575
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,640
No, I don't wanna see it.

576
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:20,280
That's what his asshole looks like, huh?

577
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:23,280
He is in the living room showing me his butt right now.

578
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,200
Why is he pooping into a mesh strainer?

579
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,800
What the fuck is wrong with him?

580
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:35,160
Oh, he's wiping it on his face and on the walls now, what?

581
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:38,800
He's holding up a sign that says Luke made me do this?

582
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,760
I didn't make him do it, stop.

583
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,840
Guy's holding up a newspaper but it's from 10 years ago.

584
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,020
What is he telling us?

585
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:55,600
Wait, what is he writing with his own feces on the wall?

586
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,760
Oh, Sirhan Sirhan should get probation?

587
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,580
That's weird.

588
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:04,860
All right, so now that Thomas has silently cleaned up

589
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:07,120
all of his mess that he made on the floor.

590
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,400
Yeah, that was disgusting.

591
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,360
I don't understand what just happened.

592
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,840
Thomas, what was the point of the newspaper?

593
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,320
I thought that was pretty self-explanatory

594
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,920
but if you don't get it, I mean,

595
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:21,240
not everybody's, I guess, as sophisticated as I am.

596
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,480
A man of culture.

597
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,660
Obviously, I still have the shit all over my face.

598
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:26,500
Right.

599
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,960
That's right.

600
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,000
My glorious war paint and...

601
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,840
Oh no, you can't taint it.

602
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,680
That's not subtly that moment.

603
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,200
You can't taint it like that.

604
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,000
That was the coolest thing we've done in the show so far.

605
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,300
Well, now the coolest thing we've done

606
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:48,060
is one of the hosts smeared shit all over his face

607
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:51,680
to gain a psychological advantage over all of the others.

608
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:56,680
Cause you're all wondering what's going on

609
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,160
in this guy's mind right now.

610
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:02,400
And to give Joe a good amount of time

611
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:06,880
to think about what he's gonna do as the overseer.

612
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,400
That would have been a smart thing for Joe to do, for sure.

613
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,240
Oh!

614
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,400
Yeah, it would have been.

615
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,960
For sure, for sure, for sure.

616
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,000
Oh, you made me laugh

617
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,080
while I was still adjusting the microphone.

618
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,580
I do have an idea, kinda, but I wanna ask,

619
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:24,360
now that my reality is shifting

620
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:27,580
and I'm getting some insight into the overseer's head,

621
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:30,400
can I dig around in there a little bit and see what I know?

622
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,180
Hondo P, baby.

623
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,440
Oh, what are you looking for?

624
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,840
Well, in the immediate, he was gonna look for some spells.

625
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,820
And my goal, since I now have a Clark Gold,

626
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:41,360
I have an overseer, and I've also got a Clark

627
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,640
who has just recently proven

628
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,540
that he can handle some level of skill.

629
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:47,540
I wanna see if there are extra spells

630
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:49,380
rattling around in overseer's head

631
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:53,180
that he can pass along to me Clark, Clark Current.

632
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:54,220
Clark me.

633
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,580
And divide forces.

634
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:57,840
If me Clark needs to go be working on something

635
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,300
while overseer's working on something else,

636
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:03,540
I feel like Clark Gold has the tactical command here

637
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:05,340
and he needs to delegate.

638
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:07,220
He's obviously had an end goal in mind.

639
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:09,140
Let's make that happen.

640
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:12,900
So you know that he is scared, which is weird,

641
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:15,540
because the same time you feel all of this power,

642
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:18,220
you feel an immense amount of fear,

643
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:22,460
and it is all directed at this creature.

644
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:25,100
Whatever you want to do,

645
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,060
whatever you want to impart

646
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:31,020
onto this younger version of yourself,

647
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:35,380
you feel good about being able to do that.

648
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:36,720
So yeah, that's kind of what I was gonna say.

649
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,780
I wanted to make sure that he has a chance to right now

650
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:42,900
with this moment of noticing, oh shit, my Clark,

651
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:45,180
my younger Clark is capable.

652
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:48,220
I wanna use this time to tell him what he needs to do.

653
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:50,980
You as Clark Bishop, which he would have seen,

654
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,400
you just had this conversation

655
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:56,460
with the only tall, gaunt creature last time,

656
00:31:56,740 --> 00:32:00,400
and you both agreed the Lumbering Beast was the issue,

657
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:04,140
and now a bunch of those things have just appeared,

658
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:06,580
you would assume to help.

659
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:09,300
You can think about the abilities that they've used, right?

660
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,140
So.

661
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:11,940
Freeze a person in place.

662
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:12,780
Yeah.

663
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:13,940
Yep, and wipe a mind.

664
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:18,420
So you think that if they can hold this thing in place,

665
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:21,460
then you guys can probably eliminate it.

666
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:26,460
Also, you do see 12 fucking goopy skeletons

667
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:29,940
are coming down, and those need to be addressed this round.

668
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:31,540
Okay, this round, I don't know.

669
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:33,900
I was gonna say, my thought was,

670
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:36,980
with the paralyzing power of those,

671
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,380
of our Marvin creatures,

672
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:41,260
that they could stop those skeletons in their tracks.

673
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:43,060
I assume that the Overseer knows

674
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:45,560
that he needs people around him to keep this power level up,

675
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,340
so he wants to make sure that those skeletons

676
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,500
can't take any more people.

677
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,180
So maybe that's what this Overseer

678
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:53,060
is going to focus on, is those skeletons.

679
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:56,480
Overseer's gonna stop those things in their tracks.

680
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,360
Or he's gonna try.

681
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,020
No, he doesn't.

682
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,740
Holy shit. It's a 93.

683
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:11,860
I rolled a 93.

684
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:14,100
Oh my God.

685
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,660
Clark Bishop, you've just looked over

686
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:19,940
and seen the Overseer reach out,

687
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:24,940
attempt something against these falling, lost bones,

688
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:29,820
these rattling bones that are just dripping with ooze

689
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:32,120
as they're falling down toward you,

690
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:37,780
and it does not work, and you see his face drop.

691
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:38,780
Yeah.

692
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:40,260
This is your moment.

693
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,340
It's Clark Bishop's turn.

694
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:48,380
This Clark is aware of this mind split,

695
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:53,380
and he feels what the Overseer was trying to do,

696
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:55,100
and so he's gonna try it himself.

697
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,180
He's gonna take up the mantle of,

698
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:58,340
all right, I see what you were doing.

699
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,220
I see what you were doing.

700
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:01,140
All right, okay, here we go.

701
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:06,140
That is a 20 on a 63 is what this Clark's Unnatural is.

702
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:06,980
Hell yeah, dude.

703
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:10,420
He's gonna just channel everything he was feeling

704
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:13,820
from the Overseer and just tweak it.

705
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:15,340
He saw where he messed up.

706
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:16,620
It was right there,

707
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:19,740
and he just tweaks the thing in his mind,

708
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:21,620
and that's the, oh shit,

709
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:22,820
that's where the Overseer fucked up.

710
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:24,220
Here we go, click.

711
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:28,060
And part of your mind just fucking breaks in that moment.

712
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:29,060
Roll sanity.

713
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:36,020
As you analyze the Unnatural nature of the universe

714
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:40,820
in which your mind currently exists.

715
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:42,140
Do not pass.

716
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:44,660
It's a 82 on a five.

717
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:47,820
Lose one sanity.

718
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,100
You know what that does, boy.

719
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,300
Yeah, that's a breaking point.

720
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,140
Showing up.

721
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:54,240
So you're gonna lose one sanity

722
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:58,620
as you handle this situation,

723
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:00,200
and handle it you do,

724
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:03,340
because the losing of the sanity is knowing

725
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:06,740
that you are fucking in control now.

726
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:10,220
You don't have a lot left of your humanity,

727
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:15,220
but you're the most powerful fucker on the field, so.

728
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:17,940
Dope.

729
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:22,140
All right, go ahead and roll three D100 rolls, Joe,

730
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:26,740
and holler what you roll.

731
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:27,580
A 34.

732
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:32,620
A 75.

733
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:37,500
And a 12.

734
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:42,340
34 is dermatillomania compulsion

735
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:44,580
for picking at one's skin.

736
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:45,900
Nasty.

737
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,260
I could see ways to use that

738
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:48,980
now that he's like split his body.

739
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,340
Oh, God.

740
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:56,340
75 is onomatomania irresistible desire

741
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,740
to repeat certain words.

742
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:03,460
Ooh, that's interesting.

743
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:04,940
Now that I'm casting spells.

744
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:06,100
Yep.

745
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:08,940
And 12.

746
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:13,940
12 is aminomania irrational cheerfulness.

747
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:20,900
I love all three of these.

748
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:21,940
Oh, shit.

749
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:24,740
So aminomania is what I live with.

750
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,760
I can role play that one real easy.

751
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,620
I kind of want to do that.

752
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:30,860
I kind of think it'd be funny for him

753
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,380
to be the most optimistic person

754
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:36,760
in this total hellscape of a grim scenario.

755
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,620
I completely agree.

756
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:40,460
Yeah, let's do it.

757
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:41,300
Let's do that one.

758
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,260
Aminomania.

759
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:43,100
That's perfect.

760
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,220
So Joe, what does Clark Bishop do

761
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:52,100
to stave off the invasion of these falling bungee jumping

762
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:56,700
frog into the frog tongue skeletons?

763
00:36:58,420 --> 00:36:59,740
I was kind of hoping you'd tell me.

764
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:02,020
I know that the overseer was last seen.

765
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:03,380
You said he extended his hand.

766
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:05,420
So I think Clark's starting with that.

767
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:07,540
He's got a big smile on his face

768
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:08,500
because he's figured it out.

769
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:11,340
He knows what's going on and it's all going to be fine.

770
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:12,960
And he does it.

771
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:13,800
I don't know.

772
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,940
Did you picture some of these powers?

773
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:16,860
How strong is this?

774
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:20,180
Can they start shattering

775
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:22,660
or are they just decommissioned shortly?

776
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:24,220
You can do whatever you want.

777
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:28,660
There's dripping skeletons that are coming down.

778
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:29,620
He wants to shatter them.

779
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:33,620
He wants them to pop as though those couple of myriads

780
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:35,060
he did, but these are bones.

781
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:38,300
So he knows that this is more of a break and less of a pop,

782
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:40,300
but he wants them to shatter and crumble.

783
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,860
Okay.

784
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,460
Fucking cool.

785
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:47,060
And let's go ahead and roll 2D12

786
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:50,660
to see how many of these guys you can get.

787
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:53,440
First one's a two.

788
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:55,180
Uh-oh.

789
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:58,580
Second one is a motherfucking one.

790
00:37:58,580 --> 00:37:59,540
I shit you not.

791
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:01,780
Oh my God.

792
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,100
I rolled a two and a one.

793
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:04,860
Let's just pretend if we were rolling three,

794
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,000
it would have been a 10.

795
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:06,840
So.

796
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:11,840
So three of these skeletons.

797
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:14,900
God damn it.

798
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:15,800
It makes sense.

799
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,640
This was young Clark who shot the spell off.

800
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,100
That's why it was only three.

801
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:23,140
Yeah.

802
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:24,700
He's just blossoming.

803
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,180
He's just blooming.

804
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,220
Figuring out his powers.

805
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:29,060
He's going to get the hang of it.

806
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,340
This is a good start.

807
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:32,260
These things completely disintegrate

808
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:35,180
and their bones as they turn into dust

809
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:38,460
kind of meld with the residue that's around them.

810
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:41,980
And it turns into like residue mud.

811
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:45,780
It's like the liquid of the ooze and the muck

812
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:48,980
with the sand now, like bone sand

813
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:51,660
just kind of forms together in this.

814
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:52,500
Gritty.

815
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,720
Yeah.

816
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:54,560
Yeah.

817
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,380
He's there too.

818
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:58,020
Is it like when you throw sand on diarrhea?

819
00:38:58,900 --> 00:38:59,740
Thomas.

820
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:03,660
Yes.

821
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:06,460
It's like throwing sand on diarrhea

822
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:08,660
while holding up a newspaper from 10 years ago.

823
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:12,820
And with that, the other skeletons are still coming down.

824
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:14,840
Don D. Pettymore.

825
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:15,820
It's your turn.

826
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:20,500
You're in conversation with John Lee Pettymore III.

827
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:24,660
He's given me a mild embrace with his tendrils.

828
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:25,580
That's right.

829
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:27,820
Just a pat on the back to reassure you.

830
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,660
I kind of like grab it

831
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:31,260
like you would like someone's hand

832
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:33,660
and I'm like kind of like affectionately

833
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:34,580
like grabbing it.

834
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:35,420
Yeah, grabbing.

835
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:36,580
Yeah, you're doing it.

836
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:40,380
Like grabbing the hand on my, the hand,

837
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:43,340
the metal tendril as though it was John's.

838
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:44,540
Yeah, he's patting your shoulder

839
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:45,620
with his metal tendrils

840
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:47,780
and you put your hand on the metal tendrils

841
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:49,260
and kind of pat back.

842
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:51,220
Tell me what I need to do, John.

843
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:53,580
Tell me what I can do to help make things right.

844
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:58,260
You feel the tendril slip into your spine.

845
00:39:58,260 --> 00:39:59,380
Oh, shit.

846
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:03,220
Yes.

847
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:09,140
Oh, shit.

848
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:12,780
And the ball comes out of John Lee Pettymore.

849
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:15,140
He's kind of hanging limp

850
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:17,780
and there's just a silver ball floating

851
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:19,900
a few feet above him.

852
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:21,860
And it all feels right though.

853
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:25,060
As you feel more and more tendrils

854
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:28,020
moving down your spine

855
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:30,900
and experiencing your nerves

856
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:34,260
and suddenly you and your nephew

857
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:38,500
are kind of the same thing.

858
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:45,100
Holy shit.

859
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:46,940
Sorry.

860
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:49,980
Did you take his spine out first?

861
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:50,820
No, no, no.

862
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:53,020
Just attach yourself to it.

863
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:56,260
He's just been attached to the John of Fortune

864
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:58,260
and he's part of that wheel of fate now.

865
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:02,340
So we can also nix all that.

866
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:06,340
I want Don to still be a character,

867
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:08,580
but essentially he and John

868
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:10,700
might just be talking heads.

869
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,060
I don't want to take away all of John.

870
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:13,300
I just literally took away

871
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:15,460
all of Justin's character's agency,

872
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:16,420
which we can.

873
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:20,260
86 right off the bat.

874
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:23,580
I just thought it might be wicked cool.

875
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:24,500
Justin, how do you feel?

876
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:25,340
Yeah, how do you feel, Justin?

877
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:27,820
I don't mind at all about you taking away my agency.

878
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:28,740
That's totally fine.

879
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:33,380
I'm just curious of your motivation for wanting my body.

880
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:35,380
Okay, that's what I don't know.

881
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:36,620
That's what I don't know.

882
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:41,020
But I kind of imagined John and Don

883
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:43,580
as a second Nick and Mick

884
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:45,340
and they're just heads.

885
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:46,180
Oh no.

886
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:48,380
That are literally like,

887
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:50,700
okay, so imagine the tiny ball

888
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:54,900
and then thick stocks of tendrils coming down

889
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:59,220
forming essentially two legs with Don and John

890
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:01,620
and it's just running around like an at-at.

891
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:05,540
Oh my God, I love that so much

892
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:07,100
and we'll see what comes of that.

893
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:07,940
You look next to you

894
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:11,780
and you see the body of John Lee Pettymore

895
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:16,780
kind of hanging limply from this massive stock of tendrils

896
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:19,860
that has started to come down from this very tiny ball

897
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:22,900
and he kind of looks over at you expectantly

898
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:25,020
and with a smile.

899
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:29,380
He says, Don, I know in your life you were mostly an outlaw

900
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:32,780
but I was a law man and that means I'm here to help.

901
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:34,220
So that's what we're gonna do here today

902
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:35,660
and I need your help with that

903
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:38,380
which is why I've taken your body from you

904
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:42,260
but I still respect your criminal mind.

905
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:46,900
So I've left you that.

906
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:50,620
You'll see here if you kind of look up

907
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:53,460
and look around at what's going on here.

908
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:56,060
I've taken over your central nervous system

909
00:42:56,060 --> 00:43:00,460
and now you're a part of a John and Don.

910
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:02,140
It's kind of like an at-at.

911
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:03,780
You like Star Wars, Uncle Don?

912
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:05,640
Love Star Wars, boy.

913
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:07,020
Where are the legs of a little,

914
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:09,740
oh, I said at-at, it's actually an AT-ST.

915
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:11,260
The scout trooper, right?

916
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:12,900
What does AT-AT stand for?

917
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:13,980
Attack, attack.

918
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:19,020
The AT-STs are the small one.

919
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:22,140
Yeah, AT-AT is the four legs, AT-ST is two.

920
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:24,260
Scout transport.

921
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:25,980
Listen, Uncle Don.

922
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:30,020
What we are is a swift, highly mobile ball

923
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:34,260
with the minds of two wily Pettymores, chicken walker.

924
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:37,260
We're gonna get out there on that battlefield

925
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:41,100
and we're gonna be where we're needed and help who we can.

926
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:42,740
Does that sound amenable to you?

927
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:46,060
Don has like kind of like tears running down his eyes

928
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:48,160
when this starts happening,

929
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:52,260
as he's like finally able to like let go of all the stress

930
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:53,960
now that he's no longer in control.

931
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:56,800
And he's like, it sounds wonderful.

932
00:43:58,420 --> 00:43:59,740
Fuck yeah.

933
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:02,580
John's head like gives a little nod

934
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:06,020
and then you get wicked whiplash

935
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:09,440
as this thing runs off towards the skeletons.

936
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:15,700
Real fast, will you describe the image of it

937
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:17,020
one more time for me?

938
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:18,100
What's the setup?

939
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:23,100
Imagine, imagine a tiny ball with the legs of an AT-ST.

940
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:25,860
So these tendrils have come out

941
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:30,860
and they formed into thick, powerful leg trunks.

942
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:34,700
Like you might find on an AT-ST

943
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:38,740
and where their shins and feet would be,

944
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:42,200
that's the, those are the bodies of John and Don

945
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:45,380
with their heads at like the kneecaps.

946
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:47,300
Gotcha, gotcha.

947
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:49,940
They're like Pacific Rim mind melded together.

948
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:53,740
Yeah, they're kind of just like crucified on this thing.

949
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:55,380
Yeah, but they look cheerful.

950
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:56,980
Crying kneecaps.

951
00:44:56,980 --> 00:45:00,360
Yeah, cheerfully, cheerfully crying kneecap.

952
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:02,060
Don Deep anymore.

953
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:05,060
This is great.

954
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:09,420
Okay, that was Don's turn somehow.

955
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:16,340
Great turn, great turn.

956
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:18,840
Good job, good job.

957
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:21,940
That's good.

958
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:26,700
It is John's turn and it is not this ball John's turn,

959
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:30,820
but rather it is the ball John that has been repelled

960
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:36,580
like a magnet away from the ball of Rosemary, M-A-R-Y.

961
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:39,520
Basically John Ball is taken aback

962
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:43,440
by being repulsed from Ballmary.

963
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:46,340
He's floating there for a second

964
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:50,220
and then he sees her starting to open like the portal.

965
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:51,120
Starting.

966
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:53,880
He sees her starting to open the portal

967
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:57,920
and very quickly long spindly like tendrils

968
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:59,760
shoot out of him.

969
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:02,760
He's trying to move the material of the world back,

970
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,120
like fill it back in where she's opening the portal.

971
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:07,120
Nice, hell yeah.

972
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:07,960
I dig it.

973
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:09,920
It's frantically like a kid in a sandbox.

974
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:13,360
He's just like trying to scoop the world into her hole.

975
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:15,480
Yeah.

976
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:20,280
Like a kid in a sandbox.

977
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,040
Yeah.

978
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,360
All right.

979
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:28,560
She just failed her unnatural role

980
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:32,220
and so if you can pass yours, then this happens.

981
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,000
43 on a 67.

982
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:38,840
Well done.

983
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:46,480
Moving on.

984
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,360
I pour the world into her hole.

985
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:55,520
Yeah, and now it is the Sky Sea Keith.

986
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:56,720
Keith has just

987
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:02,160
filled up a worm's mouth

988
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:08,240
with this liquid nitrogen, this frozen material

989
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:12,440
completely creating an ice luge

990
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:15,720
like a water slide down there at Splashylvania

991
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:19,440
but in winter time as if the entire encasement tube

992
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:23,840
has been frozen and feet first he goes right on in there

993
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:25,600
and Keith, let me tell you,

994
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:29,840
the things that you see blow your fucking mind

995
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:34,680
because you are now just surrounded in this ice world.

996
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:37,080
It is cold as fuck in here

997
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:42,080
and you see almost like a translucent ice barrier

998
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,920
surrounding you all around you

999
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:49,280
and on the other side of it are just dazzling shapes

1000
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:55,000
and colors, large shadows, just all of these movements

1001
00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:00,440
like you're at an aquarium, like a psychedelic aquarium

1002
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:04,600
but the entire pane of glass has been frosted over.

1003
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:09,480
How big am I like, what am I trying to ask?

1004
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:10,840
You've got elbow room.

1005
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:13,800
Okay, I'm not like completely sucked in

1006
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:16,520
like to the esophagus or whatever.

1007
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:18,080
You got two elbows room.

1008
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:20,160
Two elbows room, okay, tight.

1009
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:24,880
Keith looks around and he's amazed.

1010
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:26,400
He's kind of like entranced

1011
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,400
and he's just kind of staring off

1012
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:31,320
and looking at the shapes and the shadows and everything

1013
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:35,720
and then he snaps out of it and he remembers why he's here

1014
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:38,840
and he tries to just punch through,

1015
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:43,840
basically punch his way out of this frozen worm's stomach

1016
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:47,000
or whatever part of the body I'm in.

1017
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,400
Sure, yeah, go ahead and roll.

1018
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:51,840
Okay, it's a 36.

1019
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:55,120
I feel like that's gonna be good, but let's find out.

1020
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:56,000
What?

1021
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,440
40%, so I pass with 36.

1022
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:01,360
Excellent. Nice.

1023
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:05,400
Also, remember I have these pneumatic arm things too

1024
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:08,440
so my punch is extra strong.

1025
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:13,120
Yes, and with that, you are going to be able

1026
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:16,040
to shatter this worm from the inside.

1027
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:18,160
As this thing shatters,

1028
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:22,240
cold water begins pouring in all around you.

1029
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:24,680
You swim up to the top.

1030
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:28,080
You can grab onto one of these frozen insides,

1031
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:32,040
pieces of this thing to kind of raft you,

1032
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:34,680
help you hold on to the top of this water

1033
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:38,200
as waves are unnaturally coming at you from left, right,

1034
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:39,600
from front, from back.

1035
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:40,760
They're going past you.

1036
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:42,160
They're coming from within you.

1037
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:46,080
Like it's just, the water is not reacting like normal water

1038
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:47,520
and as you're looking up over the top

1039
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:49,080
of any of these cresting waves,

1040
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:53,960
you see worm after worm coming up, diving back in.

1041
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:56,920
You look down, you can't see anything.

1042
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:57,960
You can't see your body.

1043
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:58,880
You can't see your feet.

1044
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:02,080
The water is completely dark and looking above you,

1045
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:07,080
your sky is a luminous ground

1046
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:10,760
that this fight is being fought on

1047
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:12,960
and that is your ceiling.

1048
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:14,240
How many worms are there?

1049
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:16,080
I was under the impression there were two,

1050
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:19,080
but are there just a bunch swimming around in here?

1051
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:20,560
Yeah, there's more than two.

1052
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:24,000
Well, that's not good.

1053
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,040
Why did you think there was two?

1054
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:27,960
I don't know.

1055
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:30,240
I thought there were just two for some reason.

1056
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:31,840
And Keith immediately thinks to himself,

1057
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:34,960
fuck, I should not have done this.

1058
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:38,320
That's exactly what Keith thinks.

1059
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:43,320
Yeah, he finds a door-sized frozen piece of worm

1060
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:47,880
and he climbs on top of it and he looks

1061
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:51,840
and he sees a worm come up like a dolphin would

1062
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:52,680
or something.

1063
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:56,520
It winks at you.

1064
00:50:56,520 --> 00:51:00,960
And it winks at me and Keith thinks,

1065
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:05,160
I'm gonna have to do a lot of this.

1066
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:08,720
And he lunges at the worm that's near him.

1067
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:10,600
Hell yeah.

1068
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:12,560
From on top of the frozen piece of worm.

1069
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:17,640
That's so bad ass.

1070
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:19,320
Also, I'm glad you're up in the sky,

1071
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:20,920
but now it makes a lot more sense

1072
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:23,080
why you went there if you thought like,

1073
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:24,760
after you got to that first worm,

1074
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:27,160
like halfway done, there's only one more.

1075
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:30,680
Upon realizing his mistake,

1076
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:32,800
Keith is like, well, I'm here anyway,

1077
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:35,520
so might as well just get to it.

1078
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:38,960
Hell yeah.

1079
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:40,080
Doers get it done.

1080
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:41,280
Planet Juggernaut.

1081
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:46,280
Planet Juggernaut had been eerily still last turn

1082
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:48,520
and you heard whirring inside of him.

1083
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:50,080
How many turns did that take?

1084
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:51,080
One.

1085
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:52,400
Oh, cool.

1086
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:55,360
Planet Juggernaut starts rolling

1087
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:57,080
almost imperceptibly at first,

1088
00:51:57,080 --> 00:52:00,440
but then it's faster than you can really imagine.

1089
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:03,800
And he's heading towards those fucking skeletons

1090
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:05,240
like they're bowling pins.

1091
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:06,960
Yeah.

1092
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,240
They're coming down from the sky

1093
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:10,640
and Planet Juggernaut,

1094
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:14,360
I mean, this thing is spinning, spinning, spinning,

1095
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:15,200
spinning, spinning,

1096
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:17,840
and then all of a sudden it launches itself

1097
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:20,640
up into the air and is going to take out

1098
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:24,800
and fitting their nine bowling pin skeletons

1099
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:25,680
left in the air,

1100
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:26,880
which is how many are left

1101
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:29,480
after I have thrown one bowling ball.

1102
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:33,200
Cause it's like I only hit one.

1103
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:34,040
Yeah.

1104
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:35,520
It's wild that you can only hit one

1105
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:37,040
with the bumpers even.

1106
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:42,440
Yeah, we put the bumpers on and played golf rules.

1107
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:43,720
Exactly, lowest score.

1108
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:47,320
That actually sounds really game.

1109
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:49,080
Yeah, that sounds doable.

1110
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:50,480
It sounds like you created something here

1111
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:51,760
that we got to give a try.

1112
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:54,320
Don't put this episode out.

1113
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:55,560
We got to patent this.

1114
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:56,400
Yeah.

1115
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:00,720
Bowling golf is going to make us a million bucks.

1116
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,680
It's going to be huge.

1117
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:05,360
From the creators of the fuck barrel.

1118
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:06,680
Yeah, what's your company do?

1119
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:08,840
Oh, we're a podcast company

1120
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:09,680
who makes the fuck barrel.

1121
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,800
We're a multimedia conglomerate

1122
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:15,640
that puts out some audio entertainment,

1123
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:18,760
at home leisure projects,

1124
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:21,960
and we also run a professional sporting enterprise.

1125
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:26,080
At home leisure projects.

1126
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:28,000
Products, you know.

1127
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:28,840
Products.

1128
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:29,680
Personal.

1129
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:30,640
Roll bowling.

1130
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:31,800
Look on your foot sheet.

1131
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:33,120
Should I just roll a D10?

1132
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:35,240
No, go ahead and roll two D12.

1133
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:36,080
Two D12.

1134
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:39,800
It's the one that looks like a D20, but isn't.

1135
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:42,400
I had to remind myself when I was searching for it.

1136
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:44,080
Okay.

1137
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:49,040
15 and 11 and a four.

1138
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:50,360
Do you know what that'll do?

1139
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:51,840
Take out all nine skeletons?

1140
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:53,160
That'll take out all nine skeletons.

1141
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:54,000
Hell yeah.

1142
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,320
Can I describe what happens?

1143
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:01,240
Can you leave one so that I can describe how cool it is

1144
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:02,920
when it grabs Drew Andrews

1145
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:06,000
and rips him back into the mouth of a giantum rapithecus?

1146
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,080
Yeah, you can leave one.

1147
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:07,920
That's fine.

1148
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:09,240
No.

1149
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:12,200
No, you're not going to do that to our baby boy.

1150
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:13,040
Would have been cool.

1151
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:14,360
Would have been the body of Drew or Drew?

1152
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:18,240
Oh, when you say Drew Andrews, you mean Drew pages?

1153
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:20,040
I mean, when I say Drew Andrews,

1154
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:22,320
I mean the body of Councilwoman Kerry pages,

1155
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:25,800
but yeah, let's move on to a description from Thomas

1156
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:27,240
about how fucking cool this is.

1157
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:28,080
Right.

1158
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:31,200
So you mentioned that they're flying down from the air.

1159
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:34,800
So Planet Juggernaut has flown up to meet him,

1160
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:37,720
almost like he hit a ridge in the world

1161
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:39,280
as he was rolling or something.

1162
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:43,440
And maybe you even see one appear before him just briefly,

1163
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:44,640
but you can't be sure.

1164
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:46,320
Something strange happens.

1165
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:49,040
As Planet Juggernaut is rising up into the air,

1166
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:51,360
heading towards these skeletons,

1167
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:55,200
he kind of blocks your view of them for a second.

1168
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:57,280
He rises up to where they were.

1169
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:59,160
And as you come down,

1170
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:03,840
you see just like a string of ichor shooting back up

1171
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:05,360
into this thing's mouth.

1172
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:07,240
And where Planet Juggernaut hits the ground

1173
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:09,040
and starts rolling again,

1174
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:13,880
you see like black chewing gum just stuck to the side

1175
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:17,760
of his like chassis.

1176
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:21,440
And you see like some rib cages and shit sticking out.

1177
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:25,560
But these things are just like completely waffled on him.

1178
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:27,960
This is how it feels to chew five gum.

1179
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:36,320
And because you rolled so high above the nine,

1180
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:41,920
think about an AT-AT and think about Luke Skywalker

1181
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:44,760
and think about this Gigantumbropithecus

1182
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:46,920
and think about how you've got its tongue.

1183
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:49,160
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1184
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:55,080
Those are Joe's vinegar strokes.

1185
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:02,120
So Planet Juggernaut, as his turn ends,

1186
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:05,200
you just see him starting to take a long, graceful turn

1187
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,720
around the feet of the Gigantumbropithecus.

1188
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:09,400
Yes.

1189
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:10,240
Awesome.

1190
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:11,080
Yes.

1191
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:17,280
Oh, and as Planet Juggernaut picks up that spare,

1192
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:21,440
we've gone through another round of combat here, Nick Nichols.

1193
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:22,920
That's absolutely amazing.

1194
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:25,880
I think we owe our lives to our one true god,

1195
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:27,200
Planet Juggernaut.

1196
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:28,880
Praise be to the Juggernaut.

1197
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:30,560
Praise be to the Juggernaut.

1198
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:32,000
Now, did you think, Nick,

1199
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,600
that it was going to be one episode

1200
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:36,640
per one round of combat here?

1201
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:41,120
You know, I wanted to say no, but that's just it.

1202
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:42,680
It happened.

1203
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:44,000
We had all hoped not.

1204
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:50,080
What I specifically hated about D&D

1205
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:54,280
was waiting for everyone else to take their turn forever.

1206
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:58,920
And instead, I just took three 30-minute turns this game.

1207
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:04,560
One of which was Justin's.

1208
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:07,400
Right?

1209
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:43,560
What kind of world are you living in?

1210
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:53,560
What kind of world are you living in?

1211
00:57:53,560 --> 00:58:03,560
What kind of world are you living in?

1212
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:11,560
What kind of world are you living in?

1213
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:19,560
What kind of world are you living in?
