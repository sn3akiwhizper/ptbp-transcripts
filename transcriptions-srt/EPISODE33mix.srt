1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,480
What's up my babies, what's down, what's all around, what can never drown, it is me,

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:17,500
a wolf the dog of course, and I'm here taking up all kinds of space on 694.2 PTBP, the greatest

3
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,400
damn radio station that ever was.

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,900
I've got an announcement here that comes straight from my producer, later today, following

5
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,460
the release of this show.

6
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:34,420
The second Patreon exclusive bonus episode drops for all of our honorary police officers.

7
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:40,580
The whole cast, even some guy named Justin, got together and played an absurdly delightful

8
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:43,020
game of Everyone is John.

9
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:48,820
You can hear that, as well as our first bonus episode, another Q&A session, by following

10
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:55,380
the link to our Patreon in the show notes, or going to patreon.com slash pretending pod,

11
00:00:55,380 --> 00:01:02,500
and becoming an honorary police officer by pledging $5 a month to keep the show alive.

12
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,940
You know what keeps ol' Wolfie alive?

13
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:11,580
It's that real shit, that good good, it's the fatherfuckin' news y'all.

14
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:16,900
It has come to my attention that the boys from Contention are sitting pretty in the

15
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:20,060
city, though not without tension.

16
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:25,640
Rosemary convinced John Lee Pettymore IV that Marvin Glass would help them out in exchange

17
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:31,040
for the strange gun-like invention they found in the possession of Tildy B. Mitchell immediately

18
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,520
prior to her disappearance.

19
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:39,660
Rosemary and Marvin Glass clearly had other intentions, leaving our idiot cop heroes in

20
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:45,780
a sort of cage match to tension playfully referred to as the Juice Box.

21
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:55,540
I'm not really confident on everything that happened next, but I will mention the deaths

22
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:58,420
of all three cops from Contention.

23
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:05,580
In a lucky ascension, the boys rose from necrotic dimensions, leaving my mind and belief in

24
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:12,700
suspension, and now they are all in attendance at the funeral of Ari Manstein, the trusty

25
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,860
co-worker whose name kept changing.

26
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:21,820
The officers' incomprehension must have led to some apprehension as they never once looked

27
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:24,900
into the reasoning behind the faulty memories.

28
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:32,100
But of course, you already knew all that, and if you did not, no condescension, there

29
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:37,060
is a lot going on, almost too much full retention.

30
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:44,460
But my mind is inclined to find that which will remind you to bump and grind and unwind.

31
00:02:44,460 --> 00:03:03,860
It's Kudzu, baby, with no bat-o.

32
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:14,700
Got wind blow, hammer of the gods, guide us ships to new lands, how we come to tides

33
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:20,140
of war, Valhalla we are calling.

34
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,140
I'm coming.

35
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:23,140
Valhalla, I'm coming.

36
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:29,380
Guys, it's been a really long time since we've all been in this room to record this podcast

37
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,380
together.

38
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,380
It has, actually.

39
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:35,680
We've done individual sessions, but this is the first time we've all been in here, besides

40
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,900
the Q&As, to play.

41
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,420
I had forgotten about that.

42
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,420
I'm excited.

43
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,420
Me, too.

44
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,860
Oh, hey, so here's a freebie Q&A.

45
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:48,300
Somebody on the subreddit had asked why it took us six months between recording sessions,

46
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,380
and he asked, did we think the podcast wouldn't work out?

47
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:52,580
And that's not the case.

48
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:56,900
It's just that we had recorded so much before we started that that's how long it took us

49
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:01,100
to get to releasing an episode weekly and playing again.

50
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:08,220
It also took me a solid year to convince myself that I was ready for the technical

51
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:14,000
challenge of editing a audio show every week, as I've never done that before.

52
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,440
You were well up to the task, but it was a risk to record six months' worth of a podcast

53
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,460
before we got any listener feedback.

54
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,460
That's true.

55
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:24,460
Yeah.

56
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:25,460
Yep, yep, yep.

57
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,460
Ballsy.

58
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,460
To the wallsy.

59
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:30,900
Ballsy to the wallsy.

60
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:31,900
We still got it.

61
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:32,900
Yeah, baby.

62
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,900
That's what we do.

63
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,900
Oh, thank God.

64
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,900
Luke, you're not still on one of the old mics, are you?

65
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:38,900
I don't think so, no.

66
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:39,900
No, he's on the new one.

67
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:40,900
Do I sound normal now?

68
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:41,900
Shout a little bit.

69
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:42,900
Hey, you sound good.

70
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:43,900
Cool, thank you.

71
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:44,900
You sound hot.

72
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:45,900
Oh, baby.

73
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:46,900
ASL, Luke.

74
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:47,900
Twenty-five, male, Springfield, Missouri.

75
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:48,900
Not interested.

76
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:49,900
Asked and answered.

77
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:50,900
Twenty-five.

78
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:51,900
All right, so.

79
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:52,900
Baby.

80
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:53,900
Baby.

81
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:54,900
Oh, boy.

82
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:55,900
Baby, Luke.

83
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:56,900
Baby, Luke.

84
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:57,900
Oh, no.

85
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:14,180
Wait, okay, here, out of all of us, you're the baby Luke, who's the daddy Luke, who's

86
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,820
the mommy Luke, who's the grandpa Luke?

87
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,380
I think Joe is the daddy Luke.

88
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:18,580
It's so obvious, yeah.

89
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:21,080
Thomas is grandpa Luke and I'm mommy Luke.

90
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,080
That sounds right.

91
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,420
I can drive with that.

92
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:24,940
I definitely thought you were daddy Luke, but-

93
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:30,060
I love doing a podcast with my family.

94
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,540
So welcome to this podcast.

95
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,980
You're in the shit.

96
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:34,980
You are in Zach's.

97
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:35,980
Welcome, yeah.

98
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:36,980
Part of his room.

99
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:41,180
Welcome to the twisted world of Zach Reeves.

100
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,180
Doxed.

101
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:48,000
All right, so.

102
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:55,960
The three of you are in a cemetery in the city, along with many other funeral attendees.

103
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:00,480
Wait, no, I didn't go there.

104
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,040
I can't wait for the crawfish.

105
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,400
All the seats are basically full.

106
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,480
There's still some people standing around in the back.

107
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:12,160
You don't recognize anyone in attendance from contention.

108
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:17,920
Other than Jan Manstein, Ari's mother, she's just popping in and out of everywhere, talking

109
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:23,880
to everyone, shaking hands, kissing babies, doing the whole thing.

110
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:28,880
And eventually everyone kind of settles down and she takes her place at the podium next

111
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,880
to the coffin with the crawfish boil in front of it.

112
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:40,960
And the smell wafts through the cemetery with the pungency that seafood carries.

113
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,960
And she begins.

114
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,720
Oh guys, thank you so much for coming.

115
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:51,160
You know, I think that I'm really glad that everyone is able to make it out.

116
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,160
Glad's maybe not the right word, but I'm happy.

117
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:57,440
I'm not happy, but this is, it's just good to see everyone.

118
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,280
And thank you for coming to Ari's funeral.

119
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:07,800
She was taken too soon from us in the fire that claimed the lives of many here in the

120
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,040
city.

121
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:15,540
And we are here to celebrate her life, really mourn her loss, but also celebrate her life

122
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,980
but also mourn her loss.

123
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:22,100
And really just, we're here to talk about Ari.

124
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:29,940
And one person who doesn't get to talk about Ari very often, really come into the public

125
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:36,620
often, I haven't seen him very much recently, but my ex-husband, Stan Manstein, he's here

126
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,520
and he's going to say a few words.

127
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,940
So thank you.

128
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:47,080
And I guess the service will begin, or maybe it already began, but it's happening now.

129
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:53,720
And as she takes her seat, you see movement from the mausoleums, the tombs that are behind

130
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,500
the coffin area, there's some movement there.

131
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:06,120
And a man walks out and he is wearing all white, he is dressed in all white shirt and

132
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:11,180
pants, and his hands are behind his back.

133
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:16,800
Following him are three men wearing all black tactical combat gear.

134
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:22,580
One has a scar running under his chin across his neck, another has a Glasgow smile, and

135
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:26,200
the third has a scar straight down the middle of his face.

136
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:30,900
And they all look eerily similar and they're all tall and overweight.

137
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,040
What was the first one again?

138
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:35,600
He's got a scar running under his chin across his neck.

139
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:42,040
The three men stand behind Stan Manstein as he takes his place at the podium.

140
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:46,740
And Stan has extremely long, unkempt hair.

141
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:52,960
It's matted and tangled, and his beard is similarly pretty gross, actually.

142
00:08:52,960 --> 00:09:01,200
He's got a real Charlie Manson vibe going on, and he's got a weathered leather face.

143
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,240
There's a small microphone on the podium, and he pokes it with his finger and you hear

144
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,680
a woom, woom, woom, woom.

145
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,680
What?

146
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,680
Nope.

147
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,120
Why were his hands behind his back did you say?

148
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,520
I think that's just how he was walking.

149
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,520
Gotcha, they weren't shackled.

150
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,520
Nope.

151
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,520
Gotcha.

152
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:22,020
And Stan Manstein begins to speak.

153
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:38,260
And as he begins to speak this full nonsense, you hear, through the noise, him speaking

154
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:40,220
English to you.

155
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:46,780
And time slows to the pace of molasses.

156
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:49,980
And inside all your heads, you hear.

157
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:56,340
My daughter was kind, hardworking, and good every time.

158
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:59,300
She was those things when she was a police officer.

159
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:02,120
She was those things when she was a school teacher.

160
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,300
She was those things when she was a historian.

161
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:11,700
You see, one long time ago, when this land was stolen and pioneer towns began to form,

162
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:19,680
Silas Cole was a miner in the mine that employed the town nearby of contention.

163
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:24,160
Now we're going to do this in a round-by-round basis.

164
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:29,960
And that was Stan Manstein's first round.

165
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:34,100
Oh my god.

166
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,680
So are we in combat with Stan Manstein?

167
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:42,380
So technically, we're going to play this out in the combat rounds, however, you're willing

168
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:46,880
to do, you're more than, you know, welcome.

169
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,880
We're free to do?

170
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,640
You're welcome to do whatever you want.

171
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,560
Are you willing to do whatever you want?

172
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,160
I don't know.

173
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:59,880
So I would like to know what the dexterity is for Jon and for Keith.

174
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,560
65 for Jon.

175
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,560
60.

176
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,560
Okay.

177
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,520
So we are going to begin with Clark Bishop.

178
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,680
I want to survey the crowd.

179
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,280
You said time was slowing for me.

180
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:13,280
Does it look like the crowd is slowed around me?

181
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,280
Yes.

182
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,280
Good question.

183
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:18,320
Are any of them reacting in any way other than being still?

184
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,320
No.

185
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,920
I want to make my way toward the front.

186
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,480
Am I moving at normal speed?

187
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,480
You are.

188
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,480
Nice.

189
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,800
How are them guards looking?

190
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,800
Stoic.

191
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,800
I'm making my way toward the front.

192
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,960
Making my way up front.

193
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:37,080
Now for the reasons that listeners know and that some in the room don't, Thomas is going

194
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:41,240
to let me know on paper what he is up to.

195
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,240
Yeah.

196
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,880
So, Thomas, you're up.

197
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:48,920
I don't have to write down what I do for this round because I just observe.

198
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:52,160
I'm ready, but I'm just keeping an eye on everything.

199
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,160
All right.

200
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,160
Keith?

201
00:11:54,160 --> 00:12:01,160
I stay seated, but I reach into my pocket and have my hand on my gun.

202
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,160
Okay.

203
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:08,960
While down in the mines, Silas Cole came upon an odd black substance and he became obsessed

204
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,680
with studying it.

205
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:14,600
The substance was invisible to others, but not to Cole.

206
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:20,080
Exploiting the substance's wrong qualities, he became an inventor and made so much money

207
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:23,360
off of his inventions that he bought the mine.

208
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,800
He built an office on the top floor of the tall, skinny mining company building that

209
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,520
sat right above the mine itself.

210
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:36,320
He began to harvest the residue and acquired a much firmer grasp on its tendencies.

211
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,160
He invented wild, magical things.

212
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:44,360
Each new invention brought him wealth and power, but also released more of this inky

213
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,760
substance into the town.

214
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:50,400
Joe, what does Clark do?

215
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,680
I'm walking up the middle of the aisle.

216
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,680
Yeah.

217
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,840
And I want to get to the edge of the chairs.

218
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:59,880
And in the diagram, I'm to the center left of the podium.

219
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,880
Yeah.

220
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:05,520
And I'm going to let him keep talking.

221
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,520
Thomas?

222
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,280
Okay, well, I will write this one down.

223
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:15,920
Thomas has requested that I let the audience know here that John Lee Pettymore begins slowly

224
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:22,280
making his way toward the front along the right side of the map, which can be seen on

225
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:27,520
our Instagram and Twitter pages found at PretendingPod.

226
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:32,880
I see Bishop coming up and I look over and make eye contact with him, but I don't say

227
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,880
anything.

228
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,880
Are you, are you sitting?

229
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,120
I'm in the seat right in the middle aisle.

230
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,360
So I'm like standing next to you?

231
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,360
You're standing right next to me.

232
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,800
I put my hand on his, on Keith's shoulder.

233
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:48,120
I look up at him and kind of nod and then, Keith, what's up?

234
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,480
Is it bubble gum?

235
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,480
Bubble gum tree.

236
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,480
Bubble gum tree.

237
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,480
Bubble gum tree.

238
00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:00,360
I feel a little more at ease knowing that you just asked me that.

239
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:06,280
So in the, in the fiction of the rounds that we're doing here, uh, he, Manstein would still

240
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:13,160
be talking while we're talking, but we, we're, we're synced in time.

241
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,160
Yeah.

242
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,160
Okay.

243
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,160
That's super cool.

244
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:23,240
I kind of squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze your shoulder, Keith, I'm glad you're

245
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,240
with us.

246
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,240
I am too.

247
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:31,600
We can talk about this later, but I've been, it's been an interesting day.

248
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,680
If anything happens, you know, I still got your back and I would hope you'd have mine.

249
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,680
I do.

250
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:44,580
And I, I scratched my head and you can see a scar going down from my finger, down my

251
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,680
arm to my elbow.

252
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,120
I'm not like showing it to you, but you, you see it.

253
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,120
I notice it.

254
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,120
Yeah.

255
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,040
Do you think we should let him keep telling this story?

256
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,280
I'm interested in what he's saying.

257
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,040
He just mentioned the black goo.

258
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:03,280
I am too, but I don't know if the public needs to know what he's about to say.

259
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,520
I gesture around us.

260
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,760
I don't know if they, I don't know if they know.

261
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:12,220
I just look back up at Manstein and to divert his raising paranoia, he began looking for

262
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,220
a partner.

263
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:18,400
He found a similarly intelligent engineer and his wife, Mary Cole, who could also see

264
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:24,320
the substance they began calling residue, but Silas Cole was scared of their inventions.

265
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:29,360
He became paranoid that other people could see the residue that was loose all over the

266
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,360
town.

267
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:34,680
Consumed, he believed the town was plotting against him, so he began kidnapping people

268
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,080
he suspected knew too much.

269
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,600
Clark, you're up.

270
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:50,000
Good, good fucking work, Zach, on making this so fucking hard.

271
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
This is tight.

272
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,480
Clark, Clark does nothing.

273
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,480
Clark is going to keep listening.

274
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,480
Okay.

275
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:04,100
John Lee Pettymore continues moving forward along the right side that you can see along

276
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:08,040
the map on our Instagram page and our Twitter page.

277
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:13,200
It was made by Justin based off of a terrible drawing that I made.

278
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,640
Keith, what do you do?

279
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,040
I look over at Bishop again.

280
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:23,440
We're both soaking in the information that we're learning from Manstein, and when you

281
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:31,000
look over at me, looking a little closer, you see another giant scar on my forehead

282
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,640
going down on my face.

283
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,560
Are they fresh looking or are they healed looking?

284
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,560
Probably pretty fresh.

285
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,560
Probably pretty fresh, yeah.

286
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,560
Okay.

287
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,280
Would Joe recognize these scars from anybody he's seen before?

288
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,400
Are they similar?

289
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:46,320
Joe, go ahead and have Clark roll an intelligence for me, or I guess Joe is the one who rolls

290
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,000
intelligence for me.

291
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Joe rolls four-clack.

292
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,640
I'll do it on behalf of Clark.

293
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,640
That's a fail.

294
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,640
Sixty-seven on a fifty-five.

295
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,640
Okay.

296
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,480
It doesn't remind you of anything.

297
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:03,140
You're just mostly shocked that not only is he alive, but these scars also might explain

298
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:06,680
his aliveness.

299
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,640
And Keith, you are staring at Clark.

300
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,640
He is staring at you.

301
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,700
You're very near each other, right next to each other in fact.

302
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:19,100
I'm just kind of shaking my head like almost mouth agape, just like, the fuck?

303
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,740
And that's what I do.

304
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:21,740
Okay.

305
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:27,220
At this point in time, you notice that the three men who are dressed in all black begin

306
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:37,300
slowly converging on Stan Manstein, but they are moving at the pace of a high viscosity

307
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,300
liquid.

308
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,300
Got it.

309
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,300
They're moving slow.

310
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:46,300
They're moving slowly, but they are clearly moving toward Stan.

311
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:52,380
The town was suspicious of the disappearances, but most of the ones gone were bad people.

312
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:57,260
The whole saloon staff, the bartender, Miss Kitty, the piano player, there was a few gamblers,

313
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:01,700
the town drunk, so they kept their heads down and went about their business.

314
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:06,900
But then some good people disappeared, a professor, a circuit judge, a rancher, a homesteader,

315
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:10,540
the homesteader's wife, then the preacher disappeared.

316
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:15,740
The town freaked out and they hired a roaming cowboy named Cornelius Beams to kill their

317
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:18,980
weird paranoid figurehead.

318
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:19,980
Awesome.

319
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:23,740
Clark, it's your turn.

320
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:27,420
I'm drawing my weapon and shooting at Stan.

321
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,360
Roll firearms.

322
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:35,060
That's a pass, a 43 on an 80.

323
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:36,060
All right.

324
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,860
Go ahead and roll 1d10 for damage.

325
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,460
A 5.

326
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:43,380
You pull out your gun in the middle of a funeral.

327
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:47,060
I mean, it's not a normal funeral, sure.

328
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:54,740
The smell of crawfish fills the air and time is slow and this man is speaking to you in

329
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:59,060
your head in this odd spell-like cadence.

330
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:06,500
You pull out your firearm and you shoot at Stan Manstein and you hit him directly in

331
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,900
the chest.

332
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:13,540
Time immediately picks back up.

333
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,620
Thomas.

334
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:21,820
You all would see Kevin from behind the stage firing from behind the stage into the back

335
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:24,420
of one of those guys converging on Stan right now.

336
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:27,940
Go ahead and roll firearms.

337
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,700
89.

338
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,700
That's a miss.

339
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,700
You want to describe it?

340
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,700
Yeah.

341
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:42,940
I totally missed the first guy, but I accidentally hit the next guy in the head and he drops

342
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,340
the ground deck.

343
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,780
Damn it, I say.

344
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:47,780
You let him, Zach.

345
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:51,540
It's canon.

346
00:19:51,540 --> 00:20:00,820
Let's say the one with the scar on his neck.

347
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:07,180
I want to see how this plays out.

348
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:13,300
I can see in Zach's head, he's like, do I let him do this?

349
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:16,180
I like it so much, but it's not what happened.

350
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:20,340
It's not what the dice say, and 89 is pretty bad.

351
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:26,900
Keith Vigna, Clark Bishop, you both see Kevin, the security guard who you saw for the first

352
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:32,580
time at the bar in the Marvin Glass cage fighting den emporium.

353
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:33,980
We got real close.

354
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:34,980
Uh-huh.

355
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,780
Yeah, I believe he killed you.

356
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:38,880
I think so.

357
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,100
He fires and misses into this crowd.

358
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,060
Keith, it is your turn.

359
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:51,060
Oh, and also at this point in time, the audience freaks out and people all stand up and begin

360
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,940
screaming and panicking.

361
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:53,940
Yeah.

362
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:58,620
Once, I mean this boom, boom, I pull my gun out and aim for one of the security officers

363
00:20:58,620 --> 00:20:59,620
as well.

364
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:01,460
Are you just aiming this round or are you going to fire?

365
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,460
I'm firing.

366
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,460
All right.

367
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:06,840
Go ahead and roll that firearms check.

368
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,840
That's a three.

369
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,840
Nice.

370
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:12,580
Ooh, roll a, are you firing, you're firing with your small.

371
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:13,580
Powerful gun.

372
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:18,300
Rolled 2D10 for damage on that small powerful gun.

373
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,300
15.

374
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,300
15.

375
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,300
Oh, shoot.

376
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,300
Wait, what?

377
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,300
2D10.

378
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,300
A six and a nine.

379
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,300
A six and a nine.

380
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,300
Oh, congratulations.

381
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,300
Oh.

382
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:35,320
So you fire into one of the guards wearing the all black and you fire into him and he

383
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,380
goes down.

384
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:39,700
You don't know that he's dead, but he definitely goes down.

385
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,700
On the ground.

386
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

387
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,700
You knock him right on his back.

388
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:49,340
Keith, the guard that you shot hits the ground and immediately you all hear three gunshots

389
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:51,520
echo out from around you.

390
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:56,380
You don't know quite where they came from, but you see the body that is on the ground

391
00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:03,340
flops three times and then lays completely flat and it looks like someone finished off

392
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:07,580
this guy in all black completely dead, just offed him.

393
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:12,380
It is the turn of the other two in all black.

394
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:19,980
The first one turns around and tries to grapple Kevin who is behind him and I'm going to need

395
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:23,180
you to roll unarmed combat for me, Thomas.

396
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,180
Okay.

397
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,180
Haha.

398
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:27,180
25 out of 40.

399
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,180
Okay.

400
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,500
You get the better end of him.

401
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:33,820
So as he comes running toward you, what do you do with his weight?

402
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:38,700
He is like six and a half, seven feet tall and quite wide and you can do with him what

403
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:39,700
you want.

404
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:40,700
Okay.

405
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,700
So he goes out to dinner and...

406
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,700
Haha.

407
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,700
Lucky?

408
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:47,420
You got a lot of man headed your way.

409
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:55,260
No, I get down low and lean into him with my shoulder, like my left shoulder and just

410
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:57,220
kind of flip him over my back.

411
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:59,100
And is it my turn or is that just a reaction?

412
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,460
No, it's just a reaction.

413
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:06,820
The other one actually is running toward you as well and rolled a 100.

414
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:07,820
Okay.

415
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:08,820
Nice.

416
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,940
He trips over his own dick.

417
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:11,940
Haha.

418
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:12,940
Ow.

419
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:13,940
So what actually...

420
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:14,940
Haha.

421
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:17,900
That's payback for the cage.

422
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:18,900
What does he do?

423
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:19,900
He rolls a 100.

424
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:25,100
Yeah, he rolls a 100 and as he runs out, he holds one of his arms out toward you like

425
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:33,100
you saw the giant robot man in the house of James the mill worker.

426
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:38,940
As it begins to fly off, it actually flies cattywampus and goes behind him, wrapping

427
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:45,620
around his legs and he falls and hits the ground and he is currently like hogtied basically

428
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:47,620
by his own trip wires.

429
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,860
I say eat shit, Inspector Gadget.

430
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:52,740
Let's go put him on the train tracks.

431
00:23:52,740 --> 00:24:00,420
Stan Manstein is recovering from the shot to his chest and he begins to try to muster

432
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:04,980
the strength to go on, but for at least this round, he is unable.

433
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,660
Clark, it is your turn.

434
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:09,700
So one guy is hogtied on the ground, what's the other guy doing?

435
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:13,900
We got one dead on the ground, one hogtied on the ground and one that John has just flipped

436
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:14,980
over his shoulder.

437
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,740
I'm taking another shot at Stan.

438
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:20,460
Go ahead and roll firearms for me.

439
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,460
We might need Stan.

440
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:23,860
64 on an 80.

441
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:24,860
I pass.

442
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:25,860
All right.

443
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:26,860
Roll 1d10.

444
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:27,860
10.

445
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:31,300
I fucking knew you were going to 10.

446
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,300
I saw 0.

447
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,300
I'm like hell yeah.

448
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:36,300
I was like oh.

449
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:40,420
That's going to be enough to drop him fully, fully to the ground.

450
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:46,680
So when you fire into him, he steps backward with the weight of the bullets ripping through

451
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:51,900
his skin and as he falls backward, you see blood begin to pour out of the holes that

452
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:55,420
you have put in him and he is lying on the ground.

453
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:56,680
It is John's turn.

454
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:59,440
I'm just going to shoot the guy who's on the ground.

455
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,440
Yeah.

456
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,440
He's right there.

457
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,360
You get a plus 20 on your shot right now.

458
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,880
On the hogtied?

459
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,880
Not the hogtied one.

460
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,300
The one who I flipped over my shoulder.

461
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:13,160
So straight up, just two in the chest, one in the head, like I just try to end him.

462
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:16,160
Roll it for me, daddy.

463
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:20,480
Oh, 78 on a 60.

464
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:25,820
As you move your gun into position to fire on him, he freaks out and flexes and he moves

465
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:29,700
your arm out of the way and you fire into the ground right next to his head.

466
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,460
Are you 60 natural?

467
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:34,060
Because he gave you a plus 20, which would make you pass.

468
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,060
Oh, yeah.

469
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,060
I pass.

470
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,980
Oh, good looking out.

471
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:40,020
Hell yeah, Joe.

472
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,020
He's the best at it.

473
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:45,380
I forgot about the 20 you gave me as soon as I started talking.

474
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:50,820
So as you are firing into the ground, you get enough strength back in your arm.

475
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:56,940
The momentum of the gun firing carries my aim right into his heart.

476
00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:02,060
Immediately into his head and heart multiple times.

477
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:06,820
And batting number two, this man, this large, large man who you just took to the ground

478
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:08,620
is also dead.

479
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:10,220
It is now Keith's turn.

480
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:14,580
I run over to Manstein and I want to apply first aid.

481
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:15,580
Okay.

482
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:17,860
Go ahead and roll first aid for me.

483
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:21,260
Got a 53 and a 60.

484
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:22,260
All right.

485
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:24,060
Roll a D4 for me.

486
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,700
Just for me.

487
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:26,700
That is a four.

488
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:27,700
Nice.

489
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:28,700
All right.

490
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:29,700
Describe what you do.

491
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:33,180
I go stick my fingers in his bullet holes.

492
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:34,180
Not really.

493
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:35,180
No.

494
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:36,180
Plug them up.

495
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:37,980
Yeah, sure.

496
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:38,980
He rolled a four.

497
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:39,980
It works.

498
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:43,440
In the city, that's what first aid is.

499
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:51,920
As you dig your fingers into his bullet holes, you see his eyes just light up and almost

500
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:55,520
as if he has taken adrenaline into his bloodstream.

501
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:59,920
The pain from me doing that is definitely waking him up.

502
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:03,880
It's enough to open those eyes right on up.

503
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:10,560
And with that being done, he looks up at you and he is about to speak when you hear three

504
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:13,000
more gunshots fire.

505
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,440
I know.

506
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,680
Woo.

507
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:19,960
And actually- I don't like when you say woo.

508
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:20,960
Yeah.

509
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:32,320
All right, so Thomas, John feels a just fire in his back as a couple of bullets graze through

510
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:40,400
and hit right above his ribs going through his back, and you lose five hit points.

511
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,400
Uh-oh.

512
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,400
Spaghetti-o's.

513
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,400
Okay.

514
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:54,680
There is one remaining man in black and he is very upset with the situation at hand.

515
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,800
Which scar does he have?

516
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:59,160
Oh, he's got this scar that's going straight down his face.

517
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,160
This is the one that is all the way-

518
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,160
It's not the Glasgow.

519
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,160
Which one was the Glasgow smile again?

520
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,200
Glasgow smile is the one that you just killed.

521
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,200
Hell yeah.

522
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,200
For sure.

523
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,200
Yeah, fuck that guy.

524
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,200
Is it a Glasgow?

525
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,200
It's a Glasgow smile.

526
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,200
The Willhelm scream.

527
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,680
Glasgow smile, it's the scars coming out from the mouth.

528
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,760
Isn't it something else though?

529
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:17,680
I think actually Glasgow smile is not a politically correct way of saying it.

530
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:21,160
What I mean is isn't the scars coming out from the mouth a different town smile?

531
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,160
Oh.

532
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,160
I'm going to Google it.

533
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,160
It's not.

534
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,160
Yeah, I'm sure you're right.

535
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,160
You want to know how I got these scars?

536
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:30,160
Was it Glasgow?

537
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,160
Yeah, okay.

538
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:36,160
Let's just take that part off the podcast, please.

539
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:40,160
Thomas being wrong on the podcast.

540
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,160
Leave it in, baby.

541
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,160
Wait, wait.

542
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:47,160
We're not friends if you leave it in.

543
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:52,160
The guy who would wrap the tripwire around his own legs who fell on the ground, he actually

544
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:59,160
pulls out a firearm from his spot laying on the ground and he fires it Clark Bishop.

545
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,160
Doing eight damage.

546
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,160
Holy shit.

547
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:10,760
So he hits you in the chest and one of the arms and maybe the leg as well and you begin

548
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:14,660
bleeding quite profusely and quickly.

549
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:16,160
What hit points are you at now?

550
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,160
18.

551
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,160
All right.

552
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:28,920
And then Stan looks up into the eyes of Keith Vigna and you guys all begin to hear time

553
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:33,180
slow down and you hear the screams of the people.

554
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:35,180
The pace of molasses.

555
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:42,180
The screams of the people who are in the funeral not 30 seconds ago as they're making their

556
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:45,180
way back to the parking lot at an absurd rate.

557
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:47,180
But not anymore.

558
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:48,180
All right.

559
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:49,180
No longer absurd.

560
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:52,180
Oh, also very absurd just in the opposite way.

561
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:54,180
Yeah, absurdly slow now they're running.

562
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,180
It's so dangerous.

563
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:57,180
Why are you running so slow?

564
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,180
You hear his voice in your head say,

565
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:04,180
Silas and Mary Cole were never seen again.

566
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:06,180
Neither was Cornelius Beans.

567
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:14,180
That was the history of contention when my daughter's name was Mia or Leah or Micah or

568
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:20,180
Ben but her name is Ari forever now and our history is different.

569
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:22,180
Mine is now definite.

570
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:30,180
And with that the body of Stan Manstein seems to in one swift instant turn inside out and

571
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:32,180
blip out of existence.

572
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,180
Oh, man.

573
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:35,180
What happens to my fingers?

574
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:36,180
That time, Dick.

575
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:40,180
I need all three of you to roll sanity.

576
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:42,180
Seven.

577
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:43,180
Sane as fuck.

578
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,180
Oh, shit.

579
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,180
I'm going insane.

580
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:46,180
I failed.

581
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,180
I failed too.

582
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:49,180
A 62 on a 21.

583
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,180
And what's your power?

584
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,180
60.

585
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:53,180
Do we all have a mechanic left?

586
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:54,180
I'm at 15 sanity.

587
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:55,180
I rolled a 23.

588
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:57,180
My power is 50.

589
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,180
All right.

590
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:00,180
Clark and Keith both lose one sanity.

591
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:01,180
I'm at 20.

592
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:02,180
I am now at 14.

593
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:06,180
I pop up blind to the pain of the bullets that have ripped through my body and I am

594
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:12,180
charging at the guy who had his legs hogtied on the ground.

595
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:16,180
I'm rushing him and doing whatever I can to kill him.

596
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:17,180
All right.

597
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:18,180
Do you want to?

598
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:21,180
I would like to fire my weapon into his face as I near.

599
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:26,180
Go ahead and roll firearms there.

600
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:28,180
I pass a 20 on an 80.

601
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,180
All right.

602
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:31,180
And roll a D10 for me.

603
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,180
A seven.

604
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:38,180
With him being already on the ground fully hogtied and you sprinting toward him, I think

605
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:44,180
it's perfectly acceptable for you to end this man's life on this turn if you want to describe

606
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:45,180
that.

607
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,180
It's legal, baby.

608
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:53,180
You guys would see rage over my face as I bum rush this guy and I'm firing as I'm

609
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,180
running.

610
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:59,180
And even as I come to a stop over his body, I just keep firing into his head, maybe screaming.

611
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:13,180
And as you're firing into this head, you hear this like, and like all of these wires

612
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:16,180
are flying and all these sparks are flying around.

613
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:23,180
And this man's, I mean, not a man, it's like an android head just kind of like peels

614
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:27,180
open to all the bullets that are flying through it.

615
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:32,180
Something has exploded in it from the inside almost the way it peels out in every single

616
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:37,180
direction of skin and viscera and metal and wires.

617
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:41,180
And you look down satisfied.

618
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:44,180
We're going to exit round combat.

619
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:47,180
What if I want to fire on the civilians running away?

620
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:50,180
I had a final move, sort of.

621
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,180
It's pretty minor.

622
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:56,180
Can I clarify, maybe I just missed this, the bullets that went through the back of John

623
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:59,180
Lee Pettymore, were they from the guy on the ground?

624
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:02,180
I thought we had an unknown assailant still shooting at us.

625
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:04,180
They did not come from the guy on the ground.

626
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:05,180
But we're not in combat.

627
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,180
That is correct.

628
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:07,180
Okay, cool.

629
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:08,180
I'm glad I clarified.

630
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:09,180
I dig it.

631
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:10,180
I think my question is related to that.

632
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:16,180
John Lee Pettymore looks up to the top of the mausoleum where Rosemary was perched

633
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:20,180
earlier, and he sees absolutely nothing.

634
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:22,180
Okay, so, yeah.

635
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:24,180
So we're no longer in combat.

636
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:26,180
What do we see when we look around?

637
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:30,180
First off, the sun is a little bit higher in the sky now.

638
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:33,180
The fog has slightly dissipated in this cemetery.

639
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:37,180
The smell of crawfish is still potent as ever.

640
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:41,180
The people who are attending this funeral are gone.

641
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:50,180
The only bodies standing around are Clark Bishop, Keith Vigna, Kevin, and the corpses

642
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:55,180
of these large men who are half robot, half human.

643
00:33:55,180 --> 00:34:00,180
I want to go over to the casket and see if Ari is actually in there.

644
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:02,180
Ari is actually in there.

645
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:03,180
Okay.

646
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:09,180
Clark regains some composure and whips around on Kevin and holds him at gunpoint.

647
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:11,180
Hey, who are you?

648
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:15,180
As you do this, I walk up next to Kevin and stand there.

649
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:16,180
Like on his side?

650
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:17,180
Yeah.

651
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:19,180
Oh, I don't lower the gun.

652
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:21,180
Keith, what are you doing?

653
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:23,180
I have my hands down at my side.

654
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:24,180
I'm just listening.

655
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:25,180
I look at you.

656
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:26,180
Kevin looks at you.

657
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:28,180
He says, bubblegum tree.

658
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:29,180
How do you know that word?

659
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:30,180
How do you know that word?

660
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:33,180
Why are you wearing an old contention PD uniform?

661
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:34,180
Who are you?

662
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:35,180
I'm Clark Bishop.

663
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:37,180
Why are you alive?

664
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:40,180
I don't, Keith, I don't know.

665
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:41,180
Keith, why are you alive?

666
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:43,180
I kind of know why Keith's alive.

667
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:45,180
Actually, I do know why you're alive.

668
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:46,180
I'm a little bit.

669
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:51,180
Maybe you could tell me then because I don't know.

670
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:55,180
Well, it's a little complicated.

671
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:57,180
Real quick, bubblegum tree?

672
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,180
Bubblegum tree.

673
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,180
Bubblegum tree.

674
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,180
What's Keith doing with his weapons?

675
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:03,180
My gun's back in my pocket.

676
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:05,180
Everybody bubblegum tree and let's put our guns down.

677
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:07,180
Is that all right?

678
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:10,180
I stare them down a little longer than you probably want,

679
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:12,180
but I do start to.

680
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:13,180
You can see I'm moving my guns down.

681
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:15,180
I start to put them down.

682
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,180
Okay, I holster my gun.

683
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:18,180
I holster mine.

684
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:24,180
I put mine in my pocket that is way too big for me.

685
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:27,180
Yeah, we could tell you were authentic, Keith.

686
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:32,180
Also, you guys would have noticed that I am no longer

687
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:35,180
wearing my contention PD uniform.

688
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:39,180
I'm wearing a way too small orange polo and three times

689
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:45,180
too big teal frat boy pants and Sperry's.

690
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,180
Nice.

691
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,180
I was apprised of that.

692
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:49,180
What are Sperry's?

693
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,180
Like butt shoes?

694
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:51,180
Gotcha.

695
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:53,180
I actually, yeah, I knew that as well.

696
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:54,180
Yeah, so I.

697
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:56,180
It was very in character as far as I was concerned.

698
00:35:56,180 --> 00:36:02,180
My very tiny, powerful gun slips right into these huge.

699
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:05,180
Right into your Sperry's.

700
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:07,180
Right into my big, big old pocket.

701
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:08,180
All right.

702
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:10,180
Now that we've all bubble gum treed,

703
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:14,180
let's talk about what's happened to us in the preceding 12 hours.

704
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:17,180
Clark is still really side-eyeing you.

705
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:18,180
He's right in front of you.

706
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,180
Yeah, he's.

707
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:20,180
And I turn.

708
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:21,180
He's turned his head.

709
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:23,180
So he's side-eyeing you.

710
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:25,180
I can't even look at you.

711
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:29,180
But yeah, I am side-eyeing you as I talk to Keith.

712
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:32,180
Keith, do you know this guy?

713
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:33,180
Well.

714
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,180
Do you remember who he is?

715
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:35,180
We saw him.

716
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:36,180
He killed me.

717
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:38,180
Clark goes back for his gun.

718
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:44,180
But I owe his organization my life.

719
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:46,180
His organization?

720
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,180
The Glass family.

721
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:52,180
Clark, can I talk to you without Keith?

722
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:55,180
Actually, I go over to the crawfish pot.

723
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:59,180
I just pull Clark aside if he'll let Kevin do that.

724
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:00,180
I gesture like, hey man.

725
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:04,180
Yeah, if you gestured, I would cautiously go.

726
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,180
Hey, Clark.

727
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:08,180
Hey man, bubble gum tree, bubble gum tree.

728
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:11,180
Can't wait to talk for a minute.

729
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:12,180
Yeah.

730
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:14,180
How do you know that word?

731
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:20,180
Well, because I was John Lee Pettymore.

732
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:21,180
Listen.

733
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:24,180
What does that mean?

734
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:25,180
Right?

735
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:26,180
Yeah.

736
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:35,180
So I found out that John Lee Pettymore is more of a state of mind than just a single

737
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:36,180
individual.

738
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:37,180
Clark.

739
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:38,180
Wow, man.

740
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:40,180
This is going to be hard to explain.

741
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:49,180
Basically, my daddy, whom I thought was slain by the DEA on his weed farm, turns out he

742
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:56,180
was just lobotomized and he's been Marvin Glass's head of security for a while now.

743
00:37:56,180 --> 00:38:00,180
And when I died, turns out I wasn't John Lee Pettymore.

744
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:04,180
I was some kind of alien squid being or something.

745
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:09,180
But I sucked out of my brain and I left my body and I went into his.

746
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:11,180
Clark is slack-jawed.

747
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:12,180
Squid?

748
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,180
Squid something?

749
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:14,180
What was that?

750
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:15,180
Or mechanical.

751
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:16,180
I don't really know.

752
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:24,180
All I know is I felt myself leave John's body and insert myself into my daddy's body.

753
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:26,180
And now I'm him.

754
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:30,180
You believe me, right?

755
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:31,180
Clark doesn't.

756
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:35,180
Ask me something only John Lee Pettymore would know.

757
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:39,180
So Joe was just going through his notebook to try to find a good thing like that.

758
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,180
Oh, I know.

759
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:41,180
Okay.

760
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:42,180
Me and John.

761
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:44,180
We got called out and we were in a suburban neighborhood.

762
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:45,180
Yeah.

763
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:46,180
And something terrible happened.

764
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:49,180
Can you tell me what the terrible thing that happened with the vacuum?

765
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:50,180
Yeah.

766
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:54,180
Those kids, they got hit by the goo.

767
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:55,180
Yeah.

768
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:56,180
Yeah.

769
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:58,180
And then we didn't tell nobody about it.

770
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:00,180
John, what the fuck?

771
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:02,180
And I hugged you in front of me.

772
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:03,180
Watch my scars.

773
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:04,180
Watch my scars.

774
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:07,180
Thomas, roll alertness for me real quick.

775
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:09,180
68 on a 60.

776
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:12,180
Nothing seems out of the ordinary.

777
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:13,180
Damn it.

778
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:20,180
I told this all to a false Clark.

779
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:23,180
If I passed the role, I would have known.

780
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:26,180
He hugged a little harder than Clark Bishop ever would.

781
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:31,180
As I'm hugging, I'll call you John now, the Kevin body.

782
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:34,180
I kind of whisper in your ear as I'm hugging you.

783
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:37,180
Maggie's alive.

784
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:39,180
That can't be.

785
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:43,180
John, I just spent the afternoon with, with, with her.

786
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:44,180
Chief's alive.

787
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:48,180
I'm fucking working for her now, man.

788
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:50,180
She knows about this stuff.

789
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:53,180
Hey man, here's an ocean.

790
00:39:53,180 --> 00:40:00,180
I think the chief died, but I think there's other us's.

791
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:04,180
Do you know what I saw?

792
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:22,180
I saw your body broken on the ground, shattered, but an old you, an old Clark came by and was

793
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:26,180
whispering some shit over that body.

794
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:31,180
These two weird brothers kind of distracted me from investigating further, but there was

795
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:33,180
another you running around contention.

796
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,180
I remember that.

797
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:36,180
Is this the same Maggie?

798
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:38,180
You know, it's Maggie.

799
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:42,180
Is it our Maggie?

800
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:44,180
I mean, I thought so.

801
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:46,180
She, she knew me.

802
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:49,180
We talked about her and me.

803
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:52,180
I wink and I say, I know you, but I'm not John.

804
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:54,180
And I draw my gun.

805
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:55,180
I'm just kidding.

806
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:56,180
Oh shit.

807
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:57,180
Wait.

808
00:40:57,180 --> 00:41:06,180
So you saw me, you saw me dead because I'm not dead.

809
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:08,180
Now you were as dead as Bob.

810
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:10,180
Oh, I lift up.

811
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:23,180
I lift up my shirt and show you what's beneath and you see a hole through my chest, essentially

812
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:26,180
where my heart should be.

813
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:27,180
You can see through it.

814
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:32,180
It says if I had a piercing there, like the skin is all healed around it.

815
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:34,180
It's like a tunnel through my, through my body.

816
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:35,180
How big is the diameter?

817
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:36,180
Oh, fist.

818
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:37,180
Yeah.

819
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:38,180
I stick my fist through there.

820
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:39,180
I did that too, John.

821
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:41,180
It feels weird.

822
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:42,180
John.

823
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:44,180
I don't, I don't have a heart.

824
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:49,180
Well, that was your one weakness beforehand.

825
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:52,180
My weakness was I didn't have a daddy, but now I am a daddy.

826
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:53,180
So I think we're just getting stronger.

827
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:54,180
John.

828
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,180
I'm happy for you.

829
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:56,180
I think.

830
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,180
Yeah.

831
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:58,180
I mean, my back is sore.

832
00:41:58,180 --> 00:41:59,180
I'm older.

833
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:00,180
My knees kind of hurt.

834
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:03,180
My penis is not as big, but it's not broken.

835
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:10,180
So it's kind of a good trade off up until a few minutes ago when I got shot three times,

836
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:12,180
I felt like a million bucks.

837
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:13,180
Oh yeah.

838
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:14,180
I got shot too.

839
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:21,180
As you guys show your bullet wounds to each other that are just bleeding with no mechanical

840
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,180
disadvantage for you, apparently.

841
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:26,180
Isn't that nice?

842
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:27,180
John.

843
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:35,180
I mean, I don't know why I'm alive, but I woke up with my own heart in a bag and I ran

844
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:42,180
into Maggie and John, I got to tell you, I'm, I'm working for some people now.

845
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:47,180
They call themselves the circle of knowledge.

846
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:50,180
Uh, Clark says it like that cause he feels like it's a mysterious thing.

847
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:52,180
John rolls his eyes.

848
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:53,180
Kevin.

849
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:54,180
Sorry.

850
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:56,180
Kevin rolls his eyes.

851
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:58,180
I think we can call you John.

852
00:42:58,180 --> 00:43:00,180
You're technically John Lee Pettymore.

853
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:06,180
Uh, Maggie's part of them and so it was her dad and we went to a, well guess where they

854
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:07,180
are?

855
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:08,180
The mill.

856
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:09,180
Yeah.

857
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:10,180
That makes sense.

858
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:12,180
What was going on with the foot meat?

859
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:13,180
We didn't get to that.

860
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:14,180
That's a good one.

861
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:15,180
Although maybe.

862
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:17,180
Well, Maggie, does she have a foot?

863
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:18,180
Did Maggie have a foot?

864
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:20,180
You didn't notice her not having a foot.

865
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:21,180
Okay.

866
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:26,180
Uh, she, as far as I remember, she had both of them feets.

867
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:28,180
That, that seems like a thing you would have observed.

868
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:30,180
So I trust you.

869
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:31,180
Wait, hold on.

870
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:33,180
That was too Batman.

871
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:38,180
Let's see how I trust you.

872
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:39,180
Good.

873
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:42,180
You need, you need both feet and nobody wants a feet getting it.

874
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:44,180
I said it two times.

875
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:45,180
Am I going to say it again?

876
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:46,180
Getting it.

877
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:47,180
Getting it.

878
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:51,180
Do you remember and see Keith Vigna just eating some of the crawfish that's in the

879
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:53,180
boil in front of the coffin?

880
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:54,180
I just figured.

881
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:55,180
Yeah, that sounds right.

882
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:58,180
I also have some things that I should probably tell both of you.

883
00:43:58,180 --> 00:43:59,180
Yeah.

884
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:01,380
I was going to say, do you, wait, okay, hang on.

885
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:02,620
How was I pointed Keith?

886
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:03,620
How's he alive?

887
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:04,620
Okay.

888
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:05,620
You remember Charlie?

889
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:08,740
Uh, Charlie was Rosemary's partner.

890
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:09,740
Charles Donovan.

891
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:10,740
Charles.

892
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:11,740
Yeah.

893
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:12,740
Donovan.

894
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:13,740
Yeah.

895
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:19,100
Me and this forum, we all have some body modifications that help us.

896
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:21,760
Well, Rosemary wasn't sure she could die.

897
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,800
She was kind of freaked out that Charles died.

898
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:27,000
She told me that today, but Keith has the same scars.

899
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
What all of us have.

900
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,760
I don't know if we have arm rockets like that robot.

901
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:32,760
Let me check it out.

902
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:35,180
I try to shoot her my hand.

903
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:40,740
It's that scene where Tobey Maguire is like, go web, go.

904
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:41,740
It's been a long time.

905
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:42,740
He shoots the web, right?

906
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:45,620
All right.

907
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:46,620
Not in that one.

908
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:48,380
Stand back.

909
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:51,500
And I just hold my arm out and nothing happens.

910
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:52,500
Nevermind.

911
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:57,700
Oh, so we don't seem to have, we don't, we're not inspector gadgets, but it seems like we

912
00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:00,420
have some combat, some body modifications.

913
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:04,100
What make us stronger?

914
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:05,100
So that's cool.

915
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:13,220
But anyway, I saw some, some figures with funny shaped sides, dragging Keith off Marvin

916
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:16,720
Glass said that we turned them into the new Charles.

917
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,220
So they made them a murder machine.

918
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:24,640
I think of some variety of my variety of Rosemary's variety, but not of the robot variety.

919
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:28,760
So you, you don't have, are you, you have metal in you, John, are you medley?

920
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:29,980
I try to shoot my hand again.

921
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:33,180
I'm really like straining.

922
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:38,540
No, unfortunately I don't think so.

923
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:43,380
However, when you, when you look at some of the wounds that you have taken, there is some

924
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:46,500
metal underneath your skin in some places.

925
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:48,260
Hold on.

926
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:49,260
What about this tink?

927
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:53,460
It actually looks like there's some metal.

928
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:54,460
I see it.

929
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:55,460
Perhaps some you're shiny.

930
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:57,140
Perhaps some mechanized self-healing.

931
00:45:57,140 --> 00:45:58,140
I'm not sure.

932
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:01,700
It looks like a, uh, almost like a, like a, like a dermal layer.

933
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:03,340
That's all metallic.

934
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:05,000
That's cool.

935
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,580
If you're okay with it, that's a, I know that I'm on board with you.

936
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:08,580
That's awesome.

937
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:09,580
Thanks to tell you.

938
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:10,580
Let's talk to that's Brent.

939
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:14,700
That's rope Keith in on this and regarding Marvin glasses, ultimate emissions.

940
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:16,860
I'll tell you what Maggie wants.

941
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:27,660
I've been waiting since December, 2017 to learn that Clark and John walk over to Keith,

942
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:31,020
who is at the crawfish station.

943
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:35,420
I am shoving my, I'm peeling crawfish.

944
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:40,000
I'm hurting my hands cause they're still in the, like whoever was running this crawfish

945
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,900
boil is long gone.

946
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:45,180
So I'm, there's no utensils or anything.

947
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:51,620
So I'm just like quickly dipping my hand into the boiling crawfish water and grabbing crawfish

948
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:54,100
and just slamming them into my mouth.

949
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:55,100
It's our key.

950
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:56,100
That's Keith.

951
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:57,100
It's him.

952
00:46:57,540 --> 00:46:58,540
Yeah.

953
00:46:58,540 --> 00:46:59,540
The proof is there.

954
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:05,660
Guys, maybe, I mean bubble gum tree, but now I'm going to say crawfish boil.

955
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:06,660
Anyway.

956
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:07,660
Yeah.

957
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:10,380
So I've, I've got just shit all over my face.

958
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:24,020
I've been really, I've got, I'm like, no, I've got just crawfish, you know, like shell

959
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:27,540
on my face and just spices and everything.

960
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:32,500
Cause I mean, you guys were talking over there for a minute, so I was just going to town

961
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:33,500
on this.

962
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:36,500
My, my, also my fingers are like, they're very red.

963
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:42,020
I'm going to take one hit point of, of damage.

964
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:45,780
I'm going to do that for the sake of the, what does that put your hit points at?

965
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:46,780
I'm zero.

966
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:59,620
I am currently at 25 out of 25, so I'm just for the sake of that bit, I'm taking one.

967
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:00,620
All right.

968
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:01,620
That's going to end like six months.

969
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:07,980
We're going to be like, you motherfucker, it's going to come back to bite you so hard.

970
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:08,980
Oh fuck.

971
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:09,980
Yeah.

972
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:15,340
So my fingers hurt, but I am pleased with this crawfish boil.

973
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:16,340
Yeah.

974
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:22,540
To Keith and I look at you and I'm just peeling a crawfish open and Keith, do you, do you

975
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:24,580
know who, who, who this is?

976
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:27,460
And I gestured to the guy standing there with us.

977
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:30,460
I mean, I give an awkward smile in a way of Kevin.

978
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:31,460
That's Marvin's body.

979
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:32,460
Oh, okay.

980
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:36,860
I walk up to Keith and I get right by his ear and I whisper in his ear.

981
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:39,860
I'm like, I know what you did to my Smokies.

982
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:42,040
Now, now do you know Keith?

983
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:44,660
And I punch him in the gut.

984
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:52,080
I spit out the crawfish that's in my mouth.

985
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:57,100
When you said bubblegum tree, I thought maybe John Lee Pettymore had told you to say that,

986
00:48:57,100 --> 00:49:02,500
but only John knows about the Smokies.

987
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:10,500
I get back up from you punching me in the gut and I look at you and I give you a hug.

988
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:13,860
So did I.

989
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:21,320
And I look at Clark and I look over at John Lee Pettymore and just a big, big smile comes

990
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:22,320
across my face.

991
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:25,800
I'm like, boys, we did it.

992
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:30,800
Listen boys, it's not quite over yet.

993
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,160
I learned a little bit.

994
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:34,160
Marvin Glass.

995
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:36,660
This is all some business play to him.

996
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:40,480
He wants to demolish contention so we can have a land.

997
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:47,020
At least it's what I extrapolated from what I heard, but we're not done yet boys.

998
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:48,660
We got to save the town.

999
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:51,420
John, it might be even bigger than the town.

1000
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:57,020
Hey, uh, hey Keith, Maggie, she's, she's still alive.

1001
00:49:57,020 --> 00:50:01,440
No, I saw her dead with my own two eyes.

1002
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:03,420
I saw you dead with my own two eyes, Keith.

1003
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:06,200
I saw you both dead with my own two eyes.

1004
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:08,180
Also now I'm in another body.

1005
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:10,180
Somebody else's eyes.

1006
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:16,440
Well, boys, we have been through some of the weirdest shit ever, so you know, I believe

1007
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:17,440
it.

1008
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:18,440
What's she doing?

1009
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:19,440
What's she into?

1010
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:20,980
Well, how's she?

1011
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:22,160
She showed me things.

1012
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:23,160
Maggie did?

1013
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:24,160
Our babies.

1014
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:25,160
Slap.

1015
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:26,160
No.

1016
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:31,840
You got some Kevin still left in you.

1017
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:37,680
She showed me this, as I'm describing this to you guys, uh, any kind of a joviality about

1018
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:41,660
running into you guys again, a freaked out in this and anything like that is washing

1019
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:46,540
away from my face and it's mortal terror as I describe.

1020
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:57,940
She showed me a creature I'd never, it wasn't boys, it's a, we got it.

1021
00:50:57,940 --> 00:50:58,940
We got to stop it.

1022
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:03,060
It's a, I can't just, I can't describe it.

1023
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:05,500
I start to, I start to cry a little bit.

1024
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:08,080
It, it wants, it wants this.

1025
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:15,160
It wants, I don't, I put my, I put my hand on Clark's shoulder, squeeze it kind of too

1026
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:17,600
hard and I'm like, just tell us what you saw.

1027
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:19,740
I take two steps back from the group.

1028
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:23,160
It's a Maggie works for a group.

1029
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:25,040
I, I work for a group now.

1030
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:33,440
It's their only mission is to make it make what I saw not be a thing and boy, if you'd

1031
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:35,920
got seen it too, you would have, you would have jumped.

1032
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:38,500
You would have jumped when they said jump.

1033
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:39,540
And that's what I've been doing.

1034
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:41,020
That's what I'm doing now.

1035
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:42,060
She told me I had to kill him.

1036
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:46,460
So I, I came up here out, I shot him as soon as I saw him.

1037
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:48,780
They told you to kill Stan.

1038
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:54,300
She said it would, it would make sure that fucked me over Clark.

1039
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:58,740
Maggie told Maggie told me that, uh, killing Stan would help help make that thing not be

1040
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:00,540
a thing.

1041
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:01,780
So I did.

1042
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:02,940
Do you trust Maggie?

1043
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:09,520
I trust her with my life always have, but after what she showed me, I just know that

1044
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:15,400
she's on the good side, at least as far as making sure that thing isn't, isn't allowed

1045
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:17,640
to do whatever the hell it wanted.

1046
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:24,300
Well, I'm going to tell both of you guys, you might need to be watching my back cause

1047
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:27,840
the glass family is going to be very angry at me.

1048
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:31,280
I don't know that they wouldn't have killed him, but they needed to talk to him.

1049
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:32,280
Yeah.

1050
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:36,700
And the reason I'm still alive is because of the glass family.

1051
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:37,860
They're going to be gunning for me.

1052
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:44,160
I think what, what I was, I was tasked Marvin glass rebuilt me.

1053
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,060
I died.

1054
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:50,300
The only reason I'm here right now, when I'm looking at him physically, do I see any metal

1055
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:55,660
when I'm telling you this, I ding on my head and you just hear metal.

1056
00:52:55,660 --> 00:52:56,660
It was creepy though.

1057
00:52:56,660 --> 00:53:00,380
We actually heard metal.

1058
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:06,360
I point between you and uh, Kevin, John, KJ, he's got metal to Keith.

1059
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:09,920
I mean, we're not invulnerable, but we're less vulnerable.

1060
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:11,440
I think, I think there's metal things.

1061
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:12,440
Pretty cool.

1062
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:16,100
I told him I've got a gnarled old voice now.

1063
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:19,600
I'm like Sam Elliott and roadhouse.

1064
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:20,600
I'm me-o.

1065
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:39,380
Did, did you not get a sexier upgrade?

1066
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:45,420
I just, I hold my left hand up like this and I kind of do a fake fake gun in the air and

1067
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:48,460
I'm like, I got a pretty sexy upgrade.

1068
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:49,760
I'll tell you about that later.

1069
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,240
Are you a gun hand?

1070
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:52,240
Nope.

1071
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:55,540
A gun of sorts, but we'll get to that later.

1072
00:53:55,540 --> 00:53:56,540
What sorts?

1073
00:53:56,540 --> 00:53:57,540
You're being shut up.

1074
00:53:57,540 --> 00:53:58,540
You're being mysterious.

1075
00:53:58,540 --> 00:54:05,080
I was supposed to bring Manstein back to Marvin glass and that would absolve me from any debt

1076
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:07,460
to him for rebuilding me.

1077
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:14,720
So I'm on your guys's side, but we might have some trouble coming after us.

1078
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:17,560
I've, I've got two things to say.

1079
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:24,260
The first, I'm not sure who saw me in this recent kerfuffle.

1080
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:27,620
I don't know if anybody knows who I was shooting at, but I might be able to.

1081
00:54:27,620 --> 00:54:28,800
Are you okay?

1082
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:34,540
By the way, what I mean is if, if we make me less okay, one of you like shoots me in

1083
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:39,180
the leg or something, I might be able to go back and infiltrate the glass organization.

1084
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:41,580
I'm not sure how much Rosemary saw.

1085
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:45,000
I mean, Keith, I talked to Maggie.

1086
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:52,260
I asked her if I could bring you guys into the fold and she says she would trust me.

1087
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:57,540
And if I trusted her and that if I thought you guys could handle it, she's offered to

1088
00:54:57,540 --> 00:54:59,100
put me up in the middle.

1089
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:00,620
She says she could protect me.

1090
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:05,180
Keith can't handle it.

1091
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:08,900
I told her she, she, she asked if I thought you guys could handle it and I said, you'd

1092
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:10,540
seen the same things I had.

1093
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:17,840
Well, what I told Marvin Glass leaving his compound was that I would bring Stan back

1094
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:20,120
to him for questioning.

1095
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:25,200
Now that that is not an option, I became a cop for a reason.

1096
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:28,680
I want to do good by people.

1097
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:37,220
And if you think that is the option that is good, I fully want to join you.

1098
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:41,960
I'm just warning you, we're going to have some real bad people after us.

1099
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:45,140
With or without you, Glass is going to be after us.

1100
00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:48,080
That doesn't put any more burden on our shoulders, I don't think.

1101
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:49,760
Well then let me come with you.

1102
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:50,760
Yeah.

1103
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:51,760
Hey, come on.

1104
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:52,760
Come on.

1105
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:53,760
Come on.

1106
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:56,000
Let's go kill Marvin Glass.

1107
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:00,160
Whatever the fold is, I want to be brought into it if you think it's good.

1108
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:01,600
Marvin Glass is after you.

1109
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:03,720
Marvin Glass is going to be after all of us.

1110
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:05,560
Our duty is to stop him.

1111
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:10,100
We've been a team for so long, why stop being a team now?

1112
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:11,500
Teamwork make the dream work.

1113
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:15,900
What if the real contention police department was the friends we made along the way?

1114
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:16,900
I wrote that.

1115
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:19,300
That is amazing.

1116
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:20,580
So I always liked you, Clark.

1117
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:21,580
You're so smart.

1118
00:56:21,580 --> 00:56:26,500
Well, I guess here's what I'll tell you is that Maggie, she told me that this was my

1119
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:31,260
mission for today and that after I completed it, I could kind of do what I needed to for

1120
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:32,260
a while.

1121
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:35,060
She actually told me to get my affairs in order and contention so that I could move

1122
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:36,580
up to the mill with them.

1123
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:37,900
So I got some time.

1124
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:39,280
I could touch base with her.

1125
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:41,880
Are you planning on going back to contention?

1126
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:44,280
Because guys, I haven't told you this yet.

1127
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:51,960
I had tens of missed calls from Drew and a voicemail that basically said, get as far

1128
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:53,720
away from contention as you can.

1129
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:58,060
Well, I'll tell you my tentative plan was to get back to my place and grab all the guns

1130
00:56:58,060 --> 00:57:02,800
and things that we confiscated from my garage and I was going to just move shop up to the

1131
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:03,800
mill.

1132
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:04,800
Get objects and whatnot.

1133
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:07,960
Get everything back in the place.

1134
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:10,720
We had the camera in the car.

1135
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:12,720
It's not in there anymore.

1136
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,800
I don't know where the gun is.

1137
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:15,800
We had the camera in the car?

1138
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:16,800
Yeah.

1139
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:21,840
I brought it with me cause I thought maybe around, you know, I think one o'clock it might

1140
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:25,400
be working, but it's not in there anymore.

1141
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,160
Did we have the gun in the car?

1142
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:28,160
Yeah, we did.

1143
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:29,440
And the gun's gone too.

1144
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:30,440
It's not in there anymore.

1145
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:32,300
Well, the gun we know who has it.

1146
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:35,700
We brought it up to the meeting, so it's whoever was in that room.

1147
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:36,700
Right?

1148
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:37,700
Yeah.

1149
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:38,700
That's right.

1150
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:39,700
But the camera, it's not in there anymore.

1151
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:40,700
Right.

1152
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:45,340
We might need to run back to the police station and your house to get all this stuff, but

1153
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:50,620
I'm really fingers crossed hoping that at least the helmet and the jukebox is still

1154
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:51,620
there.

1155
00:57:51,620 --> 00:57:52,620
The radio.

1156
00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:53,620
The radio.

1157
00:57:53,620 --> 00:58:00,440
I've got an ocean and you just see, um, Kevin Lee, Patty Moore, he puts his, he puts his

1158
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:04,760
hands to his head and his eyes just kind of go white.

1159
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:06,760
Oh shit.

1160
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:07,760
John.

1161
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:08,760
John.

1162
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:09,760
John.

1163
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:38,080
How am I the only one trying to fool Oh, how can you have my hand

1164
00:58:38,080 --> 00:59:04,400
How can you have enough drowning out All I know is there's no more to go
