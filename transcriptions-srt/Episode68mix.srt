Charles Digby Roger and Angela Fairfield Walter and Alan Grimes and Bradley Cooper

30
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:53,100
met with James the executive director of calm comfy campground during

31
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:58,300
orientation a game of two truths and a lie got a little out of hand the group

32
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:03,500
was then led to the boathouse to meet Jack Russell the boatman he was an odd

33
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:08,820
guy who warned the group to never go out alone in a canoe on the brackish water

34
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:14,200
of Lake calm the past doesn't seem nearly as fucked as the present I bet it

35
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:19,560
definitely stays that way no way things get weirder and weirder and spin out of

36
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:27,640
control nope so stay calm friends stay comfy turn yourselves down but turn up

00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,200
Oh

39
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:11,440
hey Thomas Isaac so Bradley Cooper is standing with a key in hand it's just us

40
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:15,480
you can call him Martin Cooper you're so right Martin Cupertino is standing

41
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,960
key in hand to cottage number five and you're standing right in front of this

42
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:24,880
beautiful little cottage you've walked down those same kind of a cobblestone

43
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:31,480
path to get to your cottage and it is by itself secluded by all these trees and

44
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:36,320
bushes and stuff and it's in a little opening space it's quite lovely and

45
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,840
there's a front door with a window to the side and you are home for the

46
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:47,840
weekend he eyes it all up and kind of huffs and says cozy and goes in yeah and

47
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:54,480
when you walk in it is equally cozy inside there is a fireplace and it's

48
00:04:54,480 --> 00:05:01,600
fully decorated in a sort of like not quite lake house kind of decorations a

49
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:08,600
little bit higher level but it's still rust yeah yeah and so your bags are up

50
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:14,960
in your room which is on the second level and it's a loft by itself up a

51
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,480
staircase and there's a bathroom attached and then downstairs there's

52
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:22,600
like a living room there's a little study and there's a kitchen I prepare a

53
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:27,640
small meal of fresh fruits and vegetables that I bought at a local

54
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:32,680
market before I came here and while those are simmering I'm meditating on

55
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:37,000
the floor but not very well because I'm paying attention to the cooking

56
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,080
vegetables what is your mind keep wandering to when you're trying to

57
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:49,120
meditate I told him I told him it had to be white but I think it should be ivory

58
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:55,080
it's got to be ivory god damn it that and the smell of the cooking vegetables

59
00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:01,080
but he's trying to just focus on breathe just breathe Martin breathe in and out

60
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:10,920
just focus on your breathing ivory would be revolutionary and after he eats the

61
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:17,100
meal he's going to take out a biography of Hannibal Barca the general across the

62
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:22,480
Alps to invade Rome and he's gonna read that for a while and after some time

63
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:26,240
he's gonna kind of look around and see if it doesn't look like things have

64
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,520
quieted down outside and if they have he's gonna make his way down to the

65
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:35,080
boathouse and take a canoe out to the middle of the lake cool so as you're

66
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:39,960
walking around the cottage you come down the stairs after doing a little bit of

67
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:45,160
reading and as you're making your way out to the front door you step on this

68
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:50,240
wood panel beneath you and it is extremely loose to the point to where it

69
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:55,640
almost slides out completely god damn I almost slipped on this slidey and loose

70
00:06:55,640 --> 00:07:01,240
panel I could sue anyway I guess I'll take a look at it though what's

71
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,760
underneath the panel what's underneath the panel who knows but it is definitely

72
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:09,600
a gym bag there's a gym bag hidden underneath this panel you have to grab

73
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:14,440
another panel and move it to the side in order to get the bag up out of there I

74
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:18,440
get the bag up out of there when you get the bag up out of there you open it up

75
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:27,320
and inside it is filled with cash money there's also a passport there are many

76
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:33,720
cassette tapes and there is a map it's a map of the calm comfy campground with

77
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:38,640
Lake calm and then all of the wilderness around it and the map leads to a spot

78
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:45,560
far away from here in the wilderness and it is circled and it says the door

79
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:52,720
there's also bottled water snacks and a syringe that is filled with a clear

80
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:58,160
substance I am going to pocket the map and with a quick visual estimation how

81
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,760
much money do I think is in here at least 10 grand okay I look at the

82
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:09,880
passport the passport is for a man named Jack Russell and you'd recognize the

83
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:17,160
picture as the man who is the boat man I'd recognize those fuzzy cheeks anyway

84
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:25,080
fuzzy cheeks fluffy bags mmm full eyes clear heart of the eyes can't lose looks

85
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,920
like Jack was ready to get out of here in a hurry do the tapes the cassettes

86
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:33,640
have any kind of markings on them any like side a of Jack explains the

87
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:42,640
mystery they're all labeled with like Jack Russell number 532 Jack Russell

88
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:50,860
number 533 Jack Russell 534 Jack Russell 535 was there a stereo a cassette

89
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:55,520
player in my room there's not hmm how many tapes are there how many did I just

90
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:02,560
say it's 64 for four okay pocketable amount yeah I pocket them okay I guess I

91
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:07,440
take the passport to have leverage he doesn't care about the money he just

92
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,080
covers that back up there's also the bottled water snacks and syringe filled

93
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:21,040
with a clear substance what kind of snacks rollos combos bugles and a bunch

94
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:26,280
of nuts and some hard meat okay he takes the nuts and starts snacking on them as

95
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:32,520
he considers his next move yeah they're pistachios without the shell it's kind

96
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:38,000
of thing that's gonna make our country lazy Zach loves pistachios without the

97
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,360
show it hurts my hands X lazy Zach's the kind of thing that's gonna make our

98
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:50,680
country is that is accurate is there an employee parking lot you've seen no cars

99
00:09:50,680 --> 00:10:01,160
how did I get here roll sanity uh-huh I figured it was something like that 51

100
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:08,520
huck on a 50 god damn it oh okay yeah so go ahead and lose one sanity okay as

101
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:16,000
you cannot for the life of you remember getting here you can like vaguely

102
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:21,720
remember being in your car but then like you don't even remember taking a boat to

103
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:26,760
get on the island you were just standing there at six o'clock not the time the

104
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:33,600
position and you don't have any memory of coming to this island if I say gaze

105
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,480
out at the far shore of the lake say it this is maybe look like we're moving oh

106
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:45,040
interesting role some sort of science or survival or anything that you can think

107
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:50,080
of that would be helpful to produce this just intelligence yeah you can roll

108
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:58,840
intelligence okay 31 on a 70 the island does not seem to be moving okay okay

109
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:04,320
there was I didn't notice any stereo or anything at the boathouse no and you

110
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,800
didn't see anything when you're in the lobby or in the meeting room either but

111
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,200
you also haven't been up to Jack Russell's apartment and you haven't been

112
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,560
in the rest of the main house hmm I think I need to go find that Metallica

113
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:21,560
kid maybe he had a Walkman hell yeah do you remember where he was staying no

114
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:26,480
absolutely not no he got his room assignment and left went straight there

115
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,200
okay what would you like to do I put everything back well I take the tapes

116
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:34,240
out I keep the tapes in the map but I put everything else back in the hiding

117
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:40,680
spot okay I go and unlock my luggage and lock the tapes back up inside it and

118
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:46,200
then he's gonna go back down to the boathouse and take his canoe okay sounds

119
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,720
good he's still like he's like this place is weird but I've really got a

120
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:55,280
focus for the launch of cube so I'm sorry for the what the launch of cube

121
00:11:55,280 --> 00:12:02,560
voice in my head cube cube cube it's gonna be huge I've got a launch cube

122
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:10,560
cube Martin Cupertino as you make your way out to the boathouse you are

123
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:16,480
unmolested I'm gonna say something else you do not see anyone on your way out

124
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:22,080
and about and you get to the boathouse and it seems that Jack Russell is up in

125
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:27,200
his apartment and these six canoes are all looking you dead in the face I look

126
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,880
I'm dead back what are you looking at and I grab a life vest and a paddle and

127
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:37,680
I go out on a canoe and you just hear this echo and your back of your head

128
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:43,240
that's why we always sticked it to you in a canoe he actually doesn't hear that

129
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:50,280
echo the the listener might but as soon as he actually heard that the first time

130
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:53,840
he was like very specifically just thinking about like how it did not apply

131
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:59,840
to him are you comfortable on the water he is actually he was a high school

132
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:06,480
swimmer he grew up in California and did did some nature things he really grew up

133
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:11,000
with an appreciation of California's natural spaces and so yeah you know he

134
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,760
knows his way around a canoe all right sounds good so you go out on the water

135
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:21,720
oh god I should have asked for a joint from that girl anyway all I want to do

136
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:28,000
now is row out there's not necessarily a middle of this ring like lake but I'm

137
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,080
gonna go it's a lifesaver it's a lifesaver donut I'm gonna go to the

138
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:37,520
middle part of the ring okay you know the thick of the lifesaver yeah as far

139
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:45,400
from either shore as I can get and I'm gonna paddle out there lean back in my

140
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:51,320
canoe and meditate on cube do you come up with anything I'm starting to second

141
00:13:51,320 --> 00:14:01,440
guess the whole ivory thing I don't know well I'm coming back to cream bone is

142
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:07,280
also an option but that's really close to ivory roll alertness for me yes okay

143
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:17,160
that's not that's a d20 36 39 on a I think I gave myself a little bit here

144
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:24,240
45 oh nice so when you're out there you decide on cream and at that exact moment

145
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:34,040
you hear and looking over you see the tail end of something dip down into the

146
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:42,040
inky black water of Lake calm and you see ripples slowly moving toward you he

147
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:52,480
assumes a karate stance he stands up in the boat which is it's it's kind of

148
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,760
feasible because he's only like five foot seven so yeah it doesn't move it

149
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:01,080
around too much when he stands up there but he's yeah any I'd like to have you

150
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:05,640
rolling athletics yeah honestly it looks like he knows what he's doing what is

151
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:09,700
your athletics I think it's pretty if it's good enough you don't after all 65

152
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:15,200
oh yeah then you are good okay he gets into like an Elvis karate pose and he's

153
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:20,160
like what is this industrial espionage and the lake does not reply he keeps an

154
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:29,480
eye out for a while and then anything nothing cream won't do any respect you

155
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:33,760
get back there and it's still quiet on all fronts so you can put everything

156
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:40,600
back in peace and he does do I see a light on in any of the other cabin we

157
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:49,480
can't really I was like you don't see anyone I hope

158
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:57,160
well and if I leave right after this I hope no one sees me go ahead and roll

159
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,560
stealth for me if you're trying to be sneaky that way I have it for oh he's

160
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:08,040
not honestly he's not no no no he's paying a lot to be here that is yes and

161
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:13,040
it's a goddamn lake trip and he is very confident it's gonna use the lake he

162
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:18,960
knows how to canoe he knows karate he's fine yeah he's gonna go back to the

163
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:22,880
cabin and I'm gonna study that map a little bit does it look like what I

164
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,360
think this place should look like it looks exactly like what you think this

165
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:31,680
place should look like and you see that the trail that was pointed out to you

166
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:36,240
earlier by Jack Russell if you took that trail you would only need to dip off

167
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:41,600
about halfway through the trail to go off trail to get to where it is marked

168
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:48,520
the door okay what are the odds that I brought a Walkman I want to say zero

169
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:53,840
so I'm gonna okay you have a CD player but you don't have any you know that's

170
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:58,280
that player so true yeah yeah you do have a walk with yeah but not the kind I

171
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:03,880
want he gets really annoyed at other people for not being early enough

172
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:12,760
adapters it's 26 years ago give up the times that was a terrible laugh I'd

173
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:20,200
liked it I was really scared fine I'm kind of getting invested in this

174
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:26,640
mystery I guess I do have to find the Metallica kid but but not tonight and

175
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:33,320
right as he says that a little beeper goes off on his on his watch on a

176
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:40,800
digital watch and he's like ooh bedtime and to sleep you go yep he gets into

177
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:46,640
some some really nice pajamas oh hell yeah it's a little incongruous with what

178
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,640
he's been wearing the rest of the day sure but this is this is some good

179
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:55,520
sleepwear high thread count mm-hmm hell yeah

183
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,720
of cottage number nine you've got the key in your hand with the little keychain

184
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,720
hanging down that says number nine right on it and you're staring at this

185
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:31,040
beautiful little cozy little cottage it's in its own little clearing so

186
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:35,080
there's trees all over but yeah there there's an opening for this cottage to

187
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:39,840
be and you've got a front door and a window in the front seems to be a

188
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:44,880
two-story with loft as the second story from what you can tell outside you said

189
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,120
just a window it's not like a nice glass or anything like that it's a nice glass

190
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:53,400
little bay window sure okay I got you I'm getting a picture yeah yeah it's got

191
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:58,800
a chimney brick chimney and when you go in it's equally as like rustic and

192
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:05,240
charming and modern as the main big house was and you see that there is a

193
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:09,680
living room there's a study and there's a kitchen and then when you go up the

194
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:15,120
stairs there's the lofted bedroom with a bathroom attached is the kitchen a fully

195
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,600
fully equipped kitchen it is fully stocked and as you guys are in there

196
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,880
actually Angela starts cooking like immediately she's like I'm just like a

197
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:31,760
little hungry and you notice that as she's moving around the kitchen she

198
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,240
seems to know where everything is she's just like opening up drawers and

199
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,920
grabbing what she needs honey have you ever have you ever stayed here before

200
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:43,880
have you been to the common comfy campground without me no you seem to know

201
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:48,320
your way around that kitchen pretty dang well oh yeah well it's like this kitchen

202
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:53,120
is set up so intuitively it's like everything is where you expect it to be

203
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:58,880
that's that's handy yeah yeah it's wild what do you want what do they got well

204
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:04,600
I'm making just like an omelet with some bacon and I figured maybe maybe some

205
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:10,080
biscuits make it too all right we'll do I'm gonna go and put on my pajamas and

206
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,560
you head off and she continues cooking you can hear kind of humming to herself

207
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:19,520
from upstairs and looking around the bedroom it's just nicely decorated

208
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:24,240
everything is there for you there's I was gonna say there's phone chargers

209
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:29,640
like ready to go but that's silly I was like what's the nicest amenity I can

210
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:34,720
think it's just a phone charger already waiting for you USB outlets everywhere

211
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:42,200
it's fucking sick man and yeah there's a nice big bathroom up there that's

212
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:46,360
attached Roger is changing into some really nice silk pajamas oh hell yeah

213
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:56,080
what color are they gold tight you take your time changing and when you come

214
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:02,000
down she's finishing up cooking I sit at the table okay so I did your eggs in an

215
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,080
omelet like I said I was going to even though like they kind of split like

216
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:10,480
halfway and so I was like I scramble should I omelet I just didn't know so

217
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,840
whatever it's a it's fine and you look down it's a beautiful omelet I was about

218
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:22,680
to ask is she a good cook yeah I'm excited for it says Joe can I get that

219
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:31,320

220
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:36,040
mean thanks I don't I don't know that I did anything in particular but I just

221
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:43,720
thought that you were just so open and ready for the experience and that just

222
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:47,560
means so much to me you know you've talked a lot about me being open and

223
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:52,840
receptive and and as I'm saying this I'm kind of holding my hand out I'm gonna

224
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:58,680
hold her hand in mine it's am I doing the right thing is this is this exactly

225
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:02,680
what you want me to do I'm willing to work on whatever you need me to work on

226
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:09,760
it's just like communication and being being available to talk about anything

227
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:14,560
like I just feel like with your work and everything you just keep everything so

228

bottled up I don't want that for us I understand you you want you want you

229

gonna let her let the sick sick wife sleep maybe talk about that later

277
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:44,080
fucking boom dear but I do want to go downstairs and see if they like you said

278
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,880
there was a study right there's a study what kind of what kind of literature

279
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:52,800
that they have in on the bookshelves there's a vast array of different styles

280
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:59,720
of literature in this study and you can find really maybe anything that you're

281
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:05,240
looking for if it's vague enough I would like the history of the calm comfy

282
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:11,840
campground that's for sure not there yeah no no so Roger audience if you

283
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,240
haven't been able to tell by my actions so far he wasn't exactly the one who

284
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:18,960
decided to go on this trip but now that he's here and he really wants to work on

285
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:23,600
this with his wife he's gonna start to embrace this forestry lifestyle like

286
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:29,760
half of it is self-help well right well yeah I was gonna say that he gets he

287
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:34,120
wants to pull down like a local flora and fauna like textbook you can start

288
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:39,200
reading about the trees and the plants all around this neck of the woods and

289
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:45,400
he's he's kind of settling into an armchair and trying to put himself in

290
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:49,760
the mindset of a guy who's at a campground and he's reading about trees

291
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:57,960
and you're 15 pages in before you fucking falls there's a chance Roger

292
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:10,480
would be really into it he gets 30 pages in and then with that you nod off with

293
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,520
the book just kind of slumping onto your belly as you're sitting in this nice

294
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:18,160
comfy chair I like it

295
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:28,680
hey Luke Kingson oh god thank you that's what yeah I'm sure yes so Walter Grimes

296
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:34,640
is standing outside of cottage number three with his father Alan Grimes who is

297
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:39,200
standing right behind you and the two of you are in this clearing where your

298
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:46,640
cottage is surrounded by all this lush forest green and yeah Alan grabs the key

299
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:51,440
up out of his pocket and is like okay let's go on in and probably call it a

300
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:56,120
night walking in you see a living room there's a study on this floor and

301
00:28:56,120 --> 00:29:00,480
there's a kitchen and then there's stairs that go up to a lofted bedroom

302
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:06,720
that has two queen-size beds and a bathroom attached but where does Alan

303
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:13,320
go Alan immediately heads to the kitchen and just grabs some tea and puts on a

304
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:19,080
kettle I walk over to the refrigerator and I open it up is there anything it is

305
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:24,520
fully stocked as I open the refrigerator I look at Alan and I go father would you

306
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:30,520
like me to prepare you any food that would be fantastic what would you like

307
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:37,120
there's pretty much everything you could ask for in here breakfast eggs and bacon

308
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:41,680
yeah sounds good to me so I pull out three eggs some bacon

309
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:47,360
pour them a glass of milk make an omelet and cook up some bacon yeah and he's

310
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,480
gonna go into the other room and you hear him flick on the TV and start

311
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:55,800
changing channels with his tea while you do that curiously I break off a little

312
00:29:55,800 --> 00:30:01,720
piece of the bacon very crisp by the way I was curious yeah I break off a little

313
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:08,440
piece of the bacon and I put it in my mouth and I chew it I masticate yuck and

314
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:14,160
I attempt to swallow sure and when I swallow it is immediately rejected out

315
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:19,640
of my body not puke but like just sent back into my mouth and I spit it out and

316
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:26,720
in my mind I I think I wish that I could enjoy this like he does and then I bring

317
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:34,160
him his breakfast for dinner as you walk into the room you see that the channels

318
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:38,000
are flipping from channel to channel to channel to channel at a rapid pace at

319
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:45,760
one point Wheel of Fortune comes up sure I see the clue is just things and there's

320
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:52,440
no letters on the board and I immediately guess beer battered rock

321
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:59,640
shrimp and then they spin the wheel and they guess B oh my oh my god that was

322
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:05,680
incredible I wish that this was fun for me as well here you go and he flips to

323
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:10,480
another channel and when it flips to the next channel the picture is a square

324
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:15,920
instead of a rectangle like is the shape of the TV and the square picture is in

325
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:21,600
black and white and it is the living room entryway of a cottage that looks

326
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:27,280
identical to the cottage that you are in so it looks like like video like

327
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:33,320
surveillance surveillance videos what what what is going on I stand there and

328
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:38,800
I just continue looking at the video you see that Bradley Cooper makes his

329
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:44,480
way into frame and seems to step on something on his way to the front door

330
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:49,640
so in the entryway in between the stairs in the front door Bradley Cooper steps

331
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:54,320
on something and immediately looks down and then you see him get down on his

332
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:59,780
knees and he pulls a wooden plank off of the floor looks into it and then he

333
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:03,980
grabs another wood plank and moves it and then he grabs a black duffel bag

334
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:10,340
out of the floorboards and when he opens it you can't quite see what is inside

335
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:15,940
but then he pulls out this piece of paper that is folded up that he kind of

336
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:19,540
looks at for a second refolds it and puts it back and then he grabs four

337
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:25,580
cassette tapes while he does that make me roll something for this but I zoom

338
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:34,400
and enhance with my eyeballs well you get my eyeballs in quotation marks my

339
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:40,340
cameras okay go ahead and roll search

340
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:47,780
seven whole shit okay roll a d10 for okay so add four to that skill so take

341
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:54,220
the time right now to explain to the listeners what the deal is with Walter

342
00:32:54,220 --> 00:33:02,820
Grimes I gave Walter Grimes 30 skill points on almost everything almost every

343
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:08,780
skill except everything except like unnatural firearms and unarmed combat

344
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:12,500
yeah and like heavy artillery and shit like that the yeah but besides that has

345
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:16,340
got 30% and everything and I've told you that every time you roll whether you

346
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:22,480
succeed or fail you learn something and you gain a d10 so right now I've got 30

347
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:32,160
on everything except search I now have 34 and surgery I have a 33 fantastic

348
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:37,360
surgery of all things I think when I was like oh I've got a 30 in surgery they

349
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:40,880
were like yeah Thomas was looking at your character she like what the fuck

350
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:45,400
and then I think he saw that you have 30 on everything yeah that's not right

351
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:51,120
because I don't want to give away I'm a freaking robot I leaned into it a little

352
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:56,840
bit but I'm hoping that they haven't I did say something along the lines of

353
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:03,560
like I have the same hit hips that I was made yeah you definitely made and Joe

354
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:09,200
gave me a look of like God like kind of like oh interest and I was like damn it

355
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:15,800
well we'll see if you wrote it down yeah so you zoom in with your eyes onto this

356
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:21,840
TV screen and somehow the picture clears up enough and where you're looking for

357
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:28,320
you to see that the map that he pulled out is of calm comfy campground and he

358
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:33,660
kind of ran his face the island over the island and the the greenery around the

359
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:38,280
island of the lake and he kind of pointed at a point at the top there can

360
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:42,520
I make a mental note for my character of where he pointed to yeah sure it's in

361
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:49,640
the northeast quadrant of the map you also see him pull out four cassettes and

362
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:56,120
you just see a name on all of them and then a number afterward and it says Jack

363
00:34:56,120 --> 00:35:02,040
Russell number three hundred and and then something now all four of them are

364
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:06,800
three hundred and something Alan looks at you and he's like we got up I guess

365
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:11,640
we should look around to see if there's cameras like that and and this in this

366
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:19,640
cottage I think you might need to look for cameras and I'm going to look

367
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:24,680
underneath the floorboards by the entrance smart so go ahead and roll

368
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:32,680
search 16 oh you pry up some of the floorboards they're not easy to get up

369
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:40,760
but you well I shove my fingers there's like I find one little spot that the

370
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:45,400
floorboards aren't completely touching each other and I shove my entire hand

371
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:54,760
down into it some of my silicone skin rips a bit and blood comes out but then

372
00:35:54,760 --> 00:36:01,880
I have enough grip underneath the floorboard and I pull it up and looking

373
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:06,400
down there you see absolutely nothing and Alan comes up behind you and he's

374
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:12,160
like okay thankfully there are no cameras in this cottage it must just be

375
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:17,320
in that one band-aid oh god oh yes of course and he goes and grabs a band-aid

376
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:20,960
throws it on you and then it's like okay enough of all this nonsense I'm going to

377
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:25,960
bed for the night you did a great job today Walter and I think that you'll do

378
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:29,560
even better moving forward I think we're definitely I think you've convinced them

379
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:33,320
so far and if you can make it through this thing we're on to the next step do

380
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:40,280
you need me to tuck you in yes please I follow Alan to the bedroom he lays in

381
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:50,000
bed and I very mechanically like tuck him in to bed and I place my hand on his

382
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:55,520
forehead good night father I will discontinue soon good night Walter you

383
00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:02,240
can just say you're going to sleep I will go to sleep soon and he is out like

384
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:08,040
a light pretty quick Walter stands there watching him until he goes to

385
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:14,720
sleep he walks out of the bedroom he takes up the floorboard that he had

386
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:20,440
ripped out earlier places it back where it came from kind of like stomps on it

387
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:26,520
to like put it in place yeah and then does a little tour of the house just

388
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:33,960
walking around looking at every little piece of each room he goes next to the

389
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:41,400
door where Alan is sleeping he looks down at his shoes he reaches behind his

390
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:48,560
head and presses on a pressure point shirt on his head the matrix spot and

391
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:57,800
his piercing blue eyes turn to completely black and he's out perfect

392
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:07,640
hey Justin hello so Charles Digby is standing outside of cottage number seven

393
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:11,560
he's got the key in hand with the nice little keychain rubber with the number

394
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:17,040
seven on it says calm comfy campground and looking at this cottage it's quaint

395
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:22,280
cute it's got a little brick chimney and a front door with a window right next to

396
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:26,280
it and the front door is painted red because that's nice how calm is it oh

397
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:31,480
dude it's calm as shit you can't hear anything the only thing that you hear is

398
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:35,720
the wind and looking up you see the beautiful stars above you mildly

399
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:40,160
off-putting there's no sounds out here pretty weird to be honest can you hear

400
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:46,800
crickets no you cannot unsettled so when you go into the cottage you are going to

401
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:51,360
find a living room and that's in the entryway and then back there's a study

402
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:55,240
and there's also a kitchen on the main floor and then up the stairs there's a

403
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:59,440
lofted bedroom with a bathroom attached I'm gonna go to the kitchen and make

404
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:04,720
myself a little cup of coffee for sure anything in it no just black absolutely

405
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:11,400
sad coffee sad coffee my favorite kind personally sad coffee for a sad boy

406
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:16,720
what's Charles thinking about as he's going through here Charles is thinking

407
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:21,640
about just how how he got here he's wondering if this is all a mistake he's

408
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:26,000
not used to opening up to anybody he's thinking about his past relationship and

409
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,840
how she would have enjoyed being at this kind of outdoorsy place and how he being

410
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:35,240
from the city does not particularly enjoy it although he's trying his best

411
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:39,560
with your cup of coffee are you going straight to bed are you the type to take

412
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:44,480
caffeine right before sleep yes this is this is like kind of his nightly ritual

413
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:49,240
gotcha he does the whole like slug down some coffee and then lay down and try to

414
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:54,560
fall asleep let your brain just go yeah it's weird so as you're laying there

415
00:39:54,560 --> 00:40:00,400
staring up at the ceiling ceiling fan going around and round and round five

416
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:05,800
blades on the ceiling fan you kind of like focus your eye on one of them as it

417
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:16,680
goes and then you hear from underneath the bed hello is it like someone the

418
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:20,360

433
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:40,600

436
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:59,760
the fuck wait wait and tries to talk again this is a walkie-talkie so you can

437
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,840
talk all you want who are you what's going on here how did you know I was

438
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:10,000
gonna be here and there's nothing but he puts it on the nightstand next to him

439
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:16,120
anyway nice and lays back down but he's like staring fucking just dead eyes

440
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:21,240
staring at it just waiting kind of you don't turn it off you leave it on yes

441
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:25,240
yeah I'm just gonna leave it on for a while at least until nothing happens and

442
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:29,960
then maybe I'll turn it off to try and get some sleepies eventually but he's

443
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:37,440
very perturbed yeah seemingly was this a young girl's voice maybe it was a young

444
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:43,200
girl's voice interesting is there anything else I could it you can ask

445
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:47,080
anything you want baby welcome to the show did I hear the girl's voice earlier

446
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:51,000
you did not whenever I was okay I assumed I didn't and did I see her with

447
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,960
a walkie-talkie earlier which we did not sing with okay say I might I would I

448
00:42:54,960 --> 00:43:00,240
would assume that this is that I also take my notebook out of the night drawer

449
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:06,360
absolutely take a couple notes of some spooks and then put that back in lay

450
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:12,480
back down even though I'm like kind of adrenal adrenal eyes adrenaline filled

451
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:19,320
with adrenaline got sorry you should say that more when you scare people with

452
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:24,600
your spooky stuff you're right and then just got fucking scared bro and while

454
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:41,480
would I would lay back down kind of just wondering to myself what the fuck was

455
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:45,800
that and just like stare back at the thing but then I think he would be

restless get out of bed look out the window oh and try and look out see if he

461
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:21,360
