00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
Welcome to the Bone Zone, my skeletons.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:09,160
We gather only the finest of bones to provide for y'all.

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,080
Big bones, little bones,

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,560
those super thin weird bones that gross you out

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,840
when you devour a chicken's roasted carcass.

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,120
Them fish bones that people swallow.

7
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:27,960
Corn bones, teeth bones, you know the ones.

8
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:34,080
And I am rattling at y'all live from 694.2 PTBP.

9
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,320
It's your bone daddy, Wolf the dog,

10
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,000
here to make your ear bones quiver

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,280
with otherworldly vibrations.

12
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,920
Something's making my damn bones quiver.

13
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,560
Oh shit, it's this week's Howlin' with Wolf.

14
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:56,200
And this week's HWW comes from Kate in Limestone, New York,

15
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:00,040
who tweeted about the show and tagged at Pretending Pod.

16
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:03,880
A very easy and helpful thing to do.

17
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,640
Go on, do it for ol' Wolfie.

18
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,880
Kate from Limestone, New York writes,

19
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:14,880
I wanna thank the PTBP gang for confirming to my coworkers

20
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,840
that I am exactly as fuckin' weird as they thought.

21
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,360
And shout out to Mickalyn for introducing me

22
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:27,280
to this absolute shit show in my newest hyper fixation.

23
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,880
You're one of the best humans I could know.

24
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,760
I can't wait to hear these idiots fuck up next episode.

25
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:38,240
And remember, they are watching even when you aren't.

26
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,440
Well, I heard from a little producer

27
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:44,040
that it's Kate from Limestone's birthday today.

28
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,320
And you know what that means.

29
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,840
Wait, do y'all know what that means?

30
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm unfamiliar with a birth day.

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,160
And what people do about them.

32
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:57,120
Well, Kate, thanks for writin' in regardless.

33
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,920
And I hope your birthday is one in which things happen

34
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,520
that humans generally desire.

35
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,000
If you wanna write up somethin'

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,420
for your bone-filled wolf to how,

37
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,840
tag at Pretending Pod on Twitter or Instagram.

38
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,640
Tag Pretending to be People on Facebook.

39
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,320
Or even better, write up a five-star review

40
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,360
on the podcast app of your choice

41
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,720
and send us the receipts.

42
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,320
Or even best, write up that five-star review

43
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,720
on whatever app you use and post that garbage

44
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,640
on your socials on Reddit

45
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,280
or on a local coffee shop tech board.

46
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,760
Wherever, just make sure we hear about it.

47
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,700
Now, listen to this.

48
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:43,140
Apparently, a Zatch of some sort

49
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:46,800
took over my airwaves recently, which is...

50
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,000
It's fine.

51
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,960
He at least had some cool news.

52
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,240
The good people here at PTBP will be matching

53
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,280
all new and upgrading Patreon subscriptions

54
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,880
for the month of December.

55
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,120
And they're takin' that doubled amount

56
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,260
and donating it to a crisis cold weather shelter

57
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:09,220
in a place called Springfield, Missouri

58
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:12,360
to help keep the folks in their community warm

59
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,160
during the upcoming winter months.

60
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:19,040
The shelter is openly accepting of all genders,

61
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,240
open on all nights when the temperature is dangerously cold

62
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:27,120
and oh, that's right, they'll also shelter them pets.

63
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,120
So go on, join the Patreon.

64
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,880
Links in the show notes.

65
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,040
Help those pretending to be people boys

66
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,000
help the folks in their community

67
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,640
who are showin' up and doin' the hard work.

68
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,320
Links in the show notes.

69
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,680
Last year, the Patreon went up $400.

70
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,840
We matched that and donated $800 to the shelter.

71
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,480
This year, it's already up over 250 bucks.

72
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,160
We're well on our way to toppin' last year's donations.

73
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,540
Thanks to y'all.

74
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:00,560
Links in the damn show notes.

75
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,160
Plus, available for patrons ear holes,

76
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,880
the 38th exclusive episode is a

77
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:10,260
Contention PD Halloween special called

78
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:13,640
It's the Butterfinger Bandit Keith Beans.

79
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,560
The boys play child versions of their season one characters

80
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,780
to solve a spooky mystery.

81
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:26,780
Now, please ignore, explore, and or adore

82
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:30,240
the spooky nature of my omniscience.

83
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,440
It's time for the news.

84
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,320
Last time, the boys done fucked up.

85
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,040
Big surprise, right?

86
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:44,080
Apparently, that Zach being does a decent recap,

87
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,760
so no need for me to double dip.

88
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:50,360
I'm just here to exalt Alter Girl with

89
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:54,360
My Life is Great and It's All My Fault.

90
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,100
It's all my fault

91
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:03,040
Cause my life is great

92
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,040
And it's all mine

93
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:15,040
Cause my life is great

94
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:19,040
And it's all my fault

95
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:33,040
It's from the meat juice they put in there.

96
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,040
They rung out of horse for it.

97
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,040
Oh, man.

98
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,040
Give me that horse juice.

99
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,040
I'm late to this.

100
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,040
I didn't see the Channel 5 Chad Hanks interview

101
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,040
during White Boy Summer.

102
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,040
It's actually, I get him now, I think.

103
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,040
Like, I understand.

104
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:53,040
Not like, I kind of saw that take coming, I guess, but.

105
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:56,040
Not that he's not an idiot, not that, but like.

106
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,040
Wait, Thomas, put your shirt back on.

107
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,040
No.

108
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,040
Oh, are we recording?

109
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:05,040
Yeah, do the Denzel voice.

110
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,040
30 Seconds of Silence.

111
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,040
Are we fucking?

112
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,040
Did I just say I like Chad Hanks on you?

113
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,040
Did we record that?

114
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,040
Okay, you gotta delete that.

115
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,040
You gotta, you can't.

116
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,040
No, I didn't say I liked him.

117
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:22,040
I said I get what, I get why.

118
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,040
Yeah, you just said you liked him

119
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,040
and you're apologizing for saying you get him.

120
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,040
It was clearly a bit, Your Honor.

121
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,040
So, what do you say?

122
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:33,040
Do I delete all this or do we do 30 Seconds of Silence?

123
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:37,040
If you delete it, it's not relevant enough anymore.

124
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,040
Would have been fucking hilarious.

125
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,040
I think it's up to Joe.

126
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,040
12 months ago.

127
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,040
It doesn't matter that it's out of date

128
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,040
because you opened it with this is,

129
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,040
I'm just now seeing it, but I thought it was funny.

130
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,040
Yeah, I get it was in context for the fact that.

131
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,040
What do you think, Luke?

132
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,040
Do you think it should stay in?

133
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,040
I like Tom Hanks.

134
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,040
Now that we've recovered from that mess,

135
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:00,040
it is episode 18.

136
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:03,040
What's your favorite Colin Hanks appearance?

137
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,040
Orange County.

138
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,040
Yeah, it's a good one.

139
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,040
Don't you think that Tom Hanks knew in his bones

140
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,040
when he named Chet Hanks, Chet Hanks,

141
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,040
that he would be a country music star?

142
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,040
Oh, yeah.

143
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,040
And then this happened.

144
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,040
He didn't see the other way it could go.

145
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,040
They didn't make these kind of Chets back then.

146
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,040
That's right.

147
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,040
The future didn't exist yet.

148
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,040
Yeah.

149
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,040
It was the brand new model.

150
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,040
There was no way to foresee.

151
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:29,040
It's really unfortunate for Chet and the world.

152
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,040
It's unfortunate for Tom.

153
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:35,040
I think Chet is expressing himself to his fullest.

154
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,040
He is living his truest life.

155
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,040
More words of support from Thomas Cox.

156
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,040
I don't support Chet Hanks.

157
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,040
I don't like Chet Hanks,

158
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,040
but after watching an interview,

159
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,040
I get why he is like he is.

160
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:52,040
It's episode 18 of season two,

161
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:55,040
but more importantly, as of three nights ago,

162
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:58,040
we've been recording for five years.

163
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,040
December 1st.

164
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:03,040
And we've been releasing for four years.

165
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,040
That's insane.

166
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,040
Did that one actually happen in November?

167
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,040
Which one?

168
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,040
Releasing.

169
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,040
No.

170
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,040
I think I uploaded three episodes early,

171
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,040
but then we were like,

172
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:16,040
it's December 1st is when it actually officially dropped,

173
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,040
because we started recording on December 1st,

174
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:21,040
and that's when season one starts on December 1st,

175
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,040
because of the calendar.

176
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,040
You have to do that.

177
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,040
Yeah.

178
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,040
That is actual play legal.

179
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:31,040
When Gary Gygax received the original...

180
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,040
Who?

181
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,040
Gary Gygax?

182
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,040
That's a cool name.

183
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,040
That's his name, right, Joe?

184
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,040
Yeah.

185
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,040
Yeah, yeah.

186
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,040
You know who that is, right, Zach?

187
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:47,040
When Gary Gygax received the original rules of D&D from God,

188
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,040
it included that very specific fucking condition

189
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,040
that the day it is today is the day you're roleplaying.

190
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,040
The day it is today is the day that you're roleplaying.

191
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,040
It's what it said on the tablets from Mountain Doom.

192
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,040
Which he had to translate on his own

193
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,040
and no one else could look at the handbooks from God.

194
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:09,040
Are you implying he didn't do it faithfully,

195
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,040
or he did it to some advantage for himself?

196
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,040
I'm saying I think it might all be made up.

197
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,040
Listeners, this is the closest this podcast has ever come to ending,

198
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,040
as I don't know if we can continue on as friends.

199
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,040
Certainly not roleplaying partners after.

200
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,040
Are your guys' hands sweaty?

201
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,040
My hands are the sweatiest they've ever been.

202
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,040
I'm nauseous.

203
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,040
I'm going to have to change gloves.

204
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,040
Don't spill the sweat out of those.

205
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,040
Dude, I was watching Shark Tank

206
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,040
and this one guy was selling this poncho that...

207
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,040
That catches your blood sweat?

208
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,040
That catches your body sweat when you work out,

209
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,040
and the fucking commercials he was showing them.

210
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,040
So you can drink it afterward?

211
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,040
No, it's to help lose body weight

212
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,040
if you're trying to get in a certain weight class or whatever.

213
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:57,040
And some people just like to see how much they sweat.

214
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,040
Yeah, they did this on Jackass.

215
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,040
Would that be his whole...

216
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,040
It was that, but yeah, it was his thing that he was selling.

217
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,040
It's just a heavy sweater.

218
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,040
But in the video he showed of people using it,

219
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:09,040
it was literally people afterwards dumping the sweat out

220
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,040
and it was vile.

221
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,040
I might have said this before on this podcast,

222
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,040
that that's one of the only gags from Jackass

223
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,040
that made me gag in real life.

224
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,040
All the gross shit that they've ever done,

225
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,040
it was something about the sweat suit that got me so grossed out.

226
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,040
It was so disgusting, dude. I hated it.

227
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,040
And then Mark Cuban bought it.

228
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,040
But wait, so is this guy's whole marketing thing?

229
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,040
Is it some people want to see the sweat?

230
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,040
Is that the whole thing?

231
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,040
If Mark Cuban bought it, that means enough people out there

232
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,040
do want to see.

233
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,040
But it was like to lose water weight

234
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,040
if you're like a wrestler or something

235
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,040
trying to make weight,

236
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,040
and then you've got to weigh it.

237
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,040
I've seen people do that,

238
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,040
where they tape off their pant legs and stuff like that,

239
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,040
their sweat pants and stuff,

240
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,040
to just keep it all in there.

241
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,040
One of the guys was like,

242
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,040
how many people is that, though?

243
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,040
That can't be much.

244
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,040
He's like, a lot of people will just buy it

245
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,040
to see how much they sweat and look at their sweat.

246
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,040
It's 13 people, but they're all really rich.

247
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,040
I don't want to say.

248
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,040
Mark Cuban was like, oh no, I totally get that.

249
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,040
I want to point out,

250
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,040
Thomas has been making a face this whole time

251
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,040
like he wants one.

252
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,040
I don't want to, no, no, no.

253
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:13,040
I don't want to say Mark Cuban is an infallible businessman

254
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,040
and never makes mistakes.

255
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,040
That's not why I think

256
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,040
maybe there's something else going on here.

257
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,040
What I think is going on is that

258
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,040
maybe once every season or two,

259
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,040
Mark Cuban will buy a bad product

260
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,040
and then bring that person into his life

261
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:29,040
just to prank his other billionaire friends.

262
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,040
And he funds the idea to a ridiculous amount,

263
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:36,040
but it's really all a Clooney-esque, pretty cruel.

264
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,040
Like dinner for schmucks?

265
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,040
Yeah, it's pretty much dinner for schmucks.

266
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,040
But he shits in the guy's litter box.

267
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,040
Oh my God, what if all the sharks do it?

268
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:46,040
What if one season they fund a schmuck?

269
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,040
I would watch that season.

270
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,040
Oh my God.

271
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:54,040
They have a private schmuck-off

272
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,040
where they see how far they can get the product

273
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,040
they think is the dumbest.

274
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,040
Speaking of charity, for the month of December.

275
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,040
I'll give you a million for one percent.

276
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,040
How's that, Seth?

277
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,040
And a special invitation.

278
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,040
Donations?

279
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,040
Oh, charity?

280
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,040
It starts at home.

281
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,040
That's why.

282
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,040
That's why.

283
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,040
In the month of December,

284
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,040
we're going to take all new and upgrading subscriptions

285
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:18,040
on our Patreon over at patreon.com slash pretending pod

286
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,040
and we are going to match that increase

287
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,040
and we're going to take that double the amount

288
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,040
and we're going to donate it to a crisis cold weather shelter

289
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,040
here in Springfield, Missouri

290
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,040
to help keep people in our community warm

291
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,040
during these cold winter nights.

292
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,040
Got to be able to sleep in the warm.

293
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,040
Yeah, it's only open when it's under 32 degrees.

294
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,040
It takes all genders.

295
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,040
From what we could see when we were doing our research last year,

296
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,040
it seemed to be a really reputable and solid organization

297
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,040
doing really good work in our hometown.

298
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,040
It gets cold here and we're,

299
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:51,040
a farmer's almanac says that we're in for a real cold winter.

300
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,040
Farmers almanac.

301
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,040
What's the thing where you cut it and the inside-

302
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,040
The persimmons, yeah.

303
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,040
Apparently those were showing the spoon shape.

304
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,040
I think that was the thing that tells you it's cold.

305
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,040
Yep, that's how they do it.

306
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,040
Spoon persimmons.

307
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,040
In science land.

308
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,040
We also-

309
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,040
Wait.

310
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,040
What?

311
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,040
We have a very large-

312
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,040
Is that bio-farming?

313
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,040
Yeah.

314
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,040
House-less population in Springfield

315
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:13,040
who are not served very well by our city government

316
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,040
or the state government.

317
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,040
Yeah.

318
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,040
So there's a lot of people who really need it.

319
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,040
Yeah, and it's really rad.

320
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,040
We've got some extremely progressive churches

321
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,040
who have come together to put this together

322
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,040
and we're here to help support people doing good shit.

323
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,040
It's been under 20 degrees-

324
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,040
A lot.

325
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,040
10, 12 times in the past couple weeks here.

326
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,040
I get it.

327
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,040
We should have done it in November.

328
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,040
That's my bad.

329
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,040
No, no, no. I just mean-

330
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,040
It's going to get worse.

331
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,040
It's going to get worse.

332
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,040
It's going to get worse.

333
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,040
It's just going to get worse.

334
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,040
There's a little wrinkle to this one.

335
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,040
Oh, there is a little wrinkle to this one.

336
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,040
I thought we'd try to bump those numbers

337
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:45,040
that way we could send them a fair amount of cash.

338
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,040
We're doing a raffle this time around.

339
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,040
R-r-r-raffle.

340
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,040
Raffle.

341
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,040
You can win.

342
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,040
I hope I win.

343
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,040
He hopes he wins.

344
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,040
I hope I win.

345
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,040
No, I'm saving that for Jesus.

346
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,040
That's right.

347
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,040
Like when he comes back.

348
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,040
When he comes on your back.

349
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,040
Soon.

350
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,040
Yeah.

351
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,040
Soon.

352
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,040
Enter me.

353
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,040
Yeah, you should let Jesus into you.

354
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,040
A resurrection.

355
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,040
Her heart?

356
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,040
There's a left behind joke here.

357
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,040
Res-e-rection?

358
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,040
Is that what you're trying to say?

359
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,040
He just-

360
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,040
A resurrection.

361
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,040
A res-e-rection.

362
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,040
A res-e-rection.

363
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,040
Wow, we're going to have to cut out so much of this fucking-

364
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:29,040
Every $5 newly subscribed or upgraded Patreon subscription will get you one entry into the

365
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,040
raffle.

366
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:33,040
We're going to do three raffle winners at the end of December.

367
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:38,040
Two of you will receive a PTBP t-shirt, any design you want from the merch store or the

368
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:43,040
season one Patreon exclusive merch or the season two Patreon exclusive merch, which

369
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:48,040
we're dropping this month in December and will be available to patrons in January.

370
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,040
And it's really cool.

371
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,040
And it's fun.

372
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,040
It's really fucking cool.

373
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,040
Sick.

374
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,040
Is it though?

375
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:59,040
And we are going to have the third winner either receive a shirt, if you want that you

376
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,040
can have a shirt, or if you'd prefer-

377
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:06,040
You can write a song and we'll use it as the theme song.

378
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,040
I mean, sure.

379
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,040
Should we start doing that?

380
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,040
That's pretty fun.

381
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,040
Yeah, if you'd prefer that.

382
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,040
And it's good.

383
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,040
Hopefully you know how to do that.

384
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,040
If not, we'll be interested.

385
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,040
Oh yeah, don't-

386
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,040
Then get a shirt.

387
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:22,040
Let's please volunteer yourself for second and third place if you can.

388
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,040
Okay, let's do it.

389
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,040
Let's do a different option if they don't want to do the music.

390
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,040
Did we say what they actually get?

391
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,040
No, we haven't said what they actually get yet.

392
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,040
If you don't want to do the music option, we'll make another one up.

393
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,040
Okay, what would be cool?

394
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,040
What if they got to-

395
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,040
They can play in a game with the three of you as their fellow players.

396
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,040
Oh, with the boys?

397
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,040
And I'll run it and it'll be home brewed by me.

398
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,040
Daddy and the boys?

399
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,040
Daddy and the boys.

400
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,040
And they only have to upgrade just like $5 to the entry?

401
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,040
$5 will be in one entry.

402
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,040
To get one entry, which is kind of cool if you're already at the $5 level and you want

403
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:57,040
to see us record those Den of Sins, you can bump up to $15, get yourself two entries.

404
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,040
Speaking of which, in the Den of Sin-

405
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,040
Wait, that already happened.

406
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,040
Nevermind.

407
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,040
Cut.

408
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,040
Oh yeah.

409
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,040
It hasn't happened, but it will have.

410
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:09,040
But if you're a Patreon subscriber at any level, you can enjoy the Patreon exclusive

411
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,040
campaign, the hunt for John Lee Pettymore's gold.

412
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,040
But gold.

413
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,040
But gold.

414
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,040
But gold.

415
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,040
But gold.

416
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,040
But gold.

417
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,040
The hunt for John Lee Pettymore's gold.

418
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,040
I'm but a gold.

419
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,040
Oh, it's not even that.

420
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,040
It's the hunt for John Lee.

421
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,040
The lost treasure of John Lee Pettymore.

422
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,040
Wow.

423
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:31,040
I really wanted it to be gold, but I couldn't find a way to logically think how John Lee

424
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:37,040
Pettymore would convert his cash to gold in the time he had alive in the world.

425
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,040
So it has to just be lost treasure.

426
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,040
But gold would be such a better title.

427
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,040
Anyway, the lost treasure of John Lee Pettymore.

428
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,040
It's a Patreon exclusive campaign.

429
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,040
At any level you sign up for that, you'll get episodes of that, which will be coming

430
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,040
out starting in December and going on for a few months after that.

431
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:58,040
And those are podcast episodes, audio episodes, and that will be the 39th one that we will

432
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,040
release.

433
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,040
So there's 39 bonus episodes over on Patreon.

434
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,040
Go hit that out.

435
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,040
Oh, and one other note.

436
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:07,040
We've got an editor here at Pretending to Be People.

437
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,040
Ooh.

438
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,040
Who is it?

439
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,040
Who is it?

440
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,040
It's our friend and collaborator.

441
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,040
Collaborator.

442
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,040
Collaborator.

443
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,040
Collaborator.

444
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,040
Collaborator.

445
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,040
His name is-

446
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,040
Is it Taylor?

447
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:21,040
No, that's not a name pun.

448
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,040
Nope.

449
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,040
He already is a collaborator.

450
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,040
Am I getting closer?

451
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:33,040
His name is Cole Simmons of Brat Pit and now known as Mint Fatigue.

452
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,040
And also what did he do?

453
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,040
Oh, maybe he wrote some lyrics.

454
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,040
Am I correct?

455
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,040
Music.

456
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:43,040
Or other way around, wrote some music for a certain podcast theme song?

457
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:49,040
I believe he produced and wrote, co-produced and co-wrote the music of our current season

458
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,040
two theme song.

459
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,040
My life is great and it's all my fault by all.

460
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,040
What a good song.

461
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,040
What a great song.

462
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,040
Hell yeah.

463
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,040
Great songs.

464
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,040
Great song for a good podcast.

465
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,040
Good job, Cole.

466
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:04,040
Anyway, so Cole is doing our first initial sweep of the podcast to do a nice edit through

467
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,040
there for me.

468
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:10,040
That way I can come on through and do the little creative edits I like to do afterwards

469
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:13,040
without spending so much of my time editing.

470
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:18,040
And I'm just so happy to have Cole here with us at Pretending to Be People.

471
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:22,240
Cole removes everything problematic we say and then Zach goes back and creatively edits

472
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,040
the things we actually said to make us something problematic.

473
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,040
AI has gotten really, really good.

474
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:28,040
It's a fun little game they like to play.

475
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:31,040
I feel like Cole is in the room with us here in a creepy way.

476
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:35,040
I know Cole in the chilies.

477
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,040
Also our new sponsor, Chilies.

478
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,040
That's enough.

479
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,040
Let's get into this fucking thing.

480
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:44,040
Let's start shouting out aspirational sponsors.

481
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,040
Aspirin.

482
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,040
Aspirin.

483
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:49,040
You can get your aspirational dorm room at Target.

484
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,040
Everything you need for back to school.

485
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,040
Target's a big swing.

486
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:55,040
Which was several months ago.

487
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,040
And coming up, depending on if you're listening to this.

488
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,040
Christmas!

489
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,040
It's Christmas at Target.

490
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,040
It's Christmas at Target.

491
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,040
You hear those sleigh bells?

492
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,040
Ding-a-ding-ding-ding-a-ding.

493
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,040
What do we have?

494
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,040
Fucking 45 minutes of bullshit and no podcast right now?

495
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,040
It's actually not as much as I thought.

496
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,040
We're doing pretty good.

497
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:14,040
I thought we had a solid 20 at least.

498
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,040
16?

499
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,040
That's not great.

500
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:20,040
We're headed down to 12, which isn't too insufferable.

501
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:25,040
Don't be too selective with your edits here, Cole.

502
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,040
Alright, let's get this straight.

503
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:32,040
You went with Stevie, the new intern and secret eldest child of Fred Godell, to an anonymously

504
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:36,040
submitted dropped pin, which had been secretly submitted by Stevie.

505
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:41,040
And that led you to a series of road signs telling you to turn around and a dead end

506
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:46,040
with a dense tree line, which was secretly a wall covered in plants and bushes and trees.

507
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:51,040
And inside was an unnaturally smooth gorge and a single simple steel train car took you

508
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:54,040
across the wildly deep and foggy ravine with strangely slick sides.

509
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:59,040
Of course, after you left behind all food and drink, which Stevie explained was secretly

510
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:03,040
a ploy by Fred Godell because caffeine makes it harder for him to affect your mind.

511
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:06,040
Which is why the train couldn't actually detect the lasagna.

512
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,040
Caffeine-free lasagna.

513
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,040
And then you finally-

514
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,040
Now at Target.

515
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,040
That's right, folks.

516
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:16,040
And then you finally got in the Can-Van, family-sized frozen lasagna for the holiday season.

517
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,040
And you started driving.

518
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,040
$14.99.

519
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,040
Even had a full tank of gas.

520
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:24,040
But at the very first gas station, from the one-way road to Godell's Gate to Grover's

521
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:30,040
Gorge, there at each pump, a green Range Rover, and stepping out of one while staring directly

522
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:36,040
at the Can-Van, was president of the Godell company himself, Fred Godell.

523
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:42,040
And then, quote unquote, safely, back in the city, you left God in the tied up body of

524
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:48,040
Fox Godell with Stevie, just the two of them, where else but in Cal Colorado's basement.

525
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,040
It's a very well-built basement.

526
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:55,040
And then you decided to keep Vivica in the room to do a better edit of the footage from

527
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,040
Grover's Gorge.

528
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:59,040
And she crit-failed her grip check.

529
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:04,040
Does anyone have anything they'd like to say about any of that?

530
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,040
I'm sorry, Vivica.

531
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:09,040
I did want to mention, in re-listening to the episode, that we all made a point not

532
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,040
to show her any of the God stuff.

533
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:15,040
So she's at least not as freaked in the bean as she could be.

534
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,040
Freaked in the bean.

535
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,040
You did keep her away from the God stuff.

536
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:22,040
Sorry, we thought sanity was problematic, so this season we're going to have freaked

537
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:25,040
in the bean rolls.

538
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:28,040
Brought to you by Busch's Baked Beans.

539
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:31,040
Found a target.

540
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,040
Freaked in the bean indeed.

541
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:39,040
She was spared, perhaps, some sort of mental break there, but the critical failure on seeing

542
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:47,040
those human-animal hybrids at the end, which were outlined by Beck Wilder in the edit,

543
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,040
that's really what did it.

544
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,040
The people animals?

545
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:53,040
Yeah, yeah, I think that more than anything.

546
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,040
Yeah, they were like covered in blood too.

547
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:59,040
One of them had like a pug face, but a human body.

548
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:04,040
And I was asked on Instagram by a famous pretending to be people artist, Slidewhistle.

549
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,040
Shout out to Slidewhistle.

550
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,040
Shout out to Slidewhistle.

551
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:13,040
Slidewhistle asked if the pug face was like furry, like a dog face, or if it had like

552
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:16,040
human skin flaps, but then in the shape of a pug.

553
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,040
Excellent question.

554
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,040
And I asked which was worse.

555
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,040
I think a little bit of fur.

556
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:25,040
And they said just the human skin with the flaps.

557
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,040
So it was that?

558
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,040
So I said that, yeah, for sure it's that.

559
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,040
I agree.

560
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,040
So that's awful.

561
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,040
So that's nasty.

562
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,040
And cute Hannah.

563
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:38,040
What if it has like real thin like Charlie Brown hair, the kind you can totally see through.

564
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:41,040
And it's just like in weird patches.

565
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,040
Ugh, ducky ducky.

566
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,040
Somebody do AI of that.

567
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:48,040
Oh, somebody do AI of that.

568
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,040
Somebody do AI of that.

569
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:53,040
We're no longer asking for fan art.

570
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:57,040
We're just asking for props.

571
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:07,040
The editing bay has the air sucked out of it entirely and you can all hear the blood

572
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:13,040
in your ears pounding through your heads as you see the images of the unnaturally lush

573
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:21,040
greenery and the sounds of the bones and cartilage and Julius's face being broken and rearranged.

574
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:26,040
And you're brought right back to the most dreadful and confusing place you've ever seen

575
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,040
on a screen, much less been to.

576
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:31,040
Back to Grover's gorge and you feel nauseous.

577
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:34,040
But this was your goal.

578
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:38,040
You technically succeeded, but how these mixed emotions land on you right now, it's really

579
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,040
up to the roll of the dice.

580
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,040
So I'm going to need a grip check from each of you.

581
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:47,040
And if you pass this grip check, the success and pride you feel in a mission accomplished

582
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:52,040
pushes through the horrific memories and cements a stronger resolve.

583
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:59,040
And you'll be able to add 1d8 to your grip and you'll be able to add 1d10 to any skill

584
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:04,040
of your choosing with an explanation of how this resolve makes you better in that skill.

585
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:09,040
But if you fail, the swirling, well, we'll get to that if you all fail there.

586
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,040
Yeah, I fail.

587
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,040
I failed.

588
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,040
I failed.

589
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,040
God, you gave us such a cool thing we could have done.

590
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,040
I know.

591
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:20,040
You've never given us cool shit before.

592
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,040
Ever.

593
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,040
Ever.

594
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:25,040
You never give us anything.

595
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:33,040
If you fail, the swirling mix of devastation and helplessness will overwhelm you while

596
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:37,040
you lose yourselves in the footage playing in the editing bay and you won't be able

597
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:43,040
to take your eyes off the screens and you'll miss Vivica tensing up like a horse editing

598
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,040
a commercial for fireworks.

599
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,040
You mean a dog?

600
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,040
You mean glue?

601
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:03,040
You're going to tense up like a horse editing a commercial for glue.

602
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,040
Which is what she does.

603
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,040
Tenses up like a horse editing a commercial for glue.

604
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:14,040
She tenses up like a horse editing a commercial for glue.

605
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:18,040
She tenses up like a dog editing a commercial for fireworks.

606
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,040
She's tense?

607
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,040
We don't see it though, right?

608
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,040
Yeah, we all failed.

609
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,040
We missed it.

610
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,040
Yeah, you all failed.

611
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:29,040
So, wrapped up in your own sort of situation, she tensely continues the edit and wraps

612
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,040
up.

613
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,040
Okay.

614
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,040
Wow.

615
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,040
Yeah.

616
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,040
Wow, right?

617
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,040
Like, it's really something, isn't it?

618
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,040
I've never seen anything-

619
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,040
You handled it really well.

620
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,040
It's going to, I mean, this is good news, right?

621
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,040
Don't you think this is good?

622
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:44,040
I mean, not this is bad news, but don't you think this makes great news?

623
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:47,040
I, we're going to get promotions.

624
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,040
She's like holding back vomit.

625
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,040
Hey, hey, hey.

626
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:54,040
I know you're probably thinking right now about local Emmys and that's making you nervous,

627
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:58,040
but, well, let me say you're right to be nervous because I can't imagine anything beating

628
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,040
you this year.

629
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,040
We're talking Pulitzer.

630
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:07,040
Just looking at the computer tower, just looking at the monitors, just looks back at you, starts

631
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,040
shaking your head no.

632
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:13,040
I know you're a perfectionist, but I saw your cut and it's good.

633
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,040
We've got to get it out immediately.

634
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,040
People need to see this, Vivica.

635
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,040
I know you probably want more time with it, right?

636
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,040
She nods.

637
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:21,040
Typh has to see it and it'll have to go out tomorrow, right?

638
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:24,040
She's running her hands over her face and-

639
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:28,040
This is perhaps the most consequential story of the last 20 years.

640
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,040
This is 9-11, Vivica.

641
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,040
This is your 9-11.

642
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,040
But, like, in a good way.

643
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,040
I don't understand how that makes me comfortable.

644
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:37,040
Can I just throw a persuade role on this is your 9-11?

645
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,040
Yeah, go ahead and roll.

646
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:42,040
Yeah, I started role-playing a reasonable response.

647
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,040
How foolish of me.

648
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,040
That's a pass.

649
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:49,040
71 on an 80.

650
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,040
Opportunities like this don't come around very often, you're right.

651
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:54,040
Yeah, I just worry about the larger implications.

652
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:57,040
We worry about the larger implications of it not getting out, wouldn't you say?

653
00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:01,040
So we're just going to, Bec, can you just burn yourself a copy there that we're going

654
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:05,040
to get sent out of the editing room over to production?

655
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,040
You can keep working on this for your sizzle reel.

656
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,040
Bec pulls out a thumb drive.

657
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,040
Yeah, yeah.

658
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:14,040
And I just go over and just plug it straight in and maybe kind of move her out of the way

659
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:17,040
to get to the keyboard to just go ahead and drop it over there into the thumb drive.

660
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,040
Does it go off without a hitch?

661
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,040
Roll computer.

662
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,040
Science.

663
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,040
That's a pass.

664
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,040
34 on a 60.

665
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,040
It goes off without a hitch.

666
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,040
I plug it out.

667
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,040
Vivica, this is going to be a good thing.

668
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,040
Like, did you see that medical device in there?

669
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:35,040
Like, I know you freaked out by, like, the scary stuff, but there's also stuff there

670
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:38,040
that's going to revolutionize the way we do medicine.

671
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,040
Like, it could cure cancer.

672
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:43,040
She's just stone face staring at the floor.

673
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,040
Vivica, are you okay?

674
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,040
Are you having personal problems?

675
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,040
I'm not having personal problems.

676
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:51,040
I'm having problems with what I just saw, obviously.

677
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,040
I'm fucking having problems with what I just saw, Cal.

678
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:57,040
And you're asking me if I have personal problems right now.

679
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,040
What the fuck is wrong with you?

680
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,040
You're right.

681
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,040
You're right.

682
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:07,040
I feel like I already dealt with some of these truths, and I apologize if we thrust this upon you, as it were.

683
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:11,040
We've had a little more time to process this than you have, apparently.

684
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,040
Yes, exactly.

685
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,040
But we didn't want to go to anybody but you with this, Vivica.

686
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,040
You're the best in the business.

687
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,040
It had to be you.

688
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:21,040
We thought you would be, you know, strong enough to handle it versus hiding it from you.

689
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,040
And you would really do it justice.

690
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,040
And you have.

691
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,040
It's a good edit.

692
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,040
It's a great edit.

693
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,040
This is what this is, Vivica.

694
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,040
This is justice, putting this out in the world.

695
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,040
You saw what they did.

696
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,040
You saw the footage from the It Pit.

697
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,040
It has to be out there.

698
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,040
Fine.

699
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:39,040
So we're probably going to have, like, seven or eight different days where we show this footage.

700
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:42,040
So maybe, you know, adrenaline if you're not tired.

701
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:45,040
Any kind of motions towards, like, her workstation.

702
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:48,040
Or if you need to, you know, get some rest.

703
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:50,040
I'll be right back. I'll be right back. I'll be right back.

704
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,040
We're handling this well.

705
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:55,040
As the door closes behind her.

706
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,040
What time is it right now?

707
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,040
What, like 2.30 in the morning?

708
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:02,040
Oh, okay. So there's no way my uncle is here right now?

709
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:05,040
No. No, he's at the bar still, at least.

710
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:08,040
Well, in the city, they stay up until, like, five sometimes.

711
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,040
Well, and he wasn't at...

712
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:12,040
Especially if you call it a private club.

713
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,040
If you have the proper permits.

714
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:17,040
Luke, he also wasn't at work today.

715
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:19,040
Yeah, and he's not answering texts, right?

716
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,040
That's right.

717
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:23,040
Didn't somebody tell us that he was going to a meeting or something?

718
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:26,040
Somebody at least gave a reason for his absence.

719
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,040
Yes, he was at a meeting at City Tower.

720
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,040
It's a big tower that looks like a T.

721
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,040
No.

722
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:41,040
Vivica is in the bathroom, and the three of you have wrapped up this edit.

723
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,040
Good job. Good job, man.

724
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,040
I can't wait until I see it on TV.

725
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:47,040
Do you guys, like, after seeing how Vivica reacted,

726
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,040
have any, like, second thoughts now?

727
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,040
Like, that's gonna...

728
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,040
What just happened is gonna happen all over the city,

729
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:55,040
and then we're not gonna be there to help talk him down.

730
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:59,040
I think maybe that's the kind of outrage we need to fight against Grover's Gorge.

731
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,040
Was it outrage or abject terror?

732
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:06,040
I think our audience is smart enough to decide for themselves.

733
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:10,040
We try to not hold their hands, or at least we did when I was an anchor here.

734
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:13,040
I think... I think we can trust them.

735
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,040
I'm just saying...

736
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,040
People will recognize.

737
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:18,040
Vivica's, like, a hardened, like, professional who's edited, like,

738
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:21,040
everything that's come through here, and she's never had a reaction like that.

739
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:23,040
Are you afraid of success, Clark?

740
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,040
Who's Clark?

741
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,040
Cal, are you okay?

742
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,040
It's me, Beck.

743
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,040
Seriously, are you okay?

744
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:38,040
I'm... I'm... I'm fine, Beck.

745
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,040
Are you fine? Are you afraid of success?

746
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,040
I don't know. I guess if that... Maybe I am.

747
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:46,040
If it's, like, success on one hand, and, like, you know,

748
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:51,040
people not being able to live in the world that we present them as fact now,

749
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,040
I don't know which is worth it.

750
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:55,040
I didn't go through all that to not have a producer credit in this,

751
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,040
so I think it's going up.

752
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,040
What if we take another pass at it, and, like,

753
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:02,040
maybe just take out a few of the more mind-blowing things?

754
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:06,040
Maybe the animal people come out, and we save that for later?

755
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,040
Perhaps you might be on to something.

756
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:13,040
A whole week of series progressively leading up to...

757
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,040
He's into it.

758
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:18,040
Hey, Julius, this will increase numbers.

759
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,040
Absolutely.

760
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,040
As we tease the real things.

761
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,040
But it will also, yes, perhaps,

762
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:26,040
anesthetize the population to some extent

763
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:29,040
against the kind of surely atypical reaction we've seen here.

764
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:34,040
At that exact moment, the glass door that goes in,

765
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:37,040
the frosty glass door that leads into the editing bay,

766
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:42,040
it's a pole, and it is being pushed as a body slams into it,

767
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:46,040
and then disheveled opens the door, flinging it open,

768
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:49,040
and you see Kurt, you guys would know Kurt.

769
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,040
He's in his thirties, but he looks older,

770
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,040
his eyes are sunken in,

771
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:56,040
and he's wearing a disheveled can windbreaker.

772
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:59,040
He's got big curly hair on top,

773
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,040
and as he kind of pushes in,

774
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:04,040
you see he's got an old TCN polo

775
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:07,040
underneath his can windbreaker.

776
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:11,040
You know, Kurt goes around and shops wild videos

777
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,040
to different news agencies that he's taken

778
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:16,040
throughout the late evening of night,

779
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,040
and he kind of flings the door open,

780
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:22,040
and is like, boys, I got something for you.

781
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,040
Oh, let me get the voice.

782
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,040
Oh, I was glaring at you in character,

783
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,040
not because I disapproved of your voice choice.

784
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,040
Boys, welcome.

785
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:32,040
Boys, boys, welcome to daddy.

786
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,040
Oh, boy.

787
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:36,040
Is that your entry phrase, to this voice?

788
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:38,040
Boys, welcome to daddy.

789
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,040
Welcome to daddy.

790
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,040
No, I'm back in it.

791
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,040
Welcome, welcome, welcome.

792
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:47,040
Boys, welcome to daddy.

793
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:52,040
It is I, Kurt, typical American guy.

794
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:55,040
I want to be your dad.

795
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,040
I am Kurt.

796
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,040
What's the voice?

797
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,040
He flings the door.

798
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:04,040
He flings the mic in Luke's face.

799
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,040
He flings the mic.

800
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,040
Sorry, Cole.

801
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,040
He flings the door open.

802
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,040
Hey, it's me, Kurt.

803
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,040
Hello.

804
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,040
Hello, it is I, Kurtis.

805
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,040
Call me daddy.

806
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:17,040
Oh, no.

807
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,040
No, thank you.

808
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,040
Wrong editing, babe.

809
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:26,040
Guys, it's Kurt, the mute nightcrawler.

810
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:38,040
He walks in and hands you a notepad.

811
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,040
Where you guys crawl on it.

812
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,040
What do you want, Kurt?

813
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:44,040
No, it says welcome to daddy.

814
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:53,040
I grabbed the video from him and pop it in and see what it is.

815
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,040
He flings the door open.

816
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,040
Hello, boys.

817
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:05,040
You must call me daddy because I have footage that you are going to really love.

818
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:13,040
Oh, your mind may not be prepared to handle the footage that I have for you this evening.

819
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,040
I want you to prepare.

820
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,040
Hey, Kurt.

821
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,040
Hello, Kurt.

822
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,040
We're not going to call you daddy.

823
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,040
We tell you that every time.

824
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:24,040
I don't know why, but also, we have some...

825
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,040
Oh, Julius.

826
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,040
Oh, Julius, no.

827
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:28,040
I just only recently met him.

828
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,040
I thought it was just...

829
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,040
No, Julius, he gets every new employee.

830
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,040
He introduced himself to me as daddy.

831
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,040
Oh, Julius, no.

832
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,040
Oh, this is very disappointing.

833
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,040
Julius feels dirty.

834
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,040
Kurt, you ought to be ashamed.

835
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:44,040
He's just winking at Julius.

836
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,040
Julius, I'm sorry.

837
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,040
This is Kurt.

838
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:50,040
He's a weirdo, a bad coworker, and a nightcrawler.

839
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,040
Whoa, hey, come on.

840
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,040
He's a nightcrawler.

841
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,040
Well, let's see what you've got.

842
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:57,040
We're probably pretty full up this week, but let's see.

843
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:02,040
Yeah, this might be the last time you see us down in the non-executive editing bay.

844
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:05,040
That's not a real thing, but we're on the up and up is what I mean.

845
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,040
But let's see what footage you have.

846
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,040
Beck likes Kurt.

847
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,040
No.

848
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,040
Kurt?

849
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,040
Kurt, you got another tape?

850
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:26,040
You're gonna love it, especially.

851
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,040
It's fucked up, man.

852
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,040
This isn't like that fish man from the other day,

853
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,040
and it was just a guy taking a swim in the river, right?

854
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:40,040
If you can tell me how this is not real, that would actually help my mental state.

855
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,040
I don't know.

856
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,040
I mean, I'm sorry, Kurt.

857
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,040
No offense or some offense.

858
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:49,040
I don't know what might help the mental state of a man such as you who chases ambulances

859
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,040
to film the grisly aftermath.

860
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,040
That is how it starts.

861
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,040
We go back to your place.

862
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,040
That's how it starts.

863
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:01,040
Julius pops the video in to see what's on it.

864
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:06,040
Starts with an ambulance, and you see he's sprinting up on an ambulance

865
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:12,040
as the EMTs are rushing over to a car that is flipped over on a bridge in the city,

866
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,040
looking out beyond this accident.

867
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:17,040
You see the city skyscape in the background.

868
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,040
That's what it's called.

869
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:22,040
Kyle shakes his head and turns away, like looks away.

870
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:26,040
The other two of you see a mother and daughter trapped in this car,

871
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:32,040
and one of the EMTs is running up to try to pry open the door to get the two of them.

872
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:37,040
Suddenly, out of nowhere, you hear coming out the left speakers, the audio.

873
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:46,040
A car speeding through slams into the EMT, who is trying to help accident on top of accident.

874
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,040
It's gruesome.

875
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,040
The camera zooms in.

876
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,040
He rushes towards them, trying to figure out what was going on.

877
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:56,040
The camera whips over behind to see where the car came from.

878
00:36:56,040 --> 00:37:01,040
There's nothing, but then the camera sees people stopping on this bridge,

879
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:06,040
getting out of their cars, looking up beyond and above the camera.

880
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,040
The camera whips around.

881
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:12,040
It's like a bolt of lightning that's continuously striking,

882
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:14,040
or an unnaturally focused tornado.

883
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:20,040
An unholy, stomach-dropping phenomenon connects the sky above and the bridge below,

884
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:24,040
and Kurt begins running toward it, the camera bouncing up and down as he zooms,

885
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:28,040
and pulls focus onto this vibrating, humming, electric, and wet mass

886
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:32,040
that makes up this towering force of nature,

887
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:36,040
this terrifying, unfamiliar weather pattern.

888
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:39,040
Quietly to himself, but right into the microphone, Kurt states,

889
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:47,040
Perhaps this is a new fear for the future of humanity as earthquakes and volcanoes once were

890
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,040
for the first of our kind upon witnessing them.

891
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:54,040
And then just as quickly as a lightning bolt flashes back into nothingness,

892
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:57,040
this colossal cylinder of destruction is gone,

893
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:03,040
and Kurt makes it to the front of a confused and scared crowd to shoot the wake of this devastation,

894
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:09,040
and you all see a hole in this bridge about the size of a big revolving door at a mall,

895
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:12,040
and Kurt approaches the edge with caution.

896
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:16,040
You can hear onlookers screaming at him to get away and be careful,

897
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:22,040
but he holds his camera out over the edge and you see the choppy waters of the enormous city river below,

898
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:29,040
and there's a tugboat with a full barge, and it's too close to the changing tide.

899
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:33,040
It's fighting, resisting the new path, but whatever that was,

900
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:37,040
it punched a hole in the bottom of the city river,

901
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:41,040
and this tugboat is circling the drain smoothly at first,

902
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:44,040
and then violently, this vessel is ripped bow first,

903
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:48,040
and it plunges into the unknown followed by its barge.

904
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:51,040
Kurt doesn't move a fucking muscle,

905
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:54,040
and after about 30 seconds worth of an eternity,

906
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:58,040
the spiraling waters below slow their pattern,

907
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:01,040
and the regular flow of the city river resumes,

908
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:06,040
and as the camera zooms back out of the hole on this bridge,

909
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:10,040
you all notice the unnaturally smooth edges

910
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,040
where the bridge was punctured.

911
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:15,040
You hear Kurt breathe into the microphone.

912
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:19,040
The tearing nature is rough and ugly and leaves shrapnel,

913
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:23,040
and this is clearly none of those things.

914
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,040
He runs back, camera kind of bouncing,

915
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,040
you see people all lined out,

916
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:32,040
and he runs up to the first person he sees who looks like

917
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,040
Carrot Top.

918
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,040
He puts the camera on and says,

919
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,040
Sir, what did you see?

920
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:43,040
The person is mouth wide open, speechless.

921
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,040
Smart.

922
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:49,040
He runs up to the next person in the crowd.

923
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:52,040
It's a kid, and he's also mouth agape,

924
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,040
and he's staring at the hole,

925
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:56,040
and he's looking into the camera,

926
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:59,040
into the hole, into the camera.

927
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:02,040
Is it like a special effect?

928
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:06,040
It's like a ride,

929
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:09,040
and then it's like a mirror, right?

930
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:12,040
Yes, it must have been. Who are you here with?

931
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,040
I just was taking a stroll.

932
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:24,040
Your loved ones must be looking for you.

933
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:26,040
It's like the kid that Will Smith shoots

934
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:30,040
in the Men in Black testing facility,

935
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:33,040
because they're out at midnight with physics textbooks.

936
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,040
What the fuck are they up to?

937
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:42,040
News story, the wandering children of the city.

938
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,040
What, does the city have an urchin problem

939
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:48,040
that we might explore a little later?

940
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,040
All cities.

941
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:54,040
And he goes up to the third person.

942
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,040
Thomas, what do they look like?

943
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,040
Carrot Top.

944
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:04,040
The camera whips back around to the original Carrot Top.

945
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:07,040
Well, it's his twin brother that's standing right next to him.

946
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,040
Camera pans back and forth between the two of them.

947
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:13,040
Must you be silent like your brother?

948
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:16,040
What my brother said speaks for all of us, I think.

949
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,040
You see several more Carrot Tops in the crowd.

950
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,040
One of them comes up and goes,

951
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,040
I think we've angered God.

952
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,040
Yeah.

953
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:27,040
Well, I mean, this sick society

954
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,040
has been angering God for a long time.

955
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:32,040
Well, you might be surprised.

956
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:35,040
You might not, by what we believe.

957
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:38,040
You want to interview us some more?

958
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,040
Nope.

959
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,040
Kurt runs away.

960
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,040
Kurt runs away.

961
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,040
The camera turns off and he's like,

962
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:44,040
I couldn't get any other footage.

963
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:47,040
So, Cal, you see, has been watching

964
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,040
since his kind of false modesty at the start

965
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,040
pretty much the whole time, and he chuckles.

966
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:54,040
And he's like, okay, Kurt.

967
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:56,040
Well, that's a very nice,

968
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:58,040
is that your audition reel for Marvel

969
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:00,040
or the Fast franchise?

970
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,040
It's a little weird that you have a kid

971
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:04,040
point out its special effects halfway through,

972
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:06,040
but that was very well done, I suppose.

973
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:08,040
That's better than what you normally

974
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:10,040
apply yourself to, I guess.

975
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:12,040
Let's get a grip check from everybody.

976
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:15,040
See if that, see if Cal's bullshitting,

977
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,040
or if he actually feels that way.

978
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,040
Cal passes.

979
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,040
Beck passes.

980
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,040
Resilient.

981
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,040
Cal feels that way, which is why he said it.

982
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,040
I got a 99.

983
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:28,040
Beck lets out a wily, like a Looney Tunes scream

984
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,040
and runs out of it.

985
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,040
I'm back.

986
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,040
Who's back?

987
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,040
God damn it.

988
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,040
Clark, I'm fine.

989
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,040
Do you mean Keith?

990
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:38,040
Julius lets out a wily, god damn it.

991
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,040
What happens, Julius?

992
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,040
And that was just from seeing this footage.

993
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:47,040
Yeah.

994
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:50,040
Yeah, he also says, I think we've angered God.

995
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:52,040
Go ahead and roll a D4.

996
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:53,040
Nice.

997
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,040
It's the one with four sides.

998
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,040
He flipped me off.

999
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,040
One.

1000
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,040
He flipped me off again.

1001
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,040
All right, you just lose one grip.

1002
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,040
Good.

1003
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:09,040
Can Beck look at that footage

1004
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:12,040
and see a time on it and try and compare

1005
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:14,040
maybe what we were doing in Grover's Gorge

1006
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:15,040
when this happened?

1007
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:17,040
Yeah, it seems to be,

1008
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:22,040
it seems to have happened roughly 20 to 30 minutes

1009
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:25,040
after you left Cal Colorado's house.

1010
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,040
Oh, no.

1011
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,040
It just reasons.

1012
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:29,040
Gotcha.

1013
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,040
We have angered God.

1014
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,040
Oh, shit.

1015
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,040
Can we, from landmarks in the footage

1016
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:36,040
or maybe just asking Kurt, where did this happen?

1017
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:38,040
Is it the neighbor near my house?

1018
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:39,040
Yeah.

1019
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,040
Okay, I call Stevie.

1020
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,040
Yeah, that phone.

1021
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,040
Bing, bing.

1022
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,040
Bing, bing.

1023
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,040
Bing, bing.

1024
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,040
Bing, bing.

1025
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,040
Bing, bing.

1026
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,040
Taylor again.

1027
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:49,040
Bing, bing.

1028
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,040
Bing, bing.

1029
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:52,040
And then it goes to Stevie's voicemail.

1030
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:55,040
Beck sees the look on Cal's face

1031
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:58,040
and Beck starts to get the drained blood

1032
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:59,040
from the head feeling.

1033
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,040
Hi, Stevie.

1034
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:02,040
Cal Colorado, City Action News.

1035
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,040
Just wanted to check in,

1036
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:07,040
see how y'all are doing in my basement.

1037
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:10,040
Hope you're having a good time.

1038
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:12,040
I did, you know about the pizza money I left.

1039
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:13,040
I think I told you about that.

1040
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,040
If you don't, there's $25 on the counter.

1041
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:17,040
If that's not enough for pizza these days,

1042
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:25,040
there is $1,500 in the front drawer of the desk in my office.

1043
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:29,040
So take as much as you need.

1044
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,040
I hope you're having a good time.

1045
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:33,040
Please just let me know that everything's okay.

1046
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,040
Thank you.

1047
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:35,040
Again, this is Cal Colorado.

1048
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,040
Good night.

1049
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,040
Choice.

1050
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,040
So good.

1051
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:41,040
Julius has kind of rewound the video

1052
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:44,040
and is on one of the lightning strike looking things.

1053
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:47,040
And is just like intently just staring at it

1054
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:50,040
and picking at his face.

1055
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:51,040
Gross.

1056
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:54,040
We got to go and check on our friend.

1057
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:56,040
Beck says, remembering that Kurt's there.

1058
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:58,040
We should check on our friend.

1059
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:00,040
Yeah, I'm terribly sorry, Kurt.

1060
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:03,040
Again, I do find this all very impressive

1061
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:06,040
and certainly better than your normal filth and depravity.

1062
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:09,040
You should pursue this passion for CG,

1063
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:11,040
computer-generated imagery.

1064
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:14,040
But we do have to go check on our friend.

1065
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:18,040
I really, really hope you have a pleasant evening.

1066
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:20,040
This has been Cal Colorado.

1067
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:23,040
Julius was in a daze a little bit and turns around

1068
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:25,040
and looks at Kurt and he's like,

1069
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,040
what's the rate, daddy?

1070
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:28,040
What's the rate, Kurt?

1071
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:35,040
And he pulls out a canned checkbook.

1072
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:38,040
Well, I would say for something like this,

1073
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:42,040
I'm hoping for 800.

1074
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:45,040
Julius writes a check for $500 and hands it to him.

1075
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:50,040
The F can look like an E, the five can look like an eight.

1076
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:51,040
Yep.

1077
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,040
This'll do.

1078
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:56,040
Does Julius hear him say that?

1079
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:58,040
What?

1080
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:00,040
And he's out.

1081
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:03,040
He's like, that's just $300.

1082
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:05,040
And as the three of you head out,

1083
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:07,040
is that the move?

1084
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:10,040
Yeah, I think Beck would want to just check on Vivica

1085
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:11,040
before we leave.

1086
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:12,040
Yeah.

1087
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:13,040
Maybe just tap on the bathroom door.

1088
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,040
Oh, yeah.

1089
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:17,040
We have a whole new release strategy to discuss with her.

1090
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,040
Okay, yeah.

1091
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:20,040
So when you tap on the door, she immediately opens it.

1092
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:23,040
Hey, Viv, I know you're having a tough time with this

1093
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,040
and we've talked about it and...

1094
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,040
She goes for a hug.

1095
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:27,040
Oh, hey.

1096
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:28,040
It's like kind of weird.

1097
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:29,040
It's like not normal.

1098
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,040
Hey, no, it's okay.

1099
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,040
We talked about it and you're right,

1100
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,040
that this is maybe too much too fast.

1101
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:36,040
We're gonna take another pass at the edit

1102
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:39,040
and we're just gonna take out some of the really scary stuff

1103
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:42,040
and maybe kind of build up to it over the course of a week or two.

1104
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:43,040
Prepare people for it.

1105
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:44,040
You were right.

1106
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:45,040
It is scary.

1107
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:46,040
You were right, Vivica.

1108
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:49,040
Go ahead and roll as you're saying you were right.

1109
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:52,040
Beck, if you could roll alertness.

1110
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:57,040
I pass a nine on a 40.

1111
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:01,040
Yeah, the hug felt weird but nothing too strange

1112
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:03,040
and she kind of walks out and is like...

1113
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:05,040
She put a goddamn kick me sign on my back.

1114
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:11,040
Okay, so I guess you send that off to production

1115
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:13,040
and we'll see you in the morning.

1116
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:14,040
See you tomorrow.

1117
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:16,040
Yeah, we'll see you tomorrow with fresh eyes.

1118
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:17,040
It's all gonna be okay.

1119
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,040
And she's walking out the door.

1120
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:25,040
I need either humant or alertness from Julius and Cal.

1121
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:27,040
I pass humant.

1122
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:28,040
With a?

1123
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:29,040
34.

1124
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:30,040
Okay.

1125
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:31,040
I critically fail.

1126
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,040
Okay.

1127
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:34,040
Either within 88.

1128
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:37,040
So Cal has leaned down to tie his shoe.

1129
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:40,040
She kind of turns back and is like,

1130
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:42,040
okay, I'll see you tomorrow.

1131
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:45,040
And heads out and closes the door behind her

1132
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:49,040
off of the marbleless floor in front of you.

1133
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:52,040
Empty, dark outside but it's well lit in here.

1134
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:53,040
Well lit?

1135
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:57,040
Yeah, you can hear a vacuum going in the background

1136
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:59,040
as it's like 3.30 in the morning.

1137
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:02,040
Oh yeah, then the ghost of the janitor

1138
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:05,040
who worked here in the 50s is vacuuming at night.

1139
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:07,040
Should we go check on God?

1140
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:09,040
I mean, I've got a bad feeling.

1141
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:11,040
I'm worried that what we just saw in that footage

1142
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,040
that Kirk brought is, I don't know,

1143
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,040
did something fuck up at the God basement?

1144
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,040
I don't think that he's still in there.

1145
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:19,040
Wasn't that your neighborhood, Cal?

1146
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:22,040
Oh, I mean, nearby.

1147
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:24,040
It wasn't quite as nice.

1148
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:27,040
The nearest bridge to get to downtown.

1149
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,040
Yeah, yeah.

1150
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:32,040
That's a lot of bridge and tunnel coming through there

1151
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:34,040
but no, that's not quite my neighborhood.

1152
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:39,040
Is that bridge tall enough to, you know, splat?

1153
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,040
What do you mean?

1154
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:42,040
Jump off and die?

1155
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:43,040
Oh, Lord, yes.

1156
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:47,040
It's actually probably the most popular suicide bridge in the city.

1157
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:50,040
Yeah, it's like 83.6 yards tall.

1158
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:52,040
It's on TripAdvisor.

1159
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:54,040
Yeah, I mean, well, you see, the thing is

1160
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:56,040
it was built in the 1880s

1161
00:48:56,040 --> 00:49:00,040
and there has been a lot of time for death to accumulate.

1162
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:02,040
It's the subject of some local fascination.

1163
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:07,040
And how far of a walk from your apartment is it?

1164
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:08,040
15 minutes.

1165
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:10,040
Julius just kind of looks at Beck and Cal.

1166
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:15,040
Yeah, Beck is nodding at you with a grim expression.

1167
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:18,040
Yeah, it could have happened, I guess.

1168
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:21,040
We got to go check and make sure Stevie's okay

1169
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:23,040
and I've got a bad feeling.

1170
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,040
Here's another kicker.

1171
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:26,040
We have a date with you in the hospital.

1172
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:29,040
Do you want to get dropped off, me and Cal, go check it out?

1173
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:31,040
No, I've got to go.

1174
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:34,040
I looked it up in the rules, by the way,

1175
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:37,040
and the official rules of Delta Green.

1176
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:39,040
You're not conscious at two hit points.

1177
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:40,040
Like, you can't even...

1178
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:41,040
How could you be?

1179
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:43,040
You're not conscious at one or two hit points.

1180
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:44,040
Good thing I've got four.

1181
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:47,040
But you roll con when you go down to one or two hit points

1182
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:50,040
and if you succeed, then you're fine.

1183
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:52,040
You're just unconscious.

1184
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:56,040
But if you fail, you take a permanent injury

1185
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:58,040
that reduces one of your stats.

1186
00:49:58,040 --> 00:49:59,040
It's super bad for you.

1187
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:01,040
It's super bad for you.

1188
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:06,040
Good thing we didn't know that when it happened to me.

1189
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:07,040
Well, no, because it worked out

1190
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:09,040
because you actually succeeded on your contract

1191
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:12,040
to stay conscious both times, I believe.

1192
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:14,040
So no permanent injury, which works out well.

1193
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:18,040
And I'm up to four hit points, so we're not breaking any rules.

1194
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:21,040
Yes, we're not breaking any rules.

1195
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:23,040
I told them I'd be back tomorrow,

1196
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:26,040
which technically I've got so many hours to get back there.

1197
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:27,040
Let's go. I'll go with you.

1198
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:29,040
I mean, if you're feeling up to it,

1199
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:32,040
I'm just worried if a strong breeze comes through.

1200
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:34,040
I think we've left logic behind long ago.

1201
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:37,040
Julius takes one of the pills that the nurse gave him.

1202
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:39,040
One of the limitless pills.

1203
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:42,040
Because we're not using willpower points,

1204
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:45,040
I think it's just going to be 3.30 in the morning.

1205
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:51,040
Zach imposes a negative 40 to skill checks starting now.

1206
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:53,040
Basically, you're exhausted.

1207
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:54,040
Cal is exhausted.

1208
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:55,040
Yeah.

1209
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:59,040
Now that the energy of getting the edit done,

1210
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:02,040
the excitement, all the adrenaline from today is finally worn off,

1211
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:06,040
he's not sure why Vivica is so adverse

1212
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:09,040
to this amazing opportunity that's been dropped in front of him.

1213
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:11,040
And he just wants to go back to his apartment,

1214
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:13,040
his nice apartment where nothing has happened.

1215
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:17,040
God hasn't blasted through, say, the ceiling or anything.

1216
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:19,040
I guess if I've got to go to sleep,

1217
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:21,040
I might as well go to sleep at the hospital.

1218
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:24,040
So I guess call me and let me know if Stevie's there.

1219
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:25,040
Righty-o.

1220
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:28,040
Okay, so you guys are going to leave and drop off Julius at the hospital

1221
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:32,040
on the way to Cal Colorado's townhouse.

1222
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:34,040
I need an alertness check

1223
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:40,040
as you all head out the can studio in downtown city.

1224
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:41,040
88 on the 70.

1225
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:42,040
Wow, dude.

1226
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:43,040
89.

1227
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:44,040
Wow.

1228
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:47,040
59 on a 40.

1229
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:50,040
Cal leans down to tie his other shoe.

1230
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:53,040
As you guys head out, you're pulling out of the parking lot

1231
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:55,040
and you don't see.

1232
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:57,040
And nothing happens.

1233
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:01,040
You don't see a goddamn thing.

1234
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:03,040
You don't see a couple things.

1235
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:04,040
Okay, it could be worse.

1236
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:05,040
Yeah.

1237
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:06,040
Yeah, moving on.

1238
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:08,040
I guess it'll be fun later.

1239
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:10,040
And we can all look back and be like,

1240
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:12,040
Whoa, it was that roll?

1241
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:14,040
That's crazy.

1242
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:15,040
So just remember this.

1243
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:18,040
Cal forgets something he left in the office

1244
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:20,040
and comes back outside.

1245
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:23,040
It's not something that shouldn't have been a roll though, right?

1246
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,040
No, it's great.

1247
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:27,040
If the sky is on fire or there's people screaming and running.

1248
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:29,040
No, there's people hiding from you.

1249
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:30,040
Oh, okay.

1250
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:31,040
Multiple people.

1251
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:34,040
There's always multiple.

1252
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:37,040
In any situation Zach sets up in a role-playing game,

1253
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:39,040
there are multiple Waldos in each scene

1254
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:41,040
that we could have been rolling to find.

1255
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:43,040
And he finally remembered to ask.

1256
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:45,040
And he's like, wow, interesting.

1257
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:47,040
Very first time.

1258
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,040
You don't wear...

1259
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:49,040
Do you know what they call it in England?

1260
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,040
I don't.

1261
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:51,040
Do you know, Joe?

1262
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:52,040
I don't think so.

1263
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:53,040
It's Where's Wally?

1264
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:54,040
I was going to guess Wally.

1265
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:55,040
So maybe I did know it at some point.

1266
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:56,040
I was hoping somebody would say it.

1267
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:57,040
And then I could say,

1268
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:59,040
No, it's Where's your cunt or something stupid.

1269
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:06,040
But it's Where's Wally?

1270
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:07,040
So you head off.

1271
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:08,040
And at the hospital,

1272
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:11,040
we're going to go ahead and have you stay overnight

1273
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:13,040
and get some health back.

1274
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:14,040
Yay.

1275
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:15,040
Yeah.

1276
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:16,040
So go ahead and roll a D4.

1277
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:18,040
I also looked up the rules for Delta Green on this.

1278
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:20,040
Apparently you're supposed to roll for the surgeon

1279
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:23,040
to see if they're good enough to help you.

1280
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,040
One.

1281
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:25,040
Wow.

1282
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:26,040
Surely you could also have a credit rating roll

1283
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:28,040
against that to see if you can afford a good surgeon.

1284
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:31,040
I actually wrote in here that he wouldn't have a good surgeon

1285
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:33,040
because his health insurance with City Action News

1286
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:35,040
hasn't started up yet.

1287
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,040
Yep.

1288
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:38,040
So that's why I only got one.

1289
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:40,040
That's why you only got one hit point back.

1290
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:42,040
So you're going to wake up up to five.

1291
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:45,040
However, you do also every single night gets you-

1292
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:46,040
Yeah.

1293
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:47,040
Wait.

1294
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:49,040
He got one back or two back when we just talked to the nurse.

1295
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:50,040
Two back for talking to the nurse.

1296
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:53,040
So we need to have more than one for his actual hospital stay.

1297
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:55,040
That doesn't seem mechanically fair.

1298
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:56,040
No, no.

1299
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:57,040
Turns out the surgeon sucks.

1300
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:58,040
Don't they?

1301
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:00,040
Yeah, surgeon's not super great.

1302
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:02,040
You absolutely should get more than one.

1303
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:04,040
It should be a plus something no matter the roll.

1304
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:06,040
I agree, but I'm just the handler.

1305
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:07,040
Oh, this is actually-

1306
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:08,040
What am I supposed to do?

1307
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:14,040
This is the start of the arc where we sue the hospital for their incredible malpractice

1308
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:16,040
and treating Julius.

1309
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:18,040
They can also crit fail on the check.

1310
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:23,040
I'm just saying it doesn't make it even worth it for him to have separated from us.

1311
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:29,040
So you will get an additional one for a full night's sleep if you can succeed a con check,

1312
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:34,040
but we'll have you do that after we figure out what happens at Cal Colorado's in case

1313
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:37,040
they call you and are like, actually.

1314
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,040
Okay.

1315
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:40,040
So I've got one more back at the moment.

1316
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:41,040
Yeah, for now.

1317
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:42,040
What did they do to me?

1318
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:43,040
Fluids.

1319
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:44,040
And-

1320
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:47,040
Seems like the nurse should have done that.

1321
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:48,040
Fluids.

1322
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:49,040
Fluids.

1323
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:50,040
Just fluids.

1324
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:51,040
One pain.

1325
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:54,040
I have the little pressy button for whatever that is.

1326
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:55,040
Morphine.

1327
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:56,040
Morphine.

1328
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:58,040
They're like, yeah, you can have morphine, I guess.

1329
00:54:58,040 --> 00:54:59,040
I'll sue this.

1330
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:00,040
Do you know who I am?

1331
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:03,040
Sue this hospital if you don't get any morphine.

1332
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:04,040
You're fucking high as shit.

1333
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:07,040
You're like, I'm Cal Colorado.

1334
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:10,040
So yeah, I'm no pain, but I'm on the good stuff.

1335
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:11,040
No pain, one gain.

1336
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:12,040
On the good stuff.

1337
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:14,040
Hopefully you guys don't need me.

1338
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:19,040
This does feel worthless.

1339
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:21,040
It does not seem correct.

1340
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:22,040
It doesn't seem correct.

1341
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:25,040
It could have just been like, okay, Luke, take your headphones off and when you wake

1342
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:28,040
up, you're going to get six hit points or some shit.

1343
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:30,040
I mean, I can read from it.

1344
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:33,040
Since when have we played by the rules?

1345
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:36,040
That's a super great point.

1346
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:38,040
I mean, I can read from it right here.

1347
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:45,040
I can quote you the regulation, Thomas.

1348
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:51,040
Oh, no, I'm just kidding.

1349
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:54,040
We're feisty tonight, Cole.

1350
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:56,040
Should I step outside?

1351
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:57,040
Yeah, I guess so.

1352
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:58,040
You should go wait in the cold.

1353
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:01,040
Oh, do you have a Bluetooth headphones?

1354
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:02,040
I don't.

1355
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:03,040
I forgot the headphones.

1356
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:04,040
You can just rub your ears.

1357
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:05,040
I have headphones.

1358
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:07,040
I'll go outside until it's too cold.

1359
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:08,040
You can go to your room.

1360
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:09,040
Yeah, go to your room.

1361
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:10,040
I'll go to my room.

1362
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:11,040
You can put in my headphones.

1363
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:13,040
I just didn't want to hear you, you know?

1364
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:14,040
I'm going to go outside.

1365
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:18,040
That way I can, well, I can vape in my own room too, but just let me know.

1366
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:19,040
Just let me know.

1367
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:23,040
All right, now that Luke is out of the room, shall we go to Cal Colorado's home?

1368
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:27,040
Beep, beep, beep, beep.

1369
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:29,040
Our city traffic's crazy.

1370
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:31,040
Did you guys drive separately?

1371
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:32,040
Beep, beep, beep.

1372
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:33,040
No, we all came in the can van, right?

1373
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:34,040
Yeah, we're all in the can van.

1374
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:37,040
Well, I assume the can van, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1375
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:38,040
Okay, right.

1376
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:42,040
Oh, you know, maybe after, yeah, Cal probably picks up his car from the parking lot, like

1377
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:45,040
where he left it before we headed out to Grover's Gorge.

1378
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:46,040
Yeah.

1379
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:48,040
How, like two days ago or whatever?

1380
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:49,040
Today, earlier today.

1381
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:52,040
Just, I mean, yesterday according to the time law, time law.

1382
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:54,040
Classic time law.

1383
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:55,040
International time law.

1384
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:56,040
Time law, not van law.

1385
00:56:56,040 --> 00:57:01,040
But yeah, so it says July 6th on your phone, but it, you know, you haven't slept in July

1386
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:04,040
6th yet, so it's still July 5th in your bones.

1387
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:05,040
Yeah, exactly.

1388
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:07,040
I think Beck is still driving the van.

1389
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:08,040
Okay, sounds good.

1390
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:11,040
And the two of you pull up to Cal Colorado's home.

1391
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:12,040
You see nothing.

1392
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:16,040
He pulls his Mercedes into a little garage, like underneath the street.

1393
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:17,040
Nice.

1394
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:18,040
Beep, beep.

1395
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:20,040
As he passes Beck parking on the street in a salute.

1396
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:21,040
Beep, beep.

1397
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:28,040
I mean, you guys must be like making eyes at each other as there's nothing amiss so

1398
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:29,040
far.

1399
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:33,040
Yeah, Cal could walk straight into the basement from the garage, but to be polite to Beck,

1400
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:37,040
he walks out the door, back up onto the street, and then lets him in the front door.

1401
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:39,040
And before they go downstairs, he's like, do you want anything?

1402
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:40,040
Uh, tea, coffee?

1403
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:41,040
No.

1404
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,040
Whiskey?

1405
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:43,040
I think I'm good.

1406
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:46,040
We just got to make sure Stevie's like here and okay.

1407
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:47,040
Yes, yes, of course.

1408
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:52,040
I assume they fell asleep playing chess or Catan.

1409
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:55,040
Beck is going to make his way to the basement door.

1410
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:56,040
Yep, Cal's whispering.

1411
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:59,040
My daughter, Carol, she taught me about Catan.

1412
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:01,040
Yeah, it's a fun one.

1413
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:02,040
Do you know it?

1414
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:04,040
Oh yeah, we play it all the time in the group.

1415
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:05,040
Oh, we should play it.

1416
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:07,040
Yeah, you can come some night to a game night, sure.

1417
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:08,040
I like the sheep.

1418
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:09,040
The sheep are good.

1419
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:13,040
Sometimes you can get a good floor and you corner the market on them.

1420
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:15,040
Shh, we're getting close.

1421
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:16,040
Quiet, Beck.

1422
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:21,040
As you guys open up the door to the basement, you head down the stairs, each step creaking.

1423
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:29,040
Cal hits the light and you see the restraints previously on the body of Greg Godell, which

1424
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:38,040
have been cut off, lying helplessly, lying lifelessly on the ground of the basement of

1425
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:43,040
Cal Colorado's basement.

1426
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:45,040
The shackles are lying lifelessly.

1427
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:46,040
What's lifeless?

1428
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:47,040
The shackles.

1429
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:48,040
Oh, okay.

1430
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:49,040
All the stuff that-

1431
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:50,040
Oh, okay.

1432
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:51,040
I don't give a shit.

1433
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:52,040
Where's Stevie?

1434
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:55,040
Yeah, there's no sign of Stevie, no sign of Greg anywhere.

1435
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:56,040
Stevie!

1436
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:57,040
They're both gone.

1437
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:59,040
I kind of expected one or the other to still be here.

1438
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:05,040
They went out to get pizza for all of us, and Stevie might've thought that she needed

1439
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:06,040
the help of-

1440
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:07,040
A god.

1441
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:08,040
A turtle.

1442
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:09,040
God turtle.

1443
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:10,040
God turtle.

1444
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:12,040
A pizza god turtle.

1445
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:14,040
No, I think that something bad has happened.

1446
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:15,040
They're not here.

1447
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:17,040
The whole thing was that they were supposed to stay here.

1448
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:21,040
And I want to look at, you said the stuff we had used to wrap him up with is on the

1449
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:22,040
floor.

1450
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:23,040
Is it, it's cut?

1451
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:24,040
Is that what you said?

1452
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:25,040
Yeah, it's cut.

1453
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:27,040
Are there like scissors or a knife laying around?

1454
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:29,040
There's a pair of scissors sitting on a table.

1455
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:30,040
Okay.

1456
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:31,040
Just nearby.

1457
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:34,040
I wondered if he had somehow cut himself free or if she had helped him.

1458
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:35,040
Could be either one.

1459
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:39,040
I'm taking by the scene of this that, no, I'm thinking, well, look, there's scissors

1460
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:40,040
laying right here.

1461
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:42,040
I think that maybe Stevie set them loose.

1462
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:44,040
There's no signs of a struggle.

1463
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:47,040
No signs of forced ingress.

1464
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:53,040
It seems logical, yes, that she unlocked the door herself down here and took them both

1465
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:54,040
outside.

1466
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:58,040
She knew the whole thing was to like not let him get to a place where he could kill himself.

1467
00:59:58,040 --> 01:00:01,040
So maybe, I don't know, he said something to her that made her think that wouldn't

1468
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:02,040
happen?

1469
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:05,040
I don't know what Stevie was thinking, but they're a lot closer to this situation

1470
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:06,040
than we are.

1471
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:09,040
Hopefully we, Beck, do you think that video was real?

1472
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:10,040
I do.

1473
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:11,040
Ah, fuck.

1474
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:17,040
I've never seen Kurt doctor his footage before, like that's kind of his whole thing.

1475
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:20,040
It's kind of his whole thing.

1476
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:22,040
It's, you know, raw and real.

1477
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:23,040
That's like what he says.

1478
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:26,040
It's daddy's real stuff is what he always says.

1479
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:29,040
Beck, why do you hang out with that creature?

1480
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:31,040
Sometimes his footage is wild, man.

1481
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:35,040
Have you seen like, you had to have seen the 1973 Bigfoot that he had.

1482
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:36,040
He's 30.

1483
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:37,040
He's like 30.

1484
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:39,040
That he got a hold of.

1485
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:40,040
Oh, Kurt is 30.

1486
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:42,040
Yeah, but the Bigfoot was born in 1973.

1487
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:43,040
Right.

1488
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:44,040
Exactly.

1489
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:45,040
Right.

1490
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:48,040
A great year for big feet.

1491
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:59,040
NPS estimates put it at like at least 33 big feet born in the continental United States.

1492
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:01,040
The biggest year on record.

1493
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:05,040
For instance, in 2021, there were only five estimated big feet born.

1494
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:06,040
That's a lot less.

1495
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:09,040
The numbers is dwindling.

1496
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:12,040
No, there's less of them.

1497
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:14,040
There's smaller feet now.

1498
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:15,040
Little feet.

1499
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:16,040
Little feet.

1500
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:18,040
A land before feet.

1501
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:24,040
Which is my foot fetish parody of a land before feet.

1502
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:27,040
Where all the dinosaurs are played by feet.

1503
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:28,040
What do you guys do?

1504
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:29,040
Beck, it's clear.

1505
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:31,040
We have to find Stevie immediately.

1506
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:32,040
Yeah, it's a bummer.

1507
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:35,040
I was really hoping we could like crash here and then.

1508
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:43,040
Sometimes younger people don't answer my calls.

1509
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:47,040
Would she answer your call or a text?

1510
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:48,040
You should try it.

1511
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:49,040
I'll give that a shot, yeah.

1512
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:58,040
They find me exhausting, I've heard.

1513
01:01:58,040 --> 01:02:00,040
You know Carol, you know my daughter.

1514
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:03,040
I think people are just intimidated, you know?

1515
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:05,040
My daughter said she finds me exhausting.

1516
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:07,040
Do you ever find me exhausting, Beck?

1517
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:09,040
I mean, no.

1518
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:12,040
But we don't like live together, so maybe if we lived together,

1519
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:14,040
I would be exhausted at some point.

1520
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:16,040
But that just happens in relationships.

1521
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:18,040
But no, I don't find you exhausting at all.

1522
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:19,040
Thank you.

1523
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:20,040
Thank you, Beck.

1524
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:23,040
Sometimes we say things to hurt the ones we love.

1525
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:24,040
I'm on the call.

1526
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:25,040
I'm on the call.

1527
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:26,040
Oh, oh, oh.

1528
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:27,040
I'm sorry.

1529
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:28,040
I'm sorry.

1530
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:29,040
Breathe, breathe.

1531
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:30,040
Breathe, breathe.

1532
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:35,040
And then he goes to Stevie's voicemail.

1533
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:36,040
Beep.

1534
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:39,040
Hey, Stevie, it's Beck.

1535
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:42,040
We're really worried about you because you're not where we left you,

1536
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:44,040
and that was kind of the whole thing we had set up,

1537
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:45,040
is that you'd be where we left you.

1538
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:47,040
Tell her I hope she doesn't think I'm exhausting.

1539
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:49,040
Cal hopes that you don't think he's exhausting,

1540
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:54,040
and I hope that you're alive and that your brother's alive

1541
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:59,040
and that there's not a new god in the world that is maybe bad for us.

1542
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:00,040
I don't...

1543
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:01,040
I'll talk to you later.

1544
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:02,040
Bye.

1545
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:03,040
Are you guys crashing?

1546
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:04,040
And I send a text.

1547
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:05,040
Okay.

1548
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:06,040
Nice.

1549
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:07,040
Please call.

1550
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:08,040
Just please call?

1551
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:09,040
Yep.

1552
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:11,040
Beck, I know you prefer to take the can van,

1553
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:14,040
but perhaps tonight on this hunt for Stevie,

1554
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:16,040
we should take my ride.

1555
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:17,040
The Mercedes?

1556
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:18,040
Is that what you're talking about?

1557
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:19,040
Yes.

1558
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:20,040
Dude, yeah.

1559
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:23,040
Some very nice Mercedes coupe, whatever that is.

1560
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:24,040
Don't look at me.

1561
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:25,040
I just...

1562
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:26,040
Thomas doesn't know.

1563
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:27,040
Coupe C. C class.

1564
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:28,040
We kicked the wrong guy out.

1565
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:30,040
Hey, Luke.

1566
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:37,040
I mean, we've got to fit a van load of equipment in it,

1567
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:38,040
but I could...

1568
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:39,040
Yeah, we'll get it in there.

1569
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:40,040
No, no, no, Beck.

1570
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:41,040
It was a search mission.

1571
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:44,040
And frankly, while I've seen tonight what today,

1572
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:47,040
what a common cell phone can do.

1573
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:48,040
Most of your job, Beck.

1574
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:52,040
Whoa, Cal.

1575
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:53,040
Over the line.

1576
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:55,040
And mine as well.

1577
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:56,040
And mine as well.

1578
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:57,040
So...

1579
01:03:57,040 --> 01:03:59,040
This is some 4 a.m. talk here.

1580
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:02,040
He's so exhausted.

1581
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:03,040
He's being a bitch.

1582
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:09,040
What I'm saying is you've got the newest phone.

1583
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:12,040
But this is like, this is more of the story.

1584
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:13,040
This is more story.

1585
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:15,040
We need to film it.

1586
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:16,040
It's more story.

1587
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:18,040
Okay, the small one, the small camera.

1588
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:19,040
No sound, no lights.

1589
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:21,040
You can have a shotgun mic on top.

1590
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:22,040
Yeah, I got it.

1591
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:23,040
I just...

1592
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:24,040
I'm not carrying a boom.

1593
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:25,040
Why are we paring down?

1594
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:26,040
We've got to move quickly.

1595
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:27,040
We've got to move quickly.

1596
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:29,040
Oh, okay.

1597
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:30,040
Through the streets.

1598
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:32,040
In my sweet Mercedes.

1599
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:34,040
I looked it up.

1600
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:35,040
C class works.

1601
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:37,040
In my sweet C class.

1602
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:38,040
Yeah, okay.

1603
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:39,040
I'll grab...

1604
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:41,040
I'll just grab some of the mics and I can fit a tripod.

1605
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:43,040
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1606
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:45,040
Yeah, that's what I'm going to grab.

1607
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:46,040
We need equipment.

1608
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:50,040
We spend like 10 minutes like sorting out a pile.

1609
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:53,040
This won't even fit in that tiny trunk.

1610
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:57,040
Yeah, when the cameraman's just sitting right there.

1611
01:04:57,040 --> 01:05:00,040
The back ends up getting a surprising amount.

1612
01:05:03,040 --> 01:05:05,040
He Tetris is a pretty sweet kid.

1613
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:06,040
Yeah.

1614
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:07,040
All right.

1615
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:08,040
I mean, you guys are going to be...

1616
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:10,040
Now, I think if you go out and continue this,

1617
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:13,040
you're not going to be able to get a sleep

1618
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:15,040
and then show up at a normal time to work.

1619
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:18,040
So you're going to be at a negative 40 all day for the next day.

1620
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:19,040
Unless we go to sleep.

1621
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:20,040
Yeah.

1622
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:22,040
I mean, we've already said we want to spend a little more time on the edit.

1623
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:24,040
I think we deserve to sleep in.

1624
01:05:24,040 --> 01:05:25,040
Wake up pretty late.

1625
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:26,040
I just didn't know how late.

1626
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:27,040
7 a.m.

1627
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:29,040
I don't know how long you're hunting for is what I'm saying.

1628
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:30,040
This hunt.

1629
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:31,040
Oh, I mean, I figured we're...

1630
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:33,040
We're going to take a spin around the block.

1631
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:38,040
I figured story-wise we'd go to the hole

1632
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:40,040
and you'd show us God or whatever

1633
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:44,040
and we'd worry about fucking sleep and shit later.

1634
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:46,040
I wasn't worried about mechanics in this hunt.

1635
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:48,040
I figured we'd go straight to it.

1636
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:49,040
You're going to the hole?

1637
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:50,040
Yeah.

1638
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:51,040
Right?

1639
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:52,040
Sure.

1640
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:53,040
Awesome.

1641
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:54,040
Fuck off.

1642
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:56,040
The way you say that.

1643
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:58,040
Awesome.

1644
01:05:58,040 --> 01:05:59,040
Awesome.

1645
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:00,040
Awesome.

1646
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:06,040
When you arrive to the nearest bridge that heads over the city river

1647
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:10,040
into downtown from Cal, Colorado's lovely neighborhood.

1648
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:11,040
Beans Bridge.

1649
01:06:11,040 --> 01:06:12,040
Beck.

1650
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:14,040
You don't know the history?

1651
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:15,040
No.

1652
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:16,040
Oh.

1653
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:17,040
It is blocked off.

1654
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:20,040
80 men died building this.

1655
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:23,040
Some say their bones are in the mortar.

1656
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:24,040
They are.

1657
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:28,040
There are flashing lights everywhere.

1658
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:30,040
There are all sorts of different crews.

1659
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:33,040
You see people in suits.

1660
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:36,040
You see people in all sorts of different...

1661
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:37,040
There's cops.

1662
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:39,040
There's people in hazmat gear.

1663
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:41,040
There's all sorts of different...

1664
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:42,040
There's tents popping up.

1665
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:44,040
There's a whole crew.

1666
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:48,040
There's a whole kit and caboodle, a whole situation happening.

1667
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:49,040
News crew?

1668
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:52,040
There are other news crews that have begun piling up here.

1669
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:53,040
Yeah.

1670
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:56,040
Cal elbows you a little too hard in the ribs and he's like,

1671
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:57,040
hot damn.

1672
01:06:57,040 --> 01:06:58,040
You were right, Beck.

1673
01:06:58,040 --> 01:07:00,040
We should have brought all this shit.

1674
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:04,040
Oh yeah, I got the tripod and I've got a lav mic for you

1675
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:07,040
and the light here I can attach to the top.

1676
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:08,040
Yeah, we're set.

1677
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:11,040
You've got this Rube Goldberg of things attached to the camera

1678
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:14,040
and you're holding it in one hand and a boom in the other.

1679
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:20,040
Yeah, it's a backpack strap thing that sends the boom over the top of my head.

1680
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:23,040
I see this golden glow on my skin and I'm like,

1681
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:25,040
oh my god, he did it.

1682
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:26,040
The perfect lighting.

1683
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:29,040
Oh yeah, we're live.

1684
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:30,040
Or not live.

1685
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:35,040
We're to tape in four, three, two, silent one.

1686
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:36,040
Follow me, follow me.

1687
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:37,040
Are you getting this?

1688
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:38,040
Are you getting this?

1689
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:39,040
We're live on Bean's Bridge.

1690
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:42,040
Reporting from the scene of a bizarre accident,

1691
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:45,040
some kind of hole has been punctured through the structure.

1692
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:51,040
We've got some footage obtained by a consultant earlier tonight.

1693
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:57,040
Once again, I want to stress this was not shot by anybody

1694
01:07:57,040 --> 01:07:59,040
strictly affiliated with Cannes News.

1695
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:00,040
But you can see here, folks,

1696
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:03,040
you can see here the extraordinary footage captured earlier tonight

1697
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:05,040
showing what we're approaching the hole now.

1698
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:07,040
You can probably see in the insert, again, the footage.

1699
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:10,040
The two of you are walking up to where the rest of the media

1700
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:14,040
has bottlenecked up and there's big kind of wooden structures

1701
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:17,040
with four legs and a bar across the top.

1702
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:21,040
Table?

1703
01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:23,040
It's sawhorses, right?

1704
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:24,040
Yeah.

1705
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:28,040
Long ones.

1706
01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:30,040
You mean like just a barricade?

1707
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:31,040
You're right.

1708
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:32,040
Yep, it's a barricade.

1709
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:33,040
There's a bunch of them.

1710
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:37,040
And they're keeping the media at arm's length here.

1711
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:41,040
But if you zoom in past the shoulder of Mr. Cal Colorado,

1712
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:47,040
you can see that they're whole, that there are people of all sorts of dress

1713
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:52,040
walking around, taking samples, taking pictures, taking video, all sorts.

1714
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:56,040
I want to scan the crowd whether it's with a camera or not for Stevie.

1715
01:08:56,040 --> 01:09:00,040
Maybe I'm just holding it on the area and looking my head around.

1716
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:02,040
Is Stevie around?

1717
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:05,040
Go ahead and roll search at a negative 40.

1718
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:10,040
Would have been a pass, but it's a fail.

1719
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:12,040
Can I aid his search maybe?

1720
01:09:12,040 --> 01:09:15,040
You can also roll search if you would like since you just failed.

1721
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:19,040
I'd like to roll search and I'd like to maybe try to bump up something on my search

1722
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:21,040
by calling Stevie's phone.

1723
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:23,040
Oh, okay. Yeah, that sounds great.

1724
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:24,040
90.

1725
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:32,040
You convince yourself that the noise that you're hearing in the back of your head

1726
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:36,040
is just because you think you're expecting to hear a ringtone?

1727
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:39,040
Beck, I can't hear shit over these throngs.

1728
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:45,040
Beck, like when you're on camera, it never talks to you,

1729
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:48,040
so he just does a nod from behind the camera.

1730
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:53,040
Cal's feeling a little frosty and there's maybe a side of him

1731
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:56,040
you haven't really seen in his professional newsman days,

1732
01:09:56,040 --> 01:10:00,040
but you know he did some of this roving reporting when he was younger

1733
01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:05,040
and without any sleep, you're worried about the glint you see in his eye

1734
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:08,040
and he gives you a big wink and he says,

1735
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:11,040
All right, Beck, just remember, act like you're supposed to be there.

1736
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:14,040
And Cal just moves one of the barricades aside and slips on through

1737
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:18,040
and mushens you in and we start heading straight for somebody with authority.

1738
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:20,040
Beck does, just follows the lead.

1739
01:10:20,040 --> 01:10:23,040
Yes. Oh, fuck yeah.

1740
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:25,040
Well, I guess we'll see what happens the next time.

1741
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:29,040
We can come back inside for now.

1742
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:32,040
I should mention that this is a terrible idea

1743
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:35,040
because I don't have a skill that I can succeed on basically.

1744
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:40,040
All you have to do is film, baby.

1745
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:05,040
And it's all my fault.
