00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,160
Greetings, friends of all shapes and sizes, especially those that are octagonally inclined.

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,200
This is Wolf from the past, hitting you in the present, so that you can have a brighter

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,200
future.

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:23,440
And the future is always looking bright here on 694.2 PTBP, contentions only time travel

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,560
and pirate radio show.

6
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:31,800
Squares need not apply, because only the dopest geometry is invited to listen in on

7
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,240
this week's Howlin' with Wolf.

8
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:40,720
This week's Howlin' with Wolf comes from Matt in Singapore, aka at taffysaint, who tweeted

9
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:44,020
about the show and tagged that pretending pod.

10
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:45,020
They write,

11
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:51,000
Wolf, since the advent of digital radio and interwebs, we've been able to tap into your

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,440
dulcet-toned broadcast all the way out here in Singapore.

13
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:01,760
The trouble in contention sounds troubling, but I am sure what people remain are pleased

14
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,960
that you are there to recap the tragedy on a weekly basis.

15
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:12,160
I know when I am facing supernatural terrors from beyond time and space, it's useful to

16
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:19,080
have someone remind me what just happened, just in case there is a tentacle or proboscis

17
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,040
that escaped my notice.

18
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,960
Anyway, impending apocalypse aside, I hope all is well with you.

19
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:31,200
Your broadcasts have inspired me to seek a group of plucky idiots of my own out here

20
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:37,840
to help, ineptly, continue the fight for all that is right in the world, or at least some

21
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,720
unclaimed drug money.

22
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,520
Either or is fine.

23
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,880
Well, thanks for writin', Matt in Singapore.

24
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,560
All is well with your number one slime puppy, Wolf the dog.

25
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:55,080
I'm always gonna be here to remind y'all about all them tentacles that can creep up

26
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,080
on ya.

27
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,440
Y'all like hentai?

28
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,000
I certainly might.

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,760
But anyway, I'm glad to hear you are takin' up arms with a new crew out of the blue.

30
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,440
I got a couple tips for y'all.

31
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:15,120
Make sure you get eight hours of sleep, focus on work-life balance, and eat as much trash

32
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,960
meat as you can.

33
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:22,280
Remember, if you wanna write up somethin' for your wolf to how, tag at PretendingPod

34

37
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,240
Fuck Mark Zuckerberg, reptilian-ass powerlicker.

38
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:47,000

The sixth one comes out this week, and it's straight up some BTS action.

41
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:06,280
It may be the sixth Patreon exclusive episode, but it's our session zero for this whole campaign,

42
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:11,000
in which we discuss PC creation and fleshed out the town of contention.

43
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,080
Speaking of this campaign, what also has a shitload of gas in the tank and isn't slowin'

44
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,220
down anytime soon?

45
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:21,160
It's the news.

46
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:28,360
Last time, Jeremy Pettymore pacified a tied-up, bloody, muddy, naked man with teeny meat cylinders.

47
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:33,520
Ash took off back down the trail to tell Buzz, the ranger from the state, they had found

48
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,640
one of the missing persons.

49
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:41,760
Ken Krinklehoff met up with Jeremy after not running into Ash on the trail, and he takes

50
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,960
issue with Jeremy's new friend Rusty.

51
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:53,200
After being spooked by Woodrow, Judy Krinklehoff, Sharon Shadow Berryman, and Liz Lonklin answered

52
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,880
the ranger from state's questions.

53
00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:01,480
Judy doused her arms in hand sanitizer and is deeply worried about her mother, Krista

54
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:06,240
Krinklehoff's minivan in the parking lot of the contention woods.

55
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:13,760
Liz tried to, down low, too slow, Woodrow's hand sanitizer squirt and failed, while Shadow

56
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:19,360
decided hand sanitizer would skewer her connection with the earth and the moon and such.

57
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:25,200
The three then saw dripping of blood from the back of Woodrow's neck, staining his shirt.

58
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:31,160
Ash Hornbeam got lost in the woods, saw Tree with a bright light shining from a forearm

59
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:37,320
sized hollow, and avoided a hidden tripwire before sticking his arm right on in that there

60
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,280
tree hollow.

61
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,260
This was a pretty alarming decision.

62
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:46,720
He seems to have risked his life with this one.

63
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,520
He'll have to take on any monsters in the woods single-handedly.

64
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,520
You hear that?

65
00:04:52,520 --> 00:05:00,560
That's the sound of one hand clapping for Blue False Indigo with Moon Dance.

66
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:05,360
She runs.

67
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,360
She runs.

68
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,360
She runs.

69
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,360
She runs.

70
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,360
She runs.

71
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,360
The sun.

72
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,360
The sun.

73
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:27,360
The sun is sleeping soon.

74
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,360
She knows.

75
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:44,560
She knows that the time has come to dance beneath the, dance beneath the shadow of the

76
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:54,560
moon.

77
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,560
I'm just like, uh, dude, did you know that you're bleeding out of your head?

78
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,760
Oh, goodness gracious.

79
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:04,760
I lent my first aid kit to some nice young gentleman earlier and I wish they would have

80
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,760
left it with me.

81
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:10,760
So I actually have a first aid kit in my Lamborghini.

82
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:17,760
I call it my Lamborghini.

83
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,760
I could patch you up if you let me use your machete.

84
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,760
Oh, that is an interesting trade proposition.

85
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:29,960
I will give you a roll of persuasion with a plus 40 since you're trading such an enticing

86
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,960
offer.

87
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,960
25 on a 60.

88
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,960
Congratulations for passing.

89
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,960
I will absolutely take you up on that offer.

90
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,960
So he grabs the machete off the back wall and he hands it to you.

91
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,960
Now, I'm really hoping that you never use this.

92
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,960
I'll use it if I want to use it, but thank you.

93
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,160
If there's any brush in your way, it's likely to be mint there.

94
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,160
All right.

95
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,160
Yeah.

96
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,160
I'm going to file that away.

97
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,160
Okay.

98
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:12,160
So I go grab my first aid kit from my Lamborghini and I also grab one extra vial for his blood.

99
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,160
Interesting.

100
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,160
All right.

101
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,160
So as you patch him up, are you taking a sample of this blood?

102
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,160
He can't tell though.

103
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,160
It's on the back of his neck.

104
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,160
All right.

105
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,360
I'm going to do it for me.

106
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,360
10%.

107
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,360
All right.

108
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,360
A three.

109
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,360
Wow.

110
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,360
That's dope.

111
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,360
Means good.

112
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,360
Yeah.

113
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,360
Dope means good, Allie.

114
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,360
Unless it's drugs, which are also good.

115
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,360
Just kidding.

116
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,360
Don't you judge?

117
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,360
Yeah.

118
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,360
We're an anti-drug podcast.

119
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,360
Everybody knows that.

120
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,360
For all the 13 year olds and below.

121
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,360
Also the ones about drugs.

122
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,360
The ones about drugs.

123
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,360
I'm just kidding.

124
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,360
I'm just kidding.

125
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,360
I'm just kidding.

126
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,360
I'm just kidding.

127
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,360
I'm just kidding.

128
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,360
I'm just kidding.

129
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,360
I'm just kidding.

130
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,360
I'm just kidding.

131
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,360
I'm just kidding.

132
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,360
I'm just kidding.

133
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,360
I'm just kidding.

134
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,560
We're also the ones above 13.

135
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,560
Yeah.

136
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,560
I was going to say, I think our main listener group is like 45-ish.

137
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,560
Don't do drugs, dads.

138
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,560
If you're 14, you're in.

139
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,560
If you're 14, you're in.

140
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,560
Yeah.

141
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:03,560
Dads, wait till your kids are 14 until you start doing drugs again.

142
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,560
Taylor's coughing like so much.

143
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,560
It's like she's trying to sabotage us.

144
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,560
I'm just like trying to make this about me.

145
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,560
All righty.

146
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:21,760
So, with all of that taken care of, what are you bringing with you into the woods?

147
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,560
Did you bring any camping gear?

148
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:27,160
Were you planning on spending the night or are you just out here to do this and then

149
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,160
go back home?

150
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,160
We have some blankets.

151
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:34,360
I was told that this was a sleepover at Shadow's, so I just have my footie pajamas and my sleeping

152
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,360
bag.

153
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,360
I have no other thing.

154
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,360
And my toothbrush, obviously.

155
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,360
Obviously.

156
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,560
I have a lighter, obviously, and cigarettes, and a pocket knife.

157
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,560
Naturally.

158
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,560
Notch.

159
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:54,660
I have some crystals and a first aid kit, and I would definitely have other helpful

160
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,960
and useful items.

161
00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:00,160
Well, you would certainly have the left pinky of a deceased squirrel.

162
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,160
Correct.

163
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,160
A...

164
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,160
A vial of my own blood.

165
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,160
Correct.

166
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,160
A vial of Woodrow's blood.

167
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:15,460
A bucket full of the soil from underneath a calf that was menstruating.

168
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,460
That's correct.

169
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,460
And...

170
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,460
Some bird poop.

171
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,460
Peat.

172
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,460
Yes.

173
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,460
Some strained out bird urine.

174
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,960
Did we use a sieve?

175
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,960
Yeah.

176
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,960
100%.

177
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,960
Yes.

178
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,360
Is Judy into gold digging?

179
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,360
Is that what a sieve is?

180
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,360
I don't know what a sieve is.

181
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:35,360
A sieve is not for gold digging.

182
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,360
Okay.

183
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,360
And I'll leave it at that.

184
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,360
Okay, so sifter...

185
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,960
Alright, let's get you guys into the woods.

186
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:47,660
You take everything that you brought with you into the woods, and you head down to a

187
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:50,360
designated camping spot.

188
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:56,460
The camp spots in the Woods of Contention traditionally have wood and a fire pit built

189
00:09:56,460 --> 00:10:01,660
up and ready to go for each individual spot to make it easy for anyone who's spending

190
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:04,360
time there to immediately start a fire.

191
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:10,160
However, when you get to yours, you see that there are no rocks surrounding your fire

192
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,160
pit.

193
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,160
There's plenty of wood.

194
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,260
However, no rocks to speak of.

195
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:19,560
So if you were to start a fire, you think it might catch the woods on fire.

196
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,560
All of them.

197
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,760
Judy's very concerned about that.

198
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,060
I'm just going to start looking around for some bigger rocks to see if I can make some

199
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,060
kind of barrier.

200
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:33,260
Well, I just normally want to understand the soil below me because I don't really feel

201
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:39,060
like I can be a part of our ritual unless we're all in this together, meaning the earth

202
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:42,060
and the trees and the sky and the moon.

203
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:52,060
So I'm doing a little bit of swaying in the wind.

204
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,460
And Judy, what is Judy doing?

205
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,060
Just staring at where rocks were?

206
00:10:55,060 --> 00:11:00,660
Yeah, Judy's just desperately looking for something to cling to as far as emotion.

207
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,960
She's really terrified already.

208
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,960
She's coming to grips with the fact that she's going to be out in the dark.

209
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,960
And Liz is already left to go look for rocks.

210
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,960
Yeah, Liz is gone.

211
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:12,360
So yeah, Judy's just standing around looking for comfort.

212
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,360
And I keep being like, Judy, sway with me.

213
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,360
Shadow?

214
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:20,360
Maybe we should just find a nice place to brush our teeth?

215
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,160
Maybe in a pond somewhere that is nice?

216
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,360
You're going to brush your teeth with pond water?

217
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,360
Oh, you're right.

218
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,360
Why would I do that?

219
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,360
That's so stupid.

220
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:32,760
Maybe we should go look for your mom, Judy.

221
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:37,160
Okay, Shadow, I really need you to stop saying that because you know how nervous that makes

222
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,960
me think that my mom is out here.

223
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:42,660
Someone definitely stole her car like Elizabeth said.

224
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,360
From like forever away, I'm like, Judy, your mom's fine.

225
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,360
Yeah, you're right.

226
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,360
Anything you say is right and always.

227
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:11,960
Lindsay, Liz is walking up out of your little camping spot and looking for these big rocks.

228
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:17,260
So first, I am going to request a sanity roll.

229
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,260
First one.

230
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,260
That means something's coming.

231
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,400
You've played D&D before.

232
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,360
You ain't rolled a sanity check.

233
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,360
Oh, fuck.

234
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,360
What'd you roll?

235
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,360
If I roll a double zero and eight, that's 100.

236
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,360
That's a pass.

237
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,360
All right, all right, all right.

238
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,360
So you rolled an eight.

239
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,360
I rolled an eight.

240
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,360
Yes.

241
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,960
Under your sanity, which your sanity is?

242
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,960
My sanity is 50.

243
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:42,660
Okay, so you're going to change your current sanity to 49 because you lose one sanity as

244
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:47,820
the world around you begins to kind of warp and change.

245
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:52,580
You were just looking through these woods for rocks and you could not find any and then

246
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:56,760
all of a sudden you are seemingly standing in a different spot in the woods.

247
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,760
All right.

248
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,760
Roll a surge for me.

249
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,760
21.

250
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,760
On?

251
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,760
On.

252
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,760
A 50.

253
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,760
Oh, congratulations.

254
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,760
All right, thank you.

255
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,480
So you're going to find a couple of things.

256
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:17,100
So you turn back and you don't recognize the path that you just took to walk out here,

257
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:23,240
but looking forward, you do see a few rocks, big rocks, and next to them, even bigger rocks.

258
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:30,640
And these bigger rocks have a cleavage that you can see right over.

259
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:41,820
And you see there's an extremely fit man in his mid 40s and he is bald and he has a super

260
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:50,280
cut jaw line, like a big jaw line with some one day scruff, single day scruff.

261
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:56,960
And he is walking around in circles with his hands just like waving all about and he seems

262
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,280
to be like talking to himself.

263
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,080
Judy Krinklehoff.

264
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,360
Hello.

265
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:23,800
You are standing near Shadow who is swaying and staring up at the moon and digging her

266
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:30,800
toes into the dirt beneath trying to become a moon baby.

267
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,800
A maybe.

268
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,800
A maybe.

269
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,800
Is what it's called.

270
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,800
If you won't.

271
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:41,160
And as that happens, I need you to roll a sanity check at a negative 40.

272
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,160
What is your sanity?

273
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,720
My sanity is at a 40.

274
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,720
Oh, right.

275
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,960
So if you roll a zero zero one, that would be a success.

276
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,640
But if your dice match, then it'll be a critical failure.

277
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,400
Sounds great.

278
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,400
I rolled a 98.

279
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:59,000
Oh my God, that's incredible.

280
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,120
So that's terrible.

281
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,120
And you failed miserably.

282
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,120
Cool.

283
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:06,680
I'm going to need you to roll a D six, which is the normal die in order to see how much

284
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,280
sanity you lose.

285
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,280
Okay.

286
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,640
I roll a five.

287
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,640
Okay.

288
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,760
You're going to go batshit crazy.

289
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:21,280
So when you lose five or more sanity in one go, you automatically will have a bout of

290
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:24,960
insanity is how we're going to play it for this little story.

291
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:30,040
That means that you will either have a faint, flight, or flight.

292
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,480
Did I say flight twice?

293
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,480
Who knows?

294
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,320
Flight, fight, or faint are the three options for your character.

295
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:41,160
So let's rank them in most to least likely for Judy.

296
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,960
So what would be the most likely thing for Judy to do in this situation?

297
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,960
Judy would faint.

298
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,960
Faint.

299
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,840
So if you roll a one, two, or three on the D six, then Judy will faint.

300
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:53,240
And what would be the second most likely flight that makes sense.

301
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,120
So if you roll four or five, she'll run away.

302
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:59,280
And then if you roll a six, she will get extremely aggressive.

303
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,280
Okay.

304
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,280
Sounds great.

305
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,520
Go ahead and roll that D six.

306
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,840
I got a five.

307
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:10,920
So Judy is going to freak out and take off running, but you look over and you see shadow

308
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:18,160
swaying and her swaying begins to become one with the trees behind her and the trees are

309
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:25,520
swaying and then the ground starts moving from underneath you and you lose touch with

310
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:31,920
your own sense of direction and the sky above you turns into the ground and everything is

311
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:37,440
upside down and the ground underneath you is above you in the sky and your feet are

312
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:45,760
on top of your head playing patty cake with your hands and you cannot tell what is reality

313
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:49,320
and you need to get away from this place.

314
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,320
So won't Taylor come back in?

315
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:13,560
Hey Taylor, Hey.

316
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:21,920
So shadow is swaying in the wind and trying to become a maybe a maybe a moon baby.

317
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,920
Yeah.

318
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23,920
Mm hmm.

319
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,920
Yeah.

320
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,920
That's a term I made up and I knew it already.

321
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,920
Yep.

322
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,920
Yep.

323
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,920
Everyone knew it.

324
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,920
Duh.

325
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,880
You look over and you see Judy and Judy doesn't look like Judy.

326
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,880
Like her normal.

327
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,880
Judy.

328
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,880
Hey Judy.

329
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,880
Hi.

330
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,880
How are you doing?

331
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,880
Don't talk to me.

332
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,880
You look like a tree.

333
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,360
How long have you been a tree?

334
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:47,240
I mean in spirit I've always seen myself more like a pebble but like a tree is strong and

335
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,240
powerful too.

336
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,240
So I'll take it.

337
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,240
Stop talking to me.

338
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,240
Oh my God.

339
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,240
I can't do this anymore.

340
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,240
I have to go right now.

341
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,240
Oh my God.

342
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,240
I have to run to safety.

343
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,240
Wait.

344
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,240
Where is safety?

345
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,240
I don't know.

346
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,240
Just don't talk to me.

347
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,240
You're a freaking tree.

348
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,240
And then Judy runs off into the woods.

349
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,720
I sigh heavily.

350
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,480
I say pardon me moon.

351
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,480
Just give me a minute.

352
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,280
I grab the machete and I run after her.

353
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:12,000
I should also add that Judy has put on her footie pajamas at this point.

354
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,280
Oh of course.

355
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,160
So she's wearing those as she's running off.

356
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,040
Does she have her toothbrush in her hand?

357
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,040
Oh it's in her pocket.

358
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,040
In her hand.

359
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,040
Oh and cute.

360
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:23,040
It's a zip up pocket so it'll stay in no matter what.

361
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:40,240
Shadow.

362
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,260
You were talking to Judy and she called you a tree.

363
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:46,120
If you were a tree what kind of tree would you be?

364
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:50,480
I would be a strong cherry oak elm.

365
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,480
Wow.

366
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,980
And suicide.

367
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:54,980
Tree form.

368
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:55,980
All mixed together.

369
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:59,160
For those of you who don't know.

370
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,160
What do you do when Judy just takes off running?

371
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,520
I'm used to Judy being a little bit erratic.

372
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:08,260
I'm also up for a little bit of adventure in the night.

373
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:13,120
I just sort of assume that like the forest will take us where it wants to take us.

374
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:17,960
And so I follow suit to find our destiny.

375
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:23,240
Oh okay so are you going to follow her in the same direction at the same clip or are

376
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,380
you just walking?

377
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:25,800
How are you doing about this?

378
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,800
I would say it's somewhere in between.

379
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,760
I'm definitely not walking.

380
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:35,160
I'm kind of I'm like leaping through the forest.

381
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,200
I love it.

382
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:41,360
And I have like these attached veils they attach to my thumb and they're almost like

383
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,440
these wings but just of like meshy material.

384
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,440
What?

385
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:51,120
So when I leap through it's almost like I'm a dancer but they kind of like float like

386
00:19:51,120 --> 00:20:07,560
little ribbons out.

387
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,560
Lindsay.

388
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,560
Yes.

389
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:14,880
Liz is standing at a bit of a clearing here and she's looking at these big rocks and in

390
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:21,600
between a nice cleavage of rocks you have seen this man who is waving his arms about

391
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:29,680
and talking to himself and he is bald and has some scruff and a big jawline seems to

392
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:36,800
be in his mid-40s and I need you to roll an alertness check for me.

393
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:41,400
49 on a 50.

394
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,360
Congratulations.

395
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,640
So you're gonna see a couple things.

396
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:51,480
The first thing you are going to see is that the trees directly in the area that seemed

397
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:59,720
to be making a circle around this clearing all have a very specific sigil carved into

398
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,720
them.

399
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:05,760
It is like a single line with three lines coming off the top and two lines coming off

400
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:11,600
the bottom and it looks like kind of a like a branch of some sort and you would also notice

401
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:18,400
inside the clearing where this man is he is surrounded in a circle of a white substance.

402
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,840
Are we talking like coke or like liquid white?

403
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,840
Not liquid.

404
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,840
All right.

405
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:35,080
I know we were both thinking milk but it is a powder of some sort so that is what you

406
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,080
see.

407
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,520
What action would you like to take here?

408
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:41,200
I think as Liz, okay Liz.

409
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,200
You do think as Liz.

410
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:46,800
I think as Liz, yeah that's not how I'm thinking.

411
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:50,360
I think I'm gonna try and get the fuck out of there I don't think I'm gonna want to mess

412
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,360
with any of it.

413
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:55,320
Okay then let's roll a check against each other real quick you're gonna roll stealth

414
00:21:55,320 --> 00:22:01,080
I'm gonna roll his alertness and we'll see if he sees you.

415
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:04,000
Okay all right I'm ready I'm rolling for stealth.

416
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
That is correct.

417
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,200
85 on a 50.

418
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,120
That is a fail.

419
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:17,360
That is a fail and so you are staring at him and then you take a step backward and just

420
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:21,720
crunch down on a big old stick, crack!

421
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:26,200
And it echoes throughout this little clearing that he's in and he immediately looks over

422
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:32,920
makes direct eye contact with you and he's waving you forward and he wants you to he

423
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:36,800
wants you to join him and he's like oh you gotta get around from over there you know

424
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:43,520
you gotta use a bit of my shiver in the woods you know it's not gonna find you if you didn't.

425
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:49,160
All right Liz finds this guy attractive so I mean he's talking to me now I'm gonna go

426
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:56,240
towards him okay okay probably mistake you are approaching the white powdery line and

427
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:01,920
he's like oh hey if we're gonna stop before you touch on it if you don't you step right

428
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:06,640
over it instead of messing but all right she steps over it and walks over to him and he

429
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:11,760
immediately like runs up to you and is and is like what are you doing out here if it's

430
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,040
not a problem in the night it's the sky's about to turn.

431
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,400
What the fuck are you doing out here also where are you from?

432
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:21,260
I you know across the sea came over for a bit of business but a lot of shit's happened

433
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:26,160
since then you gotta keep safe gotta keep safe there's nothing about the fish out here

434
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:30,640
so we gotta find it if it's not here then she can't find us and and if she can't find

435
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,640
us then it's safe so.

436
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,560
Who is she what are you talking about?

437
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,560
The lady in the wood.

438
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,560
Oh fuck.

439
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:40,920
Oh fuck is right oh fuck is damn right if you can't come around here yeah I've set up

440
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:45,560
a bit of a perimeter so if you stay here with me you're gonna be safe but if you leave it's

441
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,860
over.

442
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:53,100
And he walks back towards his campsite and you see on the back of his neck he has a tattoo

443
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:59,720
and it is like a stylized H so the two sides are kind of like curved in so it'd be like

444
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:04,960
a backwards C and then a normal C with a line going through the middle of them.

445
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:11,240
He doesn't have much with him he's set up like a little camp but he doesn't even have

446
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,720
like a bag with him.

447
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,960
Is his camp like within the circle of this white powder?

448
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:20,840
Yes and the circle of white powder is probably 50 feet diameter 25 feet radius.

449
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:25,880
Can I can I ask you do I trust this person?

450
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,520
Go ahead and roll humant.

451
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:37,200
I got a 41 on a oh shit.

452
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,680
That's a fail I bet.

453
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,800
Yeah I mean it's marked out so.

454
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,800
So how do you feel about it?

455
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,200
Wait wait wait wait on a 30.

456
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:48,160
On a 30 so that is a fail yes and how do you personally Lindsay outside of the game feel

457
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,160
about this character?

458
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:55,200
I'm feeling kind of sketchy I mean I just walked away from people that I've known and

459
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:01,040
there's a strange man he's attractive so there's like 10% 10% wanting I want to trust

460
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,040
him.

461
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,040
Sure.

462
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,040
Yeah but I don't.

463
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:07,680
Attractive people do have it easier in life just in general true it is a privilege especially

464
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:13,600
for people like Liz I wake up every day and I'm just like oh thank you so much lord and

465
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:21,040
savior same yeah so you you feel however you want to feel about him and he's like oh you

466
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:26,240
have to stay here it's nightfall at this point and if you leave you'd absolutely get

467
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:31,520
in thought so there's there's no way around here you know it's got to be with the fishes

468
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:37,600
and we've got to keep it left right upside down sideways I mean your feet might be where

469
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:44,200
my head is but we can't see it anywhere and there's accent changes all right so what if

470
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:49,200
I try can I just try and run back in the direction that I came yeah absolutely I'm gonna try

471
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,520
and do that what do I roll for?

472
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:55,560
You don't have to roll anything he's gonna call after you and he's just like oh no no

473
00:25:55,560 --> 00:26:01,280
you got oh god damn you gotta fucking get got there's not a chance that you're not gonna

474
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:12,680
get got okay cool but I'm out of there right yeah you're out there now what roll a survival

475
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:25,480
check to see if you can make it back to your campsite 91 on a 40 hell yeah hell yeah dude

476
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:31,400
all right am I out now yeah you lost you're done uh bye dead yeah okay bye you're dead

477
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:37,440
you're not dead you're still alive you're just lost okay as Liz Lonklin is walking through

478
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:45,560
the woods desperately trying to find her campsite she loses track of where she is and the sun

479
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:54,940
is starting to go down you see through the trees this brightly colored vest almost cheetah

480
00:26:54,940 --> 00:27:01,840
print but more of a cheetah print houndstooth mix what the hell and uh Luke if you want

481
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:08,120
to describe the predicament Ash is currently in Ash currently has his arm almost up to

482
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:14,640
his elbow in a tree and you can see around kind of shining out of the tree of very bright

483
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:22,160
light you can also as you get closer about an inch of my skin below my elbow is completely

484
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:26,920
ripped off down to the hand no like my whole hand is in the tree but about this much of

485
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:35,080
it is is ripped off okay like just muscle and fat fibrous blood you guys remember that scene in

486
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:41,600
127 hours when James Franco like cuts his nerve didn't watch it yeah that was hard to watch shits

487
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:47,400
fucking nuts dude one thing about that is if he was a true actor he would have actually cut his

488
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:53,120
arm oh you didn't hear about that yeah really he did so the whole thing off it's prosthetic now

489
00:27:53,320 --> 00:28:00,360
just like everyone in Hollywood's teeth are fake right he has a fake arm cool so Liz that's what

490
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:06,960
you see as you approach you can also see Ash has tears streaming down his face from pain but you

491
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:12,880
he's not outwardly panicked but inside he definitely is Ash hornbeam I'm like startled

492
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:19,840
and I'm like oh hey Liz what are you doing out here me and the guys are well we're on a

493
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:25,520
camping trip but I kind of got lost I don't something really weird happened I don't know

494
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:32,640
where the hell I am and my arm is stuck in this tree yeah what's wrong with your arm what happened

495
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:38,440
to you I don't know if I can pull it out anymore because it feels like there are razor blades on my

496
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:44,600
arm in here and I was lost and I saw this tree and there's a hole in it with light coming out

497
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:53,000
and I I just stuck my arm in it and now it's stuck and it hurts really bad and I don't I drop

498
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:58,440
my axe back at the campsite so I don't really have anything to get out of here with do you have any

499
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:02,240
idea how you could help me I don't do I have any weapons or anything I don't have anything on me

500
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:07,720
I don't think you brought anything yeah I mean I would say go back to the campsite but I don't

501
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:12,240
know where that is yeah I'm also lost I don't know I just came from a place with some crazy

502
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:17,000
bald man surrounded in coke the reason that I got lost I was going back to the shack because there

503
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:23,000
was a crazy naked man that was all cut up and we tied him up and he also couldn't talk and he tried

504
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,280
to eat our food and he sounded like an animal what the fuck is going on out here I don't know

505
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:33,360
but my main priority right now is to get out of this fucking tree and I pull my arm about half an

506
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:41,840
inch out a little more lose another hit point and you feel your skin rip off the first three layers

507
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:49,080
of your skin are completely gone and blood begins running down your elbow and dripping onto the

508
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:57,400
ground and as you look down you see that the grass where it's dripping is dead can I like look around

509
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:04,160
and try oh by the way watch out for that trip wire there is there it is that's what I was about to

510
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:12,280
implement if you say that in time then I won't have her hit it so he calls out about a trip wire

511
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:19,000
and looking down right where you were about to step mm-hmm there is a wire that is running across

512
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:28,120
from a tree to a post in the ground I feel helpless that is part of the game yep can I go ahead and

513
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:32,000
roll a sanity check for me both of you because you do not know how to get out of the situation

514
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:39,280
and helpless is the exact word that I could use to describe this sanity check I got a 93 that is a

515
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:47,240
failure 34 on 44 so you're good so you're gonna keep a level head because your arms not trapped

516
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:52,640
in this tree yeah and you're starting to realize that yeah you might have to be the one to leave

517
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:59,840
and call for help Luke you are going to lose a single sanity putting your sanity down to 37 and

518
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:07,680
ash starts to freak out a little more and Liz can tell that I am very panicked I you freak out

519
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:15,080
enough to wear a little fun rule about this game is that when you lose sanity the handler can make

520
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:20,720
an action for you awesome so it'll be helpful and my arm will be out of here after that when you

521
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:28,280
lose that sanity you freak out enough to rip at your arm and try to pull it out without bracing

522
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:37,040
yourself and you pull your arm out another like three inches and you lose three hit points putting

523
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:44,840
your hit points at two Luke ash hornbeam needs to roll a constitution check in order to stay

524
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:56,240
conscious here 29 on a 45 oh you are allowed to keep your head however you are not allowed to keep

525
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:02,440
your cool I throw up yeah out of pain and panic calm down please stop pulling your arm out of the

526
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:09,800
tree hang on hang on just a second hang on just stay still and then I'm gonna be like help

527
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:20,600
anyone around you laugh maniacally after yeah I'm a bitch remember now that my arm is probably

528
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:31,720
there's more room around it right yet it is still just as as well as early pinched I really I don't

529
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:36,320
have any idea what to do right now okay I'm just gonna I'm just gonna like start looking for help

530
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:40,720
help help I start like running away I'm looking for somebody I'm gonna leave them cuz I can't do

531
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:47,000
anything yeah I like I've almost forgot that she's even here cuz I'm just looking at six inches of

532
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:53,840
my arm completely shed of skin oh what is that that's that's a nerve you can see it uh-huh it's

533
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:59,720
like just like in 127 hours it's like 127 hours yeah so I'm just standing here just staring at

534
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:04,800
it like in shock like look off I've started to say something to Liz but she's gone I'm out

535
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:26,160
Judy Krinkelhoff is running sprinting through the woods trees are lashing her body but she's paying

536
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:33,080
it no mind as the world around her is melting and contorting and convulsing all at the same time the

537
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:39,440
earth seems to be pulsating but the ground is the sky and you have no idea what's going on so I'm

538
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:45,640
gonna have you roll either which is higher your survival or your alertness my alertness is higher

539
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:52,040
and what is your alertness I have a 70 so you are going to be rolling at a negative 40 so you

540
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:57,880
need to roll a 30 or under in order to pass this alertness check go and roll those dice for me I

541
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:08,520
got an 11 that is a critical success and the world immediately all at once becomes normal to you as

542
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:16,600
you stop dead in your tracks because right in front of you is very clearly a pile of leaves

543
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:23,800
that is wholly suspicious as if beneath it lies some sort of trap but Judy notices this and stops

544
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:34,480
just before falling prey to this sham leaf pile however Judy is not alone in these woods Sharon

545
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:43,280
shadow Berryman as you are sashaying through the woods chasing after your dear friend Judy

546
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:53,560
crinklehoff I need you to roll an alertness check for me what's your alertness 40 okay I got a 61

547
00:34:53,560 --> 00:35:02,640
all right so you do not see Judy teetering on the edge of destruction as you nonchalantly dance

548
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:08,520
burst onto the scene Ally I want you to roll dexterity and because you crit earlier there's

549
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:13,880
no chance you'll fall into the leaves so you're just rolling to grab shadow and throw her off her

550
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:27,960
path okay I got a 15 whoa so you I already had plans but so shadows like barreling toward you

551
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:35,880
in a very whimsical manner and you see her just in time to grab her and pull her to the edge and

552
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:41,400
the two of you fall and hit the ground and as you do that one of your arms flings out and hits this

553
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:49,400
pile of leaves and immediately the entire pile falls and you look down and you see that there

554
00:35:49,400 --> 00:36:09,560
is a 10-foot drop into a pit below Judy oh my god you saved my life I just sort of thought that

555
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:18,360
maybe fate could take us together down that hole um shadow I am really trying to lose trust in you

556
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:24,040
right now because first you turn into a tree and then you chase me through the trees and try to

557
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:31,880
push me let's talk about that Judy like why am I no no I can't do this right now because I feel

558
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:38,680
like my mind is down that hole right now and I'm just up here without my mind right now do you want

559
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:48,160
to do some breathing exercises with my crystals okay let's go back to the camp and maybe on the

560
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:53,800
way we can pick some flowers and put them in your hair and you'll feel a little better would that

561
00:36:53,800 --> 00:37:04,120
make you feel better Judy it would not who has a better survival check I have 50 I also have 50

562
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:14,240
okay then who wants to roll some dice I really wanted to find a way in this game to use my bird

563
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:19,240
calling sure so I thought maybe now would be a good time I could be like and then the birds

564
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:29,480
would lead us to the camp interesting and how might that work well I would go and they would

565
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:35,360
swoop down and like slowly flap their wings as we danced behind them shadow like knew which

566
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:41,920
birds were like closest to her campsite earlier so you could listen for those bird sounds as

567
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:46,840
opposed to earlier one well okay when I think of bird calling I think of like bird communicating

568
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:52,480
like it's a back-and-forth sure because I'm in that forest all the time 100 and so I have like

569
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:59,840
five bird friends so I would like to use my bird calling and my very accurate and reasonable

570
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:09,360
explanation is that I noticed that there were a line of oak trees right by our campsite and I

571
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:18,200
happen to know that there is a regional canary by the name of Churchill that's its bird species

572
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:27,600
of course yeah and it only nests in oak trees of that age and so I'm listening and right now it's

573
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:37,840
pretty faint but it's coming from the West so we're gonna head west three that's a good rule

574
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:46,400
listening for the sounds of the what was it church an airy yeah the bird which is in the

575
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:56,000
Oaks of a certain age you make your way back and you find your campsite however you do not find a

576
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Liz waiting for you at said campsite but what you do notice is a raccoon a raccoon a raccoon that is

577
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:12,520
sitting on a log that is around the fire like a person might just like cross-legged and it is

578
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:18,320
using its tiny little fingers to eat food any food that you guys might have brought with you

579
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:24,920
it is chowing down on look at that little trash panda oh my god he's so cute I love him so much

580
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:39,440
Oh shadow what is that trash panda that you said um he our good friend really pretty friend Liz

581
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:49,920
what I mean I really love the idea that maybe Liz died and reincarnated very quickly into this

582
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:57,160
little raccoon maybe we should ask it some questions as you guys approach it you see this

583
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:03,800
raccoon it makes eye contact with you and it immediately perks up puts the food down looks

584
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:09,680
at you and then runs over to your bag and starts like throwing shit out of your bags and it's

585
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:16,840
clearly like looking for something I'm gonna watch it because I'm curious to see what it wants oh

586
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:22,400
wait is that the bag that has our potion in it yes whose bag is it who would have brought the most

587
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:28,840
food shadow I feel like shadow did yeah so then it's also the bag with the ingredients for the

588
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:36,400
ritual okay well I still want to kill Brittany just for my own curiosity yeah absolutely so I'm

589
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,640
gonna take off my jacket and I'm gonna walk over there and I'm gonna try to like jump on it and

590
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:47,200
like hold it down with my jacket oh hey what are you doing Judy Judy is pretty fucking anxious

591
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:52,680
right now so she has taken her arms put them inside the sleeves of her onesie that she's

592
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:58,280
wearing in the head crouched down and is just sitting there rocking back and forth saying Liz's

593
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:12,440
name over and over again and shadow I need you to roll an unarmed combat for me I fail and the

594
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:19,200
raccoon succeeds as you attempt to throw your jacket over on top of it it dodges nimbly out

595
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:26,600
of the way and it is holding a bottle of hand sanitizer that I believe Judy brought with her

596
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:34,000
you guys grabbed the hand sanitizer from yeah and the raccoon is holding it and it points at the

597
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:42,080
hand sanitizer and then it like does a thumb underneath its chin and swipes across like cut

598
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:48,240
throat and then it like throws the hand sanitizer on the ground and backs away from it and puts its

599
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:54,280
hands up and then falls over backwards like it's playing dead Judy didn't you use that hand

600
00:41:54,280 --> 00:42:04,240
sanitizer maybe half the bottle on my body but I didn't eat it or anything so I probably am fine

601
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:12,600
or am I gonna die maybe we should use the water canteen and you should take off all your clothes

602
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:19,840
and we can pour the water all over you um shadow I really want to stay in my onesie right now I feel

603
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:26,960
really scared uh maybe we can just wash my hands really good when you say that the raccoon gives

604
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:33,920
you a thumbs up and then motions back down the trail toward the trailhead with its thumb go

605
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:43,640
ahead and roll sanity both of you is that a fail or success it's a success Oh congratulations I

606
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:51,600
got a 63 on the 35 so you Judy are gonna lose one sanity taking you down to 34 dang you have such low

607
00:42:51,600 --> 00:43:00,320
sanity thank you for pointing that out I have 75 listen I'm insane so nothing messes with shadow

608
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:08,040
everything is already messed up in her head and like I'm mighty fine with that absolutely and so

609
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:15,040
Judy you were looking at this raccoon and you do not see a raccoon Taylor go ahead and take your

610
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:21,880
headphones off and plug your ears for me and just wiggle your fingers around in your ears don't get

611
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:29,920
in fact she's already not listening so Ally Judy sees this raccoon and looking in its eyes you see

612
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:37,760
a human soul okay I just see like looking at its motions and his activities you're like that's a

613
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:44,040
person I don't know why that I'm seeing it as a raccoon but that's a person okay all right Taylor

614
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:50,840
and the raccoon is like actively pointing down the trail and is staring at both of you and then

615
00:43:50,840 --> 00:44:00,440
starts like using both thumbs in a like let's get out of here kind of motion please go with the

616
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:07,600
raccoon please I think we should really trust him he seems like a trustworthy animal but as an

617
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:15,480
animal and that I could trust Judy I know you've really been through a lot and I'm just not sure I

618
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:22,960
can trust your judgment right now but lucky for you I really like that little raccoon because he

619
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:32,040
reminds me of my mother or so let's go I like jump up I'm still like cradling my own body at

620
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:36,960
this point but I jump up and I'd start following the raccoon well I'm pretending to be the raccoon

621
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:42,800
as well so I'm kind of like I'm walking on my hearing legs but I kind of keep like little T

622
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:48,200
Rex arms yeah I'm kind of waddling a little yeah just exactly like the raccoon is doing that's

623
00:44:48,200 --> 00:45:12,200
correct Liz lonklin you're walking through the forest through the trees trying to get back to

624
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:21,920
the trail and you come to a spot where you can hear some people talking and as you're walking up

625
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:32,000
you hear a couple voices and then you see hey what are you guys doing right now you're are you still

626
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:44,720
talking to rusty I'm freaking out yeah it's the it's the GM's job to paint a picture we're waiting

627
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:53,120
Liz lonklin you're walking through this massive trees and you are all alone as the Sun is going

628
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:59,400
down it is almost pure darkness and at that point it's a clear sky and the only thing you'll be able

629
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:05,760
to see by is moonlight and you know that and time is running out and you are freaking the fuck out

630
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:12,480
but as you make your way back to the trail you finally find it and as soon as you do you see a

631
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:20,800
campsite just off to the right in which you see Jeremy Pettymore and can clink it crinkle crinkle

632
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:29,160
ha and they are two freshmen from Silas Cole K through 12 Jeremy Pettymore you would know only

633
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:38,680
by name as the whole Pettymore clan is just a full big old family of rust abouts and and there do

634
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:46,120
wells and can clinkle ha fuck me you can call me whatever you want it's crinkle ha can crinkle

635
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:55,200

636
00:46:55,240 --> 00:47:01,200
K through 12 he is the future of this school the two of you would know that Liz lonklin is a total

637
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:08,360
badass always wearing her Doc Martens always disrespecting anyone who steps to her and as the

638
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:13,560
two of you are trying to calm each other down essentially well more so Jeremy is trying to

639
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:22,160
calm down Ken as you're talking to this man who is cut up and bloody and muddy and almost feral

640
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:28,360
but you're you're treating him with some with some nice little winkies and Liz you see this

641
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:37,080
as you approach their campsite winky wanky wanky terrible they're little Smokies thank you that's

642
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:44,480
different yeah oh is it yeah what way with little well this is like a feral man you guys don't like

643
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:49,000
it when I describe it in depth you don't like it when I describe it vague no I don't like you

644
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:59,960
describing little Smokies is like little ding dongs little Johnson's small meat fellas there

645
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:09,120
thank you I hear Liz approach and I should ash ash is that you ash no but ash is in trouble who

646

647
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:22,280
Laughlin who the hell are you I see that it's not ash and I go oh fuck and I try to kind of block

648
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:29,680
her view from seeing the tied-up bloody man I think Liz would be one of the few like Jeremy

649
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:33,840
would probably definitely know her from school and the town and she's probably one of the few

650
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:39,600
people he like looks up to and respects absolutely he's a little wannabe Punk too well you are a punk

654
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:08,400

677
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:28,640
board well all right I know associated with wild men ain't the kind of thing that you want to be

00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:34,360
seen around cuz you're you're some kind of fucking you know achiever now and you're better than the

679
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:39,560
rest of us but once you was down in the muck covered in in scratches just like rusty here I

680
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:44,440
don't know what you guys are going through but I ran into some wild man out there in the woods

681
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:49,400
there's more wild man yeah surrounded by like a line of like some kind of white powder and he

682
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:53,720
was telling me that if I leave by myself something will get me so I don't want to leave this guy by

683
00:51:53,720 --> 00:52:01,320
himself yeah we let's take him he is this man is like holding out his hand for another tiny meat

684
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:08,120
fell and I put I put one in there and he immediately just like holds it with fingers of both

685
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:15,080
hands and just like and that's just the cutest and then he smiles and he looks back up at you

686
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:21,920
and he holds out his hand for another can I just look at give Ken I don't like it but can can look

687
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:28,960

688
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:37,000

689
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:52,920
him look at him it happens don't worry yeah when I walked up he was he was covered in blood and

690
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:57,920
he was snarling and gnashing and and there was just there was something in his eyes I could tell

691
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:02,640
that if you've got free he would want to hurt us it's just something I just saw it it was a flash

692
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:09,040
well just keep him tied up and smokey it'll be fine listen for all we know this is Jim

693
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:19,520
Carrey preparing for a role he smiles nods and holds out his hand to Ken oh you're right is Jim

694
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:27,720
Carrey how is he tied up well can he's tied up well he keeps holding out his hand so obviously

695
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:34,320
his hands is free they're bound together and bound to his feet but he just enough to to reach

696
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:39,880
out a little bit for a if his hands are bound to his feet how's he reaching his mouth with the meat

697
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:47,200
he stretched he's stretchy yeah he's bendy stretchy and he's naked how's his dick it's like weird

698

looking we can't leave this poor little dick he'll starve out here with a dick like that

699
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:15,040
so he's not tied up to anything though he's just bound to himself he's yeah he's also tied to the

700
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:29,440
tree yeah I don't want to take this guy with us do you really not want a wild man pet this guy

701
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:39,360

718
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:16,840
with their arms t-rexed in front of them tottering tottering from one side to the left and as you

719
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:27,680
guys make your way back down you see the Sun is setting and it will be very dark very soon what

720
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:33,320
are your guys's hopes and intentions with this trip I hope to look death in the face that's

721
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:38,720
about it that's like my primary goal in life and Ali what about Judy Judy is just really worried

722
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:45,800
right now because she typically brushes her teeth at sunset and she has not been a she can feel like

723
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:52,160
the plaque but she does just like running over her toothpaste if you'll remember in her pocket

724
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:56,440
yeah she has never oh she does have her toothbrush toothpaste in her toothbrush but she's still

725
00:57:56,440 --> 00:58:00,400
really nervous about the hand sanitizer on her hand so she doesn't want to touch are you gonna

726
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:10,080
use lake water to brush your teeth Judy she doesn't know she's very uncertain right now she also is

727
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:15,720
very concerned about Liz but more concerned about her teeth her teeth okay how concerned is she

728
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:24,960
about shadows well-being very little little to none I think about as much as shadow is worried

729
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:33,840
about her so as you guys make your way back down you see the back of the little shack that is where

730
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:39,840
the Ranger sits and you see all the cars in the parking lot all of the same cars are still these

731
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:44,840
mom's cars there yes the minivan is still there is everything in the same condition seemingly yeah

732
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:52,960
is the Ranger still there so as you guys turn the corner hello hello who go who is that and Judy you

733
00:58:52,960 --> 00:59:01,160
would recognize it as your mom's voice is it coming out of her mom it is coming out of the

734
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:13,160
little shack at the trailhead okay shadow I don't want to freak you out but that is my mom yeah

735
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:18,280
that's what I was expecting I really hope that she brought her water bottle so that I could use

736
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:25,160
some of it to brush my teeth we should probably go up there and find her mom mom wait wait wait

737
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:31,160
wait wait Judy I listen to the racoon and I just look over at the racoon and the racoon throws its

738
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:37,760
hands up in a I don't know kind of situation can I pick up the racoon when you try to pick up the

739
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:43,360
racoon it like backs away from you stands its ground gives you a thumbs up okay I return the

740
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:51,520
thumbs up okay it reaches out for a high five I reject the racoon hangs its head and walks back

741
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:56,000
toward the parking lot Judy's starting to get pretty freaked out she really wants she really

742
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:04,400
wants that water bottle for my mom so mom mom mom hello hello is who is that who is there and you

743
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:11,040
see as you turn the corner that Krista Krinklehoff is poking her head out the little window of the

744
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:17,120
shack and is looking around and sees the two of you with a raccoon what are you what what are you

745
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:26,320
guys doing Krista have you used the hand sanitizer um yes as everyone should and then she like grabs

746
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:33,640
a thing of hand sanitizer from behind the bar if you will and puts it up on the little shelf the

747
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:40,600
little little ledge of the shack everyone should be washing their hands as opposed to you know

748
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:47,120
getting all higgledy-piggledy or anything else like you you must use hand sanitizer and not you

749
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:53,200
know bark at knots and you know it's the important thing to do her Krinklehoff household tradition

750
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:57,960
when Judy sees a bottle of hand sanitizer she runs to it and puts it in her hands she's already

751
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:04,920
forgotten that the raccoon told us not to use it and the raccoon will try to stop you from doing

752
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:16,240
this so let's roll a unarmed combat against each other here I got a five on a thirty the raccoon

753
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:22,320
got a four which if we play prices right rules so the highest number wins as long as you stay

754
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:28,920
under your staff so you fight this raccoon off to get some hand sanitizer and you put a bunch

755
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:35,880
in your hands yes that is absolutely right young miss you should definitely be using this I I don't

756
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:41,480
understand why what it is that uh brought made you bring a raccoon with you back out into the

757
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:52,360
parking lot of the woods it's okay it's fine you don't need to look at him or think about him at

758
01:01:52,360 --> 01:02:01,560
all or you even be here even you could why why are you here I would like to humant Krista sure to

759
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:09,640
see if like she's a little brainwashed from the hand sanitizer okay roll a human for me I passed

760
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:18,840
34 and a 40 34 on a 40 would tell you that she is not in the same state that Judy was earlier when

761
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:25,760
she seemed to lose her shit okay daughter I am here because the man who was here earlier asked

762
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:33,800
me to watch his stead for the time being because he heard that there were some some folks out there

763
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:39,040
just wobbling jaws and and and he was afraid that they might you know get their barking irons out

764
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:46,120
and take care of business and we can't have anyone shooting guns and making mayhem out here in the

765
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:51,120
woods with all these missing people Judy is no longer listening to her mom she's digging in her

766
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:54,840
mom's purse to see if she has any water that she can use to brush her teeth she does have some

767
01:02:54,840 --> 01:03:01,800
water and she will you can brush your teeth Judy brushes her teeth do you just do it like standing

768
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:07,000
out yeah she's like hanging her head out the door like ravenously brushing your teeth like it's been

769
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:17,160
years like it's been years so I taught her over to the raccoon mm-hmm and the raccoon like throws

770
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:26,240
its thumb again to the exit of the woods Judy I think that we should go back and get Liz Judy

771
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:33,480
looks up and she has toothpaste all over her mouth she says I really don't want to go back

772
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:39,360
into the woods right now I just want to stay with the raccoon probably you could go maybe

773
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:45,800
alone Judy I'm not sure that anyone could comfort Liz the way that you can you know about your

774
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:54,680
special connection Judy you left your friend Liz out in the woods all alone oh mom you don't need

775
01:03:54,680 --> 01:04:08,240
to worry about that everything is fine Liz is probably just skinny dipping oh my goodness what

776
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:15,440
was your name again mom this is my very best friend shadow so sorry of course shadow shadow

777
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:22,440
you should go back into the woods and grab Liz I will wait here and Judy you can wait here with

778
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:29,600
me and then we will all leave together so Krista as much as I would love to do that because I feel

779
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:36,000
very comfortable and one with everything in nature I'm a little confused as to why you the

780
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:42,160
mother of my best friend would want me to go back into the woods by myself where several people have

781
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:48,200
gone missing okay well I will go back in with you if you would like and Judy you can stay here and

782
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:53,560
wait for us to come back that's a really good idea maybe probably the raccoon should stay with me

783
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:58,640
yes I completely agree okay that's great also could you leave your purse so I could have some

784
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:05,840
of those breath mints I really absolutely okay all right Krista let's have some real bonding time so

785
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:12,320
that maybe for once in your JD life you can remember my name oh you are a little firecracker

786
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:20,360
aren't you thank you Judy wait will you just watch it until the man comes back who's here he's the

787
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:29,440
what was he the the Woodrow fella the the whatever what was his thing he was the Ranger yes until the

788
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:35,080
Ranger comes back if you could stay here and the raccoon friend I suppose can can stay here as

789
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:41,280
well with the breath mints and then she leaves back up the trail with shadow I grab her hand

790
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:47,800
and kind of force her to skip with me into the forest she will reluctantly join you and said

791
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:56,880
skipping okay I might also sing a song oh what would that song be death is all around us just

792
01:05:56,880 --> 01:06:08,520
look at its unrelenting eyes something like that something like that it's unrelenting eyes

793
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:35,840
Judy you've got your breath mints your teeth are brushed you've got your mom's water I need you to

794
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:46,840
roll a sanity check for me I got a 34 on a 34 oh that's a success congratulations you hold it

795
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:53,200
together even though your vision is starting to blur you're still going to lose one sanity okay

796
01:06:53,200 --> 01:07:00,720
but that is just going to make the world around you slowly it's as if it's going to turn the way

797
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:08,320
it did earlier but it doesn't quite make it fully you just see your vision is rippling and the raccoon

798
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:15,920
is walking back from around the side of the building and it looks at you with these dead

799
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:23,760
eyes that are just like horrified and scared and it motions for you to follow it okay and I do it

800
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:30,680
leads you to the small restroom attached to this Rangers welcome shack and as you approach the

801
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:38,840
heavy metal door the Sun finally finishes its shift from the inside of this trailhead restroom

802
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:48,200
we see the scratched up brown door open and Judy Krinklehoff is backlit only by the single

803
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:54,760
flickering light illuminating the contention woods parking area I'm gonna need a sanity check here

804
01:07:54,760 --> 01:08:06,160
yeah 26 on a 33 even with the success you lose one sanity as your mind tries to comprehend what

805
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:11,840
you are seeing she's starting to go a little numb so she's obviously she's freaked out her

806
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:17,080
hands are shaking a little bit and she's breathing a little heavy but she doesn't want to run she's

807
01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:23,760
she just keeps staring at it she can't look away and we zoom up to Judy's shaking hands and her

808
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:36,240
dead stare from her eyes we see the body of Ed buzz Woodrow still in his state ranger uniform

809
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:46,360
but his limp body is on the dirty bathroom floor and it's been folded neatly like a freshly pressed

810
01:08:46,360 --> 01:09:16,240
shirt. She runs. She runs. She runs. The sun is sleeping soon. She knows. She knows.

811
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:32,720
She knows that the time has come to dance beneath the dance beneath the shadow of the moon.

812
01:09:46,360 --> 01:10:13,720
She moves. She moves. She moves with the howling wind. The sun. The sun. The sun has come again.

813
01:10:13,720 --> 01:10:35,560
Her eyes have seen it all. The wonders of the wonders of the shadow of the moon.
