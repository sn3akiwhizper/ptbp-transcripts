1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,160
Cock-a-doodle-doo, my chickadees.

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:06,480
It's your mother hen, T.J. Wolf the dog here,

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,240
to sit on you and increase your body temperatures

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:14,240
with the warm embrace of my bum.

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,520
I am giving you life energizing force

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,400
live from 694.2 PTBP.

7
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,280
The only radio station that broadcasts

8
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:28,400
to all chickens across the dimensions.

9
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,880
All of them hear this.

10
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,160
They all know what you all think about them now.

11
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,880
Be wary and beware.

12
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,920
Hey, lean in close.

13
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,000
Let's shake it up because I've been shook.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,980
This is me beside myself and I'm howling with Wolf

15
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:50,400
at two you slashes who have nailed me to a wall

16
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,140
with a handful of dimes in my mouth.

17
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:57,320
A detailed description by user,

18
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:02,200
resistor0 underscore zero was titled,

19
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:06,440
My View of the Wolf and reads as follows.

20
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,400
Wolf the dog always pops up in my mind

21
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:13,000
as a crusty Chester Cheeto version wolf

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,380
covered in a restaurant trash bag grease.

23
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:17,600
That is all.

24
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,280
Damn, that's fucking cold.

25
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,860
I'm not some Chester Cheeto looking ass.

26
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:26,280
I can maybe assure you of that.

27
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,960
Chester Cheeto wishes he could get close

28
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,520
to my beauty, my grace, my grease.

29
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:38,520
And a sopping wet illustration of supposedly yours truly

30
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:43,080
was provided by user, BlueBlairyBlob.

31
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,840
Is this what I truly look like?

32
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,720
Has anyone ever actually seen me?

33
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,920
Can the human vision orb even perceive me?

34
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,840
What do y'all think I even look like?

35
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,920
Draw them and show them to me

36
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,700
and show them to the internet.

37
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,860
I heard you people love this worldwide web net.

38
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:06,560
Sounds a little spooky to me.

39
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,680
If you want to write up something for your wolf to howl,

40
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,400
tag at pretending pod on the internet

41
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,080
and reveal your true self to your internet friends.

42
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,040
Or I guess do something rad on Reddit.

43
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,460
I'm not sure I'm allowed to ask this of you,

44
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:25,680
but it'd be oily as all get out to see recommendations

45
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,400
for wolf the dog in 694.2 crew on big old internet places

46
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,280
like broad RPG subreddits and niche Facebook groups

47
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,820
and freaky deaky discords.

48
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:43,000
Word of mouth is the word of the mouth.

49
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,720
Spread the word like Uzi Fogg and cover folks

50
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,200
and wolf the dog.

51
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,680
It feels good when you know you've locked

52
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,960
onto a really good new catchphrase.

53
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,840
I'd say that calls for the news.

54
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,960
Last time, the church doors creaked open

55
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,820
and a group of uniform school children

56
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:06,900
took on the steep incline to reach the top of the gorge

57
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:10,880
on the same side where Stevie and the rest of the can crew

58
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,400
were checking on the sopping wet fox godel.

59
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,040
When the party of prep schoolers got close enough,

60
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,760
Beck zoomed in and saw blood on their uniforms.

61
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,780
And also one kid walked on all fours

62
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:28,280
and one was a kangaroo that walked like a dude.

63
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,840
And the last weird one was a humanoid

64
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,400
with the face of a pug.

65
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,060
And that pug face student had a Jaguar on a leash

66
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,280
that eventually jumped toward a bright spotlight

67
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,080
onto the unnaturally smooth cliff face and to its death.

68
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,800
And the city action news field team shot a stunning

69
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,880
little clip with a horrifying background.

70
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:54,160
The gang in the school uniform stood there

71
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,920
unmoving across the rift.

72
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,560
Enough with the rift.

73
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,260
Let's hear a riff.

74
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:03,220
It's Alter Girl with My Life Is Great

75
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,520
and It's All My Fault.

76
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,520
And it's all my fault.

77
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,520
Luke just said he'd say it to your faces.

78
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,400
If you live in Australia, suck it.

79
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,120
Oh my God, that's not the message.

80
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,960
I know that is the, that's the message.

81
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,960
If you live on Australia, you can probably get it.

82
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,120
On Australia?

83
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,160
If you live on Australia, you drink Fosters

84
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,060
out of a ditry dude shaped like a boomerang, bitch.

85
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:03,900
Oh my God.

86
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,860
Anyway, buckle the fuck up.

87
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,460
We're about to kill a kangaroo.

88
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,220
Specifically because it's Australian.

89
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,000
Dog your Barbies.

90
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,260
Dog your Barbies.

91
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,820
Dog your Barbies, bitches.

92
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,500
You better dog your Barbies.

93
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,340
Cause these boys from the Ozarks

94
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,220
are coming from you, Australia.

95
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:29,980
Coming.

96
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:30,820
Coming from you.

97
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:31,640
Coming from you.

98
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,480
Coming from you.

99
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,300
We're coming from you.

100
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,540
We get where you're coming from,

101
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,540
but we're going to kill your kangaroo.

102
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,980
You guys already left.

103
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:41,820
We're coming back.

104
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:42,660
We're coming back.

105
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:43,480
We're coming back.

106
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,320
Just kill him.

107
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:49,100
I got one job on this earth left.

108
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,220
Is that from something?

109
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:57,180
And I got one thing to do right.

110
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,860
One thing before I can pass easy.

111
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,360
And that's make sure that pink group pass hard.

112
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,800
Julius always like, anytime he went to the zoo,

113
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,420
he would see the kangaroos and be like,

114
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,260
I can do that.

115
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,100
I'm totally better than that.

116
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,260
I can do that.

117
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,260
Julius is like, shit animal.

118
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:23,060
He would look down at his thighs and be like, so what?

119
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,700
What about your pouch?

120
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:29,500
That pissed him off.

121
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,940
Cause he didn't have one.

122
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:31,780
Damn.

123
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,140
So he starts wearing a fanny pack

124
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:35,420
and is immensely popular at a young age.

125
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,680
Pretending to marsupial.

126
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,980
Let's go.

127
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:41,140
Let's get 30 seconds of silence actually.

128
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,300
Let's kill this energy.

129
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,140
Agreed.

130
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:46,260
I was going to say kangaroo jack, crocodile Dundee,

131
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,260
a cry in the dark.

132
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:49,300
There was a crocodile person over there too.

133
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,120
That's my bad.

134
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,460
Wearing a school uniform.

135
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,780
No, I was just saying Australian movies.

136
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,160
Oh, yeah.

137
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,460
Are there any others?

138
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:57,540
Are there any?

139
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:58,380
The Sapphires?

140
00:06:58,380 --> 00:06:59,220
No.

141
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:00,620
The proposition.

142
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,260
Ah, the proposal.

143
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:04,780
What's the big epic with Nicole Kidman?

144
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:05,740
Mad Max.

145
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:09,300
I mean, yeah, every Mad Max is an Australian movie.

146
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:13,300
I would watch a Nicole Kidman Mad Max reboot.

147
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,540
She's got, you know, just like bring me

148
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:17,100
to the theater energy these days.

149
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,740
I don't know what it is.

150
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,060
What was that movie, Joe?

151
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,500
The sheep fucker's daughter.

152
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,780
I think that was it.

153
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:29,180
Welcome to episode 17 of Pretending to Be Keep.

154
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:32,700
It looks like we're trending a number one improv podcast

155
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:33,540
in Australia now.

156
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:36,000
We were a number two.

157
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,100
Oh, is that Luxembourg?

158
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,420
Shout out to Luxembourg.

159
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,620
Shout out.

160
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,440
Luxembourgish fans, we have your back

161
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,420
unlike those fucking Australians.

162
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,620
No, I'm like, I want to go to Australia.

163
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,460
It seems so cool.

164
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:53,380
Oh fuck, the movie was called Australia.

165
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,020
Oh no.

166
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:19,980
Either no one's going to listen from now on

167
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,420
or they're going to want this every time.

168
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,660
It's going to be hard to do.

169
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:26,060
Listen next week to see if we pick your country.

170
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,460
Listen two weeks from now.

171
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:30,780
Oops.

172
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:33,100
Or give us money and it will be next week.

173
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:37,060
So everything's fine seemingly.

174
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:38,620
Yeah, everything's fine.

175
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:42,300
Well, we just wrapped our day of shooting.

176
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,740
We got that last little stinger there.

177
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:45,620
It's in the can.

178
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,620
And now we're in the can van.

179
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:51,700
Julius was showing Cal how to use TikTok.

180
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,540
What time is it?

181
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:55,020
I imagine cinematically it was like the sun was setting

182
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,060
as all that happened, right?

183
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,300
Hondo, pee.

184
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:00,620
Yeah, over those angry animal kids, people.

185
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,900
Are they like, are they grownups?

186
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,940
Oh, we're in like.

187
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,540
The kids are the animals.

188
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,200
There's six normal kids and then.

189
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,780
I think there is six kids standing up straight.

190
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:16,460
One extra bloody kid standing up straight who had a name.

191
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:19,680
One who still has a name technically.

192
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,100
We just, we didn't find it out though.

193
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:24,620
Exactly, you know, I'm just describing it as people, right?

194
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:25,980
I forgot to ask them their names.

195
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,300
Yeah, you gotta yell out.

196
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,140
Hey, Stevie, do you know any of those kids' names?

197
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:29,980
No.

198
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:34,980
And you guys saw that there was also the human

199
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:38,260
with the pug head.

200
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,980
That's the one I liked the least.

201
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,540
That's the one that we killed the pet of.

202
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,540
That is correct.

203
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,020
And then there was a kangaroo.

204
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:47,620
So you're not sure of the ages from either of them.

205
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,460
Yeah, the kid who was on the ground is a kid crawling.

206
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:53,100
Yeah, the kid on his knuckles dragging, that's a kid.

207
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:55,540
You've got the pug man.

208
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:58,660
That is a much taller creature, humanoid,

209
00:09:58,660 --> 00:09:59,780
than the children.

210
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,500
And then kangaroo is kangaroo.

211
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,320
Fully kangaroo?

212
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,160
I would say.

213
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,420
Oh no, you said walking kind of human-like.

214
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:09,420
Walking almost up on its toes to walk more human-like.

215
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:11,900
I can't wait until Slide Whistle draws the pug man.

216
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:12,740
Oh.

217
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,500
Please?

218
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,820
Please.

219
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:20,860
And we're reviewing, we're seeing this on video

220
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,700
as we're driving back to the.

221
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:25,620
That's right, and you're driving on these roads.

222
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,820
So we got everything out of the lockers without a hitch.

223
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,260
I was a little worried that there would be something

224
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,100
in the lockers. I'm not gonna do that

225
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,100
to you, huh? Okay.

226
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,880
Everything that you brought, you grabbed.

227
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,980
You had enough time there.

228
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:36,820
You took the time to shoot a little segment, you know,

229
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,520
and nothing bad happened.

230
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,940
It was intimidating how they just stood there silently

231
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,880
for like 15 minutes while we shot our segment

232
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,380
and then packed up leisurely.

233
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,620
It felt very ominous.

234
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:50,700
We do need to make sure that Fox doesn't die.

235
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,340
Oh, I don't wanna touch that wet freak.

236
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:56,300
Do you guys have any zip ties or something like that?

237
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,300
We could do his hands.

238
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,980
Julius already got his shoes.

239
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,580
And you look down and see that his shoes are tied.

240
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:02,400
Together? Together.

241
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,820
Not just individually, nicely.

242
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:07,980
Way to tie, that was very kind of you, to tie God's shoes.

243
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,140
Together, in a tripping formation.

244
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,740
We definitely have zip ties in the can van.

245
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:13,820
Yeah. Like that supplies.

246
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:16,540
And you would like duct tape and everything.

247
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,980
Yeah, you guys are awful people.

248
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:19,820
Yeah, of course.

249
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,020
No. No, oh, right.

250
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:21,980
We're a film crew.

251
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,700
We have useful things.

252
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:28,100
And she throws on the zip ties behind the back of Fox Coddle

253
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,120
and he is still unconscious.

254
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,780
And she's like, I guess we should try

255
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:35,060
to make him comfortable that way he stays this way

256
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,180
as long as possible.

257
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,260
Stevie, I don't wanna get lost

258
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,900
in the weeds here theologically.

259
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,280
You know, have you ever heard about like,

260
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,560
could God microwave a burrito so hot

261
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,820
he himself could not eat it?

262
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:44,900
Oh, whoa.

263
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,660
If this is really God, can he just break some zip ties?

264
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:50,140
Is he constrained by the limits of his physical form?

265
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:53,540
Well, I have to assume he was a turtle for a reason.

266
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,940
How do we get him back into something like a turtle?

267
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:59,100
I think we gotta like kill him when he's around a turtle.

268
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,100
That's the mayor.

269
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,900
Oh yeah, we gotta like decree the turtle,

270
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,440
the new mayor, then kill him.

271
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,860
Do we have to kill him?

272
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:07,500
Maybe not, maybe just decreeing a new mayor

273
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,820
makes it like automatically transfer.

274
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:10,660
Let's try.

275
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,780
Okay, who am I gonna make the new mayor?

276
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:16,540
Let's think about this maybe a lot more.

277
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:18,740
Beck wants to be filming out the back window,

278
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,380
keeping an eye and make sure we're not being followed

279
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,220
out of the gates of the wall.

280
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:23,500
Oh, you just keep seeing these signs

281
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:27,100
that are like dead end, road stops here,

282
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,500
no outlet, please stop.

283
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,060
There's like some danger signs.

284
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:34,560
And you're on this road all by yourselves

285
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,740
and there's no streets that are like coming off

286
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,740
of these streets, do you know what I mean?

287
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:41,660
Do you know what I mean?

288
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:44,900
Julius wants to, not all of them at the same time

289
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,000
because the algorithm,

290
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,620
but upload at least one crazy TikTok.

291
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:53,460
Let's find out which TikTok.

292
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,140
You took a few while we were there.

293
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:58,000
Should we actually pause and like figure out what they were?

294
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,900
Okay, there was the at the very end,

295
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,940
the year dance before we got attacked by the Jaguar.

296
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:03,760
Sure.

297
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,740
When we were getting onto the train.

298
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:06,580
That's right.

299
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:09,340
Technically that includes the Jaguar attack.

300
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,060
He hits the window as you were filming,

301
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,540
so it's got all that.

302
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,500
Right, but then there's one of us.

303
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,340
That's what I was talking about.

304
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:17,680
Yeah, we got on the train before we got back off

305
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,040
to rescue Chuck.

306
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,440
So there's that one and I think that one includes us

307
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,320
doing funny walks, sneaking.

308
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,760
Yes, there is the good sneaking one across the plant wall.

309
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,800
And I assume it also has you pointing it right in my face

310
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,840
as I say turn that off and get on the fucking train.

311
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,280
That's in that one.

312
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,560
There's also the one where you're in the it pitch.

313
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,240
Yeah, with all the crazy symbols and stuff.

314
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,080
Yep, behind.

315
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,480
Previous to that.

316
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,280
I'm sure I got the Jack.

317
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,800
Did I get the Jackalope attack?

318
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,080
Yes, exactly.

319
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,480
That is the headline here.

320
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,880
Jackalope attack.

321
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,600
It totally got me, dude.

322
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,880
It snuck up on me with malicious intent.

323
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,040
It wasn't my fault.

324
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,480
Sometimes spin is morally justified.

325
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,320
Whoa.

326
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,680
That's heavy.

327
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,840
He's gonna do the Jackalope attack.

328
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,720
Whichever one you think.

329
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,720
You know more about this kid stuff than me.

330
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,560
Beck, is it okay if I show this?

331
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,300
I think that's like probably the best one

332
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,800
because in the end of it,

333
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,280
it's just a rabbit with horns tied onto it.

334
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,320
It gives a taste of the thing that is crazy,

335
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,680
but it's not the craziest.

336
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,080
Or do we show something crazier and tease it?

337
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:25,280
I'm sure that one was showing Grover's Gorge

338
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,080
and then, oh no, Jackalope attack.

339
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:27,920
Oh no, oh no.

340
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,280
Once we make the choice, we should have to roll to see.

341
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:35,760
That's the song that plays when he zooms in on my leg wounds.

342
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,440
Oh, perfect.

343
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,600
So now we need to do an algorithm roll

344
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,720
to see how well it favors us.

345
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,600
How well it favors us.

346
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,920
Is that audio being used?

347
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,360
Do you think this is a straight up luck roll?

348
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,440
Oh yeah, defo.

349
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:56,880
Luke had a giant landing pad of a dice rolling tray

350
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,360
and missed the tray.

351
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,640
Threw it behind his head.

352
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,520
It fell out of my hand as I shook it.

353
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:04,920
He threw it behind his head.

354
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,720
Well, it's a 92.

355
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,080
You know what that means.

356
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:08,960
Spend some luck.

357
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,780
Do you have luck?

358
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:10,880
So we can go viral?

359
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,920
Yeah, I'll spend luck so we can go viral.

360
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:18,800
What is your, no, what's your notification sound bite?

361
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,240
And also give me your luck coin.

362
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,320
There's my luck coin.

363
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,160
Flick it.

364
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,440
Nice.

365
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,280
So good.

366
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,920
What's the notification on the phone?

367
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,040
Yeah, what's the noise?

368
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,320
Obama saying, yes, we can.

369
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,680
What noise do you mean though?

370
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,400
Like that he received the notification noise?

371
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,480
I assume he means it's about to start blasting off.

372
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,600
Yeah, I was just gonna do a bunch of them over and over.

373
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,760
So I guess I'll drop that in here.

374
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,600
Yes, we can.

375
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,300
Si, se puede.

376
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,140
Yes, we can.

377
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,420
Yes, we can.

378
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,660
Yes, we can.

379
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:50,500
Yes, we can.

380
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,320
Yes, we can.

381
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,160
Yes, we can.

382
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,000
Yes, we can.

383
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Thank you, Mr. President.

384
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,480
And we're back.

385
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,040
Your phone is just lighting up.

386
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,840
And so is Julius's face.

387
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:01,620
Cal.

388
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:02,800
Which he's picking at furiously.

389
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,400
When Cal hears Obama's voice,

390
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,100
he like legitimately gets a tear.

391
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,440
I miss that man.

392
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,960
And we're driving.

393
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:15,760
Hey, Stevie, like now we've seen this like transfer of God

394
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,280
or whatever twice.

395
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,100
And both times it was a thing.

396
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,880
Their eyes just get fucking huge when you say that.

397
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,600
Both times it was a thing leaping off of a thing.

398
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,040
Is that like part of it?

399
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,740
Without looking away,

400
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:30,120
you're looking in the rear view mirror at Stevie's face,

401
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,400
which is pointed directly at the road.

402
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:36,000
No flinching, no moving, just yeah, I,

403
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,760
They used to say that's how it would change bodies.

404
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,200
The original mayor, they were so scared

405
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,560
that he was gonna come back like he was

406
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,080
that they put a cage around his coffin.

407
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:50,920
Crumpy?

408
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,840
That's right, Jeremiah Crumpy.

409
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,400
And the story goes would,

410
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,280
and they kind of take their hand

411
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,480
and do the like under the chin,

412
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,160
throw the hand back and forth thing.

413
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,760
Throw their hand back and forth.

414
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,400
Throw their hand back and forth.

415
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,960
Throw their hand back and forth.

416
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,080
But it's like just that they kill themselves.

417
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,520
It's not necessarily that they leap off of something.

418
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,800
Yeah, a leap of faith as it were.

419
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,960
I have a theory on that, but I don't want to bring it up.

420
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,200
Here's the deal, like do we need to keep,

421
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,400
Hey Zach, do you call it the leap of faith in your notes?

422
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,440
Did I nail that?

423
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:25,080
I'm just wondering if we need to keep Fox away from ledges.

424
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,080
It's a little smile.

425
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,600
I mean, I think it's a good idea

426
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,240
to keep Fox away from ledges.

427
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,760
Or do we have to keep them away from like fucking everything?

428
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,640
I think that's the probably one that we should go with.

429
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,000
Like we're going to have to like,

430
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,560
what'd you say keep them in a cage?

431
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,400
Well.

432
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,400
I've got a basement in my townhouse.

433
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,840
You can't jump off of that.

434
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,600
Do the mayors have any like any idea what's going on

435
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,480
or are they basically zombies?

436
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:53,640
Well, the only one that I knew was Sandro and,

437
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,040
Rest in peace little guy.

438
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:58,120
Until Chuck and the only thing we,

439
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,680
what did you get out of Chuck?

440
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,520
It seemed like he was pretty much driven

441
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,280
to throw himself off that gorge.

442
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,080
I met Jeremiah Krumpy, but long after he was deceased.

443
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,800
What do you, what are you talking about Julius?

444
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,720
What is this Krumpy stuff?

445
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,760
What is this Krumpy stuff?

446
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,160
He's buried behind Fox's house

447
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,920
and I tripped over his grave.

448
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,360
He was the original mayor.

449
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,200
Yeah.

450
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,120
They caged his grave site.

451
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,240
Yeah, I thought it was a bit odd,

452
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,040
but I thought maybe it was to keep kids off of it.

453
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,480
They used to do it for witches and vampires,

454
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,720
you know, in the fifties.

455
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:33,360
So, I mean, we got to keep him locked up.

456
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,280
Yeah, that's my biggest fear is that when he gets conscious,

457
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,280
he's just going to start like grabbing scissors

458
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,520
and poking them in his eye.

459
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,000
Yeah, that's, and she points at the zip ties.

460
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,360
Man, when we get back in Cal, Colorado's on Bumble

461
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,720
and trying to have a dinner date,

462
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,320
while God is in his basement trying to kill himself.

463
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,720
That's going to be great.

464
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,320
I think we're on to something.

465
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,520
Tell me about that basement.

466
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,680
Oh no, it's not finished.

467
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,520
Even better.

468
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,480
Yeah, I guess like no one will go down there.

469
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,680
Oh, I thought you were, we were on the date.

470
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:18,360
No, no, God will be quite comfortable in the basement,

471
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,200
I think.

472
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,680
We're calling him God, this is God.

473
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,520
We're saying this is God.

474
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,120
No, it's just, it's Greg.

475
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:23,960
Greg.

476
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,080
I mean, that's just Greg.

477
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:25,920
Greg.

478
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,760
Gregle.

479
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,600
Gregertle.

480
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,440
Don't make it weird.

481
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,720
I mean, it can just be Greg

482
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:32,640
and hopefully we can get this thing, whatever it is out.

483
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,720
Sorry, sorry.

484
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,640
Wait, was Greg Fox's name?

485
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,520
Yeah, before he got God.

486
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,120
Once this footage is released,

487
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:43,400
I bet some authority would want to take him.

488
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,680
I'm all screwed up about like what's right and wrong here

489
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,520
at this point.

490
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:52,200
But if it is God, do you think we have like an obligation

491
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,240
to like keep that to ourselves

492
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,120
and like make sure that he doesn't do bad things or?

493
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:01,960
I understood it as not actual God,

494
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,800
but he did go to church.

495
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:09,640
Whatever it is, it seems to be a very dangerous

496
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,760
and powerful thing.

497
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,440
And I think you're right, Beck.

498
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,160
I don't know who we can trust with this shit.

499
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,920
I think we leave him out of the edit,

500
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,000
if you know what I mean.

501
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,760
And maybe don't mention he came back to town.

502
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,600
Yeah.

503
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,480
I guess like our first like thing would be to try

504
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,160
just like declaring like you have a pet goldfish

505
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,720
that we can say is the new mayor and just see if that works.

506
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,720
No, Goldie died several weeks ago.

507
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,560
Oh, Cal.

508
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:36,200
Maybe something that lives a lot longer than a goldfish,

509
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,280
like a rock.

510
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,880
I do have a pet rock somewhere.

511
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,400
Dude, can we make a rock God?

512
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:45,040
Could you make a rock so God that even God couldn't rock it?

513
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,520
I'll show you a rock God.

514
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,640
Whom?

515
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,460
Bon Jovi.

516
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,920
Thank you.

517
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,760
What'd you say?

518
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,760
We met our editor, Cole.

519
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,840
Oh, nice.

520
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,480
Here's what I propose.

521
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,040
We cut the story and get the word out to the world

522
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,560
about what they're doing there.

523
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:06,740
I don't think we should tell anyone we have Greg.

524
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:07,580
Agreed.

525
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:08,920
But everything else?

526
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,160
Everything else.

527
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,120
Everything else.

528
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,520
Everything else.

529
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,360
Yeah.

530
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,200
Everything else.

531
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,500
That's for Greg's safety, the world's safety

532
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,360
and our own safety.

533
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,400
We don't know who would wanna come for us.

534
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,640
Right now, it's those weird fucking kids

535
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,680
who know we have them.

536
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,840
Dude, when the world sees the footage, though,

537
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,860
like, we are going to change the world, yo.

538
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:32,920
This is the biggest story of the last 50 years.

539
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,860
I'm sorry, I forgot about 9-11.

540
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:35,700
Heh.

541
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,320
Moment of silence.

542
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,140
It's obviously not as big as 9-11.

543
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,200
Moment of silence.

544
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,480
Moment of silence.

545
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,900
You don't think this is a bigger deal than 9-11?

546
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:49,400
This could potentially be as big as 9-11.

547
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,880
Do you think season two will be as big as 9-11?

548
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,760
This podcast is bigger than the Beatles.

549
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,520
Moment of silence complete.

550
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:04,280
Okay, so like, yeah, the plan is get Greg, God,

551
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,920
Greg God into Cal's basement.

552
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:07,760
Okay.

553
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,940
We'll go to the pet store, find a turtle,

554
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,600
and we'll just see if that works.

555
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,120
And like, if that doesn't work, we're back to square one,

556
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,480
but at least we tried something.

557
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,240
We obviously do that after we show the news.

558
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,620
Oh yeah, and like that, and like change the world

559
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,280
in the process, yeah, of course.

560
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,840
So we're gonna go, like, take the footage

561
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,600
and drop it off first, and then take Greg?

562
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,760
As the producer, that's definitely what I say.

563
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,080
No, no, no, we need to get Greg in the basement,

564
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,220
but then Stevie and I could maybe take care of him

565
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,280
and you two can put the cut together.

566
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,360
I look over at Julius, are you still at like,

567
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:41,000
two hit points, are you still like, bloody as hell?

568
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,920
Yes, and I'm like, picking the skin that's on my face

569
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,920
is like, yanking at it and like, kind of stripping it off.

570
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:51,520
We also gotta give Julius to a goddamn hospital.

571
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:56,140
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, Greg, Julius.

572
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:59,200
No, no, the news before me.

573
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,480
You didn't happen to pack one of those,

574
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,040
you know, magic, God'll heal things, did you?

575
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,920
Oh, I didn't even think about it.

576
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,440
That would have been so handy, aw.

577
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,780
Good thing I grabbed one.

578
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,960
We can always count on you, Beck.

579
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,800
95.

580
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,360
You failed your role, so I do have it,

581
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,180
is that what you meant?

582
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,020
Yeah.

583
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,760
That's the Zach Luck role that he failed.

584
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,000
I guess, I mean, I wanna see this cut

585
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,640
before I go to the news, but I mean,

586
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,280
we could get rid of God first.

587
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,200
Julius, can I see your hands for a second?

588
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,240
He holds his hands up.

589
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,480
I wrapped some gaffer tape around him, so you can't.

590
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,320
Whoa!

591
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,320
Take your last two hit points away

592
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,600
by picking at your face.

593
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,360
He's gonna try to fight that

594
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,720
just because he doesn't want it to happen,

595
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,400
but I think that's a good idea.

596
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:51,520
All right, let's see a little unarmed combat going on here.

597
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,360
Uh-oh.

598
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,000
I got a crit success.

599
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,560
Oh, damn.

600
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,840
Well, that's just a crit success to not get.

601
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

602
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,120
So as you like nimbly blasted away.

603
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,320
You kill Calcala.

604
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,080
You dodge and he's, I wanna try to persuade you

605
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,160
that this is a good idea.

606
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,560
I'm like, I understand, I understand,

607
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,080
I should have just come at you like that,

608
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,200
but I think we might need to get your hands

609
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,480
under control here for a second

610
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,400
before you poltergeist your own head.

611
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,240
Yeah.

612
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,920
You can roll if you want, but because you crit,

613
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,440
I'm gonna go ahead and say like,

614
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,680
you can just like tell him to fuck off if you want.

615
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:27,000
I'll roll my persuade, like it says to,

616
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,600
I got a 43 on a 60.

617
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,640
I got a 63 on a 70.

618
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,480
Ooh!

619
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,960
Oh, no, sorry, a 36.

620
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,800
Oh.

621
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,640
Boom.

622
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,480
What'd you roll?

623
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,300
A 43.

624
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,140
Better than that.

625
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:39,960
So I.

626
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,800
Whiplash!

627
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,200
Picking at his face.

628
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:46,960
Okay, yeah, so, okay, good talk, Julius.

629
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,120
He's picking at his face,

630
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:51,040
but then Julius is like in his notes on his phone,

631
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,880
like writing down thoughts on different ways to cut this.

632
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,720
The video.

633
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,120
The footage, yeah.

634
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,120
And his face off.

635
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,520
All right, I need you guys to, someone,

636
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:05,100
I need you to elect a rolling leader

637
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:08,960
who has a D8 closest to them.

638
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,560
Luke, Luke is gonna roll the D8.

639
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:15,240
To see how many eighths of gas are in this gas tank.

640
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,300
More like eighths of something else,

641
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,400
you know what I mean?

642
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,720
Weed.

643
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,560
Eight.

644
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,400
Hell yeah.

645
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,220
Full tank.

646
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,440
They filled it up while we parked.

647
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,960
Compliments of Grover's Gulch.

648
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,200
Yeah, come back and see us.

649
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,560
You're only a few hours away.

650
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:33,240
It's about as full as a tank could possibly be

651
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,200
after driving this distance.

652
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,280
We stopped at a gas station right before we pulled off.

653
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,680
The same gas station is approaching on your right

654
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,800
and it is the first building

655
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,480
that you really see on this side of civilization.

656
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,680
You seem to be coming back onto a road

657
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,680
that might be used for more

658
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,960
than just heading out to this location.

659
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,080
And as you come up to this gas station,

660
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:00,960
you see that there are three black SUVs.

661
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,620
No, that's not fun.

662
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:06,160
There are three pink SUVs.

663
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,600
Now that's fun.

664
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:09,840
Spaceships.

665
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,680
Camels.

666
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,500
Kangaroos.

667
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,340
Helicopters.

668
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:14,720
There are three green.

669
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,220
Roombas.

670
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,920
Range Rovers.

671
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:21,520
Like bright green Range Rovers.

672
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:26,520
And they are all parked in a line at three pumps.

673
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,360
It's probably nothing to worry about.

674
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:32,400
Simultaneously the doors open

675
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:37,400
and men wearing monochromatic gray scale suits

676
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:43,160
with a green accent being their tie and their,

677
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,140
what's the thing that goes in your pocket?

678
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,980
Pocket square.

679
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,760
And their green pocket square and their green tie

680
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,540
get out and begin pumping gas.

681
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,160
What's the matter, Stevie?

682
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,720
That's jolly green jottles.

683
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:03,440
Golly, dream goggles.

684
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,600
Jolly green jottles.

685
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,640
Jolly green jottles.

686
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:11,960
I just, that, yeah, that's them.

687
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,440
I guess just keep your heads forward and don't.

688
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,840
Everybody act casual.

689
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,940
Julius, pretend to do a TikTok.

690
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:23,920
Julius is like writing notes on his thoughts on the edit.

691
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,760
That looks like a TikTok.

692
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,680
He just like does a little dance.

693
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,360
As far as Kal knows, you're doing a TikTok.

694
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,320
Great job, great job.

695
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,360
Great job.

696
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,200
Great job.

697
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,560
You totally looped that roll.

698
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,080
And as you continue to drive,

699
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:46,100
as you're almost past this gas station,

700
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:50,440
you see one of the side doors opens from the back

701
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:53,640
of one of these green Range Rovers and out steps.

702
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,920
Fred Godel.

703
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,960
He was on his way back.

704
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,800
I forgot.

705
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,880
Oh, shit.

706
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,720
We knew that.

707
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:04,300
And he squints as he looks at the can van

708
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:07,080
driving back toward the city.

709
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:10,220
You guys are back in the can van, heading down the road.

710
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,960
You're back in the normal world.

711
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,480
So you're seeing homes, you're seeing normal signs.

712
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,760
Please stop and interview him.

713
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:19,040
Julius says, looking like,

714
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:23,280
he says it as a statement, but it's really as a question.

715
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,440
No, no.

716
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:27,040
No, Julius, we will die if we talk to that man.

717
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:30,680
We've also got his daughter with us right now.

718
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,080
And his son.

719
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:32,920
Son.

720
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:33,880
Whoa.

721
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,280
Let's not forget, we also have the mayor of his town.

722
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,160
Shit.

723
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,000
And?

724
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,300
Oh, I'm not going back.

725
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,140
She's driving.

726
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:42,380
Yeah, she's like, fuck that, Julius.

727
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:43,840
I'm not doing that shit.

728
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,640
He knew that was the correct answer, but he had to ask.

729
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,480
Do you think he saw you, Stevie?

730
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,400
She's just like frozen this whole time

731
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,840
in the rear view mirror, just staring.

732
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,080
Oh shit, Stevie, jackalope.

733
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:57,920
Ugh.

734
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:02,440
And you see a rabbit with a stick

735
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,840
like kind of like stuck to it almost.

736
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:05,680
Like it's.

737
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,500
Like some burrs.

738
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,340
Yeah, it kind of got caught up.

739
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:08,160
At the end of a twig.

740
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,000
Yeah.

741
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,240
Stevie, what?

742
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,400
She smashes it.

743
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,160
Oh, that poor little jackalope.

744
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,240
Stevie, what were the circumstances

745
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,240
of you leaving Grower's Gorge?

746
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:22,200
Still driving, still working in the rear view mirror.

747
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,280
Who's hitting shotgun?

748
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,120
Probably Cal.

749
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:27,120
I figured we were all in the back like figuring shit out.

750
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:27,960
Yeah, that's good.

751
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,220
Looking at footage and tying up Fox.

752
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:31,200
Beck is getting a shot

753
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,240
of whatever Stevie's response is gonna be.

754
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,820
Yeah, no, I saw.

755
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,400
You know that moment when you find out

756
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,640
that maybe your parents aren't good?

757
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,400
I don't know if you've ever had that.

758
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,240
Yes.

759
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,800
So that's a weird feeling.

760
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:50,800
And when I kind of saw what I had tied my life to,

761
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:55,000
what I was born into, I couldn't hang.

762
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,280
So I'd been talking to Susan.

763
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,760
Susan's the judge.

764
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,280
Susan Bloom, Judge Bloom.

765
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,240
And then Susan was helping.

766
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,480
I mean, we were trying to help, but.

767
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,640
Help how?

768
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,920
Well, I mean, you saw the it pit.

769
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,800
You know, we were trying to save the new visitors.

770
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,900
So sometimes people would just kind of appear

771
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,440
and it wasn't just people.

772
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,460
It was like all sorts of things and creatures

773
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:19,500
like we saw back there.

774
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:23,980
And we were trying to help them because what would I mean?

775
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:26,580
Vernon would take them and put them in the it pit

776
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:28,140
because that's what Fred needed.

777
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:32,100
And we didn't really see them again after that.

778
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,780
Because Fred needed them to be quiet

779
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:36,820
or because he needed them to die in the it pit?

780
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,540
I think he needed something from them.

781
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:40,580
I don't know exactly what,

782
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:43,620
but we found animal ears down there also.

783
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:45,580
Now that we've seen animal people,

784
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,380
it was like transforming them?

785
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:51,460
No, I mean, they were showing up like all sorts of things.

786
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:53,020
Oh, they were starting animal-ly.

787
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:55,620
Yeah, they were just popping into Grover's Gorge.

788
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,020
We started getting the visitors

789
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,820
and I mean, I got out of there quick.

790
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:00,740
Susan and I tried to do what we could,

791
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:02,780
but it wasn't too long after that.

792
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:05,260
And their eyes just kind of fade away

793
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:09,180
and you see it's something cut deep enough

794
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:12,380
to leave everything they knew behind.

795
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:14,060
And she just can't bring herself.

796
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:16,780
She, despite of all that, let you go to the it pit.

797
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:18,980
She knew that if she said anything,

798
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:23,980
she'd be in their same position.

799
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:24,860
I understand.

800
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:26,460
Stevie, we are not our families.

801
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:29,180
We can move beyond that and become our own people.

802
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:30,020
I did.

803
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:32,420
Or tried.

804
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:34,660
So why'd you go back with us?

805
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,140
We got what we needed.

806
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:37,300
Hell yeah, we did.

807
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,500
Let's shut them down.

808
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:41,660
That's the spirit of a real can news intern.

809
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:43,540
Let's show the world what they're doing.

810
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,380
Let's do it.

811
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:45,220
Yeah.

812
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:47,220
Through the transformative power of journalism.

813
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,460
I'm sleepy.

814
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:50,220
And he's like closing his eyes.

815
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:51,060
Yeah.

816
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:56,980
Julius, dude, stay with me, dude.

817
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:57,820
Stay with me, dude.

818
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:58,980
He shakes his head back awake

819
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,900
like he's trying to keep his eyes open.

820
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:03,100
Maybe we should drop him at a hospital.

821
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:03,940
No, no.

822
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:06,260
The way they do in the movies where they just

823
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,860
throw you in front of the emergency room.

824
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,460
Julius, I hate to tell you this.

825
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:12,060
I think Stevie's gonna have to help Beck with the cut.

826
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:13,740
You're still my super producer.

827
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:18,860
He half forcing himself to stay awake

828
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:21,820
is continuing to write his thoughts down in his notes.

829
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:23,220
The camera peeps over your shoulder

830
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:26,380
and it's just like the same letter over and over again.

831
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:28,060
It's Z, yeah.

832
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:30,380
Text, try to text what you have to Stevie.

833
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:34,260
He hits Z again on his keyboard.

834
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:36,140
Okay, I don't feel very good.

835
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:37,100
I know, little guy.

836
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,140
Little guy with the big thighs, eh?

837
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:40,700
We're gonna take care of you, right?

838
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:44,140
Stevie, can we go to a doctor or something?

839
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:45,340
We could get to a hospital.

840
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:48,900
Is that, and she's like kinda eyeing Greg?

841
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:49,900
Well, here's what we could do.

842
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,780
We could either drop him off at a hospital

843
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:54,220
or you can leave him and Greg in my basement.

844
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:56,980
I'll watch him while you and Beck make the cut.

845
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:58,820
Luke's face.

846
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:01,820
Why would you drop me off in the basement?

847
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:04,700
Well, it's whether you wanna go to a hospital or not.

848
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:07,100
I mean, Julius doesn't wanna go to the hospital.

849
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,060
What does Luke want?

850
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:10,220
I don't know what Luke wants.

851
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:12,060
These are just, these are the options.

852
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:13,020
Luke's along for the ride.

853
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:13,860
What does Julius want?

854
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,020
I'm playing the character.

855
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:17,580
Julius wants to go cut this shit together.

856
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:19,340
Fuck yeah.

857
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:23,060
He's got two hit points left, so.

858
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:25,080
You look such a mess.

859
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,180
It's so funny.

860
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:29,860
Like you are trying to hold on by a thread at this point

861
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:33,460
and it's still a fair amount of car ride left.

862
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:35,060
Okay, why don't you,

863
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:38,020
we'll get God situated in the basement and.

864
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:40,220
And I'll go help cut the news together.

865
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:42,300
Yeah, you'll show Stevie the ropes.

866
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:44,220
And maybe we'll call an ambulance.

867
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:46,420
Maybe we'll call an ambulance.

868
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:47,860
Yeah, yeah, man.

869
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:51,260
Roll Constitution to see if you can actually stay awake

870
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:52,420
all the way into town.

871
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:54,780
An eight on a 50.

872
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:56,380
An eight on a 50's gonna keep you.

873
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:59,540
The prospect of not being able to cut this together,

874
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:02,020
adrenaline pumps through his veins.

875
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:04,340
And the consistent rings of yes we can.

876
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:06,180
Yes, exactly.

877
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,020
Yes we can.

878
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:09,300
Yes we can.

879
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,660
Dopamine fills his brain every time he hears that.

880
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:12,500
Yes we can.

881
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,340
Yes we can.

882
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,160
Yes we can.

883
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,000
Yes we can.

884
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:15,840
Yes we can.

885
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,660
I can do it.

886
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:17,500
I can.

887
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,340
I can keep it together.

888
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:20,980
All right, as we roll into the city,

889
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:21,940
what's the first stop?

890
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:23,380
And also I'm gonna go pee again.

891
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:24,740
Sorry I drank so much liquid.

892
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:25,600
What is the first stop?

893
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,700
We haven't really hammered out

894
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:28,540
what our order of operations here.

895
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:32,580
I mean, Julius is gonna say the news tower or whatever.

896
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:33,460
I'm a little nervous.

897
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:34,700
I think Beck would be nervous too

898
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:37,860
about leaving Godel unconscious in the van.

899
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:39,480
That he could pop up at any moment.

900
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:42,300
I don't know if I can deal with God alone.

901
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:45,800
So Stevie can handle the cut if he passes out

902
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,420
or goes to the emergency room or something like that, right?

903
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:51,460
Can you stay here in the basement with me and watch God?

904
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:54,940
I mean, yeah, but like I know what all the footage is.

905
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:56,500
Like that's kind of my whole thing

906
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:59,020
is to like tell him the edit.

907
00:34:59,020 --> 00:34:59,860
I mean.

908
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:01,980
Let's just bring him with us.

909
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,700
That is such a bad idea.

910
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:09,220
Julius nods his head.

911
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:11,100
Why don't we just lock him in your basement

912
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,540
and then go do the cut?

913
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:13,820
Julius nods his head.

914
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,660
I mean, someone has to stay with him.

915
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:17,260
I guess that'll be me.

916
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:18,620
I don't know about that, dude.

917
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:20,240
Like you said, it's God.

918
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,280
Like if he does wake up, what are you gonna do?

919
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,260
Well, that's why I asked one of you to stay with me

920
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:27,460
but you all wanna be a part of this fucking cut.

921
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:30,800
So I don't know.

922
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,180
Is the cut more important

923
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:34,060
than keeping God trapped in my basement?

924
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:36,380
I don't know, Beck, but.

925
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:37,220
That's my point though.

926
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:39,860
It's like, what are two people versus God?

927
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:44,860
Like what if we all leave and go get a turtle

928
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:47,700
on our way back from cutting the film footage?

929
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:48,920
Julius nods his head.

930
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:52,980
I don't know Beck,

931
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,940
but I don't think we can just leave him alone.

932
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:58,220
I mean, I'm gonna stay with Greg.

933
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:01,620
Especially since Julius is seemingly staying.

934
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:02,960
This is not a huge deal,

935
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,020
but just would you not use the upstairs bathroom

936
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:08,660
while you're there?

937
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:09,560
Is there a-

938
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,860
There's a downstairs bathroom.

939
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:11,700
Okay, cool.

940
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,500
Yeah, no, as long as there's another one.

941
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,140
And I don't mean on the main floor.

942
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:17,060
If you do need to go up there for any reason

943
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:18,060
to use the kitchen or anything,

944
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:19,220
I just mean the one upstairs.

945
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:20,620
There's just still some of,

946
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:21,460
there's just still,

947
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:22,740
there's some things my wife left

948
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:24,980
that I haven't really touched.

949
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:25,820
Wait, hold on.

950
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:28,060
Why'd you say, oh, that's horrifying.

951
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,860
Did she poop in your toilet?

952
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:31,060
Oh, if that's what you mean,

953
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:32,180
I take back the awe.

954
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:34,860
No, I think it's the way that it's messily arranged,

955
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:35,700
the way that she would have it.

956
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,300
So that got her hairbrush out and-

957
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,140
Yeah, that's what I meant too.

958
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:40,180
And she had smeared all of the walls.

959
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:42,320
No, there were, yes,

960
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,160
the hairbrush,

961
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:44,900
the tooth brace,

962
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,260
which she never closed,

963
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:47,220
some toiletries,

964
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:48,660
and of course a bowl of shit.

965
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:52,160
Please, whatever you do,

966
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,740
do not flush the upstairs toilet.

967
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:55,500
I just can't bring myself to flush it.

968
00:36:55,500 --> 00:37:00,500
Am I the only one who thought that?

969
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:03,300
I think so.

970
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,340
Yeah, okay.

971
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:10,180
That's fine.

972
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:11,000
If Taylor dies,

973
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,900
I'm throwing all of her stuff away immediately.

974
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:17,140
In the secret house you two share together?

975
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:18,700
No, that was me as Zach.

976
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:19,540
I knew it.

977
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:20,380
Whoa.

978
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:21,200
Whoa.

979
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,040
I got that.

980
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,740
You were pretending to be a person?

981
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:28,460
Was that the world's fastest no back button?

982
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:35,340
So we'll get you guys all secured in my basement

983
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:37,420
and hopefully you and Greg will be fine there.

984
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:39,860
And then we'll go edit this cut together

985
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:40,960
like a news crew should.

986
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,020
And bring back a turtle.

987
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:43,860
And bring back a new god turtle.

988
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:44,700
Okay, sick.

989
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:47,740
So let's hear about the outside of Cal Colorado's house.

990
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:49,220
What are we pulling up to?

991
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:50,560
What's the vibe?

992
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,520
Oh, I mean, nice ass neighborhood.

993
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,880
Stately like early 20th century or late 1800s

994
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:57,760
like townhouses.

995
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,600
Some of them are brick.

996
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,560
His is painted white.

997
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,600
It's probably like three stories maybe.

998
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,420
Whoa.

999
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:04,320
And you know, it's narrow, right?

1000
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,460
It's in the middle of the city.

1001
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:07,280
And yeah, I don't know what time of year it is

1002
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,800
but it seems like it's fall there.

1003
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,880
It's like nice.

1004
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,480
But it seems like it's fall.

1005
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:14,200
It's like June 18th or somewhere around there.

1006
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,780
Specifically July something.

1007
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,840
We did start in June.

1008
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,160
I have June 18th written down.

1009
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,640
Today is July 5th.

1010
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,840
Oh, okay, yeah.

1011
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:24,320
So there's all these 4th of July banners and stuff.

1012
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,560
Cal has a big American flag outside the front.

1013
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,400
Nice.

1014
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,960
And yeah, you see a neat little,

1015
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,800
like a couple of like garden, whoops.

1016
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,040
What the hell's happening?

1017
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,880
It's the helicopter landing at the hospital.

1018
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:35,840
Helicopter.

1019
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,680
Cal says, don't worry.

1020
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:39,440
That's just the helicopter landing at the hospital nearby.

1021
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,560
Thank God it's closed.

1022
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,640
Yeah.

1023
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:45,240
So there's some nice little like window planners and shit.

1024
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,800
Julius, I could just like run you over there

1025
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,920
while they get situated.

1026
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,760
That's true.

1027
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,580
We have time.

1028
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:54,220
This isn't, I mean, it was sunset when we left.

1029
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:55,140
It's been a few hours.

1030
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:56,660
This is not going on tonight's news.

1031
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:58,300
We have all day to cut this thing.

1032
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:01,420
We could definitely get you some medical attention.

1033
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:02,260
That's right, yeah.

1034
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:04,860
It's like 11, 1130 p.m. now at this point.

1035
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:07,540
Maybe that is the order of operations now.

1036
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:09,500
Yeah, it's, oh my God, it's too,

1037
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,920
how did we not realize it's too late to go on the news?

1038
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:16,180
Because it's been a pretty discombobulating day of a day,

1039
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,020
has it not?

1040
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:18,580
Julius texts his uncle to see

1041
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:20,740
if his health insurance has kicked in yet.

1042
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:21,580
Yeah.

1043
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:30,100
Commentary.

1044
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:32,260
That is a great question.

1045
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:35,980
Sax, oh, Sax consulting the fucking can.

1046
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:37,780
Who has insurance or nothing.

1047
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:38,940
I had to check.

1048
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:42,300
It's like I made a full HR department for these guys.

1049
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:43,940
It's part of my world building process.

1050
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:45,420
Extensive employee records.

1051
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:47,540
It's like, oh, nope, sorry Julius.

1052
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:49,900
That doesn't kick in until the end of the month.

1053
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:51,740
Oh, City Action News,

1054
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:55,020
they actually don't provide healthcare coverage.

1055
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:56,500
Not to junior producers.

1056
00:39:58,340 --> 00:39:59,820
Then call the chopper.

1057
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:02,420
Call the chopper.

1058
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:04,900
No, again, it is just several blocks away.

1059
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:08,900
And we're in the driveway of this beautiful brick

1060
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:09,980
three-story town home.

1061
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:12,020
We didn't want to leave God alone in the van.

1062
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:14,180
Can we leave Julius alone in the van for a second

1063
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:15,580
while we unload or?

1064
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:16,620
I'll help.

1065
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:20,780
What if you just sit right there for a moment?

1066
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:22,140
Keep writing your notes.

1067
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:22,980
Oh yeah.

1068
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:25,420
So I imagine we just kind of all like take them in

1069
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:27,060
and get them situated.

1070
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:30,020
There's probably a nice like couch and like sofa and shit.

1071
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:33,340
Julius flops down on there and continues writing his notes.

1072
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:35,220
I didn't think you came down to the basement with us.

1073
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:37,220
I was like blindly following behind

1074
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:39,100
while I typed in my notes.

1075
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:40,620
Oh, we were saying stay in the van.

1076
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:43,820
Yeah, no, he's following blindly behind you.

1077
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:46,100
I'm just trying to get us out of here quick, dude.

1078
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:49,460
He's following you guys.

1079
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:50,900
Don't you want to go to the fucking hospital?

1080
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:52,420
Who's holding Fox?

1081
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:53,340
How do we get there?

1082
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:54,460
That's what I was saying.

1083
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:56,020
I like, I imagine.

1084
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:56,860
Cal and Stevie.

1085
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:58,300
Yeah, exactly.

1086
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:02,380
So he is still absolutely drenched.

1087
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:03,220
Yeah.

1088
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:05,700
Sopping, making puddles everywhere

1089
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:07,220
that you're pulling him.

1090
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:10,720
Cal, like you can see this place is clean

1091
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,220
and Cal like visibly winces.

1092
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:15,380
And he's like, do you guys have this?

1093
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:16,700
Do you guys, do you guys got this?

1094
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:18,820
I need to mop some of this up.

1095
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:19,860
I'll put some tea on.

1096
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:22,780
And as soon as Cal steps away and says,

1097
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:24,180
I'll put some tea on.

1098
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:26,940
You see the face of Fox,

1099
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:29,580
Godel, Greg Godel, God Godel,

1100
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:32,060
slowly start to twitch.

1101
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:32,900
I punch him.

1102
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:40,180
Roll initiative with God.

1103
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:42,780
Okay, so you're just gonna roll damage

1104
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:45,060
cause you're right there.

1105
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:47,540
What's a fist punch?

1106
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:49,020
It's a D four minus one.

1107
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:52,220
Oh shit.

1108
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:53,180
One minus one.

1109
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:54,940
I rolled a one minus one.

1110
00:41:57,620 --> 00:42:00,580
You wake him up like fully.

1111
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:06,980
Stevie's looking at me like, what the fuck dude?

1112
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:08,900
I'm sorry, I thought I would like knock him out again.

1113
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:11,580
Immediately his mouth is just foaming

1114
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:14,620
and like this almost sea foam is pouring out of it.

1115
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:18,260
And it smells and you think that you might actually

1116
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:20,620
as the sea foam is like pouring up out

1117
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:23,140
and coming out of his mouth and he's fighting.

1118
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:25,180
I need a first a grip check

1119
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:27,260
for this coming out of fucking nowhere.

1120
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:29,540
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1121
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:30,620
Cal fails.

1122
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:31,460
Fail.

1123
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:32,300
Beck passes.

1124
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,460
Pass.

1125
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:34,420
Crit fail.

1126
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:36,260
Crit fail.

1127
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:37,940
I imagine we're like on the stairwell

1128
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:38,940
going down into the basement.

1129
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:39,780
Yeah.

1130
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:42,100
Okay, so Cal who has like been turning around fully

1131
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:44,620
just like scrambles backwards up the stairs

1132
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:47,180
and runs into the like into his kitchen.

1133
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:48,140
But right before you do,

1134
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:52,540
Joe takes off his headphones and Joe you lose zero grip.

1135
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:56,180
However, the other two headphones off sir, thank you.

1136
00:42:57,780 --> 00:42:59,860
Julius wasn't looking until Beck yelled,

1137
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:00,900
I'm gonna punch him.

1138
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:03,580
So this is Joe's fault.

1139
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:06,660
You're gonna lose Cal one D four plus one,

1140
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:09,100
which with the crit fail means that Julius

1141
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:11,500
automatically loses five grip.

1142
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:13,900
I see my breaking point.

1143
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:15,340
We got a breaking point

1144
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:20,300
and you lose two grip Cal as the both of you see

1145
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:24,060
is that fingertips reaching out through the top

1146
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:28,620
by a little Stevie wonder of the sea foam at the mouth

1147
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:31,780
and like maybe a finger trying to grip at the lip

1148
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:33,860
and then suddenly it's gone and you just see the water

1149
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:35,820
and then it's just foaming at the mouth

1150
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:38,660
and there are multiple hands, multiple fingers

1151
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:42,740
reaching up through the foam, trying to get out.

1152
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:45,860
He closes his mouth shut tight and continues to wriggle.

1153
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:47,100
I'm gonna burn Joe back.

1154
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:49,540
I didn't hit my bringing point, I almost did though.

1155
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:50,420
I did math wrong.

1156
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:52,140
That makes sense

1157
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:53,340
cause you already hit your breaking point.

1158
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:54,980
Yeah, I'm two away though.

1159
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:56,500
But you did lose five grip.

1160
00:43:56,500 --> 00:44:00,060
So Luke, I need a fight flight freeze.

1161
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:03,060
I'll go top in that order flight flight freeze.

1162
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:05,140
And freeze is a one.

1163
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:05,980
Five.

1164
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:06,820
What is that?

1165
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:07,640
That's fight.

1166
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:08,480
The top answer?

1167
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,040
So what do you do?

1168
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:11,040
Punch him in the nose.

1169
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,680
Julius thinks he's this guy has to shut his mouth

1170
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,080
and he's gonna just like go

1171
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:19,720
and like put his hand over his mouth and nose.

1172
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:21,680
Oh my God, okay.

1173
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:22,560
You do so.

1174
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,280
Roll unarmed combat

1175
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:26,480
and he's gonna roll at a massive disadvantage

1176
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:31,080
because his arms are behind his back with his wrists tied.

1177
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:31,920
Not all of them.

1178
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,600
He had a 41 on a 60.

1179
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:35,960
And with the success,

1180
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:38,760
Julius Summers has his hands over the mouth

1181
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,860
and nose of Greg Gottel.

1182
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:44,320
Cal was thinking something very, very similar

1183
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:46,040
as he was running up those stairs.

1184
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:47,940
And so he's trying to grab some duct tape

1185
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:49,440
from his utility drawer in the kitchen

1186
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:50,720
cause this seems untenable.

1187
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,320
Julius, Julius, be careful.

1188
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:53,160
Like don't kill him.

1189
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:54,280
Like just make sure he passes out,

1190
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:55,120
but then you gotta stop.

1191
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:56,180
Make sure that mouth stays shut.

1192
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:57,020
Help him.

1193
00:44:57,020 --> 00:44:57,840
Help him.

1194
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:58,720
Julius nods.

1195
00:44:58,720 --> 00:44:59,560
What are you doing back?

1196
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:00,380
What am I seeing?

1197
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:03,240
You are seeing Julius like plugging the nose

1198
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,740
and mouth of this dude.

1199
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:09,100
Stevie grabs and is like,

1200
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:11,060
not the nose, not the nose, just the mouth.

1201
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:12,020
He's not budging.

1202
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:12,840
Nope.

1203
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:13,680
She can't stop him.

1204
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:16,660
I put my hands over both of Julius's hands

1205
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:20,260
and my goal is to, when I feel Gottel passing out,

1206
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:21,580
I wanna pull him away.

1207
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:22,660
We can't kill him, Julius.

1208
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:23,620
We can't kill him.

1209
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:26,060
If we kill him, that God thing will pop into one of us

1210
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:27,060
and then we're fucked.

1211
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:28,260
Don't kill him, Julius.

1212
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:30,200
I'll be right there.

1213
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:31,040
Julius nods.

1214
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:34,560
Okay, let's get a human role here

1215
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:37,320
from Beck Wilder to see if you can feel

1216
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:41,280
or you can go for one of the like first aid type roles

1217
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,100
if you have that.

1218
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:43,000
I'm gonna take the human.

1219
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,080
Okay.

1220
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:44,920
I pass.

1221
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:46,140
12 on a 40 human.

1222
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:49,800
Okay, so as Cal Colorado comes running back down the stairs

1223
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:52,600
with duct tape and Stevie is trying to like push

1224
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:55,480
at the arms and hands of Julius Summers,

1225
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:58,220
you feel on the arms of Julius

1226
00:45:58,220 --> 00:46:02,380
the kind of release of consciousness from Greg Gottel.

1227
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:04,340
And she's like, that's super bad for you.

1228
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:05,180
What are you doing?

1229
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:07,740
We got to, it's not as bad as like death though.

1230
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:08,580
It's okay.

1231
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:10,280
And I'm trying to pull.

1232
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:12,540
It's okay.

1233
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:14,580
Cal's got a big thing of duct tape stripped out

1234
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:15,740
and he's like, okay, okay.

1235
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:17,460
Real quick, Julius, move your hands.

1236
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:18,300
I'm gonna tape them.

1237
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:19,460
One, two.

1238
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:22,740
And I started rapping and rapping and rapping.

1239
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:25,500
Yo, yo, yo, my name is Cal.

1240
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:28,060
My name is Cal Colorado and I'm here to say

1241
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:30,660
that you're gonna wrap your mouth in a serious way.

1242
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:35,860
All right, you've got duct tape all around the mouth

1243
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:40,860
and jaw and neck of Greg Gottel and he is unconscious.

1244
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:44,100
And Stevie is like, let's at least like, you know,

1245
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:45,740
make him comfortable again.

1246
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:47,580
Can we please like, this is.

1247
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:49,740
And you see like she's pleading with you.

1248
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:51,580
Yeah, no, of course.

1249
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:53,020
Let's get him to the couch downstairs.

1250
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:55,820
I just want to apologize that I hit your God brother.

1251
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:59,660
No, it's, it was just a reflex like he was waking up.

1252
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:00,900
Sorry, your mayor brother.

1253
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:02,080
Your mayor God brother.

1254
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:02,920
Your brother.

1255
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:04,200
Your little mayor God brother.

1256
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:06,980
She's just staring at the ground.

1257
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:08,100
Looks up at both of you.

1258
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:08,940
It's fine.

1259
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:10,380
Let's get him secured down here.

1260
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:11,220
How?

1261
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:12,060
Yeah, I don't know.

1262
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:12,880
Sit on him.

1263
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:14,840
You've got that duct tape.

1264
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:17,540
Could we like, is there like a something sturdy down here?

1265
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:20,060
We could just duct tape, duct tape.

1266
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:21,220
I've got some tie downs.

1267
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:26,220
I've got some tie down straps and in the utility closet,

1268
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:30,940
I could, we can, we can strap them to this couch.

1269
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:31,860
Yeah, let's do it.

1270
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:33,980
Julie's is just kind of staring off.

1271
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:35,580
Okay, let's be gentle.

1272
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:40,040
And Stevie is helping you use all of this roll of duct tape.

1273
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:40,880
Yeah.

1274
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:43,600
And all these straps and you use the rest of the roll

1275
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:45,420
of duct tape to secure the.

1276
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:46,900
I don't think we need the duct tape that

1277
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:48,060
she wants comfort, right?

1278
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:50,100
It's, I just.

1279
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:52,180
As they're like putting on more and more duct tape

1280
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:53,980
staring at you as you're like, I'm not sure about that.

1281
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:57,420
They're like, but if they get out, they want the comfort,

1282
00:47:57,420 --> 00:48:01,340
but Stevie is very worried about what happens if.

1283
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:02,180
Yeah.

1284
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:03,020
Yeah, understandable.

1285
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:06,140
So I am gonna crank these straps kind of hard

1286
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:07,820
and he starts ratcheting down.

1287
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:08,740
I gotta go.

1288
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:10,580
She just gonna walk upstairs.

1289
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:12,420
Like this is becoming a lot.

1290
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:13,740
Yeah, yeah.

1291
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:15,220
Could you, could you check on the T?

1292
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:17,220
Yes, absolutely.

1293
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:18,260
Anyone else?

1294
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:23,520
All right, I'll take your silence as a no T answer.

1295
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:27,420
But everyone is just dazed as, it's been a long.

1296
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:29,460
Stevie ratchet also.

1297
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:32,420
Stevie in the front right door of the fridge.

1298
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:34,940
There's some energy drink, the kind you like Beck.

1299
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:36,660
Sorry, the cat is making it sound like

1300
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:38,020
I'm touching my mic stand.

1301
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:39,380
It's not me, it's the cat.

1302
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:41,180
So we've got him ratcheted down.

1303
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:43,100
The cat touched my mic stand.

1304
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:44,960
I swear it wasn't me dude.

1305
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:47,760
If he's ratcheted down Beck would happily go upstairs

1306
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,280
to grab an energy drink.

1307
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,720
You said you liked it that time you came to my house

1308
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:52,640
three and a half years ago.

1309
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:54,200
So I keep some around now.

1310
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:55,880
Oh dude, thanks.

1311
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:58,280
Is it three and a half years old or?

1312
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:00,560
No, no, I replace them every six months.

1313
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:02,720
Oh dude, Cal.

1314
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,760
That's so thoughtful of you, man.

1315
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:06,000
You're a great camera man.

1316
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,160
Oh, thanks Cal.

1317
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:08,600
You're a great anchor.

1318
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,280
Thank you, I will be again.

1319
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:13,180
Dude, you're gonna be like the anchor

1320
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:14,720
after this story gets out.

1321
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:16,560
This is like 9-11, isn't it?

1322
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:17,800
Okay, so I'm picturing.

1323
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:20,200
Julius hears the word story and perks up.

1324
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:21,660
I was picturing this whole time.

1325
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:23,940
They're having this conversation in the kitchen

1326
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:26,920
and Julius is just standing at the top of the stairs

1327
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:29,280
out of view from them listening

1328
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,400
and just picking at his face.

1329
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:32,800
Oh God.

1330
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:35,280
In the darkness of the basement stairwell.

1331
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:38,520
One hand typing barely legible notes

1332
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:40,800
on what is gonna go into the edit

1333
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,040
and the other just peeling skin.

1334
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:44,440
You do hear at that moment.

1335
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:46,960
Julius, what do you like to drink?

1336
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,040
Energy drink.

1337
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:49,900
There's a whole six pack.

1338
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:51,200
Would you like some?

1339
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:54,240
He kind of wanders over there, still doing both things.

1340
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:58,840
And now that you have Greg Godel secured in the basement

1341
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:02,940
and the four of you are sharing caffeine in the kitchen.

1342
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:04,520
Let's call that ambulance, huh?

1343
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:05,580
It's close enough.

1344
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:09,760
Yeah, let's just walk with our tea and energy drinks.

1345
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:10,680
It's a nice day.

1346
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:11,880
I don't have insurance.

1347
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:13,800
It is nice being back in the city.

1348
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:16,480
Where everyone knows your name.

1349
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:20,160
Julius sniffs as in like, it's nice to smell the air again.

1350
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:22,920
Does he smell regular air or is it?

1351
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:25,120
It is exactly what you think it smells like.

1352
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:26,200
Uh-oh.

1353
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:29,960
Or that could mean, I don't know what that means.

1354
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:31,000
I don't know what that means.

1355
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:31,880
What do you think it smells like?

1356
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:33,180
It's why I asked, I don't know.

1357
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:35,160
Yeah, it smells like that.

1358
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:38,200
Okay, he's happily walking to the hospital,

1359
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:40,720
peeling his skin and losing blood.

1360
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:44,200
No, we're, as you like you walk out the front door

1361
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:45,680
and just start strolling down there

1362
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:47,000
and we're like, we grab you by the shoulders

1363
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,740
and we're like, no, no, no, no, get in the can van,

1364
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:50,280
get in the can van.

1365
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:51,980
Come on, we're driving you.

1366
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:53,240
He allows it.

1367
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:54,800
Do I stay here?

1368
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,140
Is that okay or?

1369
00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:57,900
Yeah, Stevie, you stay here.

1370
00:50:57,900 --> 00:50:59,520
We're gonna get him some medical attention

1371
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:01,240
and then as soon as they've got them checked up,

1372
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:04,640
I think we're pulling an all-nighter down at the station.

1373
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:07,720
Okay, all right, well, you have my number, so.

1374
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:08,560
Of course.

1375
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:10,680
If anything happens there, let me know.

1376
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:11,680
No can intern.

1377
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:16,080
I'll let you know if anything happens on my end, obviously.

1378
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:19,680
You know your number one job here, right?

1379
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:22,300
Don't let Greg kill himself.

1380
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:24,400
Right, yes, obvious, I mean, yeah.

1381
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:25,620
Stevie, if I had more time,

1382
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:28,020
I would help you move my collection of antique steak knives

1383
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:30,360
out of the basement, but we've really got to get,

1384
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:36,560
really got to get out of here and get him to the hospital

1385
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:38,000
and then get this thing cut.

1386
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,320
I think you can handle that, right?

1387
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:43,160
Hard cut to the steak knife collection in the basement

1388
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:46,680
and swift cut back to you guys waving goodbye.

1389
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:51,580
Here's a glass case full of like all these blocks of knives.

1390
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:55,960
Full fucking wooden sets.

1391
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:58,520
But there is a thing that says, do not touch on us.

1392
00:51:58,520 --> 00:51:59,360
Oh, that might help.

1393
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:00,200
There you go.

1394
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,020
That might help.

1395
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:04,720
Okay.

1396
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:06,280
I feel so much better, Julius says,

1397
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:08,440
after spending some time in the hospital.

1398
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:13,000
I'm glad, says Cal, Colorado,

1399
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,760
after sitting in the waiting room playing with TikTok.

1400
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:19,340
I need you to stay overnight, says the nurse.

1401
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:20,180
Oh.

1402
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:21,880
Julius winks and agrees.

1403
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:22,720
All right.

1404
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:27,920
Guess it's you and me on the edit, Beck.

1405
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:31,760
And the two of you.

1406
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:34,480
Like we're standing by his hospital bed while she says this?

1407
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:35,320
Yeah.

1408
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:36,160
Or like in the emergency room,

1409
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:37,800
they just got him in the hallway on a bed.

1410
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:39,920
Like ma'am, there is some news tonight.

1411
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:41,360
Do you happen to recognize me?

1412
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:43,060
Cal, Colorado city action news.

1413
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:43,900
And I wink.

1414
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:45,720
49.

1415
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:47,880
So yeah.

1416
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:48,720
Yeah.

1417
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:49,560
Oh, oh yeah.

1418
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:50,520
Call Colorado.

1419
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:52,600
Um, well, as you know, the news never sleeps.

1420
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:53,440
Of course not.

1421
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:54,720
But this man needs to,

1422
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:57,840
his face is broken in like multiple places.

1423
00:52:57,840 --> 00:52:59,140
We need to do CAT scans.

1424
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:00,400
We need to do X-rays.

1425
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:01,520
We need to draw blood.

1426
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:02,520
Sounds expensive.

1427
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:04,300
Let's just give me a Tylenol.

1428
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:05,960
Or, you know, something stronger.

1429
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:07,040
Anything that can.

1430
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:08,840
Let's just get him back on his feet for now.

1431
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:10,040
And then like we can bring him back.

1432
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:11,160
We'll bring him back in the morning.

1433
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:12,000
Right, yes.

1434
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,680
I'll be back for sure.

1435
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:15,040
1 p.m. at the latest.

1436
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:16,000
She starts laughing.

1437
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,040
She's like, I gotta be honest with you.

1438
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:21,020
I'm not sure if legally I'm allowed to let him leave.

1439
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:21,860
No, that makes a lot of sense.

1440
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:23,760
I'm not sure if you're legally allowed to make me stay.

1441
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:27,180
Okay, that's scary and fine.

1442
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:28,760
Why did you come here?

1443
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:30,080
For something quick.

1444
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:31,160
It's the hospital.

1445
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:33,400
If you want something quick, go to Walgreens.

1446
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:35,520
You got better stuff than Walgreens?

1447
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:38,200
Yeah, but we're gonna need to book you overnight

1448
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:40,000
to put fluids in you.

1449
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,520
This is Cal, Colorado.

1450
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:42,800
If you could just help us out.

1451
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:45,000
We will have him back in the morning.

1452
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,880
But he refuses to not be a part of the news.

1453
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,800
We're just asking, you can clean up his cuts

1454
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:53,400
and make sure that.

1455
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:54,600
I wanna try a persuade role on him.

1456
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:55,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1457
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:57,440
And go ahead and assist.

1458
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:01,080
You can add a plus 20, the two of you, if you succeed.

1459
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:02,200
Yep, success.

1460
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:03,480
So plus 20.

1461
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:05,240
Oh, and he already succeeded.

1462
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:07,440
I passed my persuade.

1463
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:08,280
Oh.

1464
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:09,360
A 46 on a 50.

1465
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:12,320
That plus 40, which puts me over, and I fail.

1466
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:13,160
Oh.

1467
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:13,980
Oh.

1468
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:14,820
Oh.

1469
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:15,660
Oh.

1470
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:16,480
Oh.

1471
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:17,320
Oh.

1472
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:18,160
We are way too convinced.

1473
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:20,000
The dice work in the worst way ever.

1474
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:20,840
What a shame.

1475
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:22,520
She's like, uh, yeah, whatever you guys want.

1476
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:24,320
And you're all like, he should stay here.

1477
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:25,160
Oh.

1478
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:25,980
Oh.

1479
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:26,820
Oh.

1480
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:28,880
Those are pain pills, you're putting them in pain.

1481
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:32,120
Yeah, I can do like a steroid shot.

1482
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:34,160
I can give you half a D6, I guess,

1483
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:35,400
if you're not gonna stay overnight.

1484
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:37,060
Half a D6 plus one.

1485
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:37,880
Not a chance.

1486
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:38,720
Wink.

1487
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,800
Half of three is two.

1488
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:47,040
So yeah, you go up from two hit points to four hit points,

1489
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:48,880
which is quite substantial.

1490
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:50,040
Plenty of hit points.

1491
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:51,520
Well then unfortunately we do get to the point

1492
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:53,540
where we're looking at you only two hit points better,

1493
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:55,400
and we're like, maybe you should stay.

1494
00:54:55,400 --> 00:55:00,400
I thought you would be better.

1495
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:05,200
It's just the fact that a couple of the cuts

1496
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:08,480
have now been like pushed together with a bandaid,

1497
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:11,440
like the kind of butterfly kind of holding

1498
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:12,400
the pieces together.

1499
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:15,880
And then currently you've got fluids going into you,

1500
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:18,640
and you've also, they're gonna do blood work.

1501
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:20,320
No they're not, he gets up.

1502
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:21,160
Okay.

1503
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:26,000
And I take these two a day, twice a day.

1504
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,500
You know, your nurse always gives you your medicine.

1505
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:29,960
I'll be back tomorrow.

1506
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:31,200
It's just a little something something

1507
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:32,920
from our personal stash.

1508
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:35,640
You all succeeded on your persuade checks.

1509
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:38,960
She's like, okay, here's some of the good stuff.

1510
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:39,880
And?

1511
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:42,200
Two a day, twice a day keeps the demons away.

1512
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:45,080
Again, like I said, we'll be back 1 p.m.

1513
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:45,940
two at the latest.

1514
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:48,040
To get him, you know, the full treatment.

1515
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:50,240
Maybe like 24 hours from now,

1516
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:52,520
if he does want to stay up till nine to watch his segment.

1517
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:53,360
I don't know.

1518
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:54,200
We'll see, but.

1519
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:57,240
I can watch the segment from the hospital.

1520
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:59,200
That's remarkably mature of you.

1521
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:00,320
Let's fucking go.

1522
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:03,840
Vroom vroom, the can-van speeds.

1523
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:06,040
As you're heading out down the hallway,

1524
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:09,720
you hear a man hiccup and shit his pants at the same time.

1525
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:11,720
Julia says, hm, cucumbers?

1526
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:12,720
That could be a story.

1527
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:15,240
Camera goes right back to the vroom vroom of the can-van

1528
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:20,240
as you head back down to the city action news HQ.

1529
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:22,300
We see the columns, we see the glass,

1530
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:25,040
we see the beautiful moss, we saw the landscaping,

1531
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:28,640
we see the marble-less floor as you enter.

1532
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:29,720
I miss that marble.

1533
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:33,440
It's the three of you, rolling in, ready to go,

1534
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:34,960
as you hit the edit bay.

1535
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:38,440
We are rolling Julius in in a hospital wheelchair.

1536
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:40,160
Oh, nice, wheelchair to go.

1537
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:42,020
We bump the doors open with his legs.

1538
00:56:42,020 --> 00:56:44,800
As Julius is- Roll a date for it?

1539
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:45,640
As Julius is-

1540
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:49,460
I run.

1541
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:53,520
As Julius is wheeled in, he's thinking,

1542
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:54,840
but he says it out loud.

1543
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:56,400
He's like, I'll be Raylan now.

1544
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:57,240
Raylan?

1545
00:56:57,720 --> 00:56:58,560
It's your-

1546
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:00,920
That's my family's name,

1547
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:03,360
but they've always considered me not a Raylan.

1548
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:05,680
Julius, remember what I was telling Stevie.

1549
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:07,300
You don't have to be your family.

1550
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:08,880
You can be your own man.

1551
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:09,720
A newsman.

1552
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:11,280
Julius nods.

1553
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:12,640
After what we've been through,

1554
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:14,800
I definitely feel closer to you guys.

1555
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:17,480
I mean, yeah, that was the craziest thing

1556
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:18,920
that's ever happened in my life.

1557
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:20,720
That was the third craziest thing

1558
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:22,200
that's ever happened in my life.

1559
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:23,480
Let's show the people.

1560
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,600
Wait, what, Cal?

1561
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:29,040
Vivica pops out of the editing bay

1562
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:32,080
and is like doing a big stretch of her shoulders

1563
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:33,960
and then pops her knuckles.

1564
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:35,560
And she's like, oh, hey guys, sorry.

1565
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:37,720
I'm actually heading out for the night pretty beat,

1566
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:40,020
but do you want me to take care of anything

1567
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:40,960
for you guys before I go?

1568
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:41,800
Or are you good to go?

1569
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:42,940
Do we need her help on this

1570
00:57:42,940 --> 00:57:44,400
or do we know what we're doing?

1571
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:46,760
I think Beck would know enough.

1572
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:47,920
He's not an editor,

1573
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:50,040
but he would know enough about how to edit.

1574
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:53,440
Like he normally does want Vivica there to do the editing.

1575
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:54,280
Sure.

1576
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:55,960
But I think, I look at Cal and Julius,

1577
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:58,240
I think maybe we should handle this one

1578
00:57:58,240 --> 00:57:59,760
or do you want like a professional

1579
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:00,600
set of eyes on this? She gives you

1580
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:01,420
an inquisitive look.

1581
00:58:01,420 --> 00:58:02,260
She's like, what do you mean?

1582
00:58:02,260 --> 00:58:04,080
Is it anything like super intense?

1583
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:06,200
Vivica, how did you get your job here?

1584
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:08,760
Oh, that is a big question.

1585
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:11,860
Yeah, no, I went to school, applied, intern,

1586
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:14,120
got the job, kept moving up, started getting paid,

1587
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:15,660
get health insurance next year.

1588
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:18,040
Have you ever, oh, yes.

1589
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:19,480
So you're what, 10 years in?

1590
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:20,320
Yeah.

1591
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Have you ever worked for the Godel company?

1592
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:26,960
No.

1593
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:28,300
You might want to see this.

1594
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:29,140
Okay, yeah.

1595
00:58:29,140 --> 00:58:31,260
I mean, if you've got some juicy goss,

1596
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:33,240
I'll get the tea brewing.

1597
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:35,880
Vivica, do you want to edit the biggest news story

1598
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:37,200
since 9-11?

1599
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:40,080
She gives you just like the biggest eyes,

1600
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:42,840
kind of brows waggling about.

1601
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:45,200
I bet you would, but we have to do this one on our own.

1602
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:48,240
Oh, you can't just leave me hanging like that, what?

1603
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:50,080
Vivica, I forgot.

1604
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:51,960
There's something that you can't know about

1605
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:53,200
that's in this footage.

1606
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,360
That is actually what I forgot.

1607
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:56,200
She can't know about the God shit.

1608
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:57,160
Fuck you guys.

1609
00:58:57,160 --> 00:59:01,520
And she grabs the door and heads back into the editing bay.

1610
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:03,020
She goes back into the editing bay.

1611
00:59:03,020 --> 00:59:04,440
She's like, I'm going to edit this.

1612
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:05,840
If you guys are going to be weird about it,

1613
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:06,960
I want to see.

1614
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:11,400
Oh, how do we decide if we can trust her?

1615
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:14,120
Guys, Vivica is like one of my best friend,

1616
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:15,520
coworker friends here.

1617
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:16,760
She's always had my back.

1618
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:19,440
And I mean, obviously she's never seen anything like this,

1619
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:20,280
but-

1620
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:21,960
Is she like religious?

1621
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:23,360
I don't think so.

1622
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:25,920
They're like looking in through the glass door

1623
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:27,880
that's kind of tinted at her.

1624
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:30,040
And she's like bringing the computer back up.

1625
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:32,320
She's getting the programs going, yeah.

1626
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:33,600
And she's good at what she does.

1627
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:35,560
I mean, we're going to have a good looking piece

1628
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:37,440
if she's ever fingerprints on it.

1629
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:40,200
Julius was thinking about like us editing it

1630
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:42,920
versus the quality of having her help us.

1631
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:43,760
And it's gotta be-

1632
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:46,280
It's a charming amateurism versus...

1633
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:48,440
It might be the individual life,

1634
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:51,200
but it will be a greatly edited segment, right?

1635
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:53,040
Here's the deal though, guys.

1636
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:55,720
I could just like, I think I should just like

1637
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:58,800
not give her the time codes for the stuff with Fox.

1638
00:59:58,800 --> 00:59:59,640
Perfect.

1639
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:01,840
If you can pre-scan the footage and yeah.

1640
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:02,680
Yeah.

1641
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:04,240
So that's in the earlier episodes,

1642
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:06,520
that's one of Beck's things is that he has like an eidetic,

1643
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:09,320
is an eidetic memory of like the footage that he has

1644
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:11,680
where it is on the,

1645
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:14,120
he knows of the timestamps of everything you shot.

1646
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:15,920
So he just won't give her those timestamps.

1647
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:18,120
Who was making that crazy noise?

1648
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:19,600
That was me.

1649
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:24,280
I had a bunch of spit in my mouth from burping a bunch

1650
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:25,320
and I had to swallow it.

1651
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:27,440
We have got to get Luke to a hospital, guys.

1652
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:29,400
Hey, you know what I love about our podcast

1653
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:31,840
and what I don't understand about fucking NPR?

1654
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:33,160
Oh no.

1655
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:35,320
Is the, is there liberal nonsense?

1656
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:40,400
No, they obviously have gone for a certain fidelity

1657
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:44,240
in their mics that picks up every bit of moisture

1658
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:49,240
in your mouth or lack thereof and everybody is just like,

1659
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:53,280
it's so hard to listen to sometimes.

1660
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:54,280
It's me hard to listen to.

1661
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:56,600
Yeah, I get hard listening to it sometimes.

1662
01:00:57,480 --> 01:01:01,160
That's why NPR stands for National Boner Radio.

1663
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:04,320
What?

1664
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:06,280
NPR.

1665
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:09,320
NPR, National Boner Radio,

1666
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:10,920
that would be a good shock shock.

1667
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:16,920
You're listening to NPR with penis in the clit.

1668
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:22,720
I'm the clit.

1669
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:23,720
I'm the clit.

1670
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:31,160
All right, Vivica, let's edit this thing.

1671
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:33,200
We've got a long night ahead of us.

1672
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:34,040
I bet.

1673
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:34,880
I'll be right back.

1674
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:35,880
Would you all like some coffee?

1675
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:36,720
Yes.

1676
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:38,440
Cal, you follow, like the camera follows Cal

1677
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:39,640
to the little office kitchen

1678
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:41,280
and he makes everybody some coffee.

1679
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:43,960
He knows how many creams Beck takes or doesn't.

1680
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:46,000
He grabs a handful of creamers and sugar

1681
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,520
for everybody else who he doesn't know

1682
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:49,160
and he stops by his office

1683
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:52,720
and he pours a hefty belt of whiskey into his.

1684
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:55,520
In the editing bay, Beck cracks his knuckles

1685
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:58,440
and he says, okay, first it's like a,

1686
01:01:58,440 --> 01:01:59,680
there's a jackalip that I fall on.

1687
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:01,600
You can, there's footage of that

1688
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:03,080
at four minutes and three seconds.

1689
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:04,240
And then there's also the time

1690
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:06,040
when the god turtle fell off the stool

1691
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:08,080
and that's at seven minutes and eight seconds.

1692
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:10,000
Oh, and there's also the machine that heals people.

1693
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,640
That's at three minutes and five seconds in

1694
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:13,080
and he's running down the list.

1695
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:14,600
Julius is looking at his notes

1696
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:17,120
and it's just Z a bunch of times

1697
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:18,880
that he's like, he puts his phone down

1698
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:21,080
and he's just like helping rattle off

1699
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:22,520
other things that happened.

1700
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:24,640
The children who look like animals

1701
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:26,240
but are also humans, that's it.

1702
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:28,280
Go ahead and roll.

1703
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:30,800
Did she crit fail a grip roll?

1704
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:31,640
Yep.

1705
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:32,460
We're fucking dumb.

1706
01:02:32,460 --> 01:02:33,640
We should have kicked her out.

1707
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:35,920
That's an 88 on the grip roll.

1708
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:36,960
God.

1709
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:37,880
Vivica, are you with me?

1710
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:43,040
You see Vivica just staring blankly at the monitors.

1711
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:44,800
We may have made a mistake

1712
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:46,720
onboarding Vivica to this project.

1713
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:50,440
I kind of forgot that this stuff is psyche damaging.

1714
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:52,320
Welcome to Godal's gorge.

1715
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:53,280
Yeah, Vivica.

1716
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:55,720
Welcome to Godal's gorge.

1717
01:02:55,720 --> 01:03:00,720
["My life is great and it's all my fault"]

1718
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:30,720
["My life is great and it's all my fault"]
