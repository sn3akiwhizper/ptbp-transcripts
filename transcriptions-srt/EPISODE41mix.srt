00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,040
Hello my loyal listeners, it's your radiotherapist wolf the dog and I'm here to dole out suspect

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,880
advice to people I barely know anything about and soothe your worries when it concerns the

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,960
goings on and contention and the world.

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,640
Or uh making them worse sometimes, hell I don't know what I'm doing here but y'all keep

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,800
listening.

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:29,940
As always we are broadcasting from 694.2 PTBP, the only place your worried minds can go to

7
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:37,300
be soothed when the galaxy is trying to swallow y'all up.

8
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:43,140
Anyway this week's howlin with wolf comes from at 1983bit who tweeted about the show

9
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,980
and tagged at pretending pod.

10
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:51,060
Spreading the news about this show is the only thing that will keep it on the air y'all.

11
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:54,820
Plus it makes my heart full of kissy kissy feelings.

12
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,060
They right.

13
00:00:56,060 --> 00:01:00,660
Did the outstanding officers of contention notice the signs at the town's border that

14
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:05,280
said it was twinned with a small town in England called Uddersfield?

15
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,840
This is a message from Wolf's British cousin who has heard the news of the strange goings

16
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,840
on.

17
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:16,500
Uddersfield is safe y'all apart from the influx of top grade cocaine courtesy of the local

18
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,380
church which is floodin the cobbled streets of this west Yorkshire town.

19
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:24,820
Don't forget to send us a postcard from Contention Wolf.

20
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,980
We await your next update.

21
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,140
Tom from Uddersfield UK.

22
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,700
Now listen here Tom the dog.

23
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,180
I told you to never ride into the show.

24
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:41,300
I told you what I'd do to you if I ever caught a whiff of you scurrying about.

25
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:45,740
I'd throw your soul into a dimension from which you'd never return.

26
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:51,140
You'd drift on slowly grasping at everything but touching nothing while you fade from

27
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:54,380
existence over millennia.

28
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:59,020
But nice to know things are good in jolly old London Thomas from Uddersby.

29
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:01,000
Speaking of jolly times.

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,860
If you want to write up something for your wolf to howl tag at pretending pod on Instagram

31
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:11,060
or Twitter tag pretending to be people on Facebook or write a 5 star review and email

32
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:14,600
us at pretendingpod at gmail dot com.

33
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:19,500
Also don't sleep on the contest happening over on the subreddit r slash pretending to

34
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,900
be people.

35
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:26,280
You could win your very own hardback slipcase set of Delta Green the Role Playing Game.

36
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:31,320
So join up with the community there and get to stepping on that contest y'all.

37
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:36,140
Sometimes when I hear about the horrors of the world I feel like stepping into a different

38
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,140
reality.

39
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,220
It's the news.

40
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:44,260
Last time Francis Beans embedded a big ol' rusty fish hook into John Lee Pettymore's

41
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,780
shoulder before Clark Bishop could step in.

42
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:51,620
Clark gave her a boot to the gut and she fell into the massive aquarium hitting her head

43
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:56,860
on the catwalk on the way down and they left her to float face down in the murky water

44
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:00,220
for pretty much the entirety of the episode.

45
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:05,020
Meanwhile Keith Vigna escaped from the creature that swallowed him and George Piston.

46
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:11,640
He pulled it off by firing his small but powerful pistol into the wall of this beast planting

47
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:17,080
a frag grenade into the newly made enclave and using George Piston as a shield from the

48
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,080
blast.

49
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,280
Keith hit the surface laughing and gibbering some nonsense about something being inside

50
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,280
him.

51
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:29,080
They tried to let Kathy Piston off the hook from which she hanged but they fucked up and

52
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,320
dropped her to the bottom of the tank.

53
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:36,960
John Lee Pettymore jumped in, rolled luckily and paddled Kathy Piston back into the presuming

54
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,040
safety of the catwalk.

55
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:45,560
Keith performed CPR on both Francis and Kathy but wouldn't you know it only Kathy survived.

56
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:51,000
After releasing Doug Jacobs in the body of Agent Trent Chad from his arm shredding fish

57
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,600
hook our three protagonists and their two new companions stand together ready to take

58
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:02,720
on the evil of Marvin Glass and foil his plans to take over the hometown of contention.

59
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:08,240
But first I've set aside just enough time to prepare a brand new song.

60
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:13,920
It may take some time to get used to like Bitter Coffee and Step-Parents but it's what

61
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:19,660
the American masses want inside of them like Bitter Coffee and Step-Parents.

62
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:24,560
It's kudzu with no backbone.

63
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:53,920
Let's start the episode now.

64
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,200
Zach later.

65
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,200
Start it here.

66
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,200
Pop pop pop!

67
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,200
Oh god.

68
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,200
Now you can see.

69
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,200
Yeah.

70
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,200
It's visual.

71
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:06,240
There was a guy on Reddit today that asked if you treated- fuck.

72
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,240
I think it was-

73
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,920
I think his example was IMDB scores and Rotten Tomatoes but I just used Rotten Tomatoes but

74
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:16,440
it was if you treated directors scores as a batting average that if you took all their

75
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:21,040
scores and averaged them out and I got really curious so I did a bunch of them and it was

76
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,040
really interesting.

77
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,040
Nice.

78
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,040
Who had the best?

79
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:29,400
So obviously because it's averages like Kubrick was way up there because he only has like

80
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,580
six films and they're all a hundred basically.

81
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:38,100
The ones I thought were interesting Ingmar Bergman and Martin Scorsese both have like

82
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:43,260
80% averages and they've both got like 35 films each.

83
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,260
They've got a huge list.

84
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,860
I was gonna say Scorsese would probably be up there.

85
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:47,860
Their status is way up there.

86
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,300
The one I was surprised was low.

87
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,300
What was it?

88
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,260
I think it was Fincher maybe had a really low score.

89
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,620
I wonder who the worst is.

90
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,540
I did M. Night Shyamalan just to see and it was 49.

91
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:01,660
It was really low compared to the others.

92
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:05,460
He's had some bangers in some really really truly awful movies.

93
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:08,940
Still batting 490 so.

94
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:12,140
If he was a baseball player he'd be in the Hall of Fame.

95
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:23,780
So as a GM and as a goon as I traditionally call myself or dumb as some have been known

96
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:31,620
to say I have an interesting time with how we end a session or an episode in some of

97
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:38,660
these cases do I do a cliffhanger is fun often or do I give you guys something right

98
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:43,620
off the bat the next time that you're not prepared for you just always wait for somebody

99
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:51,020
to say something dumb or funny and then I start screaming shut up it's over stop playing

100
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:59,660
the fun game and then we have to stop talking to each other you won't take this seriously

101
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:05,580
so let's go ahead and kick it off let's see where we're at I think you guys were on the

102
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:12,660
catwalks walking up to we had getting down we had just got a trench head Trent Chad Doug

103
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:18,240
Jacobs Chad yeah we just got him down and did we do anything else where was that pretty

104
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,340
much this I'm pretty sure that's where we ended I think that's about where it ended

105
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:29,180
you did you did some sort of a cheerful gathering the group together speech we all high-fived

106
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:35,740
freeze-frame high-five Francis Dunn at this point right or is she very dead very dead

107
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:41,900
and that's what I thought very dead Francis is bacon so you guys are standing on this catwalk

108
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:48,540
with Doug Jacobs in the body of agent Trent Chad who's trying to recover from everything that's

109
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:53,860
happened to him and Kathy piston who you've been having some interesting conversations with will

110
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:59,060
you remind me how much time has passed since the last time we saw Doug Chad the last time you saw

111
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:04,020
him would have been in the cage but I mean in mortal time did we put has a day passed or two

112
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:11,060
I think about a day okay though you've all been unconscious remember in the last 24 hours when

113
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:20,500
we died no not really it seems like weeks ago so you guys are all standing there and the there's

114
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:27,820
the catwalk that leads away from the torture chamber or prison or whatever weird aquarium

115
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:34,220
topping that you are currently standing in and on the other side away from that is the elevator

116
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:39,620
door and I need you all to roll alertness for me as you begin walking toward the elevator door

117
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:55,540
I pass an 18 on a 70 pass 54 on a 60 the eight nice yeah three successes so you guys all see

118
00:08:55,660 --> 00:09:02,700
as you're walking down this catwalk busting up out of the water just to the right of you

119
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:10,700
is the fish man you saw earlier wearing the brown jumpsuit who is walking the perimeter in here and

120
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:19,380
he flops up onto the catwalk kind of like a fish out of out of water and begins to shake off and

121
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:29,300
we are going to enter combat cool enter combat now I've done something kind of fun maybe perhaps

122
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:35,020
interesting for this specific combat that we're in right now we all got to get ourselves drenched in

123
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:41,860
the bathtub this is very cool whoa I assume this will be posted on the Instagram it will indeed so

124
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:46,380
what I've done is I used a whiteboard to make a map of the room that you're in you'll see the

125
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:52,620
grid has the green where the water is and the white is the catwalk that you're standing on

126
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:58,380
remember catwalk is kind of great you know so you can still see and very much smell the water coming

127
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:03,980
out from underneath you that black X's are on a couple of the water spots those are where bodies

128
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:10,400
are hanging and over there there's a circle with a little frowny face and two X's that's where the

129
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:16,800
body of Francis beans is and then down here we have the catwalk leading to the elevator door we

130
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:24,280
also have five little little magnets three of which are cat butts the butts of cats I thought

131
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:32,400
they were dinosaurs they look extremely similar to brontosauruses and then we have two little

132
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:38,600
markers down here one is a kitty pen magnet thing and the other one's just a little brick so the

133
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:44,120
little brick is gonna be agent Trent Chad's body with Doug Jacobs trapped inside and the little

134
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:51,120
kitty there is going to be Kathy piston what color cats do you guys want to be we've got an orange

135
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:56,800
cat a gray cat and a black cat I want to be the orange cat I'll be the gray cat I got the black

136
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,760
cat then all righty is that elevator door the one we came in to get into this room it is indeed okay

137
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:15,000
so are we positioned correctly right now sure okay then we leave you got this Kathy so the elevator

138
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:25,520
door so this brown suit fish man flops in between you guys and the elevator door and stands up and

139
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:33,960
shakes all this water off of him and looks up at you and we are now in combat Joe Clark Bishop

140
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:40,520
always acts first what do you do I want to pull so I handed Kathy a gun last episode yeah I want

141
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:45,800
to pull the other one from my waistband and throw it to Doug Chad all right and if I can I'd like to

142
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:51,280
still pull mine out of my boot can I do two of those I would say that you could like pull one

143
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:56,080
throw it and then pull another but maybe not shoot this turn that's what I'll do if that works for

144
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:03,040
you and who's got a better dexterity between John Lee Pettymore and Keith Vigna I have 60 50

145
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:09,360
all right so Keith Vigna you are up next so real quick Doug Chad might not be able to catch too

146
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:22,440
well with his stigmata dance I didn't want to influence your role-playing decision but I'll

147
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:28,360
roll for him let's see if he'll have a 40% chance to catch it that's not bad given where the cat

148
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:34,720
butts are I could just grapevine it down to him he rolled a 31 yeah so that's our Doug Chad he

149
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:44,280
grimaces and is like alright ready to go and then he loads he like cocks the pistol so you can tell

150
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:51,080
he means business and it is Keith Vigna's turn I pull out my tiny powerful gun aim it right at

151
00:12:51,080 --> 00:13:00,160
that fish man and take a shot all righty go ahead and roll firearms for me 74 and a 70 oh so you

152
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:06,880
fire into the wall and it actually makes a divot in this so the wall right next to the elevator is

153
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:12,600
that same like onyx kind of like black obsidian and you fire into it and it actually like kind of

154
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:17,880
cracks and you can see in the reflection it like shatters into a bunch of different like mirror

155
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:25,080
reflections all coming back and it looks very cool awesome miss thanks John Lee Pettymore it's

156
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:31,000
your turn I want to sling my shotgun like down to my hip and pull my pistol out with my other hand

157
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:37,120
and give them a blast with each with each yeah dual wielding yes all right I'm gonna have you

158
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:49,800
roll firearms at negative 20% oh man hopefully this was a good call yes 25 on a modified 60 so

159
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:55,240
40 congratulations all right so you are almost point-blank range so you're gonna be in your

160
00:13:55,240 --> 00:14:01,080
second damage increment on the shotgun so you're gonna roll 3d6 for damage on that on just the

161
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:08,720
shotgun yeah and then also it was a pistol you said the heavy pistol in yep so 1d 10 3d 6 plus

162
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:21,320
two hell yeah good shot oh no okay so eight plus so 10 10 total all right so that blast goes

163
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:28,880
directly into his gut and have you ever was aiming for his guilt has he ever gutted a fish

164
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:36,680
before yeah what's it look like on the inside fish guts yeah so it's that you blast through

165
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:41,640
and you can tell especially since it's his turn next you'll be able to tell that he's gonna be

166
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:49,800
able to continue to act but according to what one might call I think it's D&D is it Dungeons

167
00:14:49,800 --> 00:15:04,040
and Dragons rules he is certainly bloodied immediately he's oh wow for talking ooh ooh for

168
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:11,720
talking talking talking for talking ooh ooh for talking talking talking yeah that's

169
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:40,080
talking talking talking you hear that all happen in quartet fashion as three other fish men show

170
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:45,400
up on the map and I will place them they're going to be on either side of you and in the

171
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:52,200
back of the room by Francis beans body they're flanking us there was another cat but available

172
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:58,960
and you saved it for a fish man there was what are those cats called it's got a black tail it's

173
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:05,080
like the one in meet the parents like Siamese sure and so with that these other you hear a

174
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:12,400
full quartet and surround sound of this chance oh by the way he has a smile while he's singing

175
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:18,040
more of a grimace than a smile I suppose more of a giant purple action figure for McDonald's and

176
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:26,840
he his teeth are like human teeth I don't know if I've ever explained that when he when he grimaces

177
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:33,000
these uh these mutated humans they still have it's like those fish clown fish they're not

178
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:40,800
fish I think I looked it up once and they've got real weird human looking teeth yeah and

179
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:48,880
this creatures in front of you also has those teeth with that his turn is finished and Doug

180
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:53,760
Jacobs Oh Kathy piston are both standing there with pistols in their hands well hey can we get

181
00:16:53,760 --> 00:17:01,360
back to the magnet thing real quick Doug was a cat okay okay you're absolutely right I fucked up

182
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:07,720
really bad here so we're gonna take away the just swap them the brick the brick is now fish man

183
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:15,000
the brick is now a fish man and Doug Jacobs is rightfully a cat but it's called a sheep's head

184
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:23,360
fish oh I hate that yeah it's really gross like it what I'm imagining it's bad in my mind space

185
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:32,960
bad oh freaking out they are they're both gonna fire in two two different directions here Kathy

186
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:38,800
is gonna shoot the one who is flanking you from the back and side and Doug Jacobs is gonna fire

187
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:45,240
at the one right in front of him Doug Jacobs misses wildly and fires into one of the shattered

188
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:52,040
pieces of wall that Keith fired into earlier breaking it further into a prettier site oh and

189
00:17:52,040 --> 00:18:01,000
Kathy piston fires true and does five damage to one of the fish men the one on the bottom the one

190
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:09,800
on the bottom nice good job Kathy Kathy piston fires straight and true she let loose a bullet

191
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:17,720
she slayed the fish man she shot gun real good fireball variable the other three fish men

192
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:29,040
continued in their their chanting and you hear a rumble and your feet begin to shake and you see

193
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:40,200
in the distance two massive claws grab on to the catwalk and begin ripping it down and the catwalk

194
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:49,720
fully breaks off into the water and where it once was you see this massive creature that looks

195
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:58,040
exactly like one of these fish men unclothed and four times larger and this one has a giant wound

196
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:06,880
in its side and it is bleeding out pus water and this black ichor what's the junk like oh it's

197
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:14,200
super tight that will be portrayed by this magnet for tank seven by Boulevard Brewing

198
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:22,680
smokestack series cool cool yeah making me thirsty and with that the giant monster fish

199
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:27,760
creatures in the game at the top of the order here it's gonna be Clark Bishop's turn and I

200
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:34,840
want to give you guys a few outlines for this combat basically in order to leave this room

201
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:39,240
from what you know right now you have to leave through the elevator in order for the elevator

202
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:43,880
to come you have to press the button you don't know how many rounds it's gonna take for the

203
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:50,600
elevator to come after you press the button so you have to survive until the elevator comes you

204
00:19:50,600 --> 00:20:03,960
can each move you make an elevator come carefully you can each move two spaces which I'm gonna

205
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:10,640
dictate as grid spots so you can move from like one water to the you know move up different water

206
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:16,760
spaces in the grid or no sorry you can move one space and act or you can move two spaces with no

207
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:21,400
how many spaces away is the button for the elevator the button for the elevator is going

208
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:26,340
to be two spaces away from where you all are now okay like the elevator bridge represents two

209
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:30,360
squares basically sure yeah yeah yeah cool all right Clark Bishop top of the round what do you

210
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:36,520
want to do I'm going to fire at the fish man that is blocking our way to the elevator all right go

211
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:48,040
ahead and roll firearms for me yeah I pass a 24 on an 80 already rolled damage that's a four four

212
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:55,960
on one d10 do you say anything cool does he die oh yeah fuck so you you firing into him with your

213
00:20:55,960 --> 00:21:10,080
pistol I got him hook line and sinker it's made all the cooler as the fish man stumbles back and

214
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:20,320
forth as being shot and looks at you and goes dogging and then falls off to the left side into

215
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:26,840
the water and you see blood start to dissipate all throughout the water he would have been a

216
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:34,120
really chill dude if he was like hook line and sinker barely knew her and then died that would

217
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:40,320
have been very chill you're a chill way to respond to somebody like action movie line yeah is Delta

218
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:45,320
green a game where if I've now used an action I can't move or can I go ahead and use the movement

219
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:55,960
I would have had game Joe is this okay it's a life it's a lifestyle in which you can move one

220
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:01,200
space after you fire yeah I'd like to go ahead and make my way middle of the gang weather making my

221
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:08,640
way the middle Clark Bishop is now in the middle on his way to the elevator one space away Keith

222
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:14,360
Vigna it's your turn hey do I have a clear shot on big boy you do he's pretty far away pretty

223
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:21,240
right now about 50 yards out I'll take one step or one square towards them and then take a shot

224
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:26,400
with my tiny powerful gun yeah do you do anything cool or do you just like walk slowly toward it or

225
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:31,880
do you tremble or are you scared at all this giant fucking beast that's in front of you I fought this

226
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:38,520
motherfucker already you fucking took this as I fire at him I say eat this noodle fish bitch

227
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:57,040
all right okay roll okay 93 wow you cannot roll a success to save your life sucks you just fire

228
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:04,520
this this gun I mean it the noise that it makes in this room every time you fire it is exhausting

229
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:13,760
to the ears as is your lack of good rolling strongly petty more stern can I make it to the

230
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:18,760
elevator this turn you absolutely can okay I want to do that and press the button now already pardon

231
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:29,040
me you press the button to the left of the elevator door and it lights up green a few more

232
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:37,520
times John Kathy piston is going to in full Keanu Reeves fashion just start walking slowly and

233
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:47,240
calmly to the fish man she already shot and continue firing into it succeeding once again

234
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:57,760
yeah awesome and compliant NPC oh but she she does fire true however she only wings them in

235
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:03,720
the shoulder and it does not seem to do any damage whatsoever which is interesting if you

236
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:09,720
had to put a numerical value on it I would say zero it seems like these fish men have some sort

237
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:18,720
of armor on their skin that is making them not take full damage from gunfire interesting like

238
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:27,040
an amphibious chainmail like an amphibious chainmail Doug Jacobs is going to join you on

239
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:32,400
the catwalk he's very scared he wants to get out of here he's tired his arms hurt and he's bleeding

240
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:38,440
all over the place he's very upset and for the last like couple hours he's just been doing

241
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:48,200
everything everyone says and he hated feeling that way and he's scared if it gets real bad we

242
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:54,400
just throw this bleeding bastard to the big fish like chum right I'm saying no of course not but

243
00:24:54,400 --> 00:25:03,680
I'm nodding yes these fish men both jump in the water ooh sneaky habits is bloop bloop and then

244
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:12,520
they pop out on either side of Keith Vigna they got some movement on them the massive lumbering

245
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:20,440
creature is clawing its way right toward Keith Vigna who is now being completely surrounded by

246
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:29,720
these amphibious creatures oh that's close and it gets close enough in one turn to go ahead and

247
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:45,680
try to claw at Keith Vigna succeeding so so Luke if you die before we play the next game do you

248
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:57,200
want to just uber home instead of the claw does nine damage so claw basically one of the like

249
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:06,320
claw just reach it like goes directly into your shoulder and the back four claws all dig into

250
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:16,200
your back and it is going to with a successful claw attack it has a chance to grab and it fails

251
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:22,320
the group the grab so it digs its claws into you for nine damage and you start bleeding just

252
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:29,080
profusely and you actually feel a crunch where it entered you because it went all the way through

253
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:38,640
the layer of metal that is in that arm gosh well fuck I have two hit points left not to say we're

254
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:44,360
fucked oh you have two hit points left and so you took nine damage when you had 11 so I'm gonna go

255
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:50,880
ahead with two hit points you might fall unconscious why did I say that so oh because we're playing a

256
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:58,600
game fun when we when we play by the oh we shouldn't be shakes your consequences everything

257
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:05,280
she always work out so I need you to roll a constitution check to stay awake as blood just

258
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:14,200
gushes 93 with different dice yeah that is absolutely remarkable as Keith Emmett light

259
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:22,600
goes out and he falls on to the catwalk Luke I'm gonna need you to leave the room yeah I figured

260
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:30,800
oh shit we'll save you Keith I hope so I've actually got a pretty decent plan I think

261
00:27:44,200 --> 00:28:12,080
the only one

262
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,960
try
