1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,840
Greetings, friends.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:06,160
It's your BFF, WTD.

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,160
BFF means beefy, funny friend.

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:15,160
And a WTD means wet-tongued doggy.

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,080
You're welcome.

6
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:22,080
TTYL, time to yell loudly.

7
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,640
There is a new howlin' with Wolf,

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,200
and that makes my nasty old heart always burst with love.

9
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,960
This howlin' with Wolf is from Distant Egg Song,

10
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,600
location, Houston, they write.

11
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,320
Thanks much to the trash slurpin' host with the most.

12
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,160
Always glad to hear your voice on the airwaves.

13
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,980
This goes out to Tamantha in St. Louis.

14
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:52,960
Hey, Vinnie, glad you turned me on to this podcast.

15
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,120
It made my 2020 better.

16
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,360
Regarding your question, I checked in Ma's recipe book.

17
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,280
The way to render the sacrificial,

18
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,400
purulent goo from a gamer's flesh

19
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,280
is to go low and slow for a minimum of eight hours.

20
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,080
Glad to see you and Vinnie and Galina.

21
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,920
Let's do it again soon.

22
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,080
Your brother from the Venuccia mother, Vinnie.

23
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,160
Mmm, damn, that recipe sounds

24
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,200
abso-fuckin'-lutely tasty, scrumptious, unctuous.

25
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,280
I must visit this all-mother

26
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,260
and exchange my forbidden recipes with them.

27
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:37,840
If you wanna write up somethin'

28
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,300
for your BFF forever, Wolf to Hal,

29
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,360
you can go fuck yourself.

30
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,680
Ha ha ha, I'm just kiddin'.

31
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,360
Fuck Mark Zuckerberg, I got some hot news.

32
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,760
I have it on good authority

33
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:55,080
that this here is the second of two Q&A sessions

34
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:58,680
to wrap up season one of somethin'.

35
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,600
And I have it on even better authority

36
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,600
that next Friday on November 5th, ha ha, shucks, for real,

37
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,380
am I gonna have to say some corny, stankin',

38
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:11,280
remember, remember nonsense?

39
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,640
V might be for vendetta to some folks,

40
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,640
but to me, V is for volumizing shampoo and conditioners.

41
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:23,600
And beginning next Friday, November 5th,

42
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,560
we will have a guest seated at the head of the table.

43
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,260
You might know him as the rules lawyer

44
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:33,360
on the Glass Cannon Network star finder program

45
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,280
Androids and Aliens.

46
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,680
And if you don't, you'll get to know David Winters

47
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,880
as the handler of pretending to be people

48
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:45,040
for the next five weeks

49
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,320
as he runs Joe, Luke, Thomas, and some idiot named Zack

50
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,240
through a classic Delta Green scenario.

51
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,480
Get ready for an absolute mess, y'all.

52
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,200
And finally, get ready for ol' Wolfie

53
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,320
to be an absolute mess.

54
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,920
It's time to say goodbye to a brand new song.

55
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,400
This premiere will be the last time I play it here

56
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:12,400
on the main feed of 694.2 PTBP.

57
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,240
So if you want to hear this infant baby

58
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,400
of a banger ever again,

59
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,760
you actually have tons of options.

60
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:25,280
One of which is just Google cuts you with no backbone.

61
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,040
Luke, you have a question for Justin?

62
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,280
Oh yeah, did you see the article came out today

63
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,640
or just the story of Chokin'?

64
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,480
No.

65
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,060
Yeah, Chokin' on Deez Nuts.

66
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,880
Got him!

67
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,720
He didn't get him.

68
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,560
He didn't say Chokin'.

69
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,380
He didn't say it.

70
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,640
Yeah, but I did.

71
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,480
I got you.

72
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,320
Yeah, he got you.

73
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,720
He got you to say Chokin' on Deez Nuts.

74
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,680
Yeah, I got you to say it.

75
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,240
And then I wasn't a participant.

76
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,840
Reverse got him!

77
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,900
Reverse got him.

78
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:26,880
I got got.

79
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,700
Thanks, Joe.

80
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,600
Someone in the UX industry, user experience industry

81
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,280
was telling me that like a lot of people she works with

82
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,240
no longer use Photoshop.

83
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,320
They use a program called Figma.

84
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,440
And I just had to like, be like, yeah, wow, interesting.

85
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,660
Because it's not a person I could say Figma balls to.

86
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,120
You know what?

87
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:00,760
We fucked around pretty hard last time.

88
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:05,320
And then it took us a long time to get into the questions.

89
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:08,460
And this time took a long time for y'all to find out.

90
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,080
I have a bad story first.

91
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:11,920
You want to hear it?

92
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,740
I do want to hear it.

93
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:13,580
Let's fuck around.

94
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,800
Let's fuck around.

95
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,080
So whenever we were clapping,

96
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,160
I forgot that I had stabbed my hand with a steak knife

97
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,120
earlier this week.

98
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,640
Why did you do that?

99
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,480
Oh, wow.

100
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,540
I have a hole in my hand.

101
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,380
Shit.

102
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,200
Wait, I didn't see it.

103
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,520
So that first clap, I clapped and like almost went.

104
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,120
Yeah, show us your hand hole again, please.

105
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,240
It's hard to see.

106
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,080
Hold it over to the screen.

107
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,040
It's like, Zach doesn't know how to use Windows.

108
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,360
Yeah, oh.

109
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,180
How'd you do that?

110
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,640
It doesn't look that bad.

111
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,480
It's deep.

112
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,760
I was trying to split two hash browns apart

113
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,600
that were frozen with a steak knife.

114
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,840
And I was holding them in my hand

115
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:59,840
where the knife, when it pierced through, would stab me.

116
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,160
And I literally went, I shouldn't be doing this.

117
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,720
And as I said that, it's spiraling.

118
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,960
Nice.

119
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,040
Like without much pressure at all.

120
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,280
And I just like stabbed into my hand

121
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,880
and I just was like, oh man.

122
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,960
The fact that you were sober when you did this.

123
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,060
Oh, it was an afternoon, yeah.

124
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,000
So you were drinking for a few hours at that point.

125
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,960
I'd been gone for hours, you know, a Tuesday afternoon.

126
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:28,840
Yeah, Tuesday afternoon.

127
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,920
So this is, you woke up and this was like

128
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,680
a midnight snack, almost.

129
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,800
And yeah, and luckily I was okay,

130
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,580
but I did see some hand chicken meat, as I like to call it.

131
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:44,240
Cause if you've ever like sliced chicken,

132
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,080
where it like kind of the muscle kind of split,

133
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,720
I did a little bit of that,

134
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,160
which was very fun to look at.

135
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,520
And I was like, oh man, that's bad.

136
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,520
You guys make chicken different than I do.

137
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,320
You ever split your chicken meat, bro?

138
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,200
You might not have seen the inside of your hand.

139
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,120
It's chickeny.

140
00:06:59,120 --> 00:06:59,960
Oh.

141
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,960
Have you ever seen the inside of your body?

142
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,680
Yeah, yeah.

143
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,700
Yeah, I've had some x-rays done.

144
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,880
I suppose I've seen the inside of my body.

145
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,800
Technically, yeah.

146
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,640
Yeah.

147
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,040
I go with Zach to his colonoscopy and take a gander.

148
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,860
Yeah, I do want it.

149
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,280
I'm Zach's second opinion.

150
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,040
I'm like, nah, I think there's something wrong.

151
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,880
That looks, doesn't look normal.

152
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,720
Pollip.

153
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,760
It's a pollip.

154
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,000
That's a pollip. Is that a Pokemon?

155
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,900
That's so cute.

156
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:28,740
Yeah.

157
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:33,820
Sir, it's, we try to get the patients as clean as possible,

158
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:34,960
but it's clearly shit.

159
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,200
You can see the corn.

160
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,360
Yeah, that's a pollip.

161
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,200
Wake him up, tell him.

162
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

163
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,440
You gotta wake him up because they put you in a daze.

164
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,240
It's a real a pollip of daisy.

165
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,120
Oh my God.

166
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,520
Pollip of daisy.

167
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,040
What?

168
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,860
Do we have any questions?

169
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:52,700
All of them.

170
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:57,240
The bollard asks, what the fuck?

171
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,200
Fuck you too.

172
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,840
I think what the fuck is an appropriate question.

173
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,760
Yeah, that was my first question to you.

174
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,680
To what we've done.

175
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,160
When you stop the recording, it's the last episode.

176
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,000
Oh yeah.

177
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,820
I think that's what I said.

178
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,840
I think that is what you said at the end of season one.

179
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,160
The fuck?

180
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,440
I mean, it's just a small town mystery.

181
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,680
Just a small town mystery.

182
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,040
They also asked, will we ever find out the backstory

183
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,800
of Wolf the dog?

184
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,080
I mean, we've had at least a-

185
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:32,920
There's a little bit.

186
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,240
We learned a little bit.

187
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,840
If you can, if you're, you know.

188
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,680
If you're smart.

189
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,720
Pretty clever, but yeah, you can,

190
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,160
all of Wolf the dog is in there.

191
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,160
So go back, re-listen, get those numbers up.

192
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,920
Definitely re-listen and get those numbers up.

193
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,760
Actually, at the Patreon $100 tier,

194
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,520
I will call you on Discord and tell you.

195
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,520
You have to be subscribed for two years.

196
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:59,360
It's patreon.com slash Justin wants money.

197
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,520
Yeah, alternatively, you can Venmo Justin $200.

198
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:10,960
If you listen to the 694.2 PTBP Pledge Drive episode,

199
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:15,960
you can see at least the story of Wolf the dog.

200
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,200
Yeah, there's some slight origin story in there.

201
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,040
That's how he comes into the studio.

202
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,320
He's a great DJ who loves eating trash

203
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,240
and I don't know why it needs to be any more than that.

204
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,080
Yup.

205
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,840
Celery Top asks, to do hakenu.

206
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,080
To do hakenu to you as well, son.

207
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,280
Nerds, cling as they cling on.

208
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,400
To do hakenu are true words of power,

209
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,680
but how did you come up with vis-a-girl

210
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,760
and shuck-a-tee-felicia?

211
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,880
Asked and answered.

212
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,720
Asked and answered.

213
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,040
We went over this one last time,

214
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,920
but hey, Celery Top, we like what you do.

215
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,760
You've done some sick art.

216
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,400
Exactly, pasted it again in the Google document.

217
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:55,920
I think Celery Top did the Contention Trucks artwork,

218
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,360
which is fucking rad, yeah.

219
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,360
Abadfeeling asks, question,

220
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,960
what was up with the feet eating?

221
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,160
I'm curious about that too.

222
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,800
No, I was gonna ask you, Joe, if you had an idea.

223
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,120
My only theory,

224
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,800
and I don't know if these guys know this yet,

225
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,880
that was how I was introduced to that light plane world

226
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,400
with the jibugabuntubus, and-

227
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,240
You can say it.

228
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,600
It was a jagant umbropithecus.

229
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,120
It was a xenonimatoh that they attached to my foot

230
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,280
to send me there.

231
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,200
And so I assume it's maybe covering up evidence

232
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,640
of those scars on,

233
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,200
he kept mentioning that scar on my foot.

234
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,200
I assume it was maybe covering that up in some way,

235
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,200
but I wasn't sure why they needed to consume it.

236
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,480
I didn't know what was up with that.

237
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,800
They had to do it.

238
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,640
All right.

239
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:43,120
And I mean, did you have a reason at the time

240
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,520
beyond it's real spooky?

241
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,680
Yes, it was simply what Joe said,

242
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,900
that it is a thing that shows

243
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,840
that you have been at the circle of knowledge.

244
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,120
And if you were a Delta Green agent

245
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,640
and you were like cleaning up

246
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,720
after like a mission or something,

247
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,160
and one of the parts of the mission

248
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:02,840
was that certain people had this crazy scar

249
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,600
on the bottom of their left foot,

250
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,960
then yeah, you'd cut it off and-

251
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,800
Feed it to them.

252
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,640
Like you do.

253
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:12,480
Okay, but Chief Maggie Cook had some serious issues

254
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,140
with James the Mill Worker specifically,

255
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,800
because James the Mill Worker

256
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,200
clearly had issues with Chief Maggie Cook

257
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,680
and his own blood,

258
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,160
if you would have tested the blood at his house

259
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,420
that spelled out stop her,

260
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:25,920
that was James the Mill Worker's blood

261
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,640
because he knew that Chief Maggie Cook

262
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,200
was going down this dark path.

263
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,080
Hold on, tested with the Advanced Crime Lab

264
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,820
at the contention police station?

265
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:37,660
Yeah.

266
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,980
Drew Andrews is a-

267
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:40,820
Vampire.

268
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:43,680
He's a vampire and you just give him a little blood.

269
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,520
I forgot about it.

270
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,440
He licks it.

271
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,280
He laps it up.

272
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,560
And then he goes,

273
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,640
and his head vibrates and shakes around

274
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,080
and then he blows blood.

275
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,600
James the Mill Worker's blood.

276
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,880
And then he tells you who's blood it was.

277
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,840
We kept forgetting to take advantage of that.

278
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,240
You guys are idiots.

279
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,560
Compliment and question from a bad feeling,

280
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,440
the various theme songs for the show's various arcs

281
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,500
strike me as something very cool this show does

282
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:13,500
that other TTRPG podcasts don't do.

283
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,620
Will this continue in season two?

284
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:16,460
Yes.

285
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,600
Any bangers picked out yet?

286
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:19,960
No bangers.

287
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,920
No bangers picked out.

288
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,280
Circling some?

289
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,120
We're circling.

290
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,360
We're circling.

291
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:28,400
How did you pick the songs and where did you find them?

292
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:32,060
We chose the song so far from bands

293
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:35,620
that either we know or have seen live.

294
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,500
Yeah, Springfield bands for the most part.

295
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,100
Springfield bands that we're into, yeah.

296
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,780
Connected to the region at the least, yeah.

297
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:42,700
For sure.

298
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:45,760
Justin and I were in a band

299
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,500
and we played with Blue False Indigo

300
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,580
and that's kind of how we met them

301
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,580
and who else was on the show?

302
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,340
We played with Dream Girl and Kudzu before too.

303
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,540
That's right, yeah.

304
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:03,180
And Kudzu, who you might know from a song

305
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,860
that we've used a couple of times on the show

306
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:08,300
called No Backbone, the lead singer of that band

307
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:11,060
is a very good promoter in Springfield

308
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:13,220
who always makes sure that bands coming through

309
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,760
are well taken care of,

310
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,340
that they have a good place to sleep

311
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,540
and that they get paid.

312
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:20,900
So we were happy to promote Kudzu, yeah,

313
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,200
which No Backbone's a fucking banger.

314
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,580
The rest of the songs, I mean,

315
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:26,420
we've got Someone Still Loves You, Boris Yeltsin,

316
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:29,880
who's just a fucking staple of the Springfield scene.

317
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:33,060
We've all seen them countless times, I would imagine.

318
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:33,900
More than any other band.

319
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:36,740
Joe and I's band have played with them a couple of times,

320
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:39,700
not to dunk on y'all's bands.

321
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,780
And then who else do we have?

322
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:46,740
Grady P. Drug, who is just an excellent musician.

323
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:49,500
We saw him a couple of weekends ago actually

324
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,540
and he was phenomenal.

325
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:54,300
A Dragon in Three, which is an offshoot

326
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,820
of Someone Still Loves You, Boris Yeltsin, yeah.

327
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,920
And they are an incredible little outfit

328
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,240
who I am always stoked to throw them on.

329
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,340
And I'm looking forward to new music from them, hopefully.

330
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:08,260
Creek Rocks are some friends of mine

331
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,980
and they've got a residency right now

332
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,220
down in Silver Dollar City.

333
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,540
Oh, no shit.

334
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:13,380
Go check them out.

335
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:14,860
That's super rad.

336
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:15,980
That's probably coming to an end soon

337
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:16,820
as the weather changes.

338
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:19,060
I think they play in an outdoor amphitheater, but yeah.

339
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,080
Creek Rocks, that song rules.

340
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,620
We've been really happy, I think,

341
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,180
with all the songs that we've been able to play.

342
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:25,780
Do they have any pants left?

343
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:26,620
To throw on the show.

344
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:31,380
Wow, that is a deep cut from Luke talking about...

345
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:32,800
There's a ride at Silver Dollar City

346
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,020
called Fire in the Hole.

347
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:36,100
Oh, yes, I should have got it.

348
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,140
God dang it.

349
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:39,500
And as you go through this ride,

350
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,820
Luke, do you want to describe?

351
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,940
Yeah, it's called, did you say what it's called?

352
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,600
It's called Fire in the Hole.

353
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,160
And you ride through and basically

354
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,860
you just see a bunch of stuff.

355
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,660
Like you see, is that the same one

356
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:51,860
with like a prison escape or something?

357
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:52,700
Oh, yeah.

358
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,740
It's a town on fire.

359
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:57,500
And the town is lit on fire by the...

360
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,700
Bald Knobbers. Bald Knobbers.

361
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:01,340
But they don't just light towns on fire, no.

362
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,900
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

363
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:04,740
At a certain...

364
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:08,740
Yeah, I just hope you don't have any pants lying around.

365
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:09,580
Why is that, Luke?

366
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:13,340
Oh, because at one point in the ride you see a home.

367
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,020
A home that is on fire.

368
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,940
That's on fire and one of the guys

369
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,580
is getting out of the home.

370
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,700
He's hanging out the window.

371
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:20,780
And she says...

372
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,580
And he's wearing his long underwear.

373
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,380
His nighttime clothes.

374
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:26,780
And she says, whatever your name is,

375
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:28,420
it's whatever his name is.

376
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,500
Whatever your name is, get back in here

377
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,980
and put on your pants.

378
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:32,820
And he goes...

379
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:33,640
And he says...

380
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,020
I can't put on my pants.

381
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:37,860
I ain't got no pants no more.

382
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:40,620
The dang Bald Knobbers stole them.

383
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,560
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

384
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,660
So that's just some local humor.

385
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:45,980
We're trying to get local work.

386
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:50,980
And blank a patch, shout out to blank a patch

387
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:52,780
from NerdPoker.

388
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:57,500
All right, so what was the fucking question?

389
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,500
How do you pick the songs?

390
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,340
Oh yeah, that was it.

391
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:00,180
We answered it, good.

392
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,060
Moving on.

393
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:04,380
Black Moxa asks, congratulations.

394
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,660
Oh, that's, thanks.

395
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:09,300
Congratulations on excellent work across two continents.

396
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,140
Thank you.

397
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:10,960
Thank you.

398
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,300
It was across three at one point,

399
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,540
which I was super proud of

400
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,460
when we had Scott Dorward playing with us.

401
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:17,540
I bragged about that to people in my life

402
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:20,380
that we were playing a game across three continents.

403
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,460
That was cool.

404
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,280
That was dope.

405
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,120
That was rad.

406
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,320
We're cool as fuck.

407
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:28,480
So were the time loops and resets

408
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,320
always part of your story?

409
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,160
We're the coolest people who do this.

410
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:31,980
No.

411
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:36,980
Or did you have to introduce them

412
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:39,900
after the characters got into impossible situations?

413
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:40,900
Yes.

414
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:41,940
Also, how...

415
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,100
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

416
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,780
Did the characters get into impossible situations

417
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:48,780
or did little Zachy get into an impossible situation?

418
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:50,260
Yes, also yes.

419
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,020
Very much yes.

420
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:55,580
It was my doing that I had opened up the story

421
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,980
to too many avenues.

422
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,120
And I thought to myself,

423
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,960
how will I take them down these avenues?

424
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,060
And then I thought, well...

425
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:05,520
Time travel, the greatest cop out of them all.

426
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,060
And the easiest to handle.

427
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,780
Exactly, famously.

428
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:15,540
I have this future version of one of Joe's characters

429
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:18,780
that I can play with who might be able to do some stuff.

430
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,420
Yeah, fucking nightmare, honestly.

431
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,580
Never gonna do it again.

432
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:25,000
And also, how is the create-a-campaign

433
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,500
this community contributed to going?

434
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,580
Fantastic question.

435
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:29,500
Yeah, it's a great question.

436
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,920
It's going really well.

437
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:34,820
Frankie and, no, no, no, no, no, no, hang on,

438
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:38,400
have compiled everything that everyone has written

439
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,140
and voted on up into one document

440
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:47,140
and it is slowly being whittled down into a playable game.

441
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:52,780
And it'll be out in, oh, what, 2031.

442
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,020
Yeah.

443
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,380
It'll be playable.

444
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,940
Let's not put it that close.

445
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,540
Okay, yeah.

446
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:01,380
We were shooting for the 10th anniversary of the finale.

447
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,140
Yeah, let's push that right now, actually.

448
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,940
2053.

449
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:08,820
Yeah, no, that campaign is dope.

450
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:12,660
And if these guys have forgotten enough

451
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,180
of what they might've read

452
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,820
from what people wrote about that campaign,

453
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,180
I would definitely be interested

454
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,940
in running some form of that.

455
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,240
I purposely didn't read a lot of it

456
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,340
because I thought we played it at some point.

457
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:27,060
Hey, guys, it's really fucking scary and cool.

458
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:30,060
So I would be interested in using,

459
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:33,280
maybe even just using parts of it to create a one-shot.

460
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,120
What's up, Thomas?

461
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,420
This is the first time I've even heard of it.

462
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,740
Oh, right, perfect.

463
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,820
The modest light.

464
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,660
I've read as much as Thomas has.

465
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:41,820
I knew about it.

466
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:46,220
The modest light says,

467
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,820
thanks for doing such great work.

468
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:48,820
Hey, thanks.

469
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,140
Honestly, it's been great

470
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:52,100
just listening to you guys improv together.

471
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,500
I felt like I've learned a lot

472
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,540
about how to keep the jokes rolling in my own life

473
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:02,740
just by analyzing how you all do it.

474
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:03,580
Sit you on a bad path.

475
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,620
Dangerous ground.

476
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,300
Yeah, you're on thin ice, my friend.

477
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:09,620
And let me tell you,

478
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,500
you better walk back right now

479
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,960
for the sake of your relationships.

480
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:14,800
Yeah.

481
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,620
You don't want this.

482
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:16,460
And your career.

483
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:17,300
You don't want this.

484
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,580
And a future podcast editor.

485
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:19,540
We don't do this.

486
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:20,380
Right.

487
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:21,620
Yeah, all six of us have,

488
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,940
or there's five of us, I have no, no.

489
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:28,300
You okay?

490
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:32,300
All five of us have four friends, so maybe two of them.

491
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:37,660
My dude, I literally was answering that question.

492
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:39,740
Like, I was like, well, wait,

493
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:41,540
let's talk about what we mean by friends

494
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:43,380
because I have four friends.

495
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,820
I have tons of people that I like

496
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,180
and that I'll talk to in public.

497
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,980
It's the people on the pod, yeah.

498
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:59,180
How did you guys know it was a good idea to start a podcast?

499
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:01,020
And did you have any fears going in?

500
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:03,380
These are the two questions.

501
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,260
I was the one who brought it up, right?

502
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,100
Probably, for sure.

503
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,180
Yeah, you've been wanting to do it for a while

504
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,100
and I don't know if that just stemmed out of the idea

505
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:13,300
of recording the games themselves to listen back to.

506
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:16,020
But we also, we were all listening

507
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,820
to a bunch of role-playing podcasts.

508
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:18,660
We were.

509
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,180
And when I listened to a lot of music,

510
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,460
I thought I could play music.

511
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,820
And when I listened to a lot of actual play podcasts,

512
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,580
I thought I could do that too, so.

513
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,580
The thing about the actual play podcast

514
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:29,780
is that we were getting together every week

515
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:32,540
and being as funny or funnier than them.

516
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:35,940
We're like, why not record it?

517
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:38,260
At least enough that we thought we could do this.

518
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:41,380
Yeah, it was enough to where when I brought it up,

519
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,940
no one balked at the idea, except for Taylor,

520
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:47,100
who was like, all right, this is my cue to bail.

521
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,180
Yeah.

522
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,020
We felt good.

523
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:49,860
We all felt good playing together

524
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:52,340
and we thought it might translate.

525
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:55,180
We honestly didn't expect this.

526
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:56,340
No, not at all.

527
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,140
Thomas is shaking his head like I did.

528
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,500
I did.

529
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,780
He was shaking his head, no,

530
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,900
don't put a nod in his mouth.

531
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:07,380
Ooh.

532
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:10,660
These nuts.

533
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,180
Did you guys, you guys didn't have any fears?

534
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,860
No, I didn't.

535
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,220
Going in, I definitely did.

536
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:18,180
But like after the first session, I was fine.

537
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,580
Do you guys have any fears now?

538
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,940
Oh yeah, there's so much more to lose.

539
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:22,780
One fear.

540
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:25,300
Yeah, my fear, my biggest fear is success.

541
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:31,020
When we first hit record and when we slipped into it

542
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,020
and we finally found that we were just playing

543
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:35,180
at a table together, my fears were allayed.

544
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,620
I remember that we have fun doing it either way.

545
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:38,460
That's right.

546
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,300
Exactly.

547
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,140
And it helps we didn't release it for so long.

548
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:41,980
Yes.

549
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,220
We kind of touched a bit.

550
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:45,220
So that was on that stream the other night.

551
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,780
The stream the other night, yeah, yeah.

552
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:49,940
But we, yeah, because we did record so many episodes

553
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:52,980
before releasing them, it really did allow us

554
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:57,540
to just put the game we were playing on the air.

555
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:59,940
We were very comfortable with what we were doing

556
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:02,140
at that point because it was just the same thing

557
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:03,180
we'd always done, kind of.

558
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,020
Yeah.

559
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:06,300
I think that's a smart way to do any creative thing

560
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,420
like that is to build up a little bit

561
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:11,260
and then start releasing it so you're not scared

562
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:15,020
immediately from poor results after one thing.

563
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:15,860
It's like edging.

564
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,420
How do you feel about edging, Justin?

565
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,860
It's the only way.

566
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:22,220
Brenner Nunez says, what was the balloon shirt?

567
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:31,460
To quote the great Nicole Byer, I don't want to edge.

568
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:33,940
If you start fucking me, you better make me cum.

569
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:44,260
She went on Punch Up the Jam and she punched up the jam.

570
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:46,700
She was on it.

571
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:50,540
Bruno Nunez asks, what was the balloon shaped head kid

572
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:52,500
from the JLP the Third Flashback?

573
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:56,660
I mentioned a balloon shaped headed kid multiple times.

574
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:57,740
He had very dark eyes.

575
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:58,940
Who was it, Joe?

576
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,900
It was Pastor Adam Kane.

577
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,140
It was Pastor Adam Kane as a child.

578
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:05,700
When we were listening to the episodes in real time

579
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,700
and I got to my flashback, I had already

580
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,860
played at that point a scene with Pastor Adam Kane

581
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:14,820
and he described him exactly the same way.

582
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,900
And I texted Zach, you son of a bitch.

583
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:20,700
I know who the balloon head kid is.

584
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,740
Yeah, that was a fun one.

585
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:25,500
I thought you were just dunking on that poor kid.

586
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,380
This balloon headed mommy stuck kid.

587
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:29,860
So there's this balloon headed idiot next year.

588
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:31,180
Did you have a flashback with him

589
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,740
or was that just a mistake on their part?

590
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:35,580
That is from the flashback of his father,

591
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:39,260
John Lee Pettymore the Third, burning down the Kane home.

592
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:41,220
When you put on the watch.

593
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,780
Yeah, when John put on the watch,

594
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:47,380
he saw his dad rescue him is one way of saying it.

595
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:50,380
Steal him and burn down the house of his family

596
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:52,020
is another way of saying it.

597
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:55,020
The gherkin at Merlin's Merkin says,

598
00:23:56,020 --> 00:24:02,420
he says, will sweet boy Justin be a regular for season two

599
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:05,140
or will he be banished back into the pit

600
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:09,340
from whence he came until another uncle PC is introduced?

601
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:11,180
The pit, the pit.

602
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,900
Zach said I can't come out of the pit.

603
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:15,660
Yeah, he's going to be, he's an uncle.

604
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:18,260
He's an uncle forever.

605
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:21,420
No, but we talked about that and it's just

606
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:24,620
my schedule is going to be so freaking wacky with grad school

607
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:27,900
crap, especially when we're going to start recording it.

608
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,260
He already does side characters.

609
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,220
He already makes all the music.

610
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,060
You guys asked too much from him.

611
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:35,380
And he's trying to escape from that pit.

612
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:37,780
I'm trying, please.

613
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:39,740
And Zach keeps putting, like digging,

614
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:40,940
Zach's down there with me digging it.

615
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:42,820
He keeps sending more grad school assignments down there

616
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:45,460
and he's like, ah, you want to finish, don't you?

617
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:48,700
No, but I think being a regular on top of all the extra stuff

618
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:51,980
would for me right now would be just a little bit too much.

619
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:55,140
Even though I've had a blast.

620
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:57,260
If you do all my assignments, you'll

621
00:24:57,260 --> 00:25:00,180
finally earn your Zachster's degree one of these days.

622
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:02,540
What'd you say?

623
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:07,260
Alexia says, I love this format where I can just immediately

624
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:10,340
move on to something else.

625
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:13,580
Alexia says, thank you for making this amazing show.

626
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:14,620
Thanks.

627
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:17,700
It's been such a light these months.

628
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,140
Thanks.

629
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,340
You're welcome.

630
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:24,500
Question, how do you manage to find so many amazing bands

631
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,540
local to you?

632
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,700
Well, it all dates back to the Ozarks Jubilee.

633
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,900
You see?

634
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,420
That's not, that's kind of a joke.

635
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:32,100
That's also true.

636
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:32,780
It's also true.

637
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:34,380
It has a really cool musical history.

638
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:36,300
And it's just been full of musical talent.

639
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:39,100
We've had a burgeoning musical scene forever.

640
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,380
And exactly, it does go back to the Jubilee.

641
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:43,900
I saw this question earlier on.

642
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,940
And I wanted to plug, there's a documentary out there

643
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:46,420
right now.

644
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:49,060
You can find it on thecenterofnowhere.com.

645
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:51,620
And it's kind of about the history of Springfield music.

646
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:52,700
It used to be on Amazon.

647
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,140
But I think they had some weird thing where

648
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,780
they took a bunch of documentaries down.

649
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:57,300
But you can find it on that website.

650
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,700
They're trying to hide the truth.

651
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:02,100
They want to silence the truth of the Springfield music scene.

652
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,900
Well, I also think, I don't know.

653
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:07,380
Zach, did your parents also take you to a bunch of musical stuff?

654
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:09,340
Because your parents do music stuff.

655
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,580
And mine do.

656
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:12,740
And Joe's do also.

657
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:13,340
Yeah.

658
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,740
My parents tried to make it.

659
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,000
They put out a cassette.

660
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,760
And they moved to Nashville before they had kids.

661
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,640
And put out a Christian cassette tape.

662
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,200
And opened up for some notable acts.

663
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,080
But neither one of them have Grammys.

664
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,120
Switchfoot.

665
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:31,920
Oh, yeah.

666
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,840
Does anybody's dad here have a Grammy?

667
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:34,340
Yeah.

668
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,400
He's like, my dad's a good old.

669
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,740
I was like, you have to explain.

670
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,080
He's a good, good piano player.

671
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,440
He's a really good piano player.

672
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,680
He's on an album that won Grammy.

673
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:51,040
Or it was a folk album of the year, I believe it was.

674
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,480
We should make our dads do a battle of the pianos

675
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,400
against each other.

676
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,760
My dad would kick your dad's ass.

677
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,800
Yeah, I'm sorry, Justin.

678
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,280
But my dad's a really nice guy.

679
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,040
He has a degree in composition.

680
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,760
Music composition.

681
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,640
What has he composed?

682
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,140
Yeah.

683
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:05,720
A cassette tape?

684
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,220
Yeah.

685
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:06,720
Yeah.

686
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,960
He put out a one hit, not so much of a one-two.

687
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,720
Have you heard it?

688
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,840
He's a great dad, though.

689
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,560
So good on him.

690
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,640
Moving on, we found so many amazing local bands

691
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,640
because there's so many amazing local bands around.

692
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,600
We've got an embarrassment of riches around us.

693
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,200
We really do.

694
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,560
And also, throw yourself into the music scene

695
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,760
in whatever town you're in.

696
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,040
Because it's probably got good music.

697
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,200
Yeah, I'm sure you're going to find something that you like.

698
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,960
Also, it's really easy for people

699
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,520
to record music these days.

700
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,520
And so more people are making it.

701
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:40,320
And there's a lot of garbage out there that you can step through.

702
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,540
Want to go somewhere says question.

703
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:45,020
Every time the boys woke up back in the cemetery,

704
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:47,900
was there another group of them running around

705
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,460
in the same city?

706
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:50,180
Yes.

707
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:52,140
Or was that an alternate timeline?

708
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:52,820
Yes.

709
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:53,780
Alternate universe.

710
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,260
Yes kind of thing.

711
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:58,460
So A, yes, there was an alternate version of them

712
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:59,860
in that scenario.

713
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:03,540
But in, for instance, the iteration

714
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:06,260
where you guys went to the Glass Family Compound,

715
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:09,880
that world continues on and keeps doing its own thing.

716
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,880
The next time you come back, you're

717
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:15,120
in a different iteration of that same plane.

718
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,000
But you've done what you did previously before.

719
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:18,880
Does that make sense?

720
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,360
Yeah, I do get that sort of, so our guys are doing it?

721
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,280
Yeah, so in the first one that you were in,

722
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,320
there's only one of you.

723
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,040
In the second one that you woke up in,

724
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,520
there's two of you in that world.

725
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,680
In the third one you woke up in, there's three of you

726
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,480
in that world.

727
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,440
Three collective yous.

728
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:32,960
Yeah.

729
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,440
And then in the last one, there's

730
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:37,000
four of you in that collective universe.

731
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,400
Well, there's not because you died in the CSU arc.

732
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,360
But yeah, that was my idea with all that.

733
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,880
We got another question here.

734
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,560
What up with the names branded into their skin

735
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,620
when they wake up at the cemetery?

736
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:54,800
Was it an overseer hint on where they need to go next?

737
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,440
Yes.

738
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,200
Or was it something more than that?

739
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,520
It was also a little bit more than that, but barely.

740
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:03,900
It was simply that when you interact

741
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:08,220
with the person who is branded on your body as a whole,

742
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:10,820
your group will have that name crossed out.

743
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:12,480
The next time you wake up and you only

744
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,380
have until all your names are crossed out,

745
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:17,480
then you have one last time to go through it.

746
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,700
So first time you had one name crossed out.

747
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:22,020
Second time you had the second name crossed out.

748
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:25,580
Third time you ran into both Tildy B. Mitchell

749
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:29,020
because Keith ran into Tildy B. Mitchell, Andrew Andrews,

750
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:30,980
and therefore crossed out both of those names,

751
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:33,860
giving you only one more chance at life.

752
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:34,860
Thank goodness.

753
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:37,340
Yeah, it worked out really fucking well, actually.

754
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:39,380
So it was just the overseer saying, hey,

755
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:40,500
you need to talk to these guys.

756
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,100
But he was just hoping that you would figure out

757
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:42,940
what you needed from him.

758
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:43,620
Yes.

759
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,140
Yeah, that was his.

760
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:48,660
Again, that's what I intended for sure.

761
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:49,740
Good, good, good, good.

762
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:50,860
That's what I was hoping.

763
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:55,460
Punk-ass book jockey, that's a great name, Compliments.

764
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,940
I love the way, this is long.

765
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:59,180
I love the way you created horror

766
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:02,500
by constantly throwing new mysteries and problems

767
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,620
and gross shit into the plot.

768
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:07,860
Instead of being scary because of slowly built tension,

769
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:11,260
it was scary from being completely overwhelming,

770
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:13,020
like it was a mental breakdown.

771
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:13,860
It was.

772
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:17,340
Yeah, very cool inversion.

773
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:19,940
I love that you wrote a time travel plot

774
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:23,060
and still held characters and plot elements

775
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:26,340
so loosely and let unexpected things happen.

776
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,140
Yeah, that was really fucking hard.

777
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:30,220
I loved how great everyone was

778
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:32,780
at instantly bringing each new character to life.

779
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:34,740
That's just good for you guys.

780
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:35,580
Thank you.

781
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:38,100
I love the way the players play

782
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,980
like they are horror movie characters.

783
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:43,940
Yes, again, thank you that I agree with that.

784
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:45,820
Thank you for doing it.

785
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:46,940
I thought it was great

786
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:49,220
that no matter how tangled everything got,

787
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:53,060
it always felt like there was an explanation for everything.

788
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:55,140
If we could just understand.

789
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:57,660
That's the amazing illusion Zach creates.

790
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:00,620
I mean, your trust means everything to me.

791
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:03,620
I love that when the players were given complete freedom

792
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:06,580
in the final episodes, they kept topping,

793
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:07,500
lol, lol,

794
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:11,540
each unbelievably cool thing they did

795
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:14,220
with another unbelievably cool thing.

796
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:15,060
Thanks.

797
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:15,900
Thank you, yeah.

798
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,140
It felt cool at the end there, man.

799
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:18,660
We all kind of felt like our power is unlocked.

800
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:20,340
We're all just topping.

801
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:21,180
And for you guys,

802
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:23,700
what one thing do you wish you had done different?

803
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:27,220
So they're saying, having done such cool stuff,

804
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:30,060
what was the one thing you wish you had done differently

805
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,620
as your character?

806
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:33,060
I don't know if I would have changed this,

807
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:34,780
but I would have been super curious

808
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:37,060
how the whole thing would have gone if I'd gone with Leon.

809
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:38,740
That really was a fork in the road

810
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:40,340
that could have drastically changed

811
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:41,300
the way this whole thing went.

812
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,580
Yep, I have no idea what would have happened.

813
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:45,660
If I wouldn't have jumped out of the bus,

814
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:47,340
I would want to see what happened then.

815
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:48,180
Ah, yes.

816
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,020
Ooh, nice.

817
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:51,540
Yeah, that bus was on its way to the mill.

818
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:52,380
So you would have-

819
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,060
Oh, you would have been right on it.

820
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:57,820
I don't know what decisions I would make differently

821
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:59,340
with Jon, probably a lot,

822
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:01,460
but Jon does know as a character

823
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:05,020
that he should have shot Keith like a long time ago.

824
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:07,780
Oh my God.

825
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:12,860
Who was your favorite interlude character that you made?

826
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:16,340
So any of the small Mark characters?

827
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:18,140
Yeah, Martin Cupertino.

828
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:18,980
Oh, okay.

829
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,980
So we got one from Calm Comfy Campground there.

830
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,940
Everett Pace for me, I loved him.

831
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:24,180
He was really fun.

832
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:25,340
All three of those were really good.

833
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:26,780
Justin, what about you?

834
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:29,740
Like all of my beautiful children that I've created.

835
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:34,740
Yeah, you got Don, you got Jack Pearlman.

836
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:37,500
Don and Donovan, the two Donnies.

837
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,940
Yeah, the Donnies.

838
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,380
I really like Donovan because I love-

839
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:42,220
Shut the fuck up.

840
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:43,420
Who are you telling to shut the fuck up?

841
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,420
Shut the fuck up, Donnie.

842
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,260
Donnie.

843
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:46,500
Oh, oh yeah.

844
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,220
That old chestnut.

845
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:49,780
It's a movie.

846
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:51,780
No, I really enjoyed being Donovan

847
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:55,500
because he felt so opposite of like all the characters.

848
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,340
He was good.

849
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:57,180
He was really good.

850
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:58,820
And then his turn at the end, wow,

851
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:01,140
you made some really dark decisions there.

852
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:03,060
Yeah, I definitely wasn't forced upon it

853
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:06,020
by some unknown entity.

854
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:08,180
I messaged you and was like,

855
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:09,740
hey, you want to get fucking wild?

856
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:13,580
And you were like, anything to give Donovan more power

857
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:15,540
is literally what you responded with.

858
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:17,180
I would literally,

859
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:19,900
you want me to kill all those members of contention?

860
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,820
They also said for Zach,

861
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:24,700
what do you need from the community

862
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:27,700
to release the campaign notes in some form?

863
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:28,540
Money.

864
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:35,020
Which actions from the players did you most expect

865
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:38,300
and which was the furthest from what you expected?

866
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,300
Good question.

867
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:43,340
I expected some things here and there,

868
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:45,660
but most of the time I just,

869
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:47,860
honestly guys, I set up scenarios

870
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:49,820
with the hope that you will surprise me.

871
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,300
I don't plan the ending of any of this stuff.

872
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:56,580
And so everything, like fucking everything constantly.

873
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:58,340
Yeah, but like, I mean,

874
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:00,060
we touched on this in another question.

875
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:01,460
I think the most surprising thing

876
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:03,100
has to be the myriad Keith.

877
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,540
Yeah, the myriad Keith name.

878
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:06,380
I didn't plan it.

879
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:08,740
No, yeah, that was the great thing.

880
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:11,340
You could see that like by the twinkle in your eye,

881
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:15,180
you had thought of it almost as you said it.

882
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:19,300
That's the way to role play by my book.

883
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:21,940
It just says, do what you want.

884
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:26,540
What's the most squeamest thing

885
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:29,060
you've seen in real life?

886
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:29,900
Snake.

887
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:30,740
A snake probably.

888
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:31,580
A snake, yeah.

889
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:33,940
I saw a really big giant black snake in Arkansas

890
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:34,860
when I was a little kid.

891
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:36,100
It was so cool.

892
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:36,940
Oh, that's rad.

893
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:39,500
It was so big that we heard it dragging itself

894
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:42,060
across the concrete of the carport

895
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:45,260
and we thought it was a plastic bag rustling in the wind.

896
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,100
It's just loud.

897
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:50,140
Do you ever feel like a fat snake?

898
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:51,580
Like a fat snake.

899
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:58,100
The snap, like I saw a snap, like a-

900
00:34:59,140 --> 00:34:59,980
Kimono dragon.

901
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:01,900
I saw a huge turtle one time.

902
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:04,180
I was like, that's cool.

903
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:05,020
And it was wet.

904
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,780
It was a big wet turtle.

905
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:11,740
Edgeworth08 asks, what was the editing process like?

906
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:16,060
How much did you cut and did it become less and easier?

907
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:17,980
As time went on.

908
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:19,300
Editing is-

909
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,220
Difficult.

910
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:24,940
I cut out anything that seems repetitive

911
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:29,940
or unnecessary or dead air or me saying um,

912
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:35,820
like with a long space on either side of it.

913
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,820
That's mostly what I edit out.

914
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:39,620
I don't edit out a lot of content.

915
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:41,660
There's not like role-playing scenes

916
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:43,780
that I have to cut ever.

917
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:47,180
And as you all know from listening,

918
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:50,220
when someone says like, hey, let's cut that out.

919
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:55,220
That's typically like a cue to leave everything in.

920
00:35:55,900 --> 00:36:00,180
So you really hear pretty much everything that we do.

921
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:02,020
Those of you in the Den of Sin just know

922
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:07,020
that I edit out dead air.

923
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:13,100
Not even a lot, just enough to keep it all going.

924
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:15,180
I just want listening to this show

925
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:18,500
to be a nonstop fucking ride.

926
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,860
And that's kind of been my goal

927
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:23,900
is that it just pushes, pushes, pushes constantly.

928
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:24,740
For sure.

929
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:26,480
TD underscore Woogie says,

930
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,860
is Wolf the dog going to still be around in season two?

931
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:31,360
I hope so.

932
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:34,020
And there's a follow up from Sensory13 that says,

933
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:36,660
and or Justin as a full-time character.

934
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:39,340
Second chance to give us the right answer, Justin.

935
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:42,060
What do you think?

936
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:44,220
Yeah, you still busy?

937
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:45,540
Say it.

938
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:46,380
Fish.

939
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:52,940
I don't know, Zach.

940
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:55,820
Is Wolf the dog going to be in season two?

941
00:36:55,820 --> 00:37:00,820
Find out on the first episode of season two, but also.

942
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:01,840
But maybe not.

943
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,680
Yes.

944
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:05,500
Oh, Justin said, maybe not.

945
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:08,800
TBD apparently.

946
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,180
I hope so too, TD underscore Woogie.

947
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:14,620
I hope that Wolf is still around in season two as well.

948
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:17,240
He might be busy, guys.

949
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:21,860
Like underscore Larry says,

950
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:23,540
this is a question for Zach.

951
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:26,760
Were the story arcs inspired by the intro songs at all?

952
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,380
Or were you able to find songs

953
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:32,380
that the lyrics oddly tied up with the story arcs?

954
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:34,940
Either way, it's very impressive.

955
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:39,420
I found songs that matched what I was doing so far

956
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:41,100
is my answer to this question.

957
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:44,860
However, No Backbone was chosen

958
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:49,480
before I decided that the balls would rip out your spine.

959
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,320
Yeah.

960
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,140
Yeah, right.

961
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:55,180
So the plot of the balls definitely came from No Backbone,

962
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:57,220
but then for the rest of the stuff,

963
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:58,660
anything that was coincidental.

964
00:37:58,660 --> 00:37:59,780
Actually, you know what?

965
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:01,180
I definitely listened to the lyrics

966
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:02,980
and just like threw stuff in every once in a while.

967
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:05,220
There's a really fun thing in Pretty Sexual

968
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:09,660
that's like, I swore I knew you before this.

969
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:10,500
Yeah.

970
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:11,860
It was good.

971
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:14,060
When I like heard that lyric,

972
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:15,740
yeah, that probably definitely influenced

973
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:18,240
even though that was gonna be probably part of the plot.

974
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,900
Honestly, I don't know.

975
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:20,740
Moving on.

976
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,900
It was a lot of back and forth there, I think.

977
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:29,900
Brofos, brofos, brofos, brofos, brofos, brofos, brofos.

978
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:32,220
What about Brofose?

979
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:33,460
Brofose.

980
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:35,220
What was up with all the hand sanitizer

981
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:37,280
in the Cabin in the Woods arc?

982
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:41,240
The hand sanitizer specifically was being used

983
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:45,000
by Mary, M-A-R-Y, Ball,

984
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,720
who was Old Madge hanging out in the woods.

985
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,660
Old Madge was M-A-R-Y, the ball,

986
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:56,200
and she had concocted this gel

987
00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:00,560
that could be put on human skin

988
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,380
and then would- And it killed bacteria.

989
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:03,220
Would.

990
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:04,060
Whoa.

991
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:11,060
It was amazing.

992
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:12,620
I hope that answers your question.

993
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:15,560
Denny Cready asks the functions

994
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,400
of all the different key devices.

995
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,740
Well, you know, I wanna know.

996
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:25,180
Basically, if you used the hand sanitizer,

997
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:30,180
it allowed me as the handler to pull you out of reality

998
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:34,860
and get you, quote, lost.

999
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:38,160
So anytime someone used hand sanitizer,

1000
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:42,100
I took the initiative to anytime they were moving

1001
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,680
from one place to another,

1002
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:47,400
they got lost on the way to their destination.

1003
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:50,140
So that is what the hand sanitizer did.

1004
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:53,920
It allowed me to put the PCs into situations

1005
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,460
that they were not expecting.

1006
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:57,260
Cool. Yeah, that was really fun.

1007
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:59,300
Denny Cready says the functions

1008
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:01,620
of all the different goo devices is clear

1009
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:03,220
apart from the helmet.

1010
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:06,400
What exactly does the helmet do?

1011
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,520
You say that the functions

1012
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:10,060
of all the different goo devices is clear.

1013
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:13,380
Oh, they also say it seems it's either illusory

1014
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:17,220
or allows the user to benefit from other dimensions.

1015
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:20,280
The goo devices, let's go over them real quick.

1016
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,740
First ones, the camera.

1017
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:23,180
The camera takes pictures

1018
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:27,860
when it has been a certain amount of time in between uses.

1019
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:30,820
It was all based on time for these devices,

1020
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:33,860
or as we saw Pastor Adam Kane use,

1021
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:37,460
you could slam some goo up toward the,

1022
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:39,700
the goo was able to travel through glass,

1023
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:43,300
and so it could move into any of these devices

1024
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:46,460
and then charge them and make that green light lit.

1025
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:50,140
The camera was taking pictures of the dark place,

1026
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:52,400
the plane that you guys ended up in,

1027
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,260
and that was all just random

1028
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:57,040
and based on plot, how I wanted to do that.

1029
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,800
It wasn't based on location or time

1030
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,920
of what you guys were getting in those pictures.

1031
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:03,920
The gun, okay, this is the weird one.

1032
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:08,280
The gun had a bullet that was in the trunk

1033
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:11,480
that John Peters pulled from the green box.

1034
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:16,480
The bullet was to take the user to the Old West,

1035
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:21,260
specifically made by Keith Beans as Silas Cole

1036
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:23,020
to eventually get back there.

1037
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:28,020
However, that bullet was used by Tildi B. Mitchell, right?

1038
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:30,520
So she slams the bullet in.

1039
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:35,220
The person who used the gun previous was Jermaine Glass,

1040
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:37,780
who used it before the podcast started.

1041
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:40,980
So what happened was John Peters pulls the trunk

1042
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:43,220
out of the green box, goes home.

1043
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:46,740
He owes the Glass family mob a lot of money.

1044
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:49,860
The two brothers show up at John Peters' house

1045
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:50,900
to get the money.

1046
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:54,780
John Peters grabs the gun to try to defend himself,

1047
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:58,920
pulls the trigger, and inside the barrel of this gun,

1048
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:03,920
inside the chamber of this gun is, what is it?

1049
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:05,940
Not the bullet from the Old West.

1050
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:10,220
Therefore, the ooze goes in and fills up the chamber,

1051
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:14,740
sending him to the ooze plane of existence.

1052
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:18,580
The next time it's used, Tildi B. Mitchell grabs the bullet

1053
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:22,000
that was with it, slams it into the cylinder,

1054
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:27,000
and then fires, which sends her to the Old West.

1055
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:32,260
Then the gun is used once more, finally, by Rose M-A-R-Y

1056
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:37,320
after the ball takes over Rosemary's body,

1057
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:41,000
but M-A-R-Y knows how to use this gun.

1058
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:46,000
So she blew snot into her hand,

1059
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:49,640
which would have filled her hand with ooze,

1060
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,760
and then she loads the gun with ooze

1061
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:56,520
so that she can get to that plane, and that is the gun.

1062
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:57,360
Straightforward.

1063
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,660
Very straightforward.

1064
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:02,880
The radio is obvious, it switches, you know.

1065
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:06,540
It's not obvious, I thought the illusory thing,

1066
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:07,920
but he brought up the different dimensions.

1067
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,560
Oh, the radio, the radio is obvious.

1068
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:10,400
Radio is obvious.

1069
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,840
The radio just switches bodies, but yes, the helmet.

1070
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,920
You are correct, though, it is illusory.

1071
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:20,240
So when the person who is wielding the helmet

1072
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:24,120
passes a power contest against someone,

1073
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:28,120
then they can change the reality of the person

1074
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:31,220
who they are contesting with by using the helmet.

1075
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:33,640
But is it an illusion, or is it actual dimensions?

1076
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:34,880
It is an illusion.

1077
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,560
Yeah, it is all illusory.

1078
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:39,680
So when you guys were all seeing different stuff

1079
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:43,000
at Bean's Pond, you were still interacting

1080
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,560
with what you thought was real,

1081
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:47,160
but as some of you saw,

1082
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:50,720
like the repercussions of your decisions

1083
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,080
came about in a different way.

1084
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:56,560
So it wasn't an alternate plane, it was simply illusory.

1085
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,940
Al-G-Rhythm, oh no.

1086
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,820
I haven't even seen the new Space Jam,

1087
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:05,020
and I know that that's the bad guy's name.

1088
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:14,080
It's so cool to know that Don Cheadle listens.

1089
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:18,080
He says, hello, I love your show.

1090
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:20,400
I have a couple questions.

1091
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,920
Originally, was the officer whose name changes

1092
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:26,440
throughout the show supposed to be the gaslight that it was?

1093
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:27,280
No.

1094
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,780
Or did Zach, oh yes, or did Zach Wright forget

1095
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:31,080
to write it down in his notes?

1096
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:32,100
No.

1097
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:35,160
Was it originally going to be memory manipulation,

1098
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:37,040
or was it always time fuckery?

1099
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,160
It was never either of those things, really,

1100
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:41,240
because it was just split dimensions.

1101
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:45,120
The whole thing is based off of the Mandela Effect,

1102
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:47,840
the Mandela Effect, which I'm a huge fan of.

1103
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:49,360
That's a concept that fascinates idiots.

1104
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:50,200
Exactly.

1105
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:54,020
When I heard about it in college or whatever,

1106
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:57,720
I immediately called my mom and was like,

1107
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:00,680
who wrote the books with the bears?

1108
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:01,680
What were they?

1109
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:02,880
The bears.

1110
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:05,640
That's the thing that was wrong, is who wrote the books?

1111
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:06,480
Who wrote the books?

1112
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,640
I always thought it was Emily B. Bear.

1113
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,520
It was Jan.

1114
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:17,160
Anyway, so when I was finally able to have Sinbad

1115
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:23,360
on the podcast, that's actually one of my crowning

1116
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:29,680
and achievements in my mind.

1117
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:33,240
Probably against the terms of service for-

1118
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:36,680
I looked it up a few times and I didn't find anything

1119
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:38,960
that said that it wasn't able to be used.

1120
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:43,000
PTBP, I didn't say anything about it.

1121
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,400
If you want to cut this, it does specifically have,

1122
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:48,260
there's categories of people who are doing promotion

1123
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:50,640
and not promotion, and you have to make sure that you do.

1124
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,820
But it's not promotion, it's art, baby.

1125
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:57,440
Cool.

1126
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:02,180
Luke, that's the name of our Detroiters firm,

1127
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:03,480
or that's our logo, at least.

1128
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:04,840
It's not promotion, it's art, baby.

1129
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:05,680
It's art.

1130
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:08,160
Gonna give us $50.

1131
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:14,000
All right, yeah, so it was just the time splitting off

1132
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:17,040
into different iterations of the same world,

1133
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,440
but infinite versions of that same world.

1134
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,340
What a great final question.

1135
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:23,240
The final question is-

1136
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:25,720
Zach looked up the definition of squamous,

1137
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:28,280
the ooze and the worms and all that.

1138
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:30,140
Are they goopy or are they squamous?

1139
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:32,680
Good question, Zach, what does squamous mean?

1140
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:33,520
Scaly, and I-

1141
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:36,520
Did you know that when you called the ooze squamous?

1142
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:41,520
I've always pictured the ooze as being squamous.

1143
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:44,300
I don't believe it.

1144
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:45,300
Scaly ooze.

1145
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:47,120
Like an old wet turtle.

1146
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:50,880
I don't think you've seen the ooze,

1147
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,580
this word or a turtle.

1148
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,680
Guys, it's Delta Green.

1149
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:58,840
Of course it's squamous.

1150
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:00,900
Of course it's squamous.

1151
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:03,600
It's a scaly, horrible ooze.

1152
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:07,080
It's very goopy and very squamous.

1153
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:09,760
See, it's just that those are nearly,

1154
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:10,920
it's not that they're quite-

1155
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:12,480
No, they're not antithetical,

1156
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:13,320
but they're close. They don't quite

1157
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:15,280
cancel each other out, but they almost do.

1158
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:16,680
Which makes it so creepy.

1159
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:19,520
Exactly, it's the conundrum that makes it so scary.

1160
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,000
The conundrum is that you didn't-

1161
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,400
Non-Newtonian liquid.

1162
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:25,480
Thank you, so a non-Newtonian liquid

1163
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:28,940
as both solid and liquid at the same time,

1164
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:33,520
and in my mind, that is essentially what this ooze was,

1165
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:36,960
that it's this horribly, if you look,

1166
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,400
if this thing-

1167
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,040
Yeah, but which part of that is scaly?

1168
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:41,920
Dude, if it reached out to you,

1169
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:44,080
and you looked at it, and you thought

1170
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:45,880
that you would poke your finger up to it,

1171
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:49,120
it would be hard, but it's still gooping

1172
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:51,320
and oozing toward you at all at the same time.

1173
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:53,200
But in a repeated scale pattern?

1174
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:54,960
A repeated scale pattern.

1175
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:55,800
Scaly?

1176
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:56,800
Yeah, squamous.

1177
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:58,640
Any questions?

1178
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:06,480
No, Zach didn't know what that word meant.

1179
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,440
Who would you cast as the ooze?

1180
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:10,760
Andy Serkis.

1181
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:11,800
Nice.

1182
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:12,980
It's all that mocap.

1183
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:16,520
Maybe the guy who did Jar Jar, since he's the OG.

1184
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:17,360
Nice.

1185
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:19,320
First one, first one in the biz to do that.

1186
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:20,720
Is the ooze a Sith?

1187
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,480
Is the ooze a Sith?

1188
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,640
From the ooze's perspective,

1189
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:26,880
contention PD is evil, so it's like.

1190
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,960
Justin, I have a question for you.

1191
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:35,000
As you've been making music for the show,

1192
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:39,840
have you changed your goal or perspective

1193
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:42,000
of each time you sit down to make a track?

1194
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,300
Oh, absolutely.

1195
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:45,040
Yeah, I actually have been thinking about that

1196
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:47,120
revving up for season two.

1197
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:49,640
I was actually messaging you,

1198
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:50,480
because I was like,

1199
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:52,660
here's the points I think we should hit,

1200
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:55,580
because I can't just make any old random song.

1201
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:57,460
I mean, I can, but then it would be like,

1202
00:48:57,460 --> 00:49:02,460
okay, this is only useful for one really particular moment.

1203
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:04,400
So yeah, when I'm thinking about the music,

1204
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:07,940
I'm thinking about how it interplays with the,

1205
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:09,500
I don't know what the correct term is,

1206
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:13,020
the moment to moment of the sound, yes.

1207
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:15,780
I'm thinking of how the audio exists.

1208
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:18,940
No, I'm thinking of how the music interacts with

1209
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:20,780
the different tones.

1210
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:21,620
What was that?

1211
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:22,460
The feeling, the mood.

1212
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:25,140
Oh yeah, the mood, the feel, the vibe, the aura.

1213
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:26,580
But yeah, so I...

1214
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:28,100
Aria.

1215
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:29,020
God damn it.

1216
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:30,500
The start of it all.

1217
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:32,180
I, what do you get, oh God,

1218
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:34,540
you guys keep mumbling, interrupting, I can't.

1219
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:36,140
So you try to make it good now, right?

1220
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:38,660
So I'm gonna hit you, I'm gonna hit you.

1221
00:49:38,660 --> 00:49:39,900
Aria.

1222
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:41,460
Yeah, I try to make it good.

1223
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:50,980
I wanna compliment you on that you do make tracks

1224
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:53,540
that fit these moods, but the Western one,

1225
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:57,300
the one that has that kind of tinkly guitar or piano riff,

1226
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:02,300
maybe it is, that is so perfectly creepy and old timey.

1227
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:04,180
It's one of my favorites, it's so good.

1228
00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:05,020
Thank you.

1229
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:08,420
I liked the, it was fun to know ahead of time

1230
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:10,100
that there was gonna be the old West arc

1231
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:12,580
and be like, all right, let's do some...

1232
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:14,660
Basically I took what I would have done,

1233
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:17,160
like a weird arpeggiated synth thing or other,

1234
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:20,400
or just nasty synth stuff and converted it over

1235
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:24,600
to like Western instruments and stylings and stuff.

1236
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:25,800
And so that was very fun.

1237
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:28,400
The name that Justin gave the track

1238
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:32,640
that Joe brought up there, The Urgent Wind.

1239
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:34,280
Nice, yeah.

1240
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:36,840
The Urgent Wind was the time rewind.

1241
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:39,240
That one wasn't in the old Western arc, was it?

1242
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:42,280
That one's called A Road,

1243
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:44,480
then it just got uploaded to YouTube

1244
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:46,760
cause someone on the subreddit.

1245
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:49,120
A Road or A Road?

1246
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:51,080
A Road.

1247
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:51,920
A Rod.

1248
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:52,880
A Road.

1249
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:53,700
I love it.

1250
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:54,540
It's a good one.

1251
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:55,920
I thought you were talking about the one that's like...

1252
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:56,760
Waaah.

1253
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:59,560
No, I also love that one.

1254
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:00,800
That's my favorite track.

1255
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,280
The one that has the big strings.

1256
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:04,760
It's just me on a microphone going waaah.

1257
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:10,600
Zach never uses it,

1258
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:13,740
and it's Zach's, it's Joe's fucking favorite song.

1259
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:17,880
Put it in the show, coward.

1260
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:20,160
It's all right, I fall asleep to it at night anyway.

1261
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:23,040
Yeah, it's four hours long, so I get it.

1262
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,380
He's like, hey.

1263
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:27,720
Hey folks, thanks for listening.

1264
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:28,560
You're welcome.

1265
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:31,520
Wait, no, you, the listener, not me.

1266
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:35,000
No, we really appreciate you listening, Justin.

1267
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:35,920
Oh, yeah.

1268
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:36,760
Thanks, Justin.

1269
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:37,600
Thanks, Justin.

1270
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:38,420
You're welcome.

1271
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:39,420
Do you have any questions for us?

1272
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:40,260
Yeah.

1273
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,060
As a matter of fact.

1274
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:46,480
Unfurls a scroll.

1275
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:47,660
What the fuck?

1276
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:49,720
Hey, Zach.

1277
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:50,560
Good question.

1278
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:51,920
What the fuck, bro?

1279
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:54,400
Hey, Justin, I've been meaning to tell you,

1280
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,760
our friendship means a whole bunch to me,

1281
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:59,080
and I'm really proud of you,

1282
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:02,200
that you're taking the shot at grad school

1283
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:04,100
and really focusing on it.

1284
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:06,640
And while doing that,

1285
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:10,440
we've created the artistic collaboration

1286
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:13,320
that I've been most proud of in my entire life.

1287
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:16,600
And we've collaborated on a lot of artistic stuff together

1288
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:19,640
from music to short films to this.

1289
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:22,760
And this is like really fun to make.

1290
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:26,120
And I'm really glad that you're on the team.

1291
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:27,360
Thank you.

1292
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:28,200
Thank you.

1293
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:29,020
Me too.

1294
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:29,860
I agree.

1295
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:31,080
We weren't talking to the rest of you.

1296
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:32,360
This is me and Zach's time.

1297
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:33,180
Oh, sorry.

1298
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:34,020
I'm sorry.

1299
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:34,840
I'm sorry.

1300
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:35,680
I'm sorry.

1301
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:40,680
No, I love creative group collaboration is fucking rips.

1302
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:44,960
Everyone should try it sometime.

1303
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:45,800
Seriously.

1304
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:46,680
When you first started this,

1305
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:48,800
did you think our characters were gonna die

1306
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:51,180
and we would make new ones or were you?

1307
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:52,020
Yeah.

1308
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:52,840
Yeah.

1309
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:53,680
Yep.

1310
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:56,240
And I thought you'd have new ones.

1311
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:58,240
We're gonna do that in season two, by the way.

1312
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:01,080
I'm gonna pull out the rug from some of those

1313
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:04,980
Pulp Cthulhu rules that we're using.

1314
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:08,640
And we're gonna go a little bit harder on Delta Green

1315
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:12,400
to get some nice, satisfying character death.

1316
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:17,240
Is this a regular street like feed episode?

1317
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:18,320
This is.

1318
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:20,560
If you want to hear me play a minion,

1319
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:23,040
subscribe to the Patreon.

1320
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:23,880
Nope.

1321
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:26,000
That is also gonna be on the main feed.

1322
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:26,840
That is?

1323
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:27,660
Yeah.

1324
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:28,500
Do it anyway.

1325
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:31,600
He's talking about his own thing he's gonna put out.

1326
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:32,440
Oh, that's right.

1327
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:33,600
Yeah.

1328
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:38,600
Luke, are you gonna run a RPG where we all play minions

1329
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:40,380
and you play guru?

1330
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:41,220
Yes.

1331
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:45,380
Yes, we will be doing that before season two.

1332
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:47,380
Why did you conjure that into existence?

1333
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:51,460
I don't even.

1334
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:53,260
I quit if you don't edit that out.

1335
00:53:55,180 --> 00:53:56,660
I'm writing it right now as soon as I.

1336
00:53:56,660 --> 00:53:59,100
Do minions say anything except banana?

1337
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:01,580
Would we all just be yelling banana at Luke?

1338
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:02,700
What else do they say?

1339
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:06,580
Pudding and other kind of like desserts and fruits.

1340
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:07,420
Pudding.

1341
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:10,220
Oh my God.

1342
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:12,420
Yeah.

1343
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:18,100
Yeah, so thanks for listening.

1344
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:21,260
We're gonna be back next week, actually.

1345
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:22,900
We're gonna be back next week.

1346
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:27,180
If you follow along on Instagram or Twitter or Facebook,

1347
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:29,940
Reddit or Discord or any of the places

1348
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:32,780
where you can find out information from us

1349
00:54:32,780 --> 00:54:36,160
outside of just listening to our voices speak,

1350
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:39,120
then you know that on November 5th,

1351
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:44,120
the first episode will be out of a short five episode run

1352
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:48,280
that we're doing with a guest handler

1353
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:51,200
running us through the Delta Green scenario,

1354
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:54,560
Convergence that is being updated by Delta Green

1355
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:56,360
and Arc Dream publishing right now

1356
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:59,760
and our handler was able to get his hands on

1357
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:03,280
straight from the source of Shane Ivy,

1358
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:06,740
a copy of the updated version of Convergence

1359
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:08,620
for the new Delta Green role playing game

1360
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:10,420
to run for us.

1361
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:13,140
And then after that, on the main feed,

1362
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:15,940
I will be running Control Copy,

1363
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:17,760
another Delta Green scenario,

1364
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:20,260
this one written by Dennis Detwiller,

1365
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:24,260
which the patrons voted on over on patreon.com

1366
00:55:24,260 --> 00:55:25,820
slash pretending pod.

1367
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:29,940
They chose Control Copy for me to run for this crew

1368
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:32,780
and that'll be out after Convergence.

1369
00:55:32,780 --> 00:55:36,260
And so that's what we've got ready now

1370
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:38,340
and more on the horizon.

1371
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:42,620
And we're all really, really looking forward to it.

1372
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:44,920
I can't wait to play.

1373
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:47,580
Yeah, we got so much good gaming ahead of us.

1374
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:49,140
Oh yeah.

1375
00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:52,300
There's a lot of gaming left in these old bones, Joe.

1376
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:57,300
So let us tickle your ear holes

1377
00:55:58,340 --> 00:56:03,340
with our Deez Nuts and Deez Nuts signing off.

1378
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:08,340
This has been Luke from NPR.

1379
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:38,440
Pweloo, how can you have enough

1380
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:43,960
Drowning out all the notes

1381
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:50,960
Pweloo, how can you have enough

1382
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:55,960
Pweloo, how can you have enough
