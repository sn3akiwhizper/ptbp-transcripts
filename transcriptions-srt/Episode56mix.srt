1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,040
Welcome, my flock. It's your pastor, Wolf the Dog, and I'm here to give you a sermon

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:11,960
about the merits of garbage collection. We are the only trash-based ministry that will

3
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:21,680
broadcast you all live from 694.2 PTBP. I pray for y'all every day, hoping that a bounty

4
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:29,560
of trash will fill your bellies, as it always does mine. For some reason, my producer keeps

5
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:36,440
yapping on about how it's December the 6th or something, and it's about, like, 4 PM or

6
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:42,240
something thereabouts. I don't know. I just wish he'd stop yammering.

7
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:48,980
Time means nothing in the house of the Lord. Wolf bless you, my children, and Wolf bless

8
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:54,560
this mess. It's a new Howlin' with Wolf. This week's Howlin' with Wolf comes from

9
00:00:54,560 --> 00:01:01,360
AtMeganIsANerd, who tweeted about the show way back in September. She writes,

10
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:08,060
Dear Mr. Wolf, While my fellow agents and I were investigating some issues in contention,

11
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:13,600
we became trapped in some kind of temporal anomaly. My colleagues have been scattered

12
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:20,280
to the four winds of time, and your broadcast seems to be the only constant. To Chad, Drew,

13
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,960
and Sabrina, if you can hear this, I hope you catch up to my timeline soon so we can

14
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:31,960
properly theorize about what the hell is going on here. Looking forward to catching your

15
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:36,560
house with a full pack soon, Mr. Wolf. From Megan.

16
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:44,840
Well, Megan, my voice has been known to permeate through time and space. I beckon, but only

17
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:52,440
a scant few hear the call. I know Chad, Drew, and Sabrina will hear your message, because

18
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:57,640
any chosen will hear a message when I so command it of the cosmos.

19
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:04,000
Haha, but anyway, I do truly hope your friends find you instead of being caught in some sort

20
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,240
of horrible alternate timeline from which there is no return. Remember, if you want

21
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:14,360
to write up something for your wolf to hout, tag at PretendingPod on Instagram or Twitter.

22
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:19,600
I've pretended to be people on Facebook. Fuck you, Zuckmarkerberg. Or write a five-star

23
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:26,620
review on iTunes and email us at PretendingPod at Gmail.com. Of course, you can also support

24
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:33,240
the show financially over on Patreon.com slash PretendingPod. Five bucks a month instantly

25
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:40,680
unlocks access to seven exclusive bonus episodes. The most recent one is a Q&A episode.

26
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:46,200
Zach discusses his campaign notes. Justin reveals his relationship with me, Wolf the

27
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:51,780
Dog, but I don't know who that motherfucker is, y'all. Luke and Thomas come up with names

28
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:58,280
for Contention's Army Surplus store, and Joe tells the story of a legitimate alien sighting.

29
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:04,940
So legitimate, in fact, it could be up next in the news. The perhaps second iterations

30
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:10,600
of the formal Contention police officers got an address and phone number for the target.

31
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:18,440
The co-founder and current majority shareholder of BarCorp, Bruce Robin. Maggie Cook tossed

32
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:25,120
them a folder full of information about BarCorp, including a connection to Jesus Christ Ministries,

33
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,080
the $2 billion projected gross profits for next year, and the listings for the other

34
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:36,480
three entities with the highest stake in BarCorp. Stacey Beans, Francis Beans, and The Mill

35
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:42,360
on the other side of the city, and then she burned John Lee Pettymore and dipped. Our

36
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:48,880
terrible protagonist went to the downtown brownstone of Bruce Robin, a once respectable

37
00:03:48,880 --> 00:04:03,820
home and current shithole. The number 811-818-9520-1311-811 fuck. I feel like a piece of chicken that

38
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:11,600
wasn't properly tenderized, brined, and marinated, and no one wants to eat me, not even the dog.

39
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:18,160
Wolf spit me out. I'm swept up, thrown in the trash. I am nothing. At the landfill,

40
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:23,520
I land on a plastic bag named Phil. She's sweet, but I can't provide nutrients to a

41
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:32,440
fucking piece of plastic. Can I, Phyllis Theodora Festerbone III? Fucking no, I cannot. But

42
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:37,840
what I can do is drop the beat that makes you bleat. It's kudzu with no backbone.

43
00:04:48,160 --> 00:05:13,160
Oh man. Another week. Another doll hair? You're not gonna trick me with that again. Oh my

44
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:19,880
gosh, guys. Wait, if this is episode 56, I think it's our year anniversary. Really? Or maybe last

45
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:26,320
week was. So the date that we released the first three... December 2nd, I believe. So I looked it

46
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:33,440
up. My podcast app says November 18th. Yes, so the first episode got released because I submitted it

47
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,560
to iTunes for approval, and then they just uploaded it as soon as they got approved. So then we did

48
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,720
our official launch later. Okay, I'm glad that you said that because it was incongruous in my brain

49
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:49,680
that I was sure that we had our launch in December. Yeah. Okay, that makes sense now. Yeah, yeah. I was

50
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,080
actually thinking about this. Do you want to put out a special one-year episode where we just party

51
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:59,960
on Mike? Mike party. Mike party. Who's Mike party? You are now. I know that guy. What was Mike party

52
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:07,520
sound like, Joe? He's Mike party! Mike party here. Hope you're all having a good time. I brought

53
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:15,680
cocaine. So you guys are making your way to Bar Corp, and you're driving through the city,

54
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:21,800
which again, just this like sickly thickness hanging in the air, and you see these flowers

55
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:26,440
everywhere. I want to touch it. Oh, you touch the sickness? Actually, you put your hand outside the

56
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:30,880
window and you feel like physical resistance when you put it out, but it's probably just the wind.

57
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:39,360
Physics roll, please. None of you have a science, I would assume. You don't strike me as characters

58
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:45,920
who would be good at science. I have a 0% in it. Same. I bet John Lee Pettymore would have been

59
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:51,400
good at science, but he definitely can't roll for it. Well, he was like, there was one teacher who

60
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:56,320
tried to reach out to him in like ninth grade. Biology, man. Yeah. He said, I just want to

61
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:00,960
reach cars. Mr. Yeah. Mr. Hawkins just couldn't get through. John, at this point in your life,

62
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:06,200
you're going to go in one of two different directions. You can't just keep turning left

63
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:10,960
all the time. I was thinking more of like a robot voice since you said Hawkins. John,

64
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:18,360
like there's two paths that you can take at this point. I'm such an idiot. And nevermind.

65
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:27,680
I don't get it. You can't just turn left your whole life. You are an idiot. Jesus. Yeah. Luke

66
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:33,320
Hawkins is the town from Stranger Things. I was trying to go there. I was like, I can't think of

67
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:41,760
a Stranger Things. I love you. You're the person who thinks his name is Stephen Hawkins. I realized

68
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:47,600
as soon as I've said it twice that I've got no response from the room. I was like, fuck,

69
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:56,960
I am stupid. Hawkins. Hawkins. Hawkins. Don't you guys get my joke? Hawkins. Oh my God. Hear every

70
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:05,600
dumb ass I went to high school with. I'm method acting Keith. Maybe too much. Yeah, you've been

71
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:18,480
doing that your whole life. Can Keith Vigna do a pull up? Sure. Yeah. No. Keith Vigna. My

72
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:25,840
strength's 55. Oh shit. That's not great. That's below average. That's above average. Yeah. It's

73
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:35,200
five above average. I stand by it. So you guys are going to Bar Corp and the city is gross and

74
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,560
there's flowers and Luke's an idiot. Yep. And there's a thickness in the air. And I love him.

75
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:46,560
I love you. I love you too. So is this going to be the tallest building in the city? No, but it is

76
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:53,520
17 stories high from what you can tell. As you pull up, you see the whole front is just covered

77
00:08:53,520 --> 00:09:00,000
in glass all the way from the bottom to the top. It's beautiful. And you can see as you're walking

78
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:08,080
in, there are marble columns and the entry, the foyer that you see after you pass through the fun

79
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:14,960
circular turnstile at the bottom leading into a large lobby. It's so fun. I'll go through it

80
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:22,720
twice. Clark Bishop wearing an old seventies or eighties contention PD uniform goes through the

81
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:29,760
turnstile twice. Keith Wigner looks down at himself. I just realized, yeah, I do not look

82
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:35,360
like a cop, right? Yeah. We did want to roll into here looking like cops. Can we go to a thrift

83
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:41,200
store? I guess and get some blue windbreakers. Okay. We spray paint the FBI on the backs.

84
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:49,360
Let's cut to that montage right now. Oh, that's fun. Oh, they're having fun.

85
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:56,960
I put on a sparkly boa and I'm like, everyone's got their arms crossed and they shake their head.

86
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:04,080
No, you come back with a tiara and they're all like two thumbs up. So what are you guys wearing?

87
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:08,880
A blue windbreaker. You know how, when you go to a thrift store, sometimes you'll just find like

88
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:14,000
seven of the same like shitty company. It can be a windbreaker. It can be a t-shirt or whatever.

89
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,520
They all have that like gray cottony cloth on the inside. Yeah. Okay. So we found three blue

90
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:24,960
ones of those that are just blank. Um, could have been for a sports team. Yeah. You, you find,

91
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:30,400
yeah, you find them there. They're all, they all fit you well, pretty nondescript. So you can make

92
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:35,360
them look however you would like to make them look. Then I also, I grabbed any cowboy hat I

93
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:40,640
find there and throw it on. Nice. I grabbed one of those obviously fake police hat.

94
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:49,040
It's from a Halloween costume. I put that on. It's got the plastic with no words on it.

95
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,640
Yeah. That'll help. Yeah. I have that on and then I'd keep all my other clothes on. Yeah.

96
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:01,040
I'm keeping my uniform on it and just putting the windbreaker over it. Okay. So Keith Vigna,

97
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:07,360
describe what you're wearing. I think big like cargo shorts. I think they're teal, teal,

98
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:13,360
big cargo shorts, a like bright orange polo. I believe that's correct. Sparey's boat shoes

99
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:19,680
with a Halloween cop hat and a blue windbreaker. Maybe we should address your bottom layers too,

100
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:26,080
Keith. It's December and it's gotten pretty cold. So you've got goose pimples all over your shins,

101
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:33,440
baby. Uh, looking around, I find goose pimples, like a Carhartt one piece long sleeve that is

102
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,440
connected to the pants too. You know what I'm talking about? I put that on. Overalls?

103
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:45,040
Well, coveralls. Yeah. Oh, gotcha. Gotcha. They cover your overalls. The full thing. I put those

104
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,920
on and some boots. Okay. With a blue windbreaker and are you keeping the hat? I'm keeping the hat

105
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,240
and then I just ditch the clothes that I came in. So you're just, you're just free and easy

106
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:59,600
underneath. Free and easy under my coveralls. You put the clothes that you were wearing onto the

107
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:06,640
rack. That's how you think this works. This is a take a penny, leave a penny store, right?

108
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:13,040
Exactly. Everything you bought was yellow tag and it just happens to be 50% off yellow tag day.

109
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:19,920
Fucking love. Now to the 17th floor. Now immediately standing exactly where you were

110
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:27,280
before, but wearing what you're wearing now, Clark, Keith, Pettymore, you guys show up to

111
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:32,400
the headquarters of Bar Corp. Is there anyone in the lobby? There is no one in the lobby except for

112
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:40,960
a security guard and a secretary sitting at a large marble desk on the far end from you.

113
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:49,760
And behind them, there's an extremely large mural painted on the wall. And it is the painting of

114
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:57,040
George Washington crossing the Delaware, except for replacing all the guns are flowers.

115
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,840
Was there signage on this building as we walked in? Do they advertise that they are headquartered

116
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:07,680
here? No. Is there a directory like by an elevator or something? 17th floor. I mean,

117
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:12,800
just to see if this is only Bar Corp or if there's other stuff in this building. There is a directory

118
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:18,560
and you would see that the floors are separated into different departments within Bar Corp,

119
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:25,200
but they are all under the umbrella. Is there a Jesus Christ Ministries part here? There is.

120
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:30,480
What else was under in that envelope that we'd found? It was Jesus Christ Ministries

121
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:36,560
Health and Rehabilitation Unlimited and the Learning Center. Can I, I don't know if it's

122
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:41,360
a role or just a knowledge that Clark would have, but reading the directory, are there any

123
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:47,040
businesses or institutions that spring out as that's a contention thing that we know for sure

124
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,880
contention has one of this company? Well, this is where the clinker's corporate headquarters are.

125
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:59,200
No, you would not recognize any of these names from your small town of contention. And what is

126
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:03,760
the 17th floor? What is it described as? It's actually not on the directory. Does it stop at

127
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:08,720
16 or does it stop even before that? It stops at 12. Is the elevator somewhere we can just go

128
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,920
up to it? Yeah. I want to, I want to flash my badge at the security guard. We've got an

129
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:20,400
appointment with Winifred Worth. We're on our way up. Role persuade or law or bureaucracy?

130
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:32,080
Uh, 47 on a 60 for persuade. The silent security guard motions that that is okay and the secretary

131
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:37,440
sitting nearby is too busy looking at the computer screen to even pay attention. Does she have a

132
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:44,320
name tag? A place? The doctor is actually a man. The what? Oh, the doctor is actually a man.

133
00:14:44,320 --> 00:15:02,960
Does this, uh, that doesn't make any sense. The secretary was his dad. Oh, that was really dumb.

134
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:08,640
Do they have a placard? She has a placard. Yeah. What's her, what's her name? Uh, it's not

135
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:13,520
Winifred. It's kind of what I was saying. Oh no. It's a ginger Evans. Cool. That's a pretty hot

136
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:19,600
name. Uh, is there a button for the 17th floor in the elevator? When you go into the elevator,

137
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:26,960
you see that there are buttons for one through 12. Uh, you guys just want to go to 12 and I assume

138
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:31,200
take some stairs up then or we could ask that security. Yeah. I guess I just want to be like,

139
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,880
Hey buddy, we're supposed to be on the 17th floor. This only goes up to 12.

140
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:40,320
He points to the, it's a different elevator. Grazie. And I've been learning Italian.

141
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,280
Did that come with the Kevin body? Did it?

142
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,080
You know, no, I mean, John Lee Pettymore has mysteries that

143
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:57,200
is a rich inner life. As you go into the elevator that he points you to, as the door closes,

144
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:02,000
you hear, uh, as he gets on a little, uh, walkie talkie. Do we hear what he says?

145
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:08,800
He initiated it. Yeah. Gotcha. And, uh, this elevator has 14 through 17 listed.

146
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:16,720
17, 17. They already clicked the button Clark. I mean, you still have time as it goes up.

147
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,640
Is there any advantage to maybe not going straight to the top,

148
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:29,120
maybe walking at the 16th and then we could definitely, uh, we could go through all 16

149
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,200
other floors first. Really make sure we've done a search role for everything. You guys are going

150
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:39,120
to have to kill so many people. You've got that prepared, right? You've got, you've got all,

151
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:44,800
all 16 floors just started out. Oh yeah. I make stats for everybody.

152
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,680
You better have some fucking stats for Winifred worth.

153
00:16:52,640 --> 00:17:00,320
She's about to get in some combat. Do you want to try to go up the stairs to the last one or

154
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,480
just come right out? I just thought it out there. It's a part of the, maybe an element of surprise

155
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,880
is they don't see the elevator doors open with us in it. Yeah. I mean, but our, since we're dressed

156
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:14,640
up, since we are cops and also dressed up as far as, yeah, we're above board for now. Oh guys,

157
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:22,080
we just reached the 17th floor and the door opens and standing directly in front of the elevator

158
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:34,080
doors mows you down is a woman. She is small in stature. She has shock white hair. She is wearing

159
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:44,000
a very dope outfit. Her blouse is white satin and the left half is black striped vertically.

160
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:51,680
Her pants are the same material, high-waisted and one of her pant legs on the opposite side.

161
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:56,000
The right side is stripped. It's striped backwards. So yeah, they're catty corner.

162
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:06,160
And then she is wearing white platform shoes that have studs all around the sole and on her hands,

163
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:13,520
which she has folded neatly together. She has silver rings and it seems to actually just be one

164
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:19,280
big ring that wraps in and out of her fingers. Would you say that she would brass knuckles

165
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:24,240
almost like brass knuckles? Would she be trying to procure 101 Dalmatians?

166
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:33,360
I expected you. Can I get a sense of age? She is either

167
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:40,560
58 or a really, really good 72 type or somewhere in between.

168
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:47,440
Gotcha. There's no fucking way she's 73, Joe. She couldn't be the way she looks.

169
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:52,480
How old are you Winifred? That's exactly not the

170
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:58,160
question that I expected to come out of your mouth first, but I am 71.

171
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,840
Damn, you was right. That's about what I figured.

172
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:07,520
How long have you been working for Mr. Beans? I'm sorry. What is your business here?

173
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:12,720
Well, ma'am, I think it's pretty obvious from our very official windbreakers that we're the police.

174
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:19,280
Yes, from contention. Yeah, our buddy here has a, you know, he wants to commiserate.

175
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:23,520
Beans, sorry for you, I suppose. That's what you'd like to be known as these days.

176
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:29,200
I don't know what you're talking about. Rolled disguise.

177
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:41,040
Damn, 32 on a 30. I can see right through whatever she looks at you.

178
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,600
This is... And Clark Bishop.

179
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,320
Ma'am. And then she looks back at Keith.

180
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,560
So, do you have the list of questions for me? You don't know who I am?

181
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:55,120
I assume you're someone. Is that correct? More or less.

182
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:59,120
You don't know him, but you know me. How do you know my name?

183
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,520
The internet? Vast. So much knowledge. Just at your fingertips.

184
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,520
What'd you do? Google Keith's friends? Yep.

185
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:11,680
I want to Google that in my smartphone real quick and see what's coming up.

186
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:18,160
It's a picture of Clark Bishop and it says, John Lee Pettymore is no longer my best friend.

187
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,040
Friendship with John Lee Pettymore ended. Vigga is my new friend.

188
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,600
Yes, I don't know all the memes, but I got your name from that.

189
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,560
You like that Baby Yoda meme? I'm unaware.

190
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,240
He's a little cute rascal.

191
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:41,120
Well, we're just going to go ahead and go on in there and talk to Bruce.

192
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:45,200
Well, first off, if you'd like to hand me the questions that you have prepared.

193
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:45,840
Top secret.

194
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,280
Police business, ma'am. This isn't a friendly call. It's a work call.

195
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,480
While they're talking, I want to look around this floor we're on and see,

196
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,760
are we the only ones here with her? Yes.

197
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,920
Yeah. It's not like a busy office.

198
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:10,320
This has a long hallway and the floor is marble and the walls are lined with similar murals

199
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,800
as the one that you saw upon your entry. They are Renaissance America.

200
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:19,120
Wait, what is that time period called in America? The early.

201
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,920
The Renaissance? I like just said a word.

202
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,720
Revolutionary. There wasn't an America.

203
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:29,520
He's asking what you call that type of art that Crossing the Delaware is, which I don't know.

204
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,000
Boring.

205
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,680
That word. Colonial? Is it colonial art?

206
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,560
Thomas doesn't know, but he knows it's not that.

207
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,520
There's a lot of different American painting schools.

208
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,120
Sure. It's one of them.

209
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,920
Are they all flowered?

210
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,240
Yes.

211
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,960
So we can't come up with the name of that time period, but they're all that time period?

212
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,520
Yes.

213
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:04,800
I want to gesture to her almost conspiratorially and nod to take her off to the side.

214
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:11,760
Listen, ma'am, he's just absolutely torn up to hell about his brother and he thinks that

215
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:16,080
Mr. Robin's the only person in the world who might understand.

216
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:21,040
Can you see it in your heart to let him ask these questions personally?

217
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,720
And I'd like to try to persuade her.

218
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:27,360
Yeah. I'm going to have you roll against her instead of at a disadvantage.

219
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,240
Fuck.

220
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,160
She passed with a 26.

221
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,360
I passed, but with an eight.

222
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,680
Which would have been great if this wasn't contested.

223
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:39,040
She whispers up into your ear.

224
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,440
That's very well and good, sir.

225
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:50,560
However, you don't have any jurisdiction here and I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

226
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:54,400
So now I want to push her to the ground and run right past her.

227
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,520
Oh shit.

228
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:55,920
Okay.

229
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,840
Roll unarmed combat for me.

230
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,720
Fuck. Is this contested?

231
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,400
Yep. She passed with a 17.

232
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,320
Oh, that's what he got.

233
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,600
I rolled a 17.

234
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,280
Ty goes to the pusher.

235
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:13,280
Yay!

236
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:16,080
I was so fucking bummed when I rolled that.

237
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,280
I was like, damn it.

238
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,600
Did you fucking really roll 17?

239
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:21,920
Yeah.

240
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,040
Hell yeah, dude.

241
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:23,760
Why would you lie?

242
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,080
Oh yeah. None of us do that.

243
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,400
I don't hide my rolls from you guys.

244
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,080
I just sit far enough away.

245
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:39,920
So describe what you push with.

246
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:46,720
I, I give her a look like, I am so sorry, ma'am.

247
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,560
And then I just like fucking suplex her to the ground.

248
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:52,560
Run.

249
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:56,560
And I, I see this happen and I run towards where I think the office is.

250
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,760
It's just the door at the end of the hallway.

251
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,720
Big double doors.

252
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:08,000
As they take off running, I look down at her and I kind of do a half-hearted shrug and follow.

253
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,760
Thomas, if you could roll a D6 for damage.

254
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,920
It's the only time I'm going to lie about a roll and say, I got a one, I got a four.

255
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:26,640
As he hears like something crack, he's like, I'm so sorry.

256
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,880
We're really hoping she looked bad for 50.

257
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:34,240
You put her down right on her hip and just hear like a snap crunch.

258
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,360
Basically, this got really sad.

259
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,080
The good news is she ain't getting up.

260
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:51,520
Well, maybe you should have let a grieving man talk to the only person in the world who

261
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,480
would understand.

262
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,000
I am truly sorry though.

263
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,360
And I run off after him.

264
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,360
I don't think you're truly sorry.

265
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:02,400
I think you're white claw sorry because you're adhering to no laws.

266
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,360
I'm spend drift tired of your shit.

267
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,240
I'm sorry.

268
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,200
Sorry about that, ma'am.

269
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,840
And we'll get an ambulance on its way, but we got to do it.

270
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,080
And I just keep walking by.

271
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:14,480
Okay.

272
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,240
She pulls out her phone and dials 911.

273
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,080
I kicked that out of her hands and I'm like, I'm so sorry, ma'am.

274
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,560
I'm going to do the dialing because I don't think you're just going to call the hospital.

275
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,240
I think you're going to call the police on us.

276
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:28,640
Okay.

277
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,600
And I show her that like, I'm calling 911 too.

278
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,400
And I'm like, you know what?

279
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:37,280
You can tell them anything you want once they get here, but we need a few minutes with Mr.

280
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:37,680
Robin.

281
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,440
911, what's your emergency?

282
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,960
Oh my God.

283
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:45,120
My mother just fell on the 17th floor of the bar court building.

284
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,160
Bar court building.

285
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,280
She broke her damn hip.

286
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:50,880
You need to get here fast or, you know, take your time.

287
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,080
She's a tough old bean.

288
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:56,320
Sir, if you could stay on the line for me, what's the address of the bar court building?

289
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,200
Oh, it's a 501 East fake street.

290
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,800
And what is your name, sir?

291
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,280
Keith Vigna.

292
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,200
And what is your mother's name, sir?

293
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,440
Winifred Worth.

294
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,760
Sir, we have people on their way right now.

295
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:15,920
If you could stay on the line with me, I'd like to ask you a couple more questions.

296
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,360
You just say beep into the phone.

297
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,800
I say beep and hang up.

298
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,160
Sir, you're still...

299
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,400
Sir, I heard you say beep.

300
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:24,720
Okay.

301
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:31,680
So you make your way to the end of the hall and I need whoever has the highest alertness

302
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,960
to roll alertness.

303
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,000
I've got 60.

304
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,960
Got a 70.

305
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,960
Clark Bishop rolling alertness.

306
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,240
Gonna get some dice with numbers on them.

307
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:48,640
You turn around to see Winifred pull out another cell phone from her other pocket.

308
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,480
Winnie.

309
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,520
Winnie now.

310
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,080
Darling.

311
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,840
Also, I told you, you need to stand up, Winnie.

312
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:05,280
Well, we'll talk to her for one sentence and then we'll just push her on the ground.

313
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:06,960
Well, you made us do it.

314
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,600
I didn't feel like that.

315
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,320
You wanted it.

316
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,080
You set this whole situation up.

317
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:14,080


318
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,120
I'm so sorry.

319
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:20,160
I don't know why you would push a nice old lady who's just trying to do her job.

320
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:23,680
Ma'am, frankly, I'm real sorry about your hip.

321
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,080
I am.

322
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:28,880
But there's some extra worldly shit going on and your boss might be involved in it.

323
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,960
And we're just trying to literally save the fucking earth starting with our town in this

324
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,360
city.

325
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:37,680
So I mean, I'm sure you've got great medical through Bar Corps.

326
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,600
You're the fucking CEOs.

327
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:43,280
There are three men here and they have pushed me to the ground.

328
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,160
I kick it out of her.

329
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,360
No, no, no, Winnie.

330
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:48,480
Damn it.

331
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,200
Can we be friends here?

332
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,560
After all this?

333
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,680
Let's start again.

334
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,000
Yeah, fuck Winnifred.

335
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,040
I'm at the double doors and I'm like, guys, get the fuck over here.

336
00:27:59,040 --> 00:27:59,680
Come on.

337
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,360
The doors are locked.

338
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,200
I have lock picking.

339
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,960
Oh, that might be useful.

340
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,160
I'd also like to search.

341
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,240
I got a 45 on a 50.

342
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,680
Winnifred for the keys.

343
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,720
Does she have a desk?

344
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,320
No, there's no desk in this hallway.

345
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:12,640
Okay.

346
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,280
I'm looking at her, like her eyeballs and her fingerprints.

347
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,560
And I'm like, what if she is the key?

348
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:24,960
It's actually normally pubic hair that gets you into different locations, just right under

349
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,520
the armpit.

350
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,400
I picked the lock.

351
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,040
Pick the lock.

352
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:33,360
And Thomas John, Kevin Lee Pettymore hears the door open as you're going toward Winnifred

353
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,600
to try to find the keys on her.

354
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,520
I'd still like to do a search rule on her.

355
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,240
I want to frisk her for any other cell phones.

356
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,680
Okay, go ahead and roll search.

357
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:43,620
Fail.

358
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,320
Okay.

359
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,920
You don't find her third cell phone.

360
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,800
Wily old bat.

361
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:54,720
You open one of these double doors into a large office in a state of slight chaos.

362
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:59,920
To your right, there's a wall entirely comprised of a single large bookcase that seems to have

363
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:04,880
been recently fingered through books at a time, some of which have been left scattered

364
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,280
about the reading area haphazardly.

365
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:14,320
To your left, a conference table with eight chairs is completely overrun with file folders,

366
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,400
large binders, and loose papers.

367
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:24,080
Ahead of you is a large desk in a similar condition and five deep button high back to

368
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:32,400
leather chairs that sit in a half circle facing the desk and the panicked, pacing man behind

369
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:37,680
it, jerkily moving back and forth in front of the large window that makes up the back

370
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:44,400
wall of this office, giving you all a bird's eye view of the city somehow both lackluster

371
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,520
and rancid.

372
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,200
Bruce Robin is muttering to himself.

373
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:53,120
He's wearing a black nothing.

374
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,080
A black nothing.

375
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,600
He's wearing black pants.

376
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,320
How do they fit?

377
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,120
Just right.

378
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,080
Well tailored.

379
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:02,960
These pants.

380
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:12,480
And a white shirt, no tie, top button unbuttoned, and a crushed red velvet like burgundy smoking

381
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,040
jacket.

382
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:20,320
And his hair is all askew just like mop style all over his head and it doesn't suit his

383
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,320
face or the way that he is dressed.

384
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,400
I need you all to roll alertness, all three of you.

385
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:28,720
Fail.

386
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,220
Fail.

387
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:31,460
Pass.

388
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:33,220
62 on a 70.

389
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:36,820
You can hear him very faintly under his breath.

390
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:41,860
Hey, hey, oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

391
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:49,460
8-1-1-8-1-8-9-5-2-0-1-3-1-1-8-1-1-1-9.

392
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:51,780
Yeah, yeah, Bruce likey, yeah.

393
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,340
Mr. Robin?

394
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:54,900
Yeah.

395
00:30:54,900 --> 00:31:00,500
And he turns and he's like, oh, yeah, yeah, what are you guys, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,

396
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,300
what are you guys doing?

397
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,380
Hey, what are you guys doing up here?

398
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:05,300
Well, we came to talk to you, sir.

399
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:07,220
What were those numbers you were just muttering?

400
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:07,860
I heard that.

401
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,300
What were those?

402
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,020
Roll human.

403
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,900
That's a fail.

404
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,100
Can we all roll?

405
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:16,420
Yeah.

406
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:16,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

407
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:18,660
Fail.

408
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:19,160
I pass.

409
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:20,980
47 on 80.

410
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,180
You got 80, human?

411
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:22,580
Yeah.

412
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:23,460
Fuck yeah, dude.

413
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:25,940
Numbers.

414
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:27,780
I know.

415
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:30,900
8-1-1-8, you know, you just said it.

416
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:32,900
No, no numbers for me.

417
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:37,060
8-1-1-8-1-8-1-9-5-2-0-1-3-1-1-8-1-1-1-9.

418
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:39,140
Yeah.

419
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:41,940
No, Bruce no likey, Bruce no likey.

420
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:43,700
Well, you just said Bruce did likey.

421
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:44,980
No.

422
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:45,700
Come on, come on.

423
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:49,940
Hey, guys, come on, come on over here and sit down, sit down in these chairs right here.

424
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:53,220
Yeah, come on, Bruce likey if you sit down here.

425
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:55,540
I'm actually very comfortable standing, sir.

426
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,220
Yeah, Clark doesn't take a seat either.

427
00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:05,460
He immediately walks over and there is a glass on his desk, like a rocks glass,

428
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:10,260
and he picks it up and he holds it in his hand with like white knuckles and he walks

429
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:16,340
toward you guys and he's like, I think maybe you should just probably just sit in the seats,

430
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:16,660
right?

431
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:18,740
Yeah, yeah, we can talk, yeah.

432
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,420
Clark puts his hand on his gun.

433
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:24,340
No, no, no, no, no, no, there's no need for any of that business here.

434
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:27,780
Then you can put that glass down and step back behind the desk there.

435
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:30,180
All right, well, come on down, come on down.

436
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:36,180
And he walks over to his desk and he kind of slides across the top of it to go sit on

437
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:36,980
the other side.

438
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:37,540
Cool.

439
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:44,500
I'll walk over directly facing him.

440
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:52,820
So he just like a fat kid getting out of a pool, just like sets his belly down on the

441
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:59,540
desk and then like slowly tips over and then pops up and rotates around to the side.

442
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:03,700
Although Keith goes and sits at the chair.

443
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:06,500
Yeah, yeah, Bruce Leicke, yeah, do that.

444
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,820
I'll stand near a chair, but I'm not going to sit in it.

445
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:13,060
I'm going to stand behind the chair that Keith's in, kind of with my like hand on the,

446
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:15,380
not on my shoulders, but like on the top of the chair.

447
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:17,540
Hand shoes and horse grenades, I'll take it.

448
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:19,220
Yeah, yeah, all right, well.

449
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:24,180
Can I do a check that we're not standing on like a trap door?

450
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:25,620
Oh, sure.

451
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:27,540
Zach's like, ooh, there is a trap door.

452
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,100
Roll dexterity.

453
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:32,820
No, you can roll search, I guess.

454
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:34,260
I was afraid you were going to say that and I don't have it.

455
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:36,420
20% for you, sir.

456
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:38,260
I fail, 97.

457
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:42,820
You don't seem to be standing anywhere except for right next to a very comfy chair.

458
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:43,140
Okay.

459
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,180
Do you know who I am?

460
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:45,300
He just stares at you.

461
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,740
You can answer his question, Bruce.

462
00:33:49,220 --> 00:34:02,980
You're not, you're not with, and you notice as he's just like pondering your question,

463
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:08,820
blood on his knuckles, like from a cut or scrape or something, or from punching.

464
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:10,260
And which one?

465
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,060
Oh, you don't know.

466
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:14,900
I mean, it would be just kind of red and cut up.

467
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:21,540
He's also wearing a silver ring with a blank, flat top on his middle finger on his left hand.

468
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:23,140
Is that something we've seen before?

469
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:29,220
Yeah, I, I, I, I, I nod, I motion with my head and eyes at Keith and John at the ring.

470
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,940
It looks like one of those rings I found.

471
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:34,660
Is that one of the rings that we found at?

472
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:35,460
Jim Cook's house.

473
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:35,860
Okay.

474
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:36,900
And when you rubbed it.

475
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,180
Light came out of it or something?

476
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:39,620
Or when you put it on, I think.

477
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:40,580
Oh, the M.

478
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:43,540
It was the M made out of four double helices.

479
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:44,660
Double helix, yeah.

480
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:49,300
You were at Jim Cook's house when I got pushed through the wall.

481
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:50,020
Yeah, it was in there.

482
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:51,620
It was in the kitchen or in the kitchen.

483
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:51,940
Yeah.

484
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:56,020
Well, I mean, I found it in the bathroom, but then I laid it on the counter when I left.

485
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,700
And then we came back and looked at it.

486
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:58,200
Yeah, I did.

487
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:02,260
Wait, I have that around my neck on a chain.

488
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:02,820
You do.

489
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:04,500
Yeah, you do.

490
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,540
Show him the goddamn ring.

491
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:12,500
Yeah, I, I take it off like the necklace part and I just kind of show it to him,

492
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,700
but I don't say anything.

493
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:16,900
His eyes get massive.

494
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,740
In an excited way or a scared way?

495
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:19,460
Both.

496
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:22,820
And he is very careful with his words.

497
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:26,100
Are you, uh, are you with?

498
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:27,940
I'm so sorry.

499
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:31,620
Jon does that.

500
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:33,780
He waves.

501
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:34,900
He's like, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

502
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:40,980
I was waving off Zach like, don't get too far into that.

503
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:48,260
Marietta say yes.

504
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:48,740
I nod.

505
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:49,780
Okay.

506
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:54,100
Well, if it's coming, let it happen.

507
00:35:56,420 --> 00:36:00,900
And he sits down in the chair behind the desk, kind of hangs his head.

508
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,660
Marietta was that robot company.

509
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,100
They made the androids.

510
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:04,580
Yeah.

511
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:06,020
We found a file in Jim.

512
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:07,620
Do I do this in character?

513
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:08,660
No, you out of character.

514
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:10,660
We can just talk about what you guys know about Marietta.

515
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:14,180
We found all those folders in Jim Cook's secret room in his house.

516
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:19,220
And folder one was called operation stapler and it had the M helix.

517
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:21,540
And we figured out that that meant myriad.

518
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:26,580
And it had to do with the respecking androids to cut down on costs to sell to other companies.

519
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:28,020
And that's when we also found.

520
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:28,180
Yeah.

521
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:31,220
We also saw the same M logo hole puncher.

522
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:34,340
Well, yes, that's when we learned about hole puncher and some other things.

523
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:39,300
But we also saw the myriad logo on the Android who attacked us outside of, uh,

524
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:39,700
that's right.

525
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:46,100
It was on the, on the crotch of the James, the mill workers house and I've got the ring

526
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:48,020
that has that symbol on it as well.

527
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:51,220
Did it glow or something when I put it on or when I like rubbed it?

528
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:54,980
It was when you put it on because it didn't do anything for me when I found it originally,

529
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:56,180
but I never put it on.

530
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:56,820
Okay.

531
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:59,220
So at this point, what I'm just holding it.

532
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:00,100
Confirmed.

533
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:03,300
And when you say yes, I slipped the ring on.

534
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:12,980
With his head slumped down, tongue flitting back and forth across his top lip, Bruce

535
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:20,260
Robin's eyes shift up to stare past you through a messy curtain of unwashed hair.

536
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:23,700
And he begins chanting.

537
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:33,220
Towel alicorn, Towel alicorn, Towel alicorn, Towel alicorn, Towel alicorn, Towel alicorn.

538
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:35,540
I jump across the desk and punch him.

539
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:35,940
Okay.

540
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:41,060
So we are going to roll against each other dexterity.

541
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:48,180
However, I'm going to give you a plus 40 for your pulp Cthulhu talent that you took to

542
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:49,620
do combat first.

543
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:50,260
Oh, gotcha.

544
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:50,760
Cool.

545
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:55,300
Well, okay.

546
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:56,580
I succeed with a 50.

547
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:01,460
I crit pass a 33.

548
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:02,500
Yeah, baby.

549
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:06,340
The crit trumps the low, the fact that I'm still lower, right?

550
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:07,460
It absolutely does.

551
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,260
Yes.

552
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:12,820
I Superman leap across the desk, landing the punch in flight.

553
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:18,180
I think that's going to probably tackle the chair over and we'll be playing on the ground,

554
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:20,260
but I've knocked the fuck out of this dude's jaw.

555
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:21,860
Roll unarmed combat.

556
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:30,820
I pass a 47 on a 70.

557
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:31,700
I failed.

558
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:35,300
So roll a D six, a four.

559
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:38,260
As you tackle him, the chair tips over backwards.

560
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:38,580
Yes.

561
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:40,580
A punch from Clark Bishop is the exact same.

562
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:42,340
And you hear a snap as a sip.

563
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:45,140
That's the exact same damage.

564
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:51,460
As you tackle him to the floor, you actually see.

565
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:53,220
Oh, hi.

566
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:58,500
A pistol in his hand gets knocked just out of his reach.

567
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:02,580
And he had grabbed it underneath his desk with his head down.

568
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:05,860
Dude, I wanted to say, I was starting to haunt him.

569
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:08,740
Han and Greedo like gun at the table, but I didn't.

570
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:10,740
So I'm really glad you knocked that gun out of his hand.

571
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:16,900
As soon as that happens, I want to shut his talk box.

572
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,900
I want to jump over the desk as well.

573
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:22,100
And what I want to do is I want to try to stomp on his hand

574
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:24,420
and then pull the ring off of his hand as well.

575
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:25,540
Okay.

576
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:32,180
Uh, roll unarmed combat against him and I'll give him a negative 40 for being pinned.

577
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:34,740
Essentially, I got a hundred.

578
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:35,540
Oh shit.

579
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:40,100
When you go to stomp on his hand, he grabs the bottom of your foot and he just pushes

580
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:42,100
and you fall on your ass.

581
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:42,820
Oh no.

582
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:48,580
I want to grab anything I can, uh, a box of like tissues, maybe a tie that he took off.

583
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:50,180
Anything I can see.

584
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:52,260
And I want to just shove it in his mouth.

585
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:54,020
You can grab the tie that he took off.

586
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:55,380
It's on his desk.

587
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:55,780
Okay.

588
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:59,620
I want to, I want to try to just like throw that in his spell speaker.

589
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:09,460
All right, so you're going to roll strength against him and I'll give him a negative.

590
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:12,180
He passed with a 31.

591
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:13,620
I failed 54 out of 50.

592
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:14,580
Shit.

593
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:15,620
How we are cool.

594
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:19,700
And he keeps, he, he like keeps his teeth gritted together.

595
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:22,980
So you can't make it through his big old chompies.

596
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:24,660
Unclench your chompers.

597
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:25,620
Can I punch him again?

598
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:28,100
Uh, yes.

599
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:31,060
And he will actually go now.

600
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:34,660
So he's gonna make an attempt to get you off of him.

601
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:35,140
Okay.

602
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:38,660
Uh, so if you're going to punch him, he's going to roll on overcomded against you as well.

603
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:39,460
Contested me and you.

604
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:39,860
Yes, sir.

605
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:40,360
Okay.

606
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:44,980
But when you rear back to punch, he succeeds with a 51.

607
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:45,620
I fail.

608
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:47,940
So he simply gets you off.

609
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:53,220
That's a wrap on pretending to be people.

610
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:54,340
Thank you, Bruce.

611
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:00,020
Buy a Clark a drink first.

612
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,580
And he's gonna grab the gun.

613
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:08,100
So he, this round is able to grab the gun again.

614
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:09,140
He has it.

615
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:11,540
So it is Clark Bishop's turn.

616
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:12,580
He has the gun?

617
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:13,080
Yes.

618
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:16,340
And he is continuing his chant.

619
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,500
You can hear it right now in the background.

620
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:22,500
Is he standing?

621
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,620
No, he's still on the ground.

622
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:25,460
I think I just want to punch him again.

623
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:25,700
Yeah.

624
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:29,140
Just a real quick synopsis of what this looks like currently.

625
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:35,620
He's on his back on the back of the chair with his like head on the ground and his legs

626
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:37,460
like up in the air.

627
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:43,060
Keith is on his ass trying to recover from getting like brush hour two flipped on his

628
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:50,580
back and John Lee Pettymore is like straddling him trying to get this tie in his mouth.

629
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:51,220
Temporarily.

630
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:55,140
He's just like got a tie full of saliva that he's like shaking off his hands.

631
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:58,420
So you're going to go to punch him?

632
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:00,260
Is he holding the gun?

633
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:01,300
He is holding the gun.

634
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:05,620
I think I would, I mean, whatever, whatever role you need for, I would be keeping my hand

635
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:07,620
on his hand, keeping that gun away.

636
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:07,860
Okay.

637
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:10,980
So that'll be unarmed combat pin attempt.

638
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:16,580
I pass a 10.

639
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:19,940
I crit pass with an 11.

640
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:20,180
Shoot.

641
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:22,100
The gun merges into his hand.

642
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:25,300
Man becomes one with machine.

643
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:27,940
It's no longer possible to disarm him.

644
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:28,580
Keith Europe.

645
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:30,500
It is impossible to disarm him.

646
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:31,460
Oh, no.

647
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:35,860
No, he's got a real tight grip on the gun though.

648
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:41,700
And he is like far more maneuverable at this juncture for this round because of that critical

649
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:42,260
success.

650
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:44,900
I get up, I pull my gun out and I shoot him in the stomach.

651
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:46,260
Draw your gun, roll firearms.

652
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:48,580
64 and a 70.

653
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:51,220
Do you say anything terrible when you do this?

654
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:53,540
No, I just kind of, I see the gut.

655
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:54,260
I see the gun.

656
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:58,980
I see the gun waving around and just, I don't want to see Clark get shot.

657
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:01,700
I don't have the stomach for this kind of work.

658
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:02,180
No, I don't.

659
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:03,300
He says nothing cool.

660
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:05,780
He just reacts immediately and pops one.

661
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:07,940
Oh shit.

662
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:12,020
Blood splatters out and gets all over John Lee Petty more.

663
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:15,220
My new windbreaker.

664
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:16,740
Whose turn it is currently.

665
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:21,540
It was $2 and 50 cents.

666
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:24,100
Half off yellow tech.

667
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:29,380
Um, but 25, uh, it's new to you though.

668
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:32,740
Would I have time to talk to him in between a combat round?

669
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:32,980
Yeah.

670
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:33,780
Are you going to stay down?

671
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:34,500
Motherfucker.

672
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:35,620
You can answer our questions.

673
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:40,580
I want to just like smack him in the face with my pistol.

674
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:41,300
The bottom again.

675
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:41,540
Okay.

676
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:44,100
I actually, I forgot to have Luke roll damage.

677
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:46,580
So roll a D for damage.

678
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:48,580
Unless you, did you grab at this point?

679
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:52,820
Do I have my tiny gun or do I just have a service pistol?

680
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:53,860
You have your tiny gun.

681
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:56,340
Do I have a service pistol as well?

682
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:56,820
Yes.

683
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:58,820
I want to shoot him with just a regular pistol.

684
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:00,180
Not the tiny powerful one.

685
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:05,380
If I Clark got a handful of pistols from the circle of knowledge, so you guys would all

686
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:05,860
have one.

687
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:06,660
So I want to shoot him.

688
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:08,580
There was just like seven sitting around that accord.

689
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:08,900
Yeah.

690
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:13,700
I want to, uh, I want to shoot him just laying in the backseat, sticking out of the gun box.

691
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:14,420
You guys want a gun?

692
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:14,900
I got some.

693
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:23,540
So, uh, still a 10 for that or a little bouquet of a seven.

694
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:24,500
Okay.

695
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:25,620
So man.

696
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:25,860
Okay.

697
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:36,340
He passes a constitution check to stay with it and he is going to continue bleeding onto

698
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:38,900
the floor pooling in this chair.

699
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:44,820
It is one of those chairs that we like to describe on this show that has the buttons

700
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:46,020
deep pushed in.

701
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:51,380
So there's blood pooling like syrup in a waffle into the back of this chair.

702
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:51,940
Nice.

703
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:52,340
Thank you.

704
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:57,940
Thomas, go ahead and roll a human.

705
00:44:57,940 --> 00:44:58,180
Okay.

706
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:00,420
Ooh.

707
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:00,900
Eight.

708
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:03,380
He looks at you and he's like, yeah, yeah.

709
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:05,380
Bruce no likey Bruce Bruce will stop.

710
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:06,180
Yeah.

711
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:07,620
Bruce no likey Bruce will stop.

712
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:12,180
John no likey.

713
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:13,860
When you do that, stop that.

714
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:14,580
That's what I know.

715
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:19,700
Like you want Keith to shoot at you again and your Getty, you know, like that rat.

716
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:21,860
He continues chanting.

717
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:23,460
I'm a little exasperated with him.

718
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:26,500
Down the hallway and see what Winifred's doing.

719
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:32,500
As you turn to look back down the hallway, your ear starts ringing because a gunshot

720
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:33,540
just went off.

721
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:40,260
And as soon as you turn around, you see Bruce Robin has pointed the gun to his own head

722
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:44,420
and has committed suicide in front of Clark Bishop and Keith Vigna.

723
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:47,140
I need you all to roll sanity except for Keith Vigna.

724
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:48,180
Mission accomplished boys.

725
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:51,460
Who does not have to roll sanity when humans die.

726
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:52,340
That's correct.

727
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:56,420
That's a great skill to take and tilt the green.

728
00:45:58,660 --> 00:45:59,140
Fuck.

729
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:00,580
Crit fail 77.

730
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:02,180
Uh, just a regular fail for me.

731
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:08,660
Clark Bishop loses one sanity and John Lee Pettymore loses two sanity.

732
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:09,540
I'm at 14.

733
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:14,100
Fuck.

734
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:19,940
He's just covered in this dude's like blood and he's kind of out of it for a second.

735
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:22,580
Keith walks over and gets the ring off his finger.

736
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:25,140
Keith, you get the ring off of his finger.

737
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:33,860
And when you turn around, you see that John Lee Pettymore is writing on the desk in blood.

738
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:40,820
Two, one, eight, two, one, three, five, one.

739
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:44,580
Thomas looking up, you have no recollection of writing this.

740
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:46,340
Do you stop him before he's done?

741
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:46,980
Yeah, for sure.

742
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:49,300
I mean, it's freaking me out that he's not responding.

743
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:53,860
And then seeing those numbers and hearing those numbers from Bruce moments before it's

744
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:55,380
all adding up to something bad.

745
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:58,020
So Clark is putting a stop to that as quick as possible.

746
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:01,540
John, what was, why were you writing those numbers?

747
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:02,820
I'm sorry.

748
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:05,460
I'm sorry.

749
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:07,780
It's been a rough couple of days.

750
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:12,100
Just having that guy's face blow up all over me like that.

751
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:17,860
That shook me just a little bit.

752
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:22,180
But Hey, uh, listen, Maggie sent us here to kill this.

753
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:22,820
Fuck.

754
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:23,940
He's dead.

755
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:27,380
Let's strip him, search the office and a fucking report back.

756
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:30,500
I guess Clark is kind of bewildered.

757
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:31,380
Nodding one.

758
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:33,540
Do those, do those numbers mean something to you, John?

759
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:34,180
What numbers?

760
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:35,380
Those.

761
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:38,180
And I pointed what he had been writing on the desk.

762
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:42,260
Those, those numbers that you were writing on the desk, does that mean something to you?

763
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:43,700
I mean, that's the numbers he wrote.

764
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:45,380
It must, I'm sorry.

765
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:46,820
I can't, I'm a little shook up.

766
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:49,060
I must've just been writing the last thing I remembered.

767
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,460
Keith puts that ring on.

768
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:53,700
So I've got two, two of them on.

769
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:56,260
If I like touch them together, does anything happen?

770
00:47:56,260 --> 00:47:58,500
No, but they both have the little...

771
00:47:58,500 --> 00:47:59,860
Your dick gets a little smaller.

772
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:01,380
Are they, are they exactly the same?

773
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:04,180
They are the exact same.

774
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:09,540
I'm going to string the second one onto that chain again and put it around my neck.

775
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:15,300
And then all of a sudden the double doors to Bruce Robin's office swing open and the

776
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:20,180
three of you realize you aren't standing in the same places.

777
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:28,180
You were just standing and none of you are wearing clothes, but you are completely covered

778
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:35,860
in warm blood and written in the same fresh blood from the lifeless body of Bruce Robin

779
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:42,980
is a new set of numbers covering everything in the office, the floor, the walls, the window,

780
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:46,980
everything over and over and over and over.

781
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:57,620
It repeats two, one, eight, two, one, three, five, one, eight, one, five, two, nine, one,

782
00:48:57,620 --> 00:49:01,300
four, and you have no recollection.

783
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:03,620
What the fuck?

784
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:41,620
How am I the only one trying to pull over?

785
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:45,380
How can you have enough?

786
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:51,940
Drowning out all the noise.

787
00:49:51,940 --> 00:50:07,940
Cause nobody knows, nobody knows, nobody knows.
