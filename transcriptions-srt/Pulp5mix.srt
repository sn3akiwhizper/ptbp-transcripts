1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
Greetings and salutations, my pack.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,460
It's your hellacious howler, Wolf the Dog,

3
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:12,840
and I am shoutin' at you live from 694.2 PTBP.

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,500
My screams can be heard no matter where you are,

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,260
as long as you are tuned into the very good numbers.

6
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:23,000
That's how radios work, I think.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,720
One thing that always works is the adoration of the public.

8
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,060
It just gets my crawdads boilin'.

9
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:35,260
This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Josh in Maryland.

10
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:38,980
They tweeted about the show and tagged at PretendingPod.

11
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:42,720
Wow, thanks, Josh. I really appreciate it.

12
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,860
They write,

13
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,900
Thank you all for your excellent show.

14
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:50,520
I cannot wait to see what season two brings.

15
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,020
You introduced me to Delta Green,

16
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:56,600
and I've made that all of my friends' problems.

17
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,100
So far, they have sustained major casualties

18
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:04,100
in both Lover in the Ice and The Last Equation.

19
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:07,980
Shout-out to Deathwatch and the Raven Inquisition,

20
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:11,280
the best friends to play an RPG with.

21
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,640
Damn, Josh. Thank you, my child.

22
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,780
We here at PTBP love it when you make something you love

23
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,940
everyone else's problem.

24
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:24,780
Just ask all of my friends.

25
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:29,080
I have literally so many of these things called friends.

26
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,740
I'm definitely not super lonely,

27
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,240
sittin' in this studio for all time

28
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,880
with only my producer and dog, Wolf the Dog.

29
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,840
I definitely don't long to share a warm garbage parfait

30
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,380
with another under the flickering lights

31
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:50,040
in the parking lot of the long-abandoned supermarket

32
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,880
called Cream for Less.

33
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,680
The stars and moon cast in an otherworldly glow

34
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,680
upon our yogurt-covered claws and maws.

35
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,140
Yeah, I definitely don't care about none of that.

36
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,340
Ahem. Huh.

37
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,340
Well, uh, if you want to write up something for your wolf to howl,

38
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,680
tag at Pretending Pod on the Internet

39
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,880
or write a five-star review on Apple Podcasts

40
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,180
and holler at us about it.

41
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:20,180
Say it loud to the person on your left,

42
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,980
at Pretending Pod.

43
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:25,180
Now say it loud to the person on your right,

44
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:27,020
at Pretending Pod.

45
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:30,520
Say it out loud to your friend Beth's dad.

46
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:34,180
Say it out loud to your fest-drenned Brad,

47
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:37,020
at Pretending Pod.

48
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,940
And now, the news.

49
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:42,940
Last time, Lafayette J. Honeycutt

50
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:47,140
landed on the roof of the great chauffeur party building

51
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:49,940
with his Fuck Yo Gravity machine.

52
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:54,200
He then came face to face with a otherworldly creature.

53
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,440
It scuttled across the top of the building toward him

54
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,200
as he failed miserably

55
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,200
at an attempt to pop down to ground level.

56
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,700
The lit towel rained down a bevy of debris,

57
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:09,440
including a burning timber that drove checkers down

58
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,940
and pinned him into the snowdrift.

59
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,700
Thankfully, Harvey Brewer was nearby

60
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,940
to help his future cult leader,

61
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:19,440
and in a downpour of good luck,

62
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,440
Honeycutt blasted the flying monsters

63
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,940
with a jetpack fart to the face

64
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:28,940
and flipped down next to Harvey and checkers with ease.

65
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:33,940
Meanwhile, Elden Ring became Dark Soul.

66
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:39,440
That led to Mr. Soul being shot by his ex-leader checkers.

67
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,940
This was, of course, followed by the sounds of screaming,

68
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,940
electrical discharge,

69
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:49,940
and the air being absolutely filled with the buzzing

70
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,940
of these twisted winged beasts

71
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:56,440
with pulsating crenulations across their jagged heads.

72
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,940
It's a swarm, y'all.

73
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:01,940
And now, for the first time,

74
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:07,440
a brand new song here for 694.2 PTBP.

75
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:11,440
It's Isabelle Crane with Hollow.

76
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,940
I didn't know

77
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:17,940
a body could be hollow

78
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:22,940
before its blood ran cold.

79
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,940
I didn't know

80
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:32,940
that the wind could soak

81
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:37,940
the tissue and faggot bone.

82
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,940
You were hollow

83
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:45,440
and you spoke to me.

84
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:52,440
Hollow and you sang.

85
00:04:54,440 --> 00:05:00,440
I thought you might be starving,

86
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:07,440
so I gave you everything.

87
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:13,440
I feel so low energy after your kind of hype there.

88
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,440
Well, something was said right before we cut to the 30 seconds of silence

89
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,440
that made Scott literally say the phrase,

90
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,440
Jesus wept.

91
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,440
And it reminded me,

92
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,440
we used to play Bible trivia

93
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,940
when our Sunday school teacher

94
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:36,440
didn't have anything prepared for us on Sunday morning,

95
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,940
and Bible trivia was a game that was like, you know,

96
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,940
Trivial Pursuit, whatever, is in a box

97
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,940
and so we'd bust it out and play.

98
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,940
And the question was,

99
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:48,440
what is the shortest verse in the Bible?

100
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,940
And my friend's younger sister said,

101
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:55,940
enthusiastically as anyone has ever proclaimed any two words,

102
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,940
Jesus wept.

103
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,940
Jesus wept.

104
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:05,940
No, Jesus used the three cells.

105
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:11,440
Yeah, he didn't come to wash away mankind's sins,

106
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,440
just to wipe them away.

107
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,440
Just smudge them a bit.

108
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,440
Yeah, from back to front too.

109
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,440
Jesus was a freak.

110
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,440
Yeah, and they didn't have bidets back then,

111
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,440
so, ugh.

112
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,440
Oh my God.

113
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,940
And for you listening at home,

114
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,440
if you don't have a bidet,

115
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,440
we're not living in Jesus times anymore.

116
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,440
You can get one.

117
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,440
They're relatively inexpensive

118
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,440
and it keeps your butthole happy.

119
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,940
Brought to you by, I'm Googling bidet company.

120
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,940
We need to reach out.

121
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,940
If we could get a sponsor for the podcast

122
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,940
that wasn't like, just like Bomba socks or whatever

123
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,940
every time, it would be cool

124
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,940
if we were just exclusively sponsored

125
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,940
by a bidet brand.

126
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,940
Brought to you by,

127
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,940
Brought to you by Tushy.

128
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,940
Oh, that's a good one.

129
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:59,940
Today only, if you type in the code PTBP

130
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,940
and then delete it off there,

131
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,940
you can buy, if you buy two bidets,

132
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:06,940
you can save $90 at Tushy.com.

133
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:09,940
And if you use Honey, it'll probably help.

134
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:14,440
If your arsehole could speak, it would thank you.

135
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,940
Oh, that's a hell of a tagline.

136
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,940
Thomas, what do you think about that?

137
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,940
Our Jimmy John's came, Scott.

138
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,940
We've got delicious Jimmy John's incoming.

139
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:26,940
That was freaky fast.

140
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,940
That was freaky fast.

141
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:31,940
Your sandwich place is called Jimmy John's?

142
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:32,940
Jimmy John's, yep.

143
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:33,940
Oh, Jimmy John's. Oh, sorry.

144
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:34,940
I thought you said Jimmy John's.

145
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:37,940
I was expecting it to come with flavor aid.

146
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:42,940
Holy shit.

147
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,940
The Jim Jones.

148
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,940
Is this going to be like some special Patreon content

149
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:49,940
where it's just like eating sounds for 10 minutes?

150
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:50,940
Oh, God.

151
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:51,940
Dibbing up of sandwiches.

152
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:54,940
So we literally have to split off in our very first episode.

153
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,940
There's a doorbell that rings like four minutes

154
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,940
into our very first recording.

155
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,940
Jimmy John's just showed up at the door

156
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:04,940
and Luke went to the door and the guy was like,

157
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:05,940
what are you guys up to today?

158
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:08,940
And Luke was like, oh, we're playing a role playing game.

159
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,940
And the guy was like, oh, sweet.

160
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,940
Have you ever heard of Delta Green?

161
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,940
And Luke was like, dude, I'm not kidding.

162
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,940
That is what we're playing.

163
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:22,940
Brilliant.

164
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:23,940
And then I didn't say like, hey, we're recording.

165
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:24,940
You should listen to this thing

166
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,940
that will come out in two years.

167
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,940
Well, that guy was Joe.

168
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:32,940
Can I play?

169
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,940
It was called Jimmy Joe's back then.

170
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:38,940
What are we going to do?

171
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,940
Hoover down a few bites.

172
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,940
Take your time.

173
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,940
I don't want to see any of you choking to death

174
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,940
trying to catch the game in a hurry.

175
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:47,940
It's a horror game, Scott.

176
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:48,940
Psychic attack!

177
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:49,940
Psychic attack!

178
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,940
Well, I think everyone's stopped crunching chips.

179
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,940
Yeah, I'm ready to go.

180
00:08:58,940 --> 00:08:59,940
Fantastic.

181
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:02,940
Does someone want to do a recap

182
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,940
and then we can move on to the death?

183
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,940
There was a heavy betrayal.

184
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:08,940
Oh, man, yeah.

185
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,940
Luke really betrayed me.

186
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,940
But then kind of a reconciliation sort of.

187
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:15,940
I don't know what happened at the end there

188
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:18,940
where he was first aiding you after having shot you.

189
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:19,940
I know, it's wild.

190
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:22,940
Well, I was pissed that I could feel you betraying me

191
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:25,940
in real time and then I didn't want to kill you,

192
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,940
but I had to stop you psychic attacking me.

193
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:31,940
I'd like to read something from the psychic attack part

194
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,940
of the Pulp Cthulhu handbook.

195
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,940
It says, I can.

196
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:40,940
Okay, I can.

197
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,940
Sounds like you're making it up already.

198
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,940
I'll read the whole thing then, I guess.

199
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,940
It says that I can.

200
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,940
And I do.

201
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,940
The psychic may attempt a psychic attack

202
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,940
if the target is in line of sight.

203
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:58,940
If the initial opposed power roll is failed,

204
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:01,940
the psychic hero may attempt another power roll

205
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,940
on their turn in the following round.

206
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:07,940
The second attempt effectively works like a push roll.

207
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,940
If the second attempt fails,

208
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:13,940
the target of the attack can never be targeted again

209
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,940
by the same psychic.

210
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:16,940
Wow.

211
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,940
So I don't know if you read that, Scott,

212
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:22,940
as like two psychic attacks back to back in one combat.

213
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:24,940
Okay, so then I've done it once.

214
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,940
So if I do it again and fail,

215
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:29,940
then I'll never be able to psychic attack you ever again.

216
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,940
And then that would restore my trust in you.

217
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,940
Yeah, so don't think of it as a psychic attack.

218
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:38,940
Think of it as an inoculation.

219
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:39,940
Right.

220
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:42,940
Oh, and if I fail, it works like a pushed roll.

221
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,940
So something suitably bad happens.

222
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,940
Possible consequences might include

223
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,940
bleeding from ears and eyes,

224
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,940
sanity loss and instant delusion,

225
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:56,940
incapacitation by shaking and spasms, et cetera.

226
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:57,940
Nice.

227
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:58,940
I like et cetera, too.

228
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,940
Yeah, et cetera sounds crazy.

229
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:01,940
Yes.

230
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:04,940
Anyway, that could be bad, huh?

231
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:05,940
Could be bad.

232
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,940
But I'm sure you wouldn't be silly enough to do that,

233
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:08,940
would you?

234
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:09,940
God, no.

235
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:12,940
There's no way of telling, honestly.

236
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,940
So shall we open up with that then

237
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,940
with the two of you down there in the cellar,

238
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:20,940
patching things up both figuratively and literally?

239
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:21,940
But why?

240
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:22,940
Why did you do it?

241
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:26,940
You should join us.

242
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,940
I'm not sure what any of it is.

243
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:29,940
I don't know what the invention is.

244
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:30,940
I don't know what that thing was.

245
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,940
I don't know what you're trying to get me to join.

246
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:36,940
Well, you didn't know what anything was before,

247
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,940
and you were still the face of that.

248
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:39,940
Fair enough.

249
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:42,940
His mind has been changed.

250
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,940
Oh, yes.

251
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:45,940
Delta.

252
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:49,940
Green.

253
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:52,940
Well, let's, I mean, we got you patched up

254
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,940
as much as I can do right here, but...

255
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,940
I'm feeling much better, thank you.

256
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:57,940
There's probably a doctor.

257
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:58,940
Friend.

258
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:01,940
There's scientists and academics and everything.

259
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,940
There's got to be a doctor.

260
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,940
Hey, I want you to know,

261
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,940
just because you're no longer my master

262
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,940
does not mean that we cannot be friends.

263
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:10,940
Huh?

264
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:13,940
I can teach you the ways of this creature,

265
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:14,940
and you can learn.

266
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:15,940
But I'm in charge, though.

267
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:18,940
Assuredly, but you can learn from me.

268
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:19,940
Hmm.

269
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:22,940
I think you lost a lot of blood or something,

270
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:25,940
and you're not making no sense.

271
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,940
And I think with that as well,

272
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:30,940
you can start hearing all the screaming and crying

273
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:33,940
and strange, you know, crashing sounds from outside.

274
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:36,940
A little bit of Checkers charm pops into his head,

275
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:39,940
and he's like, hey, they're missing us out there.

276
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:42,940
Yeah, a little bit of Monica in my life.

277
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:43,940
Right.

278
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,940
A little bit of Sandra in the sun.

279
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,940
A little bit of Jessica.

280
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,940
I help you walk up the stairs,

281
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:54,940
and we'll head out of this horrifying dungeon.

282
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:55,940
Thank you, friend.

283
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:58,940
And meanwhile, upstairs, Lafayette and Harvey,

284
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,940
you'd heard all the chaos as well

285
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,940
from deeper within the building.

286
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:03,940
What are you doing?

287
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:07,940
I was having a bout of not feeling so great mentally.

288
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:08,940
Am I still having that?

289
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:09,940
Yes.

290
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:10,940
You are.

291
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,940
Yeah, absolute panic.

292
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,940
You've got to get out of here as soon as possible,

293
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:17,940
and I mean, you know where the front door is.

294
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,940
I mean, you know, if you just run out of there,

295
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,940
I'm sure you'll be fine.

296
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:22,940
I'm charging ahead.

297
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:25,940
Okay.

298
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,940
So, yeah, Lafayette can see Harvey

299
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,940
just legging it down the corridor

300
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,940
full speed away from him.

301
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:32,940
How many legs?

302
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:33,940
Yeah, I was gonna ask.

303
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:36,940
I started with 13.

304
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:37,940
You didn't know that?

305
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:42,940
He's running at, what, just over 100 miles an hour?

306
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:46,940
He's done that in, like, the same direction

307
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,940
that the creature just flew off, basically?

308
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:49,940
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

309
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,940
Yeah, he's running towards the chaos.

310
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:55,940
Lafayette looks down, like, either side of the hallway

311
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:58,940
and then closes the door behind him and locks it.

312
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,940
Like, while you're in the room?

313
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:01,940
Yeah.

314
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,940
And then he starts going through the shit in Cicero's room.

315
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:07,940
Well, I mean, the shit in Cicero's room

316
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:11,940
largely consists of blood-splattered furnishings,

317
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:16,940
blood-splattered bedding, blood-splattered carpet,

318
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,940
blood-splattered corpse,

319
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:23,940
the syringe and the strange liquid,

320
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:27,940
blood-splattered ceiling, blood-splattered light fixtures.

321
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:30,940
Blood-splattered love letters he never sent you.

322
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:35,940
I try to open any blood-splattered drawers

323
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,940
or cabinets and find, you know,

324
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,940
is there anything in his bedside table,

325
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:43,940
any super sentimental knick-knack

326
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:48,940
that I can take to just really rub in the world's, you know,

327
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:51,940
I guess I wouldn't show it off too much, but still.

328
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:52,940
You would know.

329
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:53,940
Ego.

330
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:54,940
Yeah.

331
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:00,940
Oh, gosh, what kinds of knick-knacks might he have?

332
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:05,940
Yeah, I guess there's a lock of blonde hair

333
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,940
that's tied with a ribbon.

334
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:10,940
Was his wife?

335
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:13,940
I see that, and I look at it, and I kind of toss it away,

336
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,940
and I see, like, propped up next to the bed

337
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:18,940
is that stupid self-playing violin, and I take that.

338
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:19,940
Yes.

339
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:20,940
And I...

340
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,940
It's out of tune already.

341
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:26,940
And I look at the weird, you know, the stuff he was injecting.

342
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:29,940
I can see the track marks on his arms and shit.

343
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:33,940
And I pocket that as well.

344
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:34,940
Okay.

345
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,940
And then are you two running up those same stairs

346
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:37,940
out of that wardrobe?

347
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,940
Yeah, I think at this point the two of them

348
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,940
do burst out of the wardrobe.

349
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,940
Well, hello, chaps.

350
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,940
We got to go help or something.

351
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,940
What are you doing?

352
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,940
As screams are coming from the...

353
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,940
What's down there?

354
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,940
I don't know, something bad.

355
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,940
Oh, where we just came from.

356
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:56,940
Yeah.

357
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:57,940
Something bad.

358
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:58,940
Did you see it fly out of there?

359
00:15:58,940 --> 00:15:59,940
It's gone, yes.

360
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:02,940
That was down there, and it took him...

361
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,940
He's fucked up because he's thinking

362
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,940
that that thing's his master, but I am.

363
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,940
The new invention of Cicero Morgan

364
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,940
is going to change the world, you know?

365
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,940
And he's saying that shit.

366
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:15,940
Just like everybody down there.

367
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,940
It's going to change the world, you know?

368
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,940
Also, the last branch, you should get in early

369
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,940
because it's about to take off.

370
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:24,940
No. No.

371
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,940
God damn it, no.

372
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:28,940
Lafayette J. Honeycutt is about to take off.

373
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:32,940
He did take off in his amazing jet pack.

374
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,940
I don't know who that is, David.

375
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,940
I am Lafayette J. Honeycutt.

376
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:38,940
Whoa!

377
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:39,940
The whole time?

378
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,940
Yeah, he parts his hair to the other side.

379
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,940
Dramatically.

380
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,940
Checkers recalls, he's like,

381
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,940
I've seen him in the magazines.

382
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,940
That's right, you have.

383
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:50,940
I am the best inventor.

384
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,940
You're the second best inventor on Earth?

385
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:56,940
Well, and then I see him.

386
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,940
I'm like, well, the best now.

387
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:01,940
I was the best before.

388
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,940
I made this kick-ass jet pack.

389
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,940
Can you invent us something to get out of here?

390
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:06,940
Alive?

391
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:07,940
A jet pack!

392
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,940
Us, not you.

393
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:13,940
So Honeycutt, does that mean that I am the vessel

394
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:16,940
that followed through with the energy focus

395
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:20,940
in order to make you the successful man

396
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:23,940
without any sort of rival to speak of?

397
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:25,940
This is exactly what I was saying.

398
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:28,940
He's lost it.

399
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:31,940
If so, I think any invention that you come up with tonight

400
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:35,940
and show off could change the world, you know?

401
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:38,940
Oh, well, have you seen my jet pack?

402
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:41,940
I kind of turn around and I flash it to him.

403
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:43,940
I'm like, eh?

404
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,940
Is it cool?

405
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,940
It's very cool.

406
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,940
I think if you want to work out how cool this is,

407
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,940
you'd have to lick it.

408
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,940
Yeah.

409
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:54,940
Do you mind?

410
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,940
Yeah, I also give him just a little push.

411
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,940
I spread a little flame out the back.

412
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:00,940
Ooh.

413
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:02,940
Just revving the engine, just a little.

414
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:03,940
Huh?

415
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:04,940
Look at that.

416
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,940
I think with all the blood and tissue around,

417
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:09,940
there's just this brief smell of cooking meat.

418
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:13,940
Yeah, it just like singes.

419
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,940
Well, we got to get him to a doctor

420
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:18,940
and figure out what the hell's going on out there.

421
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,940
Well, it sounds like a lot of people are screaming

422
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:24,940
and dying out there, so what if we just stayed in here?

423
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,940
That was sort of my plan.

424
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,940
Well, and what, wait for them to come to us?

425
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,940
No, wait for everything to leave.

426
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:32,940
They know we're up here.

427
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:35,940
That thing had holes drilled in its head and it's mad.

428
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,940
It seemed like it just wanted to get out of here.

429
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:38,940
It's gone.

430
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,940
I'm going to survive.

431
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:41,940
I sure hope so.

432
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,940
I shot him.

433
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:44,940
Sorry.

434
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:45,940
It's okay.

435
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:46,940
I think I'm going to be protected.

436
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:47,940
Split up.

437
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:48,940
Wait, what? Why?

438
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,940
Okay, you take care of him then,

439
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,940
and I unlock the doors and go investigate the scene.

440
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:56,940
Wow, he's going to be deeply unsafe now.

441
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,940
Why don't you go see what's going on out there for me?

442
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:00,940
Could you do that?

443
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:03,940
Yeah, I'm not going to be harmed by this creature

444
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:07,940
or any of its friends, so of course, yeah, that seems fine.

445
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:08,940
Perfect.

446
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,940
You go down there and see what's going on

447
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:11,940
and report back to me.

448
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,940
Yeah, I'll let everybody know you're up here.

449
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:14,940
I kind of shuttle you out the door after.

450
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:15,940
No, no, no, no, no, no.

451
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,940
Don't do that.

452
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:20,940
Don't tell anyone.

453
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,940
Well, in order to make sure that tonight goes off without a hitch,

454
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:26,940
everyone should know where everyone is.

455
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:29,940
You understand that tonight has just been one big hitch, right?

456
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:32,940
No, it's a party.

457
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:33,940
Sorry.

458
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:38,940
The hitches have already gone off.

459
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:43,940
You know, I'll just go with you two.

460
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:44,940
It's a party.

461
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:45,940
Sorry.

462
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:49,940
Well, Harvey's got a head start, so let's catch up with him.

463
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:54,940
So in your panic to get out, you've run to the main stairs

464
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:58,940
and you were going to head to the exit,

465
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,940
but now that you're on the stairs,

466
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,940
you're beginning to come out of this panic

467
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:07,940
and you can see that it is carnage down below.

468
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:11,940
There are people running around all over the place

469
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:15,940
and there are a number of these flying creatures

470
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:17,940
buzzing through the air around them.

471
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:20,940
A few of them are holding these devices

472
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:23,940
that look a bit like cameras maybe.

473
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,940
The people are terrified.

474
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,940
Some of them are trying to get outside.

475
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:30,940
You can see there are a few bodies on the ground.

476
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:32,940
People are getting trampled.

477
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,940
What do you do?

478
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:36,940
Has anything noticed me?

479
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,940
Notice me.

480
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:39,940
What?

481
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:40,940
Give me a luck roll.

482
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,940
Give me a luck roll.

483
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,940
It's a 21 on a 59.

484
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:49,940
I mean, a couple of people run past you up the stairs.

485
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:52,940
There are some of these creatures buzzing around,

486
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:56,940
but nothing seems to have taken a lively interest in you yet,

487
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:59,940
but it's probably only a matter of time.

488
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:03,940
Can you give me an idea of the number of these bug creature things?

489
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:06,940
Is it like 20 of them or is it like three or four of them?

490
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:09,940
At the moment, you're mainly looking into the hallway

491
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:12,940
and you can see about half a dozen of them here,

492
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:16,940
but there's sounds of buzzing from outside.

493
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:20,940
You hear some strange crackling noises from out there as well.

494
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:24,940
And there's pandemonium in the ballroom as well.

495
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:27,940
The band, funnily enough, has stopped playing at this stage.

496
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:30,940
Oh, no, the music.

497
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:35,940
The party's not going off without a hitch.

498
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:38,940
If I'm starting to regain my senses at this point,

499
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:41,940
he's remembered that he's abandoned his employer,

500
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,940
the person he's only supposed to protect.

501
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:48,940
So he's going to look back down the hallway and see if he is followed.

502
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:52,940
Yeah, and as you do so, you can see the others moving towards you,

503
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,940
silhouetted by the light from Gordon's room.

504
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:58,940
And I'm going to try and tell him to slow down and be quiet.

505
00:21:58,940 --> 00:21:59,940
Yeah, it's easy to see that.

506
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:01,940
Let's just go back and lock ourselves in that room.

507
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:04,940
I slow down a little bit, but I kind of blow by Harvey

508
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:07,940
and I'm like, come on, you'll be the most help.

509
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:10,940
I grab him by the scruff of his collar.

510
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:14,940
Hey, buddy, listen, there's a lot of them down there.

511
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:15,940
I can't take them alone.

512
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,940
I don't think four of us can take them either.

513
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,940
What's them?

514
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,940
You saw that thing that came out of the cellar?

515
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:22,940
I shot it.

516
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:23,940
There's a lot of those.

517
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:27,940
Just so you know, I shot it and nothing happened at all.

518
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,940
So do you want to go fight those now?

519
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:32,940
There's got to be a way, or they could join the cult

520
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:35,940
and be the most powerful members of the cult.

521
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,940
Where did this voice come from?

522
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:44,940
The most powerful members of our cult.

523
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,940
Everything about me is a fraud.

524
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:52,940
So I don't really even have an actual voice.

525
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:58,940
So you're having this conversation at the top of the stairs.

526
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,940
Unfortunately, it sounds like it.

527
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,940
So while you're having this conversation,

528
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:10,940
you see Margaret Payne running pursued by one of these creatures.

529
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:14,940
Another one of them wields this camera-like device

530
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:19,940
and seems to be trying to point it actually in your direction.

531
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:23,940
But this bolt of energy shoots out of it

532
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:30,940
and hits the mounting for the chandelier in the hallway.

533
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:32,940
And you see the chandelier come down

534
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:36,940
and land on Margaret Payne, pinning her to the ground.

535
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,940
Oh, Margaret.

536
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:41,940
That beautiful chandelier is ruined.

537
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:49,940
Checkers sees all this and he's thinking like,

538
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:50,940
yeah, I shot that thing.

539
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:53,940
It didn't get affected at all by my gun,

540
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:59,940
but I did see, fucking not Fayetteville, Lafayette.

541
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:02,940
I saw Lafayette burn one to death.

542
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:03,940
Fayetteville, D'Artagnan.

543
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:04,940
Fayetteville.

544
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,940
I saw Fayetteville burn one to death.

545
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:10,940
So because I can't move because Harvey's got his grip on me,

546
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:15,940
I pull my lighter back out and I try to just set the picture on the wall on fire.

547
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:18,940
Stop setting shit on fire, dude.

548
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,940
I'm just picturing in amongst all this chaos,

549
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:25,940
you're standing there almost casually with your arm out

550
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:28,940
as this picture frame slowly smoulders.

551
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:32,940
My plan is to hide out in a room.

552
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,940
I was going to lock myself in a room on the second floor

553
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,940
and you're about to burn me out, dude.

554
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:37,940
Well, I wasn't going to do that

555
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,940
and I figured you'd just come along with us.

556
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,940
So fire kills him.

557
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,940
And while you're having this debate,

558
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:46,940
you can see Margaret Payne is there,

559
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:47,940
still under the chandelier.

560
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,940
She's looking around in panic

561
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,940
and she just makes eye contact with you at the top of the stairs,

562
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:55,940
one bloody hand reaching up towards you.

563
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:59,940
And there's one of these creatures that's swooping down,

564
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:02,940
buzzing down towards her menacingly.

565
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:05,940
We got to help Maggie.

566
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,940
She's in Margaret Payne.

567
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:13,940
Now's the moment for a gentleman to shine, I suppose,

568
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:16,940
and I jet pack down the hallway.

569
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:20,940
Fantastic.

570
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:21,940
Are you going for the chandelier?

571
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:23,940
Are you going for the creature that's about to attack her?

572
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:24,940
What are you doing?

573
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:28,940
I'm going to go, yeah, I'm going to go try to intercept it

574
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,940
before I can get to her.

575
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:36,940
And I'm like, Harvey, lift that off the lady there, you brute,

576
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:37,940
if you're still with me.

577
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:41,940
I'm following him for sure, but do you hit the creature?

578
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:42,940
We don't know yet.

579
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:44,940
Well, let's find out.

580
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:48,940
So I think this comes down to your 35% piloting roll.

581
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,940
I'll let you use that as a combat skill.

582
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:53,940
This thing is going to attack you in return,

583
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:56,940
and it's going to try to bring you down to the ground

584
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:58,940
so it can rip you apart with its pincers.

585
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:04,940
Yeah, 33!

586
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:05,940
33 on a 35?

587
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:06,940
Yeah.

588
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,940
Oh, my God, it's a success.

589
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:09,940
Oh, but it's not a crit.

590
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:10,940
Yeah, no crit.

591
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,940
But it's a success.

592
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,940
Let me just see.

593
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:15,940
I've got a success for it.

594
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:18,940
I'm just checking to see whether it's an ordinary or a hard one.

595
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,940
It is an ordinary one.

596
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:24,940
It just missed a hard success by 1%.

597
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:31,940
So, yeah, you slam into this thing at speed.

598
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:35,940
It doesn't have a face, so it's difficult to describe it as looking surprised,

599
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,940
but it looks surprised.

600
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:41,940
So what's your plan?

601
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:44,940
Are you trying to take it outside?

602
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,940
Are you slamming it into a wall?

603
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,940
Are you slamming it into the ground?

604
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,940
I am probably as surprised as it is,

605
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:54,940
and I am just going to try to jetpack away.

606
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,940
I don't know if I can get it to follow me,

607
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:59,940
but I basically want to try to lead it away.

608
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:00,940
You've got a hold of it, I think.

609
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:01,940
You've got it.

610
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:03,940
I mean, basically, you've barreled into it.

611
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:04,940
You've got hold of it.

612
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:05,940
Right.

613
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:08,940
Then I hold it tight, and I'm like,

614
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:10,940
oh, what's something clever to say, boys?

615
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:13,940
Always the thing that you want, huh?

616
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:15,940
Say that.

617
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:21,940
Yeah, I say, well, you can't always get what you want, I suppose.

618
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:26,940
Something about this party has been bugging me.

619
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:30,940
I say, fuck you, bug man.

620
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:35,940
And as I'm holding it tight,

621
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:41,940
yeah, I'm going to try to just drop it into a wall with some momentum,

622
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,940
bowl it a little bit.

623
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,940
Okay, so, I mean, as you're doing that,

624
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:48,940
I think it's going to have one chance to attack you,

625
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,940
because as you're holding onto it,

626
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:55,940
it becomes very apparent in just how many sharp appendages it has,

627
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:58,940
and it's bringing a couple of these big pincers up

628
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:01,940
to see whether it can remove your face.

629
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:07,940
How are you trying to prevent it from removing your face?

630
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:12,940
I think I'm going to try to take some wild maneuvers with the,

631
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:14,940
like, if I see him going for a swipe,

632
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:19,940
I'm going to try to, like, do a big drop with the jet pack.

633
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,940
So you can use your pilot as a defensive skill,

634
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,940
and give that a try.

635
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:26,940
93.

636
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,940
Okay, I got a success.

637
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:37,940
So, yeah, this creature has brought its claw up,

638
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:40,940
and, oof, this could hurt.

639
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:45,940
I think you should clip that and put it at the beginning of the first episode.

640
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,940
Ooh, this could hurt.

641
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:53,940
So that's six hit points of damage as this pincer closes on your face.

642
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:57,940
I mean, it takes a chunk of meat off the end of your nose,

643
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,940
and there's blood running down into your mouth.

644
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,940
You bastard.

645
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:04,940
I say.

646
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:05,940
I say.

647
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:06,940
Good man.

648
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:11,940
And with that, you said you were going to try to throw it into a ball.

649
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:13,940
Yeah.

650
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:18,940
Okay, I think it's going to try to hold on to you as you do that.

651
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:24,940
So, yeah, if you want to give me again your pilot roll,

652
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:31,940
and I shall roll again for its, sink its sharp appendages into Lafayette roll.

653
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:37,940
I'd like to do just a fast-talk roll to it to say don't.

654
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,940
He says it real fast, though.

655
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:41,940
I roll to 0-3.

656
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:42,940
Oof.

657
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:44,940
I rolled a 20.

658
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,940
Okay, so it beats you.

659
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:48,940
Yeah.

660
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:51,940
And so, yeah, I mean, you try to throw it away from you,

661
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:59,940
but as you do so, it sinks its sharp claws and the ends of its legs into your flesh.

662
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,940
And as you try throwing it away from your body,

663
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:09,940
you can just feel multiple rips in your body as it holds onto you for dear life.

664
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:14,940
Because that's an extreme roll, it does maximum damage on this.

665
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,940
So that is...

666
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:18,940
Ow!

667
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:21,940
So, yes, that is 10 hit points of damage.

668
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:23,940
Ouchy ouchy.

669
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:27,940
Is that 16 that you just within a second?

670
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:29,940
Yes.

671
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:33,940
My current hit points now are, that was 10 just then?

672
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:34,940
Yeah.

673
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:35,940
Yeah, so I'm down to 9.

674
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:36,940
So that's good.

675
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:40,940
Okay, so you're still wrestling with this creature in the air.

676
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:43,940
What's everyone else doing while this is going on?

677
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:49,940
Can Harvey see that happening and he wants to run up and punch this thing off of him?

678
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:51,940
It's got to be quite difficult to do,

679
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:55,940
because the two of them are pretty much bouncing off the ceiling and the walls all around you,

680
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:57,940
moving at speed.

681
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:00,940
So it's not only like trying to hit a pinata,

682
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:03,940
but it's like trying to hit a pinata that's actively running away from you.

683
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:08,940
Well, if that's the case, if I don't think it's possible, then I would help try to get Margaret out from another chandelier.

684
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:11,940
Okay, yeah, you can give me a strength roll to do that.

685
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,940
That's a 50 on a 90?

686
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:20,940
Yeah, you manage to lift the chandelier off her and she's quite bloody and bruised,

687
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:23,940
but she drags herself out from underneath it and says,

688
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:28,940
Oh, thank you so much. I thought I was done for there.

689
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:30,940
We need to get to 6.

690
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:33,940
Safety, we're safe. Where is safe?

691
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:36,940
Shall we get a car and get out of here?

692
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:39,940
Sorry, the car's not an option. They're destroyed out there.

693
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:44,940
There was nobody upstairs. That's probably the most safe place at this point right now.

694
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:47,940
All right, yes, yes, I'll do that.

695
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:53,940
And she starts limping up the stairs as fast as her damaged legs will take her.

696
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:57,940
At the top of the stairs, Checkers is trying to light things up.

697
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:02,940
At the top of the stairs, Checkers is trying to light fires.

698
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:09,940
Well, you are being beaten to the punch slightly because you can see where these things,

699
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:13,940
the ones that are armed with these things that look like cameras have been firing them,

700
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:18,940
that there are bits of the wall and ceiling now which are beginning to catch fire.

701
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,940
Perfect.

702
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:27,940
Yeah, we're on their side now, so this seems fine.

703
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:33,940
Elden, what do we do now? That's your master.

704
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,940
Yeah, I'm looking for the religion man.

705
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:36,940
The Reverend.

706
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:40,940
Okay, give me, actually give me a listen roll.

707
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:44,940
Ooh, 14 on a 50.

708
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:50,940
So you don't see him, but you hear from the ballroom his voice and it's loud.

709
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:56,940
It's cutting through the chaos and he's shouting in absolute fury,

710
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:59,940
you idiots, you are ruining this.

711
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,940
You are ruining everything.

712
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:07,940
Come on guys, we should go talk to the man with the collar.

713
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:10,940
I follow you.

714
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:19,940
So we're going down the stairs as the injured Margaret Payne is being helped up the stairs by Harvey Warby.

715
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:24,940
I think I probably just sent her on her way because my wife is still flying around.

716
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:29,940
She's going to hide under a bed somewhere.

717
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:30,940
Smart.

718
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:33,940
Yeah, I mean the rest of you gather downstairs.

719
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:39,940
There are people running all over the place just trying to get the hell out of here.

720
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:41,940
A couple of them are on fire.

721
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:45,940
There are some on the ground.

722
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,940
Immediate laughter from the PTBP crew.

723
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,940
Someone was on fire.

724
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:53,940
In the climax of a horror movie.

725
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:57,940
A couple of people on fire, some Wilhelm screams.

726
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:59,940
It's like, this is great.

727
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:01,940
Yeah, it is exactly that.

728
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:09,940
What I would like if you're trying to make your way through to the ballroom is dodge rolls off everyone to avoid being stampeded by the panicking people.

729
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:11,940
10.

730
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:12,940
Uh oh.

731
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,940
Hey, I passed a 21 on a 25.

732
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:15,940
94.

733
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:16,940
I fail.

734
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:21,940
So, those of you who failed, so, sorry, was that just Mr. Soul who failed?

735
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:23,940
Soul and Harvey Birdman.

736
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:24,940
No, I passed.

737
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:25,940
Oh, you passed. Sorry, my bad. Just me?

738
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:26,940
Just you.

739
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,940
Oh, okay, cool. I thought anyone...

740
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:32,940
So the rest of you are kind of weaving and elbowing your way through the panicking throng.

741
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:40,940
But, yeah, Mr. Soul gets knocked to the ground and someone's foot slams into your face as they're running off.

742
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:41,940
Oh, no.

743
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:47,940
And you take a grand total of one hit point of damage.

744
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:48,940
Oh, no.

745
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:50,940
It was a little dainty foot.

746
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:52,940
Oh, just a little dainty foot.

747
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:53,940
Yeah, it was a size three.

748
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:55,940
It was a child.

749
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:57,940
But the point is, you're down at the ground.

750
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:06,940
The rest of you, through the doors to the ballroom, you can see Reverend Nye is just marching through the panicking crowd.

751
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:14,940
The air is thick with smoke now, and there's more of these creatures buzzing around these electrical arcs flying everywhere.

752
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:20,940
And you see the air around Reverend Nye seems to be shimmering.

753
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:23,940
It's like he has his own personal heat haze around him.

754
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:32,940
His eyes are absolutely black and he just marches up in the direction of one of these flying creatures, shouting,

755
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:35,940
you idiots, you're ruining this, you idiots.

756
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:40,940
And he raises his hand up and there is this shockwave of force.

757
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:49,940
And the creature flies through the air, impacts the wall behind it, and then just splats like a bug on a windshield.

758
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,940
We should have just done that.

759
00:35:51,940 --> 00:36:01,940
I see that through the crowd of legs and feet, like all through, and I'm like, oh, my God, another one like me.

760
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:08,940
Oh, yeah. I mean, his eyes are absolutely jet black at the moment and the air is shimmering around him with the heat.

761
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:10,940
I can learn so much from this man.

762
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:14,940
I help him off the ground and like try to get him over to the reverend.

763
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:19,940
Yeah, the reverend standing there looking around, his face a mask of fury.

764
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:28,940
And as he sees you coming towards him, Jesse's movement coming towards him, he whips around and raises his hand up again.

765
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:31,940
But pauses for a moment as he sees that it's you.

766
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:35,940
How do I do that, too, so we can eliminate the issues?

767
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,940
There is no time.

768
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:42,940
We have to protect Cicero's invention at all cost.

769
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:51,940
It needs to be shown to the world this is such a delicate time, such a precious time.

770
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:57,940
We need to make sure that his invention goes out there and changes the world.

771
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:00,940
Can his invention help get rid of all these things?

772
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:07,940
I don't know. Maybe. I mean, honestly, I don't understand how it works.

773
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:16,940
This is Cicero's doing. But if you think you understand it, then have at it.

774
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:25,940
Dark soul runs over and in one fell swoop grabs onto the canvas atop it and does the big swipe to unveil it.

775
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:28,940
And I want to roll Cthulhu Mythos.

776
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:32,940
Actually, Cthulhu Mythos doesn't really apply.

777
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:33,940
Oh, shit.

778
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:45,940
Yeah, what you're looking at is just basically a big metal box with a number of dials and meters on it.

779
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:48,940
Fuck.

780
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:55,940
Lafayette! David! Help! Science! Science, man!

781
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,940
This is beyond my mystical capabilities.

782
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:04,940
I yell and look and see him flying around with a crab person on him.

783
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:08,940
If I get out of that, I've got just the thing for this.

784
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:14,940
Let's see whether Lafayette can get out of this so he can have another try at splatting your bug friend.

785
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:21,940
Can I offer help in some way that maybe I'm such a hulking big mass that maybe I can just try and get my body in the way of them?

786
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:29,940
I'll tell you what. Let's have a dex roll to see whether you can get into a position whereby you can actually attack them.

787
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:32,940
Or at least attack the bug. Maybe not Lafayette.

788
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,940
I hit an 11 on a 50.

789
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:48,940
Okay. Yeah, I mean, you reckon if you get up onto the stage, you can probably maybe stage dive onto the flying clusterfuck that's going around you.

790
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:49,940
Yes!

791
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:51,940
Hell yeah, that's what I want to do.

792
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:53,940
Right as the breakdown starts.

793
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:57,940
This is some jingle all the way shit and I am here for it.

794
00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:08,940
Could I attempt a biology roll against this creature to find any weak spots? It's a science I have. Science biology.

795
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:15,940
I think because this thing does not follow terrestrial biology, you could make a Cthulhu Mythos roll.

796
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:24,940
Yeah, I don't have anything good there. I guess I'll continue trying to fly against a pilot against it.

797
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:28,940
Yeah, I mean, you can certainly see Harvey getting ready to join in the fray.

798
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:31,940
Yeah, so I'll just try to steer things towards him.

799
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:38,940
Okay. Yeah, then give me a policy roll. This would be a great time to roll a double zero.

800
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:42,940
67.

801
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:43,940
Damn.

802
00:39:43,940 --> 00:40:08,940
The good news is that you are heading roughly in the direction where Harvey is. The bad news is, I mean, initially they were flying overhead, but now Lafayette seems to have lost control of this and they've ducked down a bit and you realize that now both he and the creature are cannonballing towards you, Harvey, at speed.

803
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:14,940
I mean, you have a choice about what to do here. You've got maybe half a second before they hit you like a wrecking ball.

804
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:18,940
I want to try and tank the hit and grab onto him to pull him down to the ground.

805
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:19,940
Okay.

806
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:26,940
Yeah, you can make a fighting brawl roll here, and if you fail, this could hurt really badly.

807
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:33,940
Oh, no.

808
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:39,940
I was so fucking excited because I have an 80 in fighting brawl, but I rolled a 98.

809
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:40,940
Oh.

810
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:44,940
I mean, it's not a fumble. You could spend 18 points of luck and make that a success.

811
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:46,940
Oh, hell yeah, that's what I'll do.

812
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:48,940
Yeah.

813
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:49,940
What does that leave you with?

814
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:50,940
What's 59 minus 18?

815
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:51,940
41.

816
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:58,940
You're about to miss, but then you slip on, like, a trumpeter's blood and get a direct hit.

817
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:00,940
Trumpeter's blood.

818
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:02,940
That fucking clarinet is dead.

819
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:10,940
Okay, so you're grabbing hold of this thing as it is barreling towards you.

820
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:16,940
Am I strong enough? Does that roll help me pull them and, like, pull them, or do I get pulled along with them?

821
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:21,940
At the moment, yeah, you're probably getting pulled along with them.

822
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:33,940
So, yeah, I'm imagining it now as the two of you holding on to this creature being piloted by Lafayette's jetpack.

823
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:43,940
Harvey may be holding on to the undercarriage of this creature, and, yeah, the creature is pretty nonplussed by all of this.

824
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:48,940
And I think it probably wants to get Harvey off it at this stage.

825
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:56,940
It's basically got to bring up one of its pincers and try to gut you with it. What are you doing when it does this?

826
00:41:57,940 --> 00:42:03,940
Harvey wants to hit this thing in the squishy part of its head that we've seen pulsating. He wants to try and hit it there.

827
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:06,940
So whatever maneuver I can make to do that.

828
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:10,940
That's just a straight fighting brawl roll. Cool.

829
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:17,940
I'm going to throw up. It's an 85 on an 80.

830
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:19,940
Do you have five luck?

831
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:20,940
I do have five luck.

832
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:27,940
But you'd need to get a hard success, because I got an ordinary success on its attack versus you, and you're fighting back here.

833
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:32,940
So, yeah, you'd need to have a result of 40 here.

834
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:33,940
Ouch!

835
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:35,940
Yeah, that's not happening.

836
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:37,940
Would I roll an 85?

837
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:39,940
45 luck?

838
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:40,940
I've got 41.

839
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:47,940
On the price side, it's obviously a bit...

840
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:55,940
Oh, oh, wait! Hang on. One of my special talents is called Rapid Attack, and I can spend 10 luck to gain an extra melee attack.

841
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:56,940
Yeah.

842
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:58,940
Go for it. Go for it.

843
00:42:58,940 --> 00:42:59,940
Awesome.

844
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:06,940
But you can spend luck on this one.

845
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:08,940
Okay, yeah. That's an 81.

846
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:12,940
This is a follow-up attack, which I'll deal with in a moment.

847
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:18,940
But on your first attack there, you did take three damage as it sunk its claws into you.

848
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:24,940
But then you're punching it right back. It's still trying to gut you, so it's fighting back.

849
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:27,940
So it needs a hard success here.

850
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:30,940
And it's only got an ordinary one, so this time you are hurting it.

851
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:31,940
Nice!

852
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:32,940
Hell yeah!

853
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:34,940
So give me a damage roll on that.

854
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:36,940
That would be a d3 plus your damage bonus.

855
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:38,940
d3, you're just half a d6, is that how you do it?

856
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:39,940
Yeah.

857
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:43,940
That's a 2, but my damage bonus is a d6.

858
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:44,940
Ah, that's good.

859
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:45,940
That's a 5.

860
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:46,940
So 7.

861
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:47,940
7.

862
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:51,940
Okay, I better make a con roll for it.

863
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:58,940
You punch it in the squidgy part of its head, and yeah, it goes limp.

864
00:43:58,940 --> 00:43:59,940
Oh, hell yeah.

865
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:00,940
Oh.

866
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:03,940
Well done, Avi.

867
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:08,940
While this is going on, the other two had both of you over with all the equipment?

868
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:11,940
Yeah, I was over with Dark.

869
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:17,940
And Reverend Nye has come over as well, and he looks out the window at this stage,

870
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:24,940
and through the snow sees just the burning remains of the tower out there.

871
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:31,940
And he just stops for a moment, staring at this thing.

872
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:38,940
There was the heat haze of anger around him before, but it seems to have gone up a few hundred degrees.

873
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:43,940
And you can just feel the stage shaking underneath him.

874
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:45,940
Did you need that?

875
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:52,940
What happened to the tower?

876
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:55,940
Oh, yeah, that's crazy.

877
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:57,940
No one knows who could have done this.

878
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:02,940
We're all looking for who's burned down the tower.

879
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:06,940
It must be those monsters that did it.

880
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:09,940
Do you want to give me a fast talk roll like your life depends on it?

881
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:11,940
Yeah.

882
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:17,940
I got a 64, but I have a 60, so I'm going to spend 4 luck and pass.

883
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:18,940
Okay.

884
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:23,940
And so there is a brief moment of hesitation.

885
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:32,940
And the temperature drops again by a few degrees, and he looks around and says,

886
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:38,940
I will find out who is responsible for this and I will destroy them.

887
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:42,940
Yeah.

888
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:44,940
Yeah. Would you like help?

889
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:48,940
No, he says, and turns and storms off the stage.

890
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:50,940
Wait, how does this thing work?

891
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:52,940
He ignores you and walks off.

892
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:55,940
How does this thing work?

893
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:58,940
Can I try to find an on button?

894
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:00,940
Luke, it doesn't anymore.

895
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:02,940
Oh, yeah, because of the tower.

896
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:06,940
Because literally the stuff you did, you were a part of it.

897
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:08,940
We smashed it up real good.

898
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:16,940
So while the Reverend Nye storms off the stage, I mean, he almost casually flicks his hand up

899
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:20,940
and another one of these things spirals and bounces off the ground.

900
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:23,940
This is one that's holding a camera type thing.

901
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:30,940
And as it bounces off the ground, this huge arc of electricity comes off it and shoots

902
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:32,940
over in your direction.

903
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:35,940
Can I have a group luck roll?

904
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:38,940
Whoever's got the lowest luck out of the four of you?

905
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:39,940
I have 4.

906
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:44,940
34.

907
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:45,940
Damn.

908
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:47,940
OK.

909
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:51,940
And with that, the arc of electricity hits the console.

910
00:46:55,940 --> 00:47:00,940
And all of a sudden, there are explosions and sparks coming off it.

911
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:03,940
There's electricity now.

912
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:08,940
I mean, not just the arc of electricity, but the electricity within the console is sparking

913
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:10,940
your way now as well.

914
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:16,940
Just all this, you can feel your hair standing on end.

915
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:20,940
Yeah, the air itself seems to be electrified.

916
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:22,940
What are you doing?

917
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:27,940
Is that, did the camera thing, it's like dropped by the bug guy, right?

918
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:28,940
It is.

919
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:32,940
And yeah, it's basically just spinning around on the ground, sending out random sparks of

920
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:34,940
energy now.

921
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:35,940
Oh, OK.

922
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:37,940
I was going to grab it, but I don't think I'm going to grab it.

923
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:40,940
Well, I'm going to run after it and try to grab it.

924
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:41,940
OK.

925
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:44,940
And I'm going to go try to work this machine.

926
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:49,940
Yeah, my goal is to grab it and then direct it at the machine to give it even more juice.

927
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:54,940
And I'm going to be trying to press buttons that look like they do stuff.

928
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:59,940
And I'm well educated, so maybe I read about it in a book.

929
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:04,940
This new invention that it was just revealed.

930
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:05,940
Yeah.

931
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:08,940
Yeah, this hasn't quite made it into the books yet.

932
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:10,940
OK, fuck.

933
00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:11,940
Right.

934
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:12,940
Sorry.

935
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:16,940
OK, so you're trying to get the machine working.

936
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:22,940
What's Lafayette doing now that the creature that you're flying around with seems to have

937
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:23,940
stopped fighting?

938
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:28,940
Well, if it stopped grappling me, I'm going to stop grappling it and try to bring Harvey

939
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:32,940
and I to a safe stop and we just kind of ditch the corpse, maybe try to drop it on another

940
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:33,940
one of these things.

941
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:34,940
OK.

942
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:35,940
Yeah.

943
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:36,940
Yeah.

944
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:37,940
You can do that easily enough.

945
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:40,940
You are in a target rich environment.

946
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:45,940
So, yeah, we bought one of the other ones with this thing's corpse and it's pretty funny

947
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:48,940
and we share a little chuckle about that.

948
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:54,940
And and then, yeah, I see them like futzing with this machine, which now seems to be on

949
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:56,940
fire and sparking with electricity.

950
00:48:56,940 --> 00:48:57,940
Yeah.

951
00:48:57,940 --> 00:49:03,940
Lafayette's eyes just get super wide and he's like, come, Harvey, we need it right away.

952
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:12,940
He lands right next to the machine and kind of pushes checkers out of the way and he starts

953
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:15,940
going away at it using computer use.

954
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:18,940
This would be electrical repair.

955
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:21,940
Well, then he uses electrical repair.

956
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:22,940
Yeah.

957
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:23,940
OK.

958
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:27,940
Before we do that, let's just deal with, was it Mr.

959
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:34,940
Soul who was going off to try to grab the electrical gun that was misfiring?

960
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:39,940
Yeah, doing a real hopscotch situation, trying to avoid the electrical bolts flying off this

961
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:40,940
thing.

962
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:46,940
OK, then give me a DODGE roll to see what you can get to it without getting shot in

963
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:48,940
the process.

964
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:50,940
54 on a 30.

965
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:52,940
So I'm going to spend 24 LUCK.

966
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:53,940
Oh, nice.

967
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:54,940
To succeed.

968
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:55,940
OK.

969
00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:57,940
So I'm going to go from 39 down to 15.

970
00:49:57,940 --> 00:49:58,940
Oh, OK.

971
00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:00,940
That's what Scott likes to hear.

972
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:06,940
So, yeah, you've managed to leap over this arc of electricity just as he was about to

973
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:10,940
take your legs off and grab hold of this device.

974
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:16,940
It looks like, yes, it does have controls on it that are supposed to determine when

975
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:17,940
it discharges.

976
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:20,940
But on the other hand, this thing is very definitely damaged.

977
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:22,940
It's just shooting randomly.

978
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:29,940
Knowing that it's randomly shooting, I'm just focusing on hefting it, you know, and

979
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:35,940
making sure that it is facing not at anyone who's working on the machine, but basically

980
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:40,940
like at a wall until I can run over to the machine close enough to direct it into the

981
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:44,940
machine and not at any of my new friends who are over there.

982
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:45,940
OK, yeah.

983
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:47,940
Yeah, you can do that.

984
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:50,940
Yeah, I don't see any reason for a roll.

985
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:56,940
So you can just do that for a bit while the others try to get to grips with the malfunctioning

986
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:57,940
machine.

987
00:50:57,940 --> 00:51:02,940
Now, just as Lafayette is getting to grips with it and trying to work out how to fix

988
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:03,940
this.

989
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:06,940
I mean, first of all, yeah, you can make that electrical repair roll to see whether you

990
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:08,940
can see how to fix this.

991
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:13,940
Twelve, which is, I believe, an extreme success.

992
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:14,940
OK.

993
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:16,940
So, yeah, I mean, you can see.

994
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:23,940
I mean, if you can just get inside the works and disconnect that red wire over there,

995
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:28,940
then you can at least stop any further damage or at least you can probably limit any

996
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:31,940
further damage while it's on fire.

997
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:36,940
I mean, it's going to be difficult saving the machine because of the fire, but that's

998
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:37,940
a separate problem.

999
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:44,940
But the problem is that as you reach in to do that, this shockwave of energy comes off

1000
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:51,940
the machine and all of a sudden it's like the room gets turned upside down.

1001
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:55,940
Oh, we could do cocaine off the ceiling.

1002
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:59,940
His final trick was perfecting the anti-graviton.

1003
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:00,940
Yeah.

1004
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:01,940
Yeah.

1005
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:06,940
I mean, as a mad scientist, yeah, clearly that's what's come to mind.

1006
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:07,940
Yes.

1007
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:12,940
This has managed to reverse the graviton pulse or some shit like that.

1008
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:13,940
Yeah.

1009
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:16,940
All of a sudden you are falling towards the ceiling fast.

1010
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:17,940
Wow.

1011
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:18,940
Wow.

1012
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:21,940
So it was like yours, but cooler.

1013
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:26,940
I wouldn't say that.

1014
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:32,940
What I'd like off all four of you is a jump roll just to see whether you can land on the

1015
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:34,940
ceiling without getting hurt.

1016
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:37,940
Ouchie.

1017
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:38,940
Oh, wait.

1018
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:41,940
I pass a 10 on a 20.

1019
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:43,940
An 0-1 on a 20.

1020
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:44,940
He got an 0-1.

1021
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:45,940
Oh, my God.

1022
00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:46,940
Bloody hell.

1023
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:47,940
Yeah.

1024
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:50,940
I mean, you were born to walk on ceilings.

1025
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:51,940
Yes.

1026
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:54,940
I failed a 67 on a 20.

1027
00:52:54,940 --> 00:53:01,940
I mean, for a start, you are going to take a big one hit point of damage as you land

1028
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:03,940
awkwardly on the ceiling.

1029
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:08,940
But I would also like a luck roll off Lafayette.

1030
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:10,940
Oh, 36.

1031
00:53:10,940 --> 00:53:12,940
Oh, 36 on a 36.

1032
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:13,940
Oh, baby.

1033
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,940
The whole day.

1034
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:20,940
So, yes, you managed to avoid damaging your jet pack in the process.

1035
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:24,940
Thank God, Jetty.

1036
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:25,940
Wow.

1037
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:30,940
And, sorry, Mr. Soul failed as well, did he?

1038
00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:31,940
Yeah.

1039
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:34,940
I could spend 10 luck, but I only have 15.

1040
00:53:34,940 --> 00:53:36,940
Yeah, you take five hit points of damage.

1041
00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:39,940
You land far more heavily on the ceiling.

1042
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:42,940
And so this is quite a high ceilinged room.

1043
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:50,940
So you are now 20 feet at least away from the burning machine that is right above you.

1044
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:52,940
I mean, it's maddening.

1045
00:53:52,940 --> 00:54:02,940
You know which cable you could pull just to try to deactivate this, but it's way up there.

1046
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:08,940
However, will you get to it?

1047
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:16,940
Well, that might be a problem, Scott, for someone who doesn't have a jet pack.

1048
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:21,940
One, two, three, take away the compliment because you look so fine that I really want to make you mine.

1049
00:54:21,940 --> 00:54:22,940
Okay, yeah.

1050
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:27,940
So he jet packs up to there or gives it a go anyway.

1051
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:34,940
I don't think I actually want a pilot role for this because you are basically just flying up a few feet.

1052
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:39,940
It's not like you're being attacked at this stage, and it's not like you're fighting strong winds.

1053
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:43,940
This is fairly basic stuff, so I don't think you need a role for this.

1054
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:47,940
He nimbly maneuvers to the machine in his kick-ass jet pack.

1055
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:53,940
Yeah, I mean, you've seen the wires that you can just rearrange to bypass the damage circuits.

1056
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:55,940
What is your goal here?

1057
00:54:55,940 --> 00:55:02,940
Are you trying to restore this part of the machine to functionality, or are you trying to disable it?

1058
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:08,940
I think I'm trying to disable it, but what can I gleam of this machine's function from messing around in its innards?

1059
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:11,940
Give me an engineering role to understand it.

1060
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:13,940
96 on a 90.

1061
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:18,940
No, I'll spend six luck.

1062
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:19,940
I'll spend six luck.

1063
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:27,940
And so, yeah, looking at this, you're fairly certain that it's doing something absolutely amazing.

1064
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:32,940
Something that an idiot like Morden should never have been able to figure out how to do.

1065
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:43,940
It doesn't have a power source per se, that it seems to be somehow pulling ambient energy out of just the fabric of reality itself.

1066
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:48,940
Whoa. Holy shit.

1067
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:52,940
Simply to harvest energy or to power itself for some other end?

1068
00:55:52,940 --> 00:56:04,940
It does seem to be what you thought, that it seems to be a device that can broadcast electricity or at least transmit electricity through the air.

1069
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:09,940
Give me an intelligence role as well, just to see whether you can work out something else there.

1070
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:14,940
A pass, 64 on a 75.

1071
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:26,940
Yeah, I mean, the other thing that might occur to you is this is also a bit similar to some of Tesla's weirder designs for death rays.

1072
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:30,940
Can I tell, so is this thing like spitting out energy right now?

1073
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:32,940
I mean, it isn't activated at the moment.

1074
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:38,940
You've managed to restore functionality, so you could switch it all on if you wanted to.

1075
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:40,940
Can I tell where the energy would come out?

1076
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:41,940
Through the aerial.

1077
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:47,940
Well, Harvey, we might be able to repurpose this. I shot this down, I guess, to the ceiling below.

1078
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:53,940
Harvey, we might be able to repurpose this thing as, well, some sort of death ray.

1079
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:57,940
But I'll need you up on the aerial, manning it like a turret gun.

1080
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:05,940
Is the way that the ceiling, now that we're on the ceiling, do I have easier access to it now?

1081
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:07,940
Because it was above the eaves of the window, right?

1082
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:14,940
Yeah, you'd need to clamber down, or rather, clamber up to the window, up from your perspective.

1083
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:18,940
So, yeah, you could jump up and pull yourself up to the window.

1084
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:19,940
I want to try to do that, yeah.

1085
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:28,940
There is this small matter of what happens when you get outside, whether what's happening with gravity is limited to this room or whether you might risk falling off into the sky.

1086
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:30,940
I'm real excited to find out.

1087
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:36,940
At the very least, his goal would be to grab onto the aerial outside there.

1088
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:37,940
Okay.

1089
00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:39,940
So if he does end up falling into the sky.

1090
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:45,940
I mean, you could smash your way through what's left of the window really easily. It's quite badly damaged already.

1091
00:57:45,940 --> 00:57:49,940
And then, yeah, if you want to try to grab hold of the aerial.

1092
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:57,940
Can I, before I do that, can I take the pocket square out of my tuxedo pocket and just throw it out the window and see where it goes?

1093
00:57:57,940 --> 00:57:58,940
Ooh!

1094
00:57:58,940 --> 00:57:59,940
Oh, yeah.

1095
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:00,940
Big brain!

1096
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:02,940
Give me a luck roll.

1097
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:03,940
Okay.

1098
00:58:06,940 --> 00:58:08,940
That's a fail, a 68 on a 30.

1099
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:12,940
Okay, it floats up into the sky, or falls up into the sky.

1100
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:16,940
Okay, with that knowledge, I'm going to more carefully grab onto the aerial.

1101
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:20,940
Okay, with that knowledge, I'm going to more carefully still continue with the plan.

1102
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:24,940
I want to be able to grab onto the antenna that's on the outside here.

1103
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:29,940
I mean, outside, you can see that the cars have disappeared outside.

1104
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:36,940
And you can just hear the despairing cries of a few people who've gone out the front door and have fallen up into the sky as well.

1105
00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:38,940
Holy shit!

1106
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:40,940
This is amazing!

1107
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:42,940
So cool!

1108
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:48,940
But you're clambering out carefully, holding onto the aerial.

1109
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:51,940
Are you trying to break it away from the ball?

1110
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:59,940
I mean, I'm doing what Lafayette told me to do, which was to try and use it and man it like a turret, but I don't know...

1111
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:01,940
Yeah, I mean, it's got a fixed mount on it.

1112
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:13,940
In order to have the freedom of movement to use it like that, you'd probably have to break it away from the ball and move it around or hold it.

1113
00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:15,940
You seem like you're built to do that.

1114
00:59:15,940 --> 00:59:20,940
Am I able to hold onto the building and the antenna at the same time so that if I do break it free?

1115
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:23,940
You could probably hook your legs around the window and hold on like that.

1116
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:28,940
That's what I want to do. And then I want to try and break the antenna free of the building.

1117
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:36,940
Then what I want is a combined strength and dex roll, so it's whichever one is lower out of the two that you're rolling against.

1118
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:39,940
Okay, I'm rolling on my dex, which is at a 50.

1119
00:59:41,940 --> 00:59:43,940
And I got an 0-5.

1120
00:59:43,940 --> 00:59:44,940
Oh yeah!

1121
00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:46,940
It's an extreme success.

1122
00:59:46,940 --> 00:59:53,940
Okay, so yeah, you do. You manage to break this thing off the wall and you are hanging there by your ankles.

1123
00:59:53,940 --> 01:00:03,940
Feeling like you're upside down, even though you're looking up into the sky, there are plenty of these buzzing things around you.

1124
01:00:03,940 --> 01:00:11,940
What's Lafayette doing at this stage? You can see that Harvey is hanging on outside the window now. You can hear the crunching.

1125
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:13,940
Once I broke it free, I'll yell in something like,

1126
01:00:13,940 --> 01:00:14,940
I got it, boss!

1127
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:21,940
Yeah, Lafayette is floating up by the machine and he's nervously watching Harvey do all this.

1128
01:00:21,940 --> 01:00:32,940
And he says, alright now Harvey, well if my calculations are correct, this should act as sort of a death ray.

1129
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:34,940
Here goes nothing!

1130
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:38,940
And he flips the switch and turns the thing on.

1131
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:43,940
So as this is happening, what is going on with our two cultists?

1132
01:00:44,940 --> 01:00:52,940
Checkers is just like, anytime one of those things flies near him, he's just like running away from it.

1133
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:57,940
But he's kind of just like not really sure what to do and just trying to stay safe.

1134
01:00:57,940 --> 01:01:00,940
Okay, and how about Mr. Soul?

1135
01:01:00,940 --> 01:01:10,940
Dark Soul is aiming this camera gun lightning bolt shooter action guy at the bugs now that are like still flying around.

1136
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:18,940
Yeah, this doesn't really fall under any weapon skill you might have. It's not a human weapon, so I'll give you the base chance, which is 20%.

1137
01:01:18,940 --> 01:01:19,940
Cool.

1138
01:01:22,940 --> 01:01:23,940
I rolled a 10.

1139
01:01:23,940 --> 01:01:25,940
Holy shit!

1140
01:01:25,940 --> 01:01:30,940
So yeah, you are just spraying electric death around this room.

1141
01:01:30,940 --> 01:01:38,940
I mean, every now and then when you set fire to a bit of wall or perhaps vaporize one of the serving staff.

1142
01:01:38,940 --> 01:01:45,940
But you are on the whole blasting away and killing more bugs than anything else.

1143
01:01:45,940 --> 01:01:51,940
I mean, it doesn't help that you can't choose when it fires. You're just pointing and moving it around and hoping.

1144
01:01:51,940 --> 01:01:53,940
Do you want to give me a luck roll?

1145
01:01:53,940 --> 01:01:58,940
He's just crying again. He's really confused on whether or not this is good.

1146
01:02:00,940 --> 01:02:01,940
25 on a 15.

1147
01:02:01,940 --> 01:02:07,940
As you're firing around, one of these stray bolts hits Reverend Eye.

1148
01:02:09,940 --> 01:02:16,940
He's in the process of just with one fist, smashing one of these insects into an absolute pulp.

1149
01:02:16,940 --> 01:02:25,940
And the bolt hits him almost immediately. His clothes are on fire, his hair is on fire, and he just turns around.

1150
01:02:26,940 --> 01:02:35,940
His face looks almost inhuman now with the black eyes and the twisted, contorted features.

1151
01:02:35,940 --> 01:02:39,940
And he almost seems to ignore the burning of his clothes.

1152
01:02:39,940 --> 01:02:46,940
And he marches across the ceiling towards you, his fists raised, murder in his black eyes.

1153
01:02:47,940 --> 01:02:48,940
What do you do?

1154
01:02:49,940 --> 01:02:55,940
I keep the camera trained on him, hoping for a shock to blast off soon.

1155
01:02:55,940 --> 01:02:57,940
As I'm crying, I just say,

1156
01:02:58,940 --> 01:03:05,940
I just don't think that you're going to believe that it was an accident and you're just too powerful.

1157
01:03:05,940 --> 01:03:12,940
And even though I could learn so much from you, sir, it's just hopefully gonna any second now blast off.

1158
01:03:13,940 --> 01:03:17,940
And he's getting closer and closer and the thing hasn't fired off yet. It hasn't fired off.

1159
01:03:17,940 --> 01:03:21,940
You just have to, please, sir, please.

1160
01:03:22,940 --> 01:03:29,940
And then just as he's about to catch up with you, just as he's about raising his fist ready to do to you what he's done to so many of these flying things,

1161
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:36,940
the gun fires off again and shoots into him and you can see it just blasts a hole through his chest.

1162
01:03:37,940 --> 01:03:38,940
And he slumps to the ceiling.

1163
01:03:42,940 --> 01:03:43,940
Fuck yeah.

1164
01:03:44,940 --> 01:03:46,940
Okay, that one was all me.

1165
01:03:46,940 --> 01:03:53,940
Checkers sees this happening and like fires a shot into the dead body.

1166
01:03:54,940 --> 01:03:57,940
Okay, yeah, that probably finishes the job off.

1167
01:03:57,940 --> 01:03:58,940
Friend.

1168
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:00,940
Master.

1169
01:04:00,940 --> 01:04:03,940
I think we're gonna be okay.

1170
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:11,940
I sure hope so. It's all up to him and I point it at Harvey.

1171
01:04:11,940 --> 01:04:12,940
Segue.

1172
01:04:16,940 --> 01:04:27,940
What's up, everybody? It's Zach. Just want to pop in here real quick to thank you all for listening to the series with Scott Dorward.

1173
01:04:27,940 --> 01:04:36,940
It's always such a pleasure to game with Scott and if you haven't checked it out, he also ran a Call of Cthulhu scenario he wrote called Bleak Prospect for us.

1174
01:04:36,940 --> 01:04:41,940
It takes place in a Hoover town and it is super spooky.

1175
01:04:41,940 --> 01:04:46,940
And if you've been enjoying pretending to be people, please consider supporting us on Patreon.

1177
01:04:50,940 --> 01:04:59,940
We play one-page RPGs, do Q&A sessions, go through session zeros and have a rip-roaringly good time while doing it.

1178
01:04:59,940 --> 01:05:03,940
And your financial support means so much to me personally.

1179
01:05:03,940 --> 01:05:08,940
I'm the producer, the editor, the social media person, the business boy, everything.

1180
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:17,940
And it's my favorite thing in the world, but I also work a full-time job and have a healthy marriage and I try to keep a decent social life.

1181
01:05:17,940 --> 01:05:20,940
I sleep sometimes.

1182
01:05:20,940 --> 01:05:28,940
Your support on Patreon allows me to continue to spend a dumb amount of time working on this show.

1183
01:05:28,940 --> 01:05:32,940
And I'm down to scale that up if you all are.

1184
01:05:32,940 --> 01:05:41,940
So, season two is fast approaching. I don't have a date set yet, but while we do take a short break on the main feed to get season two up and running,

1185
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:46,940
we're going to do a couple live streams for patrons at every level.

1186
01:05:46,940 --> 01:05:54,940
Yes, so we will have every single person who is a patron of pretending to be people on Patreon for the live stream, in the chat,

1187
01:05:54,940 --> 01:06:01,940
everybody going to get hyped for the new season alongside your monthly dose of the Den of Sin over there at patreon.com slash pretending pod.

1188
01:06:01,940 --> 01:06:10,940
So, if you don't already follow us on social media, now's the time to follow at pretending pod to not miss out on what's all happening,

1189
01:06:10,940 --> 01:06:13,940
because it's all happening, baby.

1190
01:06:21,940 --> 01:06:28,940
And with that, Lafayette flicks the switch and the death ray bursts into life.

1191
01:06:28,940 --> 01:06:31,940
Harvey was looking down the end of it to see if it was on.

1192
01:06:34,940 --> 01:06:37,940
I think it's totally Cicerad.

1193
01:06:39,940 --> 01:06:47,940
So, yeah, you can feel it sparking, bursting into life, and then this almighty arc of power just comes out.

1194
01:06:47,940 --> 01:06:57,940
It's only partly visible. It's less that you can see a bolt of light coming out of it and more that it seems to be setting the air around it on fire.

1195
01:06:57,940 --> 01:06:58,940
Holy shit.

1196
01:06:58,940 --> 01:07:04,940
And, you know, certainly wherever you point it, things seem to be exploding and catching into flames.

1197
01:07:04,940 --> 01:07:10,940
I'm aiming it as, I'm just kind of trying to get a feel for it, aiming at things outside the building that are flying around,

1198
01:07:10,940 --> 01:07:13,940
just trying to get my feel for the zapiness of it.

1199
01:07:13,940 --> 01:07:20,940
Yeah, I mean, it's pretty much a continuous beam, so if you're just swirling around, I mean, it is difficult to aim,

1200
01:07:20,940 --> 01:07:23,940
and, you know, these things are, you know, small and fast moving.

1201
01:07:23,940 --> 01:07:32,940
On the bright side, your view isn't obscured by snow anymore because the snow seems to be falling up rather than down, but...

1202
01:07:35,940 --> 01:07:41,940
Well, I'll tell you what, I'll give you a choice. If you've got a higher firearm skill than Dex, I'll let you use that instead.

1203
01:07:41,940 --> 01:07:44,940
I do have higher firearms for both handguns and rifles.

1204
01:07:44,940 --> 01:07:47,940
Okay. I say this comes under rifles.

1205
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:49,940
That's a seven.

1206
01:07:49,940 --> 01:07:50,940
Okay.

1207
01:07:51,940 --> 01:07:54,940
Wow, dude. Wow.

1208
01:07:54,940 --> 01:08:03,940
So, I think, yeah, I mean, you are against all the odds, you know, wielding this thing with alarming accuracy,

1209
01:08:03,940 --> 01:08:08,940
and, I mean, you're not necessarily shooting every one of these creatures out of the sky,

1210
01:08:08,940 --> 01:08:13,940
but you've certainly shot enough of them that the others are fucking right off.

1211
01:08:13,940 --> 01:08:15,940
They do not want anything to do with this.

1212
01:08:15,940 --> 01:08:16,940
Holy shit.

1213
01:08:17,940 --> 01:08:18,940
Fuck yeah.

1214
01:08:18,940 --> 01:08:19,940
Well done, Harvey.

1215
01:08:20,940 --> 01:08:21,940
Good shooting, chap.

1216
01:08:21,940 --> 01:08:23,940
I turn around and look at you guys.

1217
01:08:23,940 --> 01:08:25,940
Oh, thanks, guys. Oh, shit.

1218
01:08:25,940 --> 01:08:29,940
Fucking half the second story of the house just, like, slides off.

1219
01:08:29,940 --> 01:08:37,940
And it sounds like Mr. Soul and Checkers are looking over, joining in all this excitement.

1220
01:08:37,940 --> 01:08:41,940
You probably don't notice the sound behind you at first,

1221
01:08:42,940 --> 01:08:47,940
but there is this deep, ominous rumbling sound coming from behind you.

1222
01:08:51,940 --> 01:08:52,940
What is it?

1223
01:08:53,940 --> 01:09:01,940
And as you look around, you can see Reverend Nye's body is thrashing on the ground

1224
01:09:01,940 --> 01:09:08,940
and splitting open and something, something is coming out of it.

1225
01:09:08,940 --> 01:09:13,940
There is this huge, blackish, red tentacle reaching out, pushing up through the floor.

1226
01:09:15,940 --> 01:09:22,940
This huge claw and another huge claw reaching out as if it's lifting itself up through the ruined remains of a body

1227
01:09:22,940 --> 01:09:24,940
that is far too small to contain it.

1228
01:09:25,940 --> 01:09:26,940
Harvey, quick.

1229
01:09:26,940 --> 01:09:28,940
Direct your fire on the beast.

1230
01:09:28,940 --> 01:09:29,940
Can I have sanity?

1231
01:09:31,940 --> 01:09:33,940
That's a hard fail on that one.

1232
01:09:33,940 --> 01:09:34,940
Pass.

1233
01:09:34,940 --> 01:09:35,940
Pass.

1234
01:09:35,940 --> 01:09:36,940
Oh, my God.

1235
01:09:36,940 --> 01:09:37,940
A hundred.

1236
01:09:37,940 --> 01:09:38,940
No.

1237
01:09:38,940 --> 01:09:39,940
A hundred.

1238
01:09:39,940 --> 01:09:40,940
No.

1239
01:09:40,940 --> 01:09:42,940
You guys are so dead.

1240
01:09:42,940 --> 01:09:46,940
So Harvey takes the maximum sand loss on this because this is a fumble.

1241
01:09:46,940 --> 01:09:47,940
Fuck.

1242
01:09:47,940 --> 01:09:49,940
So you lose 100 points of sand.

1243
01:09:51,940 --> 01:09:52,940
What?

1244
01:09:55,940 --> 01:09:56,940
Oh, my God.

1245
01:09:56,940 --> 01:09:57,940
Was it a D100?

1246
01:09:57,940 --> 01:09:59,940
So that puts me down to 33.

1247
01:09:59,940 --> 01:10:00,940
No, I'm just kidding.

1248
01:10:00,940 --> 01:10:03,940
This is a D10 D100 sand loss.

1249
01:10:04,940 --> 01:10:12,940
So let's roll, then, for Mr. Soul, who also failed, didn't he?

1250
01:10:12,940 --> 01:10:13,940
Is that right?

1251
01:10:13,940 --> 01:10:14,940
Yeah, I failed.

1252
01:10:14,940 --> 01:10:15,940
Oh, no, no, no.

1253
01:10:15,940 --> 01:10:16,940
Sorry, I succeeded.

1254
01:10:16,940 --> 01:10:17,940
I failed.

1255
01:10:17,940 --> 01:10:19,940
So Checkers loses 87 points of sand.

1256
01:10:22,940 --> 01:10:23,940
That puts me at three.

1257
01:10:24,940 --> 01:10:26,940
Wait, Frugal, you still had 90?

1258
01:10:26,940 --> 01:10:27,940
Yep.

1259
01:10:30,940 --> 01:10:32,940
Oh, you're a shell of a man.

1260
01:10:33,940 --> 01:10:34,940
Oh, man.

1261
01:10:34,940 --> 01:10:39,940
Yeah, I mean, you are at least indefinitely insane, but yeah, bloody hell.

1262
01:10:39,940 --> 01:10:43,940
And Mr. Soul loses 10 points of sand.

1263
01:10:45,940 --> 01:10:49,940
And yeah, can I have an INTELLIGENCE roll to see whether you go into a bat of madness?

1264
01:10:49,940 --> 01:10:52,940
61 on a 50.

1265
01:10:52,940 --> 01:10:53,940
That is a fail.

1266
01:10:53,940 --> 01:10:56,940
OK, so you are not going into a bat of madness, at least.

1267
01:10:56,940 --> 01:10:57,940
So that's something.

1268
01:10:57,940 --> 01:11:00,940
And then that just leaves Lafayette.

1269
01:11:00,940 --> 01:11:03,940
Lafayette loses 9 points of sand.

1270
01:11:03,940 --> 01:11:06,940
How much has Lafayette lost in total?

1271
01:11:06,940 --> 01:11:07,940
10 total.

1272
01:11:07,940 --> 01:11:11,940
OK, and you've got more than 50 sand, haven't you?

1273
01:11:11,940 --> 01:11:12,940
Yes.

1274
01:11:12,940 --> 01:11:15,940
OK, so yeah, then give me an INTELLIGENCE roll.

1275
01:11:19,940 --> 01:11:20,940
7.

1276
01:11:23,940 --> 01:11:25,940
So you are having a bat of madness as well.

1277
01:11:25,940 --> 01:11:31,940
So basically, the only one of you who's not in a bat of madness at the moment is Mr. Soul.

1278
01:11:32,940 --> 01:11:45,940
What's even worse than that is that the person with the death ray hanging outside the window is on zero sand as this huge monster is filling up the room.

1279
01:11:45,940 --> 01:12:03,940
I guess I'll leave it down to you guys as to whether you want to play this out in detail or just perhaps cut to a little summary of what horrible things happened to you as a result of this series of rolls.

1280
01:12:03,940 --> 01:12:04,940
Let's hear the summary.

1281
01:12:04,940 --> 01:12:06,940
I'm down for the summary.

1282
01:12:06,940 --> 01:12:29,940
I mean, I think between the fact that you now have a monstrous avatar of Nyarlathotep in your midst who is personally pissed off with each and every one of you and hoist them into little bits, and you have a lunatic with a death ray outside just firing wildly, I cannot see this situation ending well for any of you.

1283
01:12:32,940 --> 01:12:34,940
Well, we've faced worse odds.

1284
01:12:36,940 --> 01:12:48,940
I think I'll leave it up to each of you, I think, to describe how horribly this ends for you.

1285
01:12:49,940 --> 01:12:52,940
So let's go round one by one.

1286
01:12:53,940 --> 01:12:56,940
How do you think this ends for Checkers?

1287
01:12:57,940 --> 01:13:15,940
Checkers sees this coming out of the ground and then just, he's lost it pretty much, but he looks up at Harvey and just sees nothing in his eyes and like realizes like, oh, we are totally fucked.

1288
01:13:16,940 --> 01:13:23,940
He goes to like just shoot himself to end it, but he doesn't have any bullets left, so he just kind of lays down.

1289
01:13:23,940 --> 01:13:29,940
Lays down on the ceiling, waiting for death.

1290
01:13:33,940 --> 01:13:39,940
And he just kind of tosses the pamphlets around him and he's like, maybe whoever finds me will take over.

1291
01:13:43,940 --> 01:13:45,940
And how about Lafayette?

1292
01:13:45,940 --> 01:13:48,940
He couldn't spend 30 luck to get out of this, could he?

1293
01:13:49,940 --> 01:13:50,940
Yeah.

1294
01:13:50,940 --> 01:13:51,940
Wait, how much luck do you have?

1295
01:13:51,940 --> 01:13:52,940
30.

1296
01:13:52,940 --> 01:13:53,940
Oh, shit.

1297
01:13:54,940 --> 01:14:05,940
If you have that much luck left, yeah, let's come back to your last then as potentially the last survivor of the massacre on the mount, as I'm sure the press will call it later.

1298
01:14:06,940 --> 01:14:09,940
Then, OK, how about Harvey?

1299
01:14:09,940 --> 01:14:16,940
I mean, Harvey obviously is permanently insane, but that shouldn't stop you narrating a little ending for him.

1300
01:14:16,940 --> 01:14:31,940
Well, I mean, the thing that sent him into insanity is the tentacles coming out of the floor and it startled him so bad that he fumbles with the death ray and it just goes bobbling all around and it's taken out things and people and stuff he's not meaning to aim at.

1301
01:14:31,940 --> 01:14:33,940
And he's still insane.

1302
01:14:33,940 --> 01:14:37,940
So once he gets back control of it, he's trying to point it at the tentacle thing.

1303
01:14:37,940 --> 01:14:43,940
But maybe one of those errant blasts hit the machine that was powering it on.

1304
01:14:43,940 --> 01:14:44,940
Oh, yeah.

1305
01:14:44,940 --> 01:14:47,940
So I've got no juice to shoot at this thing.

1306
01:14:47,940 --> 01:14:49,940
And it's seeing me as the biggest threat right now.

1307
01:14:49,940 --> 01:14:56,940
I assume a tentacle comes out and just grabs a hold of me and does what tentacle things in Cthulhu do.

1308
01:14:57,940 --> 01:15:01,940
I'm imagining your dying words are pew, pew, pew.

1309
01:15:07,940 --> 01:15:12,940
And how about Mr. Soul as the only sane person at the moment?

1310
01:15:13,940 --> 01:15:29,940
Yeah, Dark Soul lets off one more of these camera lightning bolts into this fucking enormous creature beast that is making its way into our dimension here and realizing that it does absolutely fuck all.

1311
01:15:29,940 --> 01:15:30,940
Oh, no, no, it does.

1312
01:15:30,940 --> 01:15:31,940
It doesn't do fuck all.

1313
01:15:31,940 --> 01:15:33,940
It doesn't do fuck all.

1314
01:15:33,940 --> 01:15:34,940
It makes it angry.

1315
01:15:35,940 --> 01:15:36,940
Ah, yeah.

1316
01:15:37,940 --> 01:15:44,940
So once I get its attention and make it upset, then I realize, like, oh, I'm fucked.

1317
01:15:44,940 --> 01:15:45,940
This is over.

1318
01:15:45,940 --> 01:15:50,940
And so he crouches down at the side of Checkers.

1319
01:15:51,940 --> 01:15:52,940
Psychic attack him.

1320
01:15:54,940 --> 01:15:56,940
I'll see what I can do, boss.

1321
01:15:57,940 --> 01:16:00,940
And he turns back and psychic attack, psychic attack, psychic attack.

1322
01:16:01,940 --> 01:16:08,940
And he is thrusting his mind directly into this fucking creature, which the rule book says you can't do.

1323
01:16:09,940 --> 01:16:13,940
You can do is I mean, you absolutely thrust your mind into it.

1324
01:16:14,940 --> 01:16:16,940
Just don't get your mind back again afterwards.

1325
01:16:17,940 --> 01:16:19,940
Your mind is now its chew toy.

1326
01:16:20,940 --> 01:16:22,940
That's even worse than your body.

1327
01:16:22,940 --> 01:16:32,940
And then, yeah, that just leaves Lafayette.

1328
01:16:32,940 --> 01:16:44,940
So how, once the dust and the screaming and the death and the fire and the madness end, how does Lafayette survive all this?

1329
01:16:45,940 --> 01:16:50,940
Well, I don't think it has ended by the time he's long gone.

1330
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:55,940
He sees all of his three companions for the evening just, like, meet horrible fates.

1331
01:16:56,940 --> 01:17:01,940
He's probably still floating by the controls when the machine gets, like, shot by Harvey.

1332
01:17:02,940 --> 01:17:09,940
And at that moment, he just, like, watches in horror as the beast reaches out a tentacle and consumes his man.

1333
01:17:10,940 --> 01:17:13,940
As he's watching the building just collapse down around him.

1334
01:17:14,940 --> 01:17:15,940
Or up.

1335
01:17:15,940 --> 01:17:17,940
Yeah, collapse up around him.

1336
01:17:18,940 --> 01:17:29,940
He just sees a hole, through some beams, and jetpacks out of there, spending his last luck to, you know, narrowly get by before the Indiana Jones door closes on him.

1337
01:17:30,940 --> 01:17:31,940
He jets away into the night.

1338
01:17:32,940 --> 01:17:39,940
And, you know, I think the device has been destroyed, so there's no way of undoing the gravitational reverse that it did.

1339
01:17:39,940 --> 01:17:50,940
And I ordinarily would ask you for a luck roll to see what the widespread effect of this is, but you don't have any luck.

1340
01:17:53,940 --> 01:18:03,940
So I think as Lafayette flies out over the dawn, over Vermont, you can just see this world that has been changed and reshaped.

1341
01:18:04,940 --> 01:18:05,940
Fucking cows and shit floating past me.

1342
01:18:05,940 --> 01:18:08,940
Everything that was loose has flown off into the sky.

1343
01:18:09,940 --> 01:18:10,940
You're gonna change the world.

1344
01:18:13,940 --> 01:18:14,940
You know?

1345
01:18:17,940 --> 01:18:19,940
And shall we leave it there?

1346
01:18:22,940 --> 01:18:25,940
As Lafayette's jetpack starts sputtering out of fuel.

1347
01:18:28,940 --> 01:18:29,940
That was incredible.

1348
01:18:30,940 --> 01:18:31,940
Wow!

1349
01:18:32,940 --> 01:18:34,940
Thank you so much, Scott. That was amazing.

1350
01:18:36,940 --> 01:18:39,940
Has anybody ever tried to use the death ray as a gun?

1351
01:18:40,940 --> 01:18:43,940
One group has, but they weren't very successful.

1352
01:18:44,940 --> 01:18:48,940
Certainly nowhere near as successful as Harvey was. That was fucking amazing.

1353
01:18:53,940 --> 01:18:54,940
Wow.

1354
01:18:55,940 --> 01:18:56,940
That was great.

1355
01:18:57,940 --> 01:19:02,940
Can I ask a question? If we hadn't fucked up the tower, what was the plan? That the beam would hit that tower and then do what?

1356
01:19:02,940 --> 01:19:14,940
Yeah. So the basic plan was that Cicero had built this device, not because he was a decent inventor. He was a really shit inventor, as you word out.

1357
01:19:15,940 --> 01:19:28,940
But he'd found this injured amigo at some stage and started, first of all, extorting it to create stuff for him, and then realized that he could just extract its cranial fluid, inject it into himself, and it would boost his own intelligence.

1358
01:19:29,940 --> 01:19:31,940
So he started coming up with weird shit like that.

1359
01:19:32,940 --> 01:19:39,940
So his plan was just simply to create a device to succeed where Tesla didn't, and wirelessly transmit electricity.

1360
01:19:40,940 --> 01:19:57,940
The tower was basically just a big lighthouse, and the idea was that he'd flick a switch and demonstrate to everyone that there weren't any power sources up in the tower, and yet that light would suddenly beam with an incredibly bright wattage.

1361
01:19:58,940 --> 01:20:00,940
But obviously it all went a bit wrong.

1362
01:20:00,940 --> 01:20:05,940
I was going to say, that's pretty mundane. That's pretty dope. That's pretty standard cool.

1363
01:20:06,940 --> 01:20:20,940
Yeah. I mean, unbeknownst to him, Nyarlathotep had taken an interest in his work and was encouraging him along, because with World War II and the offing, he decided that what would really help World War II would be if people had death rays.

1364
01:20:21,940 --> 01:20:31,940
And so he was really keen on getting Cicero's invention out there into the world, just in time to turn the battlefields into killing fields.

1365
01:20:32,940 --> 01:20:38,940
You kind of wrecked all that, but you did wipe out most of humanity, so you win some, you lose some.

1366
01:20:39,940 --> 01:20:40,940
Yeah, anyone who wasn't in a basement.

1367
01:20:41,940 --> 01:20:44,940
What was the deal with the preacher, the Reverend?

1368
01:20:44,940 --> 01:20:58,940
The Reverend was an avatar of Nyarlathotep. He was basically a human avatar of Nyarlathotep, who was there just, I mean, he was the one who was going around mind-controlling people just to try to make sure that they got the good word out to the world and bigged up Cicero's invention.

1369
01:20:59,940 --> 01:21:00,940
Gotcha. Incredible.

1370
01:21:01,940 --> 01:21:01,940


1371
01:21:02,940 --> 01:21:03,940
Absolutely incredible.

1372
01:21:04,940 --> 01:21:05,940
Scott, you knocked it out of the park again for us.

1373
01:21:06,940 --> 01:21:07,940
Thank you so much, dude.

1374
01:21:08,940 --> 01:21:08,940


1375
01:21:09,940 --> 01:21:13,940
I've been looking forward to this for a while now, and it lived up to it. I've had so much fun.

1376
01:21:14,940 --> 01:21:16,940
I'm glad you enjoyed it. I had an absolute blast running it.

1377
01:21:17,940 --> 01:21:18,940
Yeah.

1378
01:21:19,940 --> 01:21:21,940
And yes, I did laugh.

1379
01:21:23,940 --> 01:21:31,940
For those of you who have yet to check out Scott's other stuff, you can find The Good Friends of Jackson Elias everywhere that you find podcasts.

1380
01:21:31,940 --> 01:21:44,940
It is an incredible podcast about horror gaming, role-playing, and horror gaming in general, and horror gaming in general.

1381
01:21:45,940 --> 01:21:46,940
Yeah, that too.

1382
01:21:47,940 --> 01:21:48,940
Did I get that?

1383
01:21:49,940 --> 01:21:50,940
Concise to the point.

1384
01:21:51,940 --> 01:21:55,940
We also talk about horror films and weird fiction, but yeah, it's mostly horror gaming.

1385
01:21:56,940 --> 01:22:00,940
It's a solid podcast. It's one of my go-to weeklies. I'm a huge fan, so check that out.

1386
01:22:01,940 --> 01:22:02,940
Thank you.

1387
01:22:03,940 --> 01:22:07,940
And you can go back if you haven't listened to it already, The Bleak Prospect that you ran for us a year and a half, two years ago.

1388
01:22:08,940 --> 01:22:11,940
Yeah, it is extremely good. That's why you're the only person we've brought back.

1389
01:22:14,940 --> 01:22:15,940
Eat it, David Winters.

1390
01:22:20,940 --> 01:22:22,940
I shall rub that in everyone else's faces.

1391
01:22:23,940 --> 01:22:24,940
There you go.

1392
01:22:25,940 --> 01:22:31,940
Well, I look forward to hopefully playing with you on the TV again, sir.

1393
01:22:32,940 --> 01:22:35,940
Oh, marvelous. Oh God, you were going to take a picture of that, weren't you?

1394
01:22:36,940 --> 01:22:37,940
Yes, we need to take a group picture now.

1395
01:22:38,940 --> 01:22:39,940
Oh, fuck.

1396
01:22:55,940 --> 01:23:01,940
I didn't know that the wind could sew

1397
01:23:02,940 --> 01:23:07,940
The tissue and faggot bone

1398
01:23:09,940 --> 01:23:15,940
You were hollow and you spoke to me

1399
01:23:17,940 --> 01:23:22,940
Hollow and you said

1400
01:23:24,940 --> 01:23:30,940
I thought you might be starving

1401
01:23:31,940 --> 01:23:38,940
So I gave you everything

1402
01:23:42,940 --> 01:23:46,940
Thorns and rocks and devil's claw

1403
01:23:47,940 --> 01:23:51,940
Briers and dried red clay

1404
01:23:51,940 --> 01:23:55,940
Crocus blossoms in February

1405
01:23:56,940 --> 01:24:00,940
And I live in May

1406
01:24:01,940 --> 01:24:05,940
Time between a mother's fingers

1407
01:24:06,940 --> 01:24:09,940
And spit off of a bridge

1408
01:24:11,940 --> 01:24:14,940
Restless legs at 3 p.m.

1409
01:24:15,940 --> 01:24:18,940
While waiting for a fix

1410
01:24:21,940 --> 01:24:25,940
And I live in May

1411
01:24:26,940 --> 01:24:30,940
Time between a mother's fingers

1412
01:24:31,940 --> 01:24:35,940
And spit off of a bridge

1413
01:24:36,940 --> 01:24:40,940
Restless legs at 3 p.m.

1414
01:24:41,940 --> 01:24:46,940
While waiting for a fix

1415
01:24:46,940 --> 01:24:50,940
And I live in May

1416
01:24:51,940 --> 01:24:56,940
Time between a mother's fingers

1417
01:24:59,940 --> 01:25:06,940
So come back here and see what's left of me

1418
01:25:09,940 --> 01:25:15,940
Is this the wholesome girl you left in Missouri?

1419
01:25:17,940 --> 01:25:22,940
My voice is nothing now

1420
01:25:23,940 --> 01:25:27,940
But the howl of the wind

1421
01:25:28,940 --> 01:25:31,940
Come closer dear in my teeth

1422
01:25:32,940 --> 01:25:35,940
Better in my jaw

1423
01:25:37,940 --> 01:25:44,940
Come closer dear in my teeth

1424
01:25:44,940 --> 01:25:49,940
Better in my jaw
