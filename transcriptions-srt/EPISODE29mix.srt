00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,380
Peace and blessings to all of our listeners here on KITI City Radio, where the only thing

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:08,100
softer than my chin is the K in our name.

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:13,300
I'm your host, Steve N. Smith, filling in for Gary Fazier for the foreseeable future.

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:19,340
Let us slide right into what is, personally, to me, my favorite segment, in my opinion,

5
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:20,500
within the show.

6
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:25,180
It's time for, Hey There Steve, where listeners here in the city can send in thoughts and

7
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:30,540
opinions to be read by me, your host, now and forever, Steve N. Smith.

8
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:32,520
Steve N. Smith, your host.

9
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,380
This listener has been all over the internet advocating for pretending to be people, a

10
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:38,700
show that is near and dear to my heart.

11
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,140

Wow, yes, thank you for all of that.

26
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,840
You too could write up something to be read on.

27
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:06,120

32
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:28,120
ship of itunes or tell a friend about the show or self pretend to cow the snow.

33
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,100
More bells attend than bow and go.

34
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:35,520
I am pleased as punch and I have a hunch you will stop, drop, and roll for House Fire by

35
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,740
Someone Still Loves You, Boris Yeltsin.

36
00:02:48,780 --> 00:03:18,660
Hi, my little friend is full of

37
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:21,840
peanuts and jelly.

38
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:35,140
They always are making good snack taste period.

39
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,140
I think we nailed it.

40
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,140
Question mark?

41
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:40,140
All right, welcome to pretending to be people.

42
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:43,780
I feel bad now.

43
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:46,900
Yeah, well, that's Justin.

44
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:47,900
Hi.

45
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:51,180
Yeah, Justin's here for this episode.

46
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,180
We've got Thomas here as well.

47
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,180
Hi.

48
00:03:54,180 --> 00:04:00,820
And things are a bit off the rails here, part of this show, so we're going to see what happens.

49
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:04,800
Okay, so should we talk about the fact that this is the first time we've recorded an actual

50
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,620
playing session in nearly six months?

51
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,180
I guess we should.

52
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:14,020
It's been nearly six months since we've recorded an actual session of us playing.

53
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:19,460
Yeah, the last thing that happened to us was the events of episode 28, I think, or

54
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,460
27?

55
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,260
27, 28 was the Q&A.

56
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,780
Gotcha, yeah.

57
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:29,020
So we haven't recorded anything since late last year, so we're getting back into it.

58
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,500
We're getting back in the swing of things.

59
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,660
This is the first time you'll hear an episode that we recorded recently.

60
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:34,660
Yeah, so hopefully our-

61
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:37,460
It's all the Red Dead Redemption talk in the last episode.

62
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:41,220
Yeah, hopefully our references are more up to date from here on out.

63
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,540
But we're excited to be back.

64
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:45,920
The response to the podcast so far has been overwhelming and flattering.

65
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,340
It's made our knees weak.

66
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,340
Yeah.

67
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,940
Justin, has it made your knees weak?

68
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:50,940
Maybe.

69
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:51,940
Maybe.

70
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,500
Well, it's made my knees weak, Zach.

71
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,820
No ifs, ands, or maybes about it.

72
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:00,380
Maybe and, all right.

73
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:01,380
No but.

74
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,980
I think we should hop right in.

75
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:10,500
I think we're at a pretty intense situation right now, so let's dive into it.

76
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,340
John Lee Pettymore IV.

77
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:17,820
This massive room reeks of blood and piss and other bodily fluids.

78
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:22,780
The pervasive music as well as the thunderous jeering and overall debaucherous crowd noises

79
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:27,200
have died off, leaving only silence in this cavernous chamber.

80
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,740
Looking down, you see the limp, lifeless body of Keith Vigna.

81
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:36,540
His jaw is broken off and hanging loosely below a shattered cheekbone that has allowed

82
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:42,900
one of his eyes to dangle gently off the side of his expressionless face, almost reaching

83
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,780
the blood-soaked concrete floor.

84
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:54,780
Yeah, so Pettymore stifles some vomit when he sees that, and he takes a moment and he

85
00:05:54,780 --> 00:06:01,660
says, Keith, I know we had our differences, but you didn't deserve to have your jaw ripped

86
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:06,900
off in your eye, took out, no matter what you did to my smokies.

87
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:12,020
And I close his remaining eye and move on.

88
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:17,740
Across the room, you see an inert Clark Bishop slumped halfway out of his broken metal cage.

89
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:23,380
One of the bars seems to have snapped off into Clark's sternum, and it's a real chest-specific

90
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:28,400
Phineas Gage situation, what with the bar going in one side and clear out the other.

91
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:33,400
The bar is kind of propping up Clark's corpse, which is staring across the room at you, cold

92
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,400
and unblinking.

93
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:39,760
Oh Clark, you were the only one of us worth a damn.

94
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,800
I'm sorry, friend.

95
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:46,320
The crowd that filled this room moments before has rushed out the only exit, the double doors

96
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:52,500
on the same wall as the bar, but you see the last two bloodthirsty patrons trying to stealthily

97
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:56,480
exit the room by creeping together along the wall.

98
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:00,000
Justin, what does your fellow look like?

99
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:07,000
In my mind, I have weird, slightly overweight, but just the belly, maybe has a little vest,

100
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,320
like the penguin suit kind of thing going on.

101
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,320
Absolutely.

102
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,760
And what did you say, like an ascot?

103
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,120
Is that like the necktie thing?

104
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,120
Ascot seems good, yeah.

105
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,840
Yeah, like an ascot and a really ill-fitting suit that's like, everything's just a little

106
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,840
too tight.

107
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,840
It looks very uncomfortable.

108
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,320
Does it fit poorly or does it fit ill?

109
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,320
Both.

110
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,000
He, yeah, like too tight of pants.

111
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,360
Oh, that's an ill-fitting suit, dude.

112
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,360
Bro.

113
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,360
Sick.

114
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,360
Fucking sick ass penguin suit.

115
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,840
That's too tight.

116
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:47,140
And next to that guy is a man dressed very, very similarly who looks very similar, but

117
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:50,520
the colors that he's wearing are inverted of yours.

118
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,520
That's the way to do it.

119
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,520
That's how twins do it.

120
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,520
That's how twins do it.

121
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:58,960
And we both have blood just pouring down our mouths onto our cheeks.

122
00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,960
Delicious.

123
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:05,000
We're like looking at it as we're like sliding around the wall, like trying to get away,

124
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,320
trying to just sneak past this one standing person.

125
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,920
John Lee Pettymore points at them and he says, you hold it right there, you blood-eating

126
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,920
sons of bitches.

127
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:16,720
Oh, and you've got Keith's tiny but powerful gun in your hands.

128
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,360
Pointed right, the noise of cricket pointed right at him.

129
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,360
I mean, I'm scared.

130
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,120
I'm horrified, always horrified.

131
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,160
Even without the gun, I would have been...

132
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,160
Oh my.

133
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,960
I want to approach him and conk their heads together cartoonishly.

134
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:39,560
Upon doing so, the two sit cross-legged staring up at you.

135
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,120
My good sir, what do you want from us?

136
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,800
We're just trying to leave.

137
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,800
Leave what?

138
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,940
What the hell is going on here?

139
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:49,540
The greatest party that you've ever seen, have you not?

140
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,560
It wasn't so great from the cages.

141
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:57,480
Now, one good cop and one other man is dead.

142
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,880
And I want some fucking answers.

143
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,040
Why are we here?

144
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,460
Why were you drinking our blood?

145
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:02,460
What is this?

146
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:06,520
Oh, how could you not be partaking in this delicious juice?

147
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,560
Yes, do you want some?

148
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,560
Come right down.

149
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,120
There's plenty on the floor for all.

150
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:16,080
I conk their heads together again.

151
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,700
I don't want none of your damn people juice.

152
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,080
I want answers.

153
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,560
You best start talking immediately.

154
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:27,680
Well, I mean obviously you're in Marvin Glass's den of sin.

155
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,680
Yeah, why do you drink the blood?

156
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,680
Why wouldn't you?

157
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:36,740
It's delightful life-giving powers.

158
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:41,040
It tastes good and it makes us feel better on the inside.

159
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,240
I don't know why you're kink-shaming me here.

160
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,080
I'm just wanting to drink some boy juice.

161
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:56,720
Now listen, John Lee Pettymore is a sexually awake creature and he understands that the

162
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,720
spectrum of human pleasure is broad.

163
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:06,880
But the second it becomes a problem is when you, without consent, start drinking, minding

164
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,880
my partner's blood.

165
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,000
Well, you guys seem to be useless people.

166
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,840
You definitely whipped your dick out and tried to piss on me.

167
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,840
Yes.

168
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,840
It seemed like you were a willing participant.

169
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,600
Now who's kink-shaming?

170
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,520
If you would like to do that again, please.

171
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,760
Yes, we would quite enjoy it.

172
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:26,240
I would actually like to pee all over E2 right now, but my dick is broken.

173
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,240
I don't think I could pee.

174
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,240
Yeah.

175
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:34,320
Okay, conk.

176
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,320
How are you so blissfully unaware of everything that's happening here in the city?

177
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:43,520
Well, I come from a town where some pretty fucked up shit has been going on.

178
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,240
Oh, you're not from here.

179
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,960
Oh, he's not from here.

180
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,160
No, I'm not from here.

181
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,400
Rich, did you hear that?

182
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,960
He's not from here.

183
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,960
Rich.

184
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,960
It sounds like y'all want me to ask you what your names are.

185
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:58,200
Well, it's awfully rude of you to clonk our heads so many times without asking us what

186
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,200
our names are.

187
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,200
All right, what are your names?

188
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,960
Well, I am Rich.

189
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:05,160
And I'm Richard Nichols.

190
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,240
Dick Nichols.

191
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,040
Dick Nichols and Rich Nichols at your service.

192
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,560
I conk their heads together.

193
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,360
All right, now that we've been properly introduced.

194
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,820
What's your name?

195
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,860
My name is none of your goddamn business.

196
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:21,700
Where do you hail from, stranger that pisses on other strangers?

197
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:22,700
Contention.

198
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,700
That's a-

199
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:29,140
Why do you- what's that evil laugh for?

200
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:32,460
Well, we don't hear stories of contention.

201
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,300
What have you heard?

202
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:41,140
No, just that the police force there might be the most inept in all of the land.

203
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,540
That part might be true.

204
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:45,140
Not really.

205
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:48,540
Why does Marvin Glass hate you so much?

206
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:54,020
That part, well, because he took a bunch of his money and drugs.

207
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:56,500
Oh, I wouldn't do that if I were you.

208
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,220
No, that's a rude thing to do.

209
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,220
We didn't know.

210
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,220
Marvin-

211
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,060
Well, okay, so I've- I mean, like, I found the drugs, right?

212
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,320
I just found them sitting there, so I sold them.

213
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,460
That's Finders Keepers.

214
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,340
I don't know why he can be so mad about that.

215
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:09,340
I don't know.

216
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:10,340
Are they his drugs?

217
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:12,420
No, because somebody had stolen them from him.

218
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,420
I don't follow.

219
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:16,660
Well, so, like, there were two steps removed from Marvin.

220
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,140
Also, it's drugs, man.

221
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,140
Like-

222
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,060
Rich, does that seem enough steps removed for you?

223
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:28,340
I'm very curious about this Finders Keepers rule you bring up.

224
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:33,580
I tend to be a Keepers Keepers sort of man myself.

225
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,760
I think Rich is agreeing with you.

226
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,540
If you keep it, it's yours.

227
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:38,540
I didn't.

228
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:39,540
I sold it.

229
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,540
That's why Marvin's so mad.

230
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:43,700
Keith, my dead friend, see the eyeball dude over there?

231
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,260
Oh, it's delectable.

232
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,260
Oh my.

233
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,260
Erotic.

234
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,260
Yes, it was.

235
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,260
Okay, I conk him.

236
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:52,260
Can we go now, please?

237
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,260
No.

238
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:58,580
You've got- you've got many conkings ahead of you yet, weird little fuckers.

239
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:06,860
Okay, I see- I can see you like that, so- listen, what the- what do you two do in the

240
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:07,860
city?

241
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:08,860
Oh, we're security advisors.

242
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:09,860
In fact-

243
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,380
We're the best of the best, I would say, brother.

244
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:12,940
We are the best of the best.

245
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:13,940
The best of the best.

246
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:20,420
So much that the greatest man in the city, Marvin Glass, hired us to create the security

247
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:22,820
for this entire denizen.

248
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:29,820
Since all the denizens of this palace of horror and sin have fled and terror, many are dead,

249
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:34,540
and the prisoners, me, have escaped, it doesn't seem like you are the best of the best.

250
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:37,100
Also, you're being held at gunpoint right now.

251
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,500
Yeah, that's a fair point.

252
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,540
That's a good point.

253
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,540
He makes a good point.

254
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,740
How secure is this place?

255
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,420
I guess not very secure.

256
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,900
Can you protect us?

257
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:45,900
Maybe.

258
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:46,900
Please?

259
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:47,900
Listen.

260
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:51,380
Oh, pretty please, stranger.

261
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:57,020
We know how to use the security system in this place, and we could get you out of here.

262
00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:03,060
And we may love watching death, but we are, how do you say, not into dying.

263
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:06,340
Alright, well, first of all, it's gonna cost you.

264
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:07,340
How much?

265
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,340
Five million dollars.

266
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,340
What?

267
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:13,180
That's such a large number.

268
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:15,260
Rich, do we have that much money?

269
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:18,020
I don't think so, brother.

270
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,700
But I do wish so.

271
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,220
Tell you what, if we-

272
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,940
Wait, wait, hold on.

273
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:31,460
You guys got the contract to install security throughout this entire supervillain's lair.

274
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:36,260
You're dressed like millionaires with a bunch of other rich people literally lapping up

275
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:39,180
the blood of commoners.

276
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:41,020
And you're telling me you don't have money?

277
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:43,100
No, we have money.

278
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,820
It's tied up, it's not liquid.

279
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:48,660
You wouldn't understand.

280
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:51,060
I happen to be a man of means myself.

281
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:53,420
I might understand more than you think.

282
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:54,420
Interesting.

283
00:14:54,420 --> 00:15:02,780
So you propose that you kill us, and then you die here, or we help you escape, and you

284
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:05,420
pay us lots of money?

285
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,420
No.

286
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,420
Hmmmm.

287
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:11,100
No, that's not, that's not, you're not listening.

288
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,100
I propose-

289
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,900
I think we know exactly what's going on here.

290
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,340
I propose that you pay me-

291
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,340
For what?

292
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,340
To not kill you.

293
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,340
Oh.

294
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,340
Oh.

295
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,340
No, go ahead.

296
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,340
I don't care.

297
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:22,340
Do you want to get out of here alive?

298
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,860
We have the ability to make that happen.

299
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:28,900
It's not a strong negotiating tactic to give up what you want, so I think I don't care

300
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:29,900
either.

301
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:30,900
Okay.

302
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:34,300
I'm gonna shoot you in the knee now.

303
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,300
And then I shoot you in the knee.

304
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,300
Oh no, brother!

305
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:40,300
Oh my, can you see it?

306
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,300
Conk.

307
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,700
He's like licking at his knee.

308
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,660
I conk you so you can't lick your own blood.

309
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:49,060
Oh, let me get in there, brother.

310
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:53,020
Please, get that tongue inside me.

311
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,020
Let's move on.

312
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,020
Yeah, I don't know-

313
00:15:55,020 --> 00:16:04,820
My knee hurts, god damn.

314
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:09,500
But we still can help you out of here if you're willing to part with some of your apparent

315
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,500
money.

316
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,820
No, I mean, I can probably get out.

317
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:16,100
I'd help you guys not die though, if you pay me.

318
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,100
That's pretty much my offer.

319
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,100
Okay, sounds good.

320
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,500
We'll give it to you later.

321
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,740
Yes, we pinkies will.

322
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,700
Do you hold out your pinkies, eh?

323
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:25,700
No.

324
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:26,700
Butt.

325
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:29,300
I hold out my butt.

326
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,980
We put our pinkies in your butt.

327
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:32,980
All right.

328
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:33,980
It's a deal.

329
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:34,980
Gentlemen's cake.

330
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:38,140
Now we've sworn the old-fashioned way.

331
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:42,060
All right, five million dollars.

332
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:48,340
That's what that stinky finger promises.

333
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,580
Good lord, man.

334
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:56,500
Hearing a voice near Clark Bishop's shish-kabobed corpse, you look over and see a hunched man

335
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:00,840
wearing an old tattered robe with a hood that covers his face.

336
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:09,620
The voice is crackly and muttering something ancient and jaunty.

337
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:15,720
A bright light begins to form under the hood that is obfuscating this being's face.

338
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:21,200
As it reaches its hands into the light, the hood is drawn back, and this old man rips

339
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:25,840
an unnaturally bright light out of his familiar face.

340
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:32,660
A much older Clark Bishop takes his beaming hands and reaches deep into the chest of the

341
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:39,080
Clark Bishop you've known before yanking out the bar and throwing his younger self's body

342
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:42,520
over his shoulder.

343
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:56,840
Before you can act, in a flash the length of a blink, both Clark Bishops are gone.

344
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,160
Roll sanity.

345
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,160
93.

346
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,160
Whoo!

347
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,960
Go ahead and lose one.

348
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,440
What's that put you at?

349
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,440
23.

350
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,440
Whoo!

351
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,440
You are going down.

352
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,240
Okay, and my breaking point is 20.

353
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,800
Oh my god, brother, that was so interesting.

354
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:20,920
That was one of the stranger things I've ever seen.

355
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:27,860
Was that your, what, did your, your man friend just disappear with another man?

356
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:35,200
He's not my man friend, he's my friend man, and again, I think that an old man and a dead

357
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,920
man can just both sneak out of here.

358
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,920
That they did.

359
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,840
Dog shit at your jobs, guys.

360
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,840
The security here is non-existent.

361
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:46,960
We've agreed that maybe we could have done a little bit more.

362
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,160
Maybe we would have made more money.

363
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:57,360
That's true, delicious money.

364
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,600
Did you mention that you were from Contention?

365
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,520
I did.

366
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,000
What you been hearing about Contention?

367
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,480
Well we do know one man from Contention, I heard tell.

368
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:13,200
He was a, god, he was such a lush, he came in, he was trying to get into the VIP section

369
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,200
here one night.

370
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,960
They just don't let anyone in there.

371
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,240
No, and he was this dumb, small looking man.

372
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:26,960
I mean, he was like balding and round and I believe, Kevin, what was his name?

373
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,960
I can't remember.

374
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,760
Anyway, he said that he worked for the government.

375
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:34,800
I was here, I was pretty lit, weren't we, Rich?

376
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,880
That is always my dear brother.

377
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,960
And we were, I mean, just on the verge of it, right?

378
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:47,600
And he starts talking about how he's been in a coma, whoop-de-doo for him.

379
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,440
And we were like, why does that mean that you should be in the VIP section?

380
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,600
And he said that he was having visions while he was in this coma.

381
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:00,600
And we said, yes, we have visions all the time.

382
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,520
What's your favorite vision that you've had?

383
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:07,000
Oh, I couldn't say, brother, not in front of a stranger.

384
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
No, tell me.

385
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Completely agreed.

386
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,680
They're too personal.

387
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:17,680
And this man, I mean, he had the audacity to post about his visions online, online.

388
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:21,360
It's like sharing your mind diary with the public.

389
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,360
It's so absurd.

390
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:26,840
And the government got a hold of it and they sent some man named, oh, what was the name

391
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,000
he kept saying?

392
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,360
Agent Victor, I believe?

393
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,880
Victor, I think it was.

394
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,440
It was so odd.

395
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,920
He said that this Agent Victor paid him a visit and he was the one who told him about

396
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:43,240
the mind probing device that apparently ISIS is using now to give people vision.

397
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:46,280
So he said, claimed he was now like in the know.

398
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,280
Hold on.

399
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,280
ISIS?

400
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,280
Yeah, ISIS.

401
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,280
Like ISIL?

402
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,280
Like Daesh?

403
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,280
Sure.

404
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,280
Whatever.

405
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,280
I'm not much for current events.

406
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,480
ISIS has mind control technology.

407
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,800
Isn't that the worst news you've heard today?

408
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,920
I just don't believe it.

409
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,960
I don't know.

410
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,360
I understand why you didn't let John Peters in your place.

411
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,880
He seems like a raging lunatic.

412
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,880
Yeah.

413
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,360
Everyone from contention is.

414
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,360
Okay.

415
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,560
Well, I shoot him in the other knee.

416
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:16,380
Can we go now, please?

417
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:19,160
My brother's leg is so hurt.

418
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,320
I am in such deep pain.

419
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:24,920
I'd love to take care of it for him outside of here.

420
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,960
I love the pain.

421
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,400
That's a conkin.

422
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,400
That's a conkin.

423
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,400
That's a conkin.

424
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,400
Oh, that?

425
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,400
That's a conkin.

426
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,480
That's his dang conkin, boy.

427
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:45,920
Richard Nichols stands up and with the help of his brother, he says, sir, we, we must,

428
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,320
we must go now.

429
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:51,400
Otherwise I, the security will be here any moment and we need to go through these double

430
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,400
doors.

431
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,400
It's the only way out.

432
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,680
Are you going to pay me not to kill you?

433
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:58,920
We are absolutely going to pay you.

434
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:04,920
All right, well, I feel like you're not, but I don't want to get killed either.

435
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,960
So you can get me past the security here.

436
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:12,440
Uh, let's, let's get moving, but I want to find some place, some things out about this

437
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,440
place first.

438
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:20,400
So you guys walk up through the double doors and into a long wide hallway with tall ceilings.

439
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:26,280
The floor, ceiling and walls are made out of black marble, making depth perception difficult.

440
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:31,080
Your eyes take a second to adjust and you see at the end of the hallway is an elevator

441
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,080
door.

442
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:36,960
There are also two doors about 10 yards away from you, one on each side of the hallway

443
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:42,640
above the elevator is a dial that is slowly moving from the left to the right side.

444
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,640
Oh no.

445
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,640
Oh my.

446
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,640
Oh God.

447
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,640
The elevator.

448
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,640
It's coming down here.

449
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,640
It's coming down here.

450
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,740
Someone's on their way.

451
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,460
This can't be good, brother.

452
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:53,420
Oh no, no, no, no.

453
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,420
Okay.

454
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:55,420
Okay.

455
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:56,420
Let's um, you're, you're Richard, right?

456
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,420
I'm Richard.

457
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:58,420
And you're Dick.

458
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,420
Yes.

459
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,420
But rich.

460
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,420
Yes.

461
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:04,980
No, I'm Dick and Richard and I'm also rich and Dick.

462
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:05,980
Dickard.

463
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:06,980
Okay.

464
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:07,980
Dick.

465
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:10,700
Why don't, why don't you look away real quick?

466
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:11,700
Okay.

467
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:12,700
I execute.

468
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:18,900
Dick, I'm sorry, but your brother's a creep and a liability.

469
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:22,700
And uh, unfortunately I shot him in the knee to prove a point, but that just slowed him

470
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:23,700
down.

471
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:26,780
Uh, so that's why I had to shoot him just now.

472
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:30,880
If you'd like to take a moment and lap up his blood before you run through one of these

473
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:41,940
doors with me, I'd understand brother, I need it now.

474
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:43,820
I start lapping that bad boy up.

475
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:44,820
Okay.

476
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:45,820
Okay.

477
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:46,820
All right.

478
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:47,820
That's while sobbing uncontrollably.

479
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:48,820
That's enough.

480
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:50,740
Go.

481
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:51,740
We got to go.

482
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,740
A little bit more of my brother's blood, please.

483
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:58,260
I squirt a little bit from his knee into, I just, I just squeeze.

484
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,260
Oh boy.

485
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:00,260
All right.

486
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,260
Okay.

487
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,260
Dick.

488
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,260
Are you ready?

489
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:04,260
Like a blood fountain?

490
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,260
Like you squeeze it up into?

491
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,260
Yeah.

492
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:07,260
Like a blood Capri Sun.

493
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:10,420
Or like a hose when you like spurred it so it'll go into your mouth.

494
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:11,420
Exactly.

495
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:13,740
Is that, Hey, is that enough of your brother's blood?

496
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:18,380
I raise my blood soaked face up and I go, I think that has to do for now.

497
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:19,940
All right.

498
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:23,940
So I'm going to take the price down to 2.5 fair is fair and uh, let's get the fuck out

499
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:24,940
of here.

500
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:27,820
Oh, I guess that will have to do.

501
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:32,780
I'm still holding like the blood up to like the little spurt up to my mouth a little bit.

502
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:38,140
I conk him against his brother's corpse head and I'm like, we do not have time.

503
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:39,140
It hurts.

504
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:40,620
Let's go, Dick.

505
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:41,620
You guys don't have time.

506
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:42,980
Do you go left or right?

507
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:43,980
Left.

508
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:44,980
All right.

509
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:45,980
Wait, no, I mean he, where do we go?

510
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:46,980
Sorry.

511
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:51,500
I'm not super familiar with the map, but I'd say left is probably good.

512
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,500
Oh, left then.

513
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,500
God damn it.

514
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,620
Did I kill the wrong brother?

515
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:58,180
You very well may have my friend.

516
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:59,180
All right.

517
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:01,060
Get us through the door.

518
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:02,060
Let's go.

519
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:08,340
There's a touch screen next to the door and Rich begins fumbling with it and let's see

520
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,340
here.

521
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,340
I don't remember properly.

522
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:15,220
It was something like, and the door opens inside this door.

523
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:22,340
You walk into a small empty foyer that leads to four more doors and the door closes behind

524
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:23,660
you.

525
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:27,780
You've got one door on your left, two ahead of you, and one on your right.

526
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:34,620
They are labeled Kevin, Francis, Charles, Rosemary.

527
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,740
Oh my God.

528
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:40,660
What a potentially informative set of doors.

529
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:43,060
I would like to go into Rosemary's door.

530
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,460
I can help with that.

531
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:50,620
If I remember correctly, it was something like this, but my dear brother always used

532
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:54,380
to do this door, but I'm doing this in his honor.

533
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:56,720
And the door opens.

534
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:03,580
This room contains three things, a bed, a popcorn machine, and a television screen the

535
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:08,580
size of an entire wall that is currently playing an episode of Happy Days.

536
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:09,580
That figures.

537
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:12,100
The popcorn machine is an oddly whimsical touch for Rosemary.

538
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:14,580
I'll take a moment to reflect on that.

539
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:17,980
Is there any way to tell where Rosemary is in the building right now?

540
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,340
I don't think so.

541
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:25,500
We usually don't track people so much as capture them and, you know.

542
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,140
Make them fight for bloodsport.

543
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:28,140
Yes.

544
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:29,940
All right.

545
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,300
These guys seem to be really into blood.

546
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,900
Could I drink some blood for willpower?

547
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:36,540
I've never- They're really talking up it's healing benefits.

548
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:40,580
They really are talking up it's healing powers.

549
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:42,380
I did leave the- Do you drink some blood?

550
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:45,860
Well, we left the source in the hallway with a guard.

551
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:46,860
Oh, yeah.

552
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:52,340
I lick Rich's face.

553
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:55,100
I know you were going to like it, Rich.

554
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,100
I know.

555
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,100
Just let me- You were correct, Seth.

556
00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:00,180
Stop wiggling so much and let me get some of this blood.

557
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:06,860
And as he's wiggling, he moves the pillow on the bed and under it, there's a picture.

558
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:07,860
Yeah.

559
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:08,860
I think I know who it is.

560
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:09,860
Oh, really?

561
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:10,860
Yeah.

562
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:11,860
Is it Marvin Glass's boy?

563
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:12,860
It is.

564
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:13,860
Mm-hmm.

565
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:14,860
It absolutely is.

566
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:15,860
Yeah.

567
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:16,860
I had some suspicions about Rosemary's motivations.

568
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:23,500
Rosemary has a picture of a slender, muscular man in a black t-shirt and black tactical

569
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,500
pants.

570
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:29,620
He has tribal tattoo sleeves on both arms going down his hands and fingertips.

571
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:31,500
This guy seems cool.

572
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:37,340
There's a sharpied heart around this man's face, which is stoic, almost blank.

573
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:42,900
And she has written Rosemary Glass all over it.

574
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,900
Rosemary.

575
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,060
Yeah.

576
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:49,460
If we all get out of this, I do hope you find the love you seek someday, Rosemary.

577
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:52,260
I'm going to give you 10 luck for calling that.

578
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,260
Oh, thank you.

579
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:54,260
That puts me to 55.

580
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:55,260
Congratulations.

581
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:59,540
And we talked about how we haven't recorded since September.

582
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:04,420
I've been thinking about that for the next ... I'm like, oh shit, I think I know why

583
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:07,000
she sent us for the gun.

584
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:13,480
In the background, as soon as you get that luck, you hear Fonzie go, aye.

585
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,480
Thank you.

586
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,480
Thank you, Fonz.

587
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,480
Seemed right.

588
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,760
At the exact right time.

589
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,760
Exactly.

590
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:23,440
Rich, have you watched Barry on HBO with Henry Winkler?

591
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,680
I can't say I watch TV very often.

592
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,680
It's excellent.

593
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,680
You should check it out.

594
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:32,920
He does a great job as Gene Cusinow, the head of the acting theater.

595
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:36,480
John Lee Pettymore IV endorses Barry on HBO.

596
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,000
Go check it out.

597
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Timely references.

598
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Exactly.

599
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,200
The season's on right now, y'all.

600
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:46,060
Actually, it won't be by the time this goes to air.

601
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,060
Always behind.

602
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,060
Always.

603
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,060
All right.

604
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,280
I want to go into Kevin's room now.

605
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,400
Did y'all hire Kevin?

606
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,000
Do you know much about Kevin?

607
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,720
Rich, I think Kevin would have been around for as long as you've been there.

608
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:00,560
He's always been Marvin Glass's number two security.

609
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,560
Okay.

610
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:04,480
Kevin Glass is number two security, not head of security for the building.

611
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,480
I guess both.

612
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,480
Yeah.

613
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,480
He's like his right-hand man basically.

614
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,480
Okay.

615
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,080
Oh, I've known Kevin for quite a while.

616
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,840
He was always Marvin's number two.

617
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,160
Interesting.

618
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:22,840
You didn't happen to have any involvement in, say, making people like Rosemary unkillable

619
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,840
in any way?

620
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:29,320
Or, well, I guess it was Keith's brother who might have raised all those mutant children.

621
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,320
Anyway, did you make Rosemary immortal?

622
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,800
Or do you know that she might be?

623
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,080
I can't say we had any part in that.

624
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:41,840
We mostly stuck to the doors and whatnot.

625
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:51,120
When you go into Kevin's room, you guys leave and go into Kevin's room, it is the epitome

626
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,360
of minimalism.

627
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:55,680
There is a full-sized bed neatly made in the corner.

628
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:58,080
There's a chest of drawers against the wall.

629
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,640
And the only other thing in the room is a desk with a chair.

630
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,200
I'm not in great shape.

631
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,200
No, you're not.

632
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,640
You're just stumbling around.

633
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,640
What's in here?

634
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,640
You've got blood.

635
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,880
It's just smearing.

636
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:13,880
Also, you're still in your underwear from the fighting that took place.

637
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,860
You got your underwear in the cages.

638
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:19,120
You're welcome, listeners.

639
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:24,640
And then you were in the cage with Keith, and then you fell out, and you've been fighting,

640
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,640
and there's blood everywhere.

641
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:28,720
I've got the goo of the guy that I landed on probably.

642
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,720
Oh, just all over you.

643
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,800
You've got toenails.

644
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,800
Yeah.

645
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:38,760
So you're slip-sliding around all over this place, and when you check the desk, you grab

646
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:44,360
onto it, and you do notice that there is a different texture underneath the desk than

647
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,560
there is on top of it.

648
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,400
I'd like to feel around under the desk.

649
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:53,200
When you feel around, the texture is, it seems like someone's carved into the bottom of the

650
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,200
desk.

651
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,520
Rich, get under there.

652
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,520
Tell me what this desk says.

653
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:01,080
That's what I love doing is getting under things.

654
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:06,840
And as you get under it, you see that the phrase, not Kevin, has been carved into the

655
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:13,840
bottom of the desk over and over and over and on top of itself repeatedly.

656
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:17,720
Not Kevin.

657
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,720
That's weird.

658
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,080
You sure that's what it says?

659
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,080
Check again.

660
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,080
I'm looking at it.

661
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,080
It's very unsettling.

662
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:29,040
Rich, go ahead and roll Sanity for me.

663
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:32,040
I always fail.

664
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:35,840
Do you want to look at anything else in this room?

665
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,760
Yeah, I want to look under the bed.

666
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,000
I'd like to pop under the bed.

667
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Rich, look under the bed.

668
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
As you wish.

669
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,760
That's why you're here, Rich.

670
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,720
Well, I'm just leaning against the wall.

671
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,200
Bending hurts right now, so.

672
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,200
That makes sense.

673
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,200
Oh, yeah.

674
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,000
Oh, my broken dick.

675
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,080
Rich, under the bed, you find a notepad.

676
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:59,840
Seems to be some kind of notepad under here.

677
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:00,840
Pass that here, Richard.

678
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,000
I slides it.

679
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:08,600
On every page, it says, quote, I had the same dream again last night.

680
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,640
She just says, I'm so sorry.

681
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,380
He's just so beautiful.

682
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:15,160
You don't have to do this.

683
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,360
We can leave.

684
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:19,300
We can run.

685
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:23,740
On every page of the notepad.

686
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:27,780
I've heard that, but I don't know if John Lee Peddingmore's heard that or if I've heard

687
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:28,780
that.

688
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:29,780
John Lee Peddingmore.

689
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:30,780
Okay, where did he hear that?

690
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:31,780
It was in your dream.

691
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:32,780
Oh, right.

692
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:33,780
And I recognized him.

693
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:34,780
Okay.

694
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:40,280
So John Lee Peddingmore recognizes the words on the page from his dream, and a chill runs

695
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,500
down his spine.

696
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:44,940
Just a sickening recognition, but it shouldn't be there.

697
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:53,580
As Rich gets up from crawling under the bed, he bonks his head on one of the chested drawers,

698
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:58,640
and he's like, ooh.

699
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:04,540
And he sees that there's carving underneath this drawer as well.

700
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:06,220
Rich, what's it say?

701
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:12,220
It says, Mary in the woods, over and over and over.

702
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:14,220
Mary in the woods.

703
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,700
Kevin's a real focused guy, you know?

704
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:17,700
Yeah, he seems to write.

705
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:18,700
He gets on one thing.

706
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:23,980
Yes, I was going to say lots of repeated phrases and such.

707
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:24,980
It's interesting.

708
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:25,980
It's a style.

709
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:26,980
You know, it's a choice.

710
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:31,420
I wouldn't make it, but you gotta, you know, you gotta explore your own artistic avenues.

711
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:34,620
Can I see what, like, I want to check all the drawers on this desk now and see.

712
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:39,940
Every single drawer in the chested drawers says Mary in the woods carved over and over

713
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:41,380
and over again.

714
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:43,820
Mary in the woods.

715
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:46,780
To the point to where, like, the wood is thin.

716
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:48,620
And Kevin's an intense dude.

717
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:54,680
Yes, I've known Kevin a while, and I would say intense is one of the few adjectives I

718
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:59,100
know about him.

719
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:03,420
You're handling the death of your brother pretty well.

720
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:05,900
Well, he'll always be with me.

721
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:18,860
We went right back to being a little freak right away, so I appreciate that.

722
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:24,020
Alright, let's go through these other rooms here.

723
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,940
As you wish, sir.

724
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:28,100
Let's go into Charles' room.

725
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,580
As you wish, sir.

726
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:33,820
This room looks like it was a set used on Mad Men.

727
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:38,780
Everything is beautiful, but it smells like someone spilled a vat of Everclear in here.

728
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:44,040
There is a well-stocked bar, and the closet is full of different uniforms and disguises.

729
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:47,340
There is a computer, and there are a shitload of tabs open.

730
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:53,500
They are all about the town of contention, different businesses, and maps to Hotel Motel,

731
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:56,260
John Peters' house, and the Piston Pig Farm.

732
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,260
The pig farm.

733
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:58,260
The homeless.

734
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:00,660
Damn it, what does it all mean?

735
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:03,140
There's an email open as well in one of the tabs.

736
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:06,540
If only I could read.

737
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:08,660
I read the email.

738
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:14,460
So there's actually nothing in his inbox, but there is one email still in the drafts

739
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:15,460
folder.

740
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:24,940
The email details that Rosemary and I, Charles, found the gun that turned Alfred mad in the

741
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,620
possession of a young girl.

742
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:29,740
A chase ensued, and she got away.

743
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:33,940
He also adds that there are more strange items that are in contention, and he thinks that

744
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:35,860
they should try to collect them all.

745
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:36,860
Interesting.

746
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:41,980
So poor Tilde B had a run-in with Charles before she met us.

747
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:44,460
No wonder she didn't trust us.

748
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:46,580
Plus, fuck the police.

749
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:47,580
Yes.

750
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:49,540
Yeah, he knows what I'm saying.

751
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:53,180
I guess that explains why she was so nervous when she saw us.

752
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:57,140
Okay, on to the last room, Richard.

753
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:58,140
Richie.

754
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:59,140
Dick.

755
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:01,140
Wouldn't you like to know?

756
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:04,780
Yes, that's why I just asked.

757
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:09,140
The last room is Francis, and this room is a fucking disaster.

758
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:13,640
Clothes have been tossed onto every surface, the bed, the floor, the armoire, everywhere.

759
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:18,740
The walls are made out of whiteboard that is filled with equations.

760
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:23,040
There's a single drawing of a sphere, one inch in diameter.

761
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,300
This person seems smart.

762
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:27,780
I bet they're not related to Keith.

763
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:29,500
Do you know anything about these equations?

764
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,900
I can't say that I do.

765
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:34,500
I've never been much of a math man myself.

766
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:37,860
I'd like to do an intelligence roll and see if I can decipher what any of this is about.

767
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:38,860
Okay.

768
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:42,500
I mean, I didn't typically apply myself in school, but I did have a head for figures,

769
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:45,140
and I was an AP Calculus.

770
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:49,580
This is...

771
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:50,580
Last name.

772
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:53,220
Really inspired me.

773
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,220
You know, I was a pretty rough...

774
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:55,220
You know what?

775
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:56,220
You don't care about this, but...

776
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:58,660
I'm always interested to hear a good story.

777
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:00,780
All right, well, picture this.

778
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:04,500
We were both butt naked, naked on the bathroom floor.

779
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,500
I did.

780
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:08,660
Yeah, that's unfortunately why Mrs. Lastname got fired.

781
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:10,980
All right, I'm rolling...

782
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,180
Oh, an intelligence roll to see if I can figure out...

783
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:14,180
Add a negative 20.

784
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:15,180
The negative 20.

785
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:16,180
32.

786
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:17,180
I passed.

787
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:21,580
My intelligence is 75, so I'm rolling on a 55.

788
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:29,740
These equations are built to perform some sort of mathematics that do not exist in this

789
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:31,080
world.

790
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:36,860
She is coming up with solutions that do not make sense with the math that you know to

791
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,340
be absolutely true.

792
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:40,340
Go ahead and roll sanity for me.

793
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:41,340
Three.

794
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:42,340
I passed.

795
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:43,340
Fuck.

796
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:47,060
No, honestly, like, I kind of...

797
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:48,060
I don't know.

798
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:49,060
So this makes sense to you.

799
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:52,500
You were looking at math that doesn't make sense, and you were starting to realize with

800
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:56,620
everything that you've seen in this world that the math that you grew up with is not

801
00:37:56,620 --> 00:38:00,540
the math that actually exists in this reality.

802
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:01,540
Richard, this...

803
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:02,540
Hold on.

804
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:06,380
Okay, I'd like to do a search roll in this room.

805
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:07,380
Okay.

806
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:08,380
Five.

807
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,540
Oh, shit.

808
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:12,240
These dice are all over the place.

809
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,500
That means they're working.

810
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,500
So when you...

811
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:18,340
What did you do to my dice, you piece of shit?

812
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:19,980
When you...

813
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:25,260
Looking through the room, you start moving some of the clothes out of the way, and underneath

814
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:28,100
a shirt or something, there's a picture.

815
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:32,420
There's a picture of Frances with a man and a woman who are older than her.

816
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:37,380
It looks like a family picture, like it's her parents, and her father, the Duke, has

817
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:40,660
his eyes crossed out with X's from a Sharpie.

818
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:41,660
Teen angst.

819
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:42,660
We've all been there.

820
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:43,660
We have.

821
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:45,520
Until Mrs. Lastname got ahold of me.

822
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:48,260
Really turned me around.

823
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:49,860
More ways than one.

824
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:50,860
Hot.

825
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:51,860
Yeah.

826
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:52,860
Uh-huh.

827
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:59,620
All right, well, this room of this precocious teen mind seems to have revealed all it can

828
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:00,620
to me.

829
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:02,180
Let's keep moving, Richard.

830
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:03,180
Yes.

831
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:05,900
You've now gone into all four rooms in this quadrant.

832
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,900
The only door is back into the hallway.

833
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:08,900
All right, Richard.

834
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:09,900
Follow me.

835
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:10,900
Peek your head out there.

836
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,020
Make sure the coast is clear.

837
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:19,420
When you peek your head out, you see there are four men dragging this limp body behind

838
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:27,980
them, and each of them are wearing full brown jumpsuits, and they have a large scythe strapped

839
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:34,100
to their backs, and the blade of each scythe is shaped like an enormous fishhook.

840
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,260
How bloody is it?

841
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:38,820
None of the fishhooks have any blood on them.

842
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:40,580
Mm, disappointed.

843
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:42,540
You might want to take a look at this, friend.

844
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:43,820
I peek my head out.

845
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:47,460
When you peek your head out, you notice that the body that they are dragging behind them

846
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:53,340
is the body of Keith Vigna, and they walk into the elevator, and the elevator door closes

847
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:54,460
behind them.

848
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:56,140
Where all does the elevator go?

849
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:58,700
Anywhere your heart desires.

850
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,300
Hmm.

851
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,540
Like, really, though?

852
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:05,340
Could I just think about a person I want to see in this building?

853
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:08,540
I meant within the building's bounds.

854
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:09,540
Okay.

855
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:13,420
Do you think we could find Rosemary?

856
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:14,420
Mayhaps.

857
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:15,420
Where would she be?

858
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:16,660
Where's, like, security control?

859
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:18,820
I believe I could take you there.

860
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:20,060
It's across the hall.

861
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:21,060
Let's go.

862
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:26,380
When you guys go across the hall, there's also a touchscreen, yeah, Scooby-Doo shot

863
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:31,220
of you guys running across the hall to the other door that looks the exact same, using

864
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:34,340
the same, what are those called in cartoons?

865
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:35,860
Frames of animation.

866
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:36,860
Sure.

867
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:37,860
Yeah.

868
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:41,700
It's, like, on a loop of us walking, and...

869
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:48,700
And you guys do the same thing, where you, like, hack into the keypad, and the door opens,

870
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:55,340
and inside this door, you walk into a small, empty foyer that leads to two doors, one on

871
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:57,260
your left and one on your right.

872
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:58,780
Neither one has a label.

873
00:40:58,780 --> 00:40:59,780
Oh, good.

874
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:00,780
I don't...

875
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:02,140
I think labels are generally harmful.

876
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:03,700
Me as well, friend.

877
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:04,700
Where...

878
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:05,700
You guys have so much in common.

879
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:06,700
Alright, let's not.

880
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:07,700
I don't...

881
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:09,740
I'm becoming quick friends with you.

882
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:10,980
Rich, no.

883
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:11,980
That's not what's happening.

884
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:13,660
You know, you took my brother.

885
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:16,140
You could fill in a little bit here for...

886
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,140
Oh, yeah, sorry.

887
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:21,940
When you guys walked out into the hallway, they saw you, and...

888
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:22,940
No, Richard...

889
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:24,940
And they killed both of you.

890
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:29,140
Richard's body was still, you know, just limp on the floor.

891
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:31,300
Just figured I'd remind you of what you've done.

892
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:35,580
Thank you for making me relive these delicious and horrible memories.

893
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:38,780
Do you want to go in the left door or the right door?

894
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:39,780
Left door.

895
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:42,940
You walk into a room that is long and narrow.

896
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:47,580
Each wall is made entirely of deep, tall file cabinets.

897
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:50,940
Above you is only fluorescent lighting.

898
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:53,260
On the far end of the room is a table.

899
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:58,660
It looks like a desk but is four feet off the ground and has no accompanying chair.

900
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:02,660
There is a file open on the standing desk or super wide podium or whatever.

901
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:03,660
I go to read it.

902
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:07,660
It's a file that says John Lee Pettymore the Fourth on it.

903
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:13,660
It shows you as a cocaine supplier, number one, and a contention police officer, number

904
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:15,100
two.

905
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:19,740
There's a lot of stuff about the Pettymore family.

906
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:24,900
Different troubles that cousins and uncles and aunts have all gotten into.

907
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:27,500
And then there's a manila envelope.

908
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:32,060
When you open the manila envelope, it's adoption papers.

909
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:39,700
From Cole's Orphanage, New School Under Modern Etiquette, and the name of the adopted child

910
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:42,460
is John Lee Pettymore the Fourth.

911
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:45,180
What?

912
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:46,900
I pour over the paper.

913
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:49,220
Does it show my birth parents or anything?

914
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:50,780
It has your adopted parent's name.

915
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:52,660
It doesn't have your birth parent's name.

916
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:55,040
So that's pretty stunning.

917
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,040
How old was Kevin?

918
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:59,420
He was probably mid-50s, mid-60s.

919
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:00,420
That's my daddy.

920
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:03,820
I want to take a look and see if I can find a file for Kevin.

921
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:12,140
Actually, right underneath the file for John Lee Pettymore, there's a file labeled K-Cell.

922
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:18,660
Three members of an unknown organization who go by Kyle, Karen, and Kevin.

923
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:21,260
Kyle is listed as unknown.

924
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:23,700
There's a blurry picture attached of a man.

925
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:26,180
The picture is from a security camera.

926
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:30,400
Karen is listed as Anne Love.

927
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:36,480
There is a mug shot of a woman smiling a cold, vacant smile behind asymmetrical bangs

928
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,040
covering one of her eyes.

929
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:42,480
Kevin is listed as unknown.

930
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,080
There is a picture attached.

931
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:49,240
He's missing the surgical scars and is so much younger and happier than Kevin, the man

932
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:55,080
you saw earlier, who is now only a hollow shell of the man in this picture, the man

933
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:59,280
you immediately recognize as your father, John Lee Pettymore the Third.

934
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:08,600
Okay, so Copperhead Road starts playing by Steve Earle and John Lee Pettymore gets, he's

935
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:18,160
stunned and he's kind of, the paper is shaking in his hands and he's like, daddy, daddy,

936
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,040
you ain't dead.

937
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:22,800
The G-Men didn't kill you.

938
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:23,800
You're alive, daddy.

939
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:41,920
Also, in this file, there is a miniature tape player with a cassette loaded into it.

940
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,680
I nervously press play.

941
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:51,680
The cassette begins playing and you hear that whirring of an old recording and you hear

942
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:58,720
a voice that you just recently met and you recognize as Marvin Glass.

943
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:07,720
I do not typically reward my adversaries with the honor of joining my family, but if

944
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:16,880
either of you are willing to give up any information on your associate who stole my property, I

945
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:21,360
would be willing to let you live.

946
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:23,240
Fuck you, you goddamn monster.

947
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:25,040
You and your kind can eat my ass.

948
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:27,480
No, no, no, please.

949
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:28,840
How are you doing this?

950
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:30,720
Kyle, I swear I'm not doing this.

951
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:33,200
He's controlling my- BANG!

952
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:42,280
The sound of a gun firing is followed by silence.

953
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:43,840
What are you?

954
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:52,200
Tell me how this little ball works and I'll tell you what I am.

955
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:54,440
The recording ends.

956
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:58,440
Little ball.

957
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:00,440
Goddamn.

958
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:06,440
I guess this mystery is a lot older than December 3rd.

959
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:10,440
Hey, Rich, did you hear any of that?

960
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:11,440
Mm-hmm.

961
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:12,440
What is this?

962
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:13,440
Yeah.

963
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:14,440
Sorry, man.

964
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:24,000
I just heard like some life shit, like my daddy, who I found out is my adopted daddy,

965
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,280
who I thought had died and abandoned me.

966
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:29,400
He's alive.

967
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,400
He's Kevin.

968
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:34,800
Oh, interesting.

969
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:38,520
Were you around- did you work for Mr. Glass at this time period?

970
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:39,520
Did you know anything?

971
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:44,000
No, I can't say I was around whenever this was.

972
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,960
Like is this- does it seem- is it like A through Z or whatever?

973
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:47,960
It's not.

974
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:48,960
It's all over the place.

975
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,320
Do you want to go ahead and roll a search for me, though?

976
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:51,320
Yeah.

977
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:52,920
I've got one thing for you if you roll.

978
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:55,920
Sorry, it's a zero and a two.

979
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,160
Fuck yeah.

980
00:46:57,160 --> 00:47:01,800
You quickly just rifling through trying to find anything interesting.

981
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:08,360
There's a bunch of files that are itemized by like number and letter coding, stuff that

982
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:11,720
doesn't make any sense, but there's one that's just called Satan.

983
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:14,040
I'd like to read this file called Satan.

984
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:16,400
Yeah, there's one thing in it.

985
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:22,320
It's just a picture and it's of a woman with shoulder length curly hair and a mouth that

986
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:28,840
not only takes up half of her face, but it's showing an amount of unbridled pleasure you

987
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:36,480
can barely comprehend, and you feel like it might be important later.

988
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:39,160
This is a deeply unsettling photograph.

989
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:44,320
It is, and I would like you to roll sanity.

990
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:45,640
Thirty-one, fail.

991
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:48,000
Alright, lose one sanity.

992
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Twenty-two?

993
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Yes.

994
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,200
I'd like you to roll an alertness check for me, John.

995
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:53,680
The same age as Taylor Swift.

996
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:58,560
At least he has a song called Twenty-Two.

997
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:00,840
Thirty-four on a sixty.

998
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:02,760
Fuck, I just missed it.

999
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:03,760
No, no, I passed.

1000
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:04,760
You passed.

1001
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:05,760
Yeah, you passed.

1002
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:06,760
Hell yeah.

1003
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:08,720
You hear the elevator door ding.

1004
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:16,360
I grab Richard Rich, whichever you prefer, Dickie, and throw him behind the table with

1005
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:17,360
me.

1006
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:18,360
I'm like, get down.

1007
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:19,360
Okay.

1008
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:26,040
As you hide, you hear footsteps, and then you hear the door to the foyer that you're

1009
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:33,200
in open, and then you hear someone right on the other side of the door of this room that

1010
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:42,400
you are now in, and the door opens, and Kevin is standing there, dressed in all black, average

1011
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:48,080
build, six feet tall, light brown hair, mustache with a dead stare and scars on his forehead

1012
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:49,600
and neck.

1013
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:57,800
The scars look medical in nature, and he is all gussied up with an assault rifle, a shotgun,

1014
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:58,800
a pistol.

1015
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:01,000
He's wearing body armor.

1016
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,760
Body armor that you recognize.

1017
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,680
We came in with our body armor.

1018
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:10,960
Yep, and he's holding the assault rifle that you specifically chose to bring to the city

1019
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,680
with you.

1020
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:16,400
Nature versus nursery right there, you know what I'm saying?

1021
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:17,400
Woo!

1022
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:23,920
And he starts shooting, and he fires this assault rifle.

1023
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:27,320
We're behind a big solid four foot wide thing, right?

1024
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:33,960
I just motion to Rich, don't make a fucking move, and I'm just hoping he's just firing

1025
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:34,960
blindly.

1026
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:35,960
I don't want to make a move right now.

1027
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:41,280
So he keeps firing and firing, clip empties, you hear it hit the ground.

1028
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:45,840
He loads in another clip, and he starts firing again.

1029
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:48,520
Woo!

1030
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:54,600
And as he's firing, you start feeling this podium chip away.

1031
00:49:54,600 --> 00:50:00,720
A few bullets actually whiz through near your heads right in between the two of you.

1032
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:01,720
Okay.

1033
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:07,440
I want to wait until I hear him go through another clip, and as soon as I hear him reloading,

1034
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:11,640
I'm going to kick Richard out into the open.

1035
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:14,080
Fair, fair.

1036
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:17,360
A clip hits the ground.

1037
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:20,240
I kick Richard rolling out behind the podium.

1038
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:26,440
I'm in the fetal position, so I literally roly poly out into the fetal position.

1039
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:30,800
And I'm not saying anything, I'm just hoping maybe he just recognizes one of the guests

1040
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:31,800
and will...

1041
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:40,160
John, you turn to your right and you see the body of Rich Nichols turn into cheese, basically.

1042
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:44,240
It's shredded through with lead flying all the way through it.

1043
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:51,480
I would say roughly 18 shots go through the body of Rich Nichols, and he is flopping about

1044
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:52,940
on the ground.

1045
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:57,940
He shits his pants, he starts throwing up everywhere and gurgling blood.

1046
00:50:57,940 --> 00:51:03,400
And as he's gurgling blood, you are my new best friend.

1047
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:08,240
Live, Dammit, live.

1048
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:11,080
Earn this.

1049
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:20,240
All right, so while he's focused on just lighting up Rich, I want to roll around the other end

1050
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:23,140
and take some shots with the noisy cricket.

1051
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:24,680
Roll firearms.

1052
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:26,800
25.

1053
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:27,800
What's your firearms?

1054
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:33,200
My firearms is a 60, that would make it a 40, so I'm good.

1055
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,960
Roll 2d10 for damage.

1056
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,960
Oh, fuck.

1057
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:40,240
Oh, fuck indeed, that's a noisy cricket, my dude.

1058
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:41,240
Add up the numbers?

1059
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:42,240
Yes, please.

1060
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:43,240
17.

1061
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:44,240
No, wait, no.

1062
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:46,680
Yeah, no, because a 10 is a 10, right?

1063
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:47,680
A zero is a 10.

1064
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:50,280
Oh, a zero is a 10, so eight.

1065
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:51,280
Wait, what?

1066
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:52,280
I rolled a 10.

1067
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:53,280
Oh, yeah, that's a one.

1068
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,280
Right.

1069
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:55,280
That's what I'm...

1070
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:56,280
Yeah.

1071
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:57,280
All right.

1072
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,280
Or a 71.

1073
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:01,680
710 points of damage.

1074
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:09,640
Eight damage, so you fire at Kevin and he takes it in the shoulder and part of his shoulder

1075
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:16,840
rips away and underneath it you see some sort of, it's not bone, it's some sort of shiny

1076
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:24,600
material underneath his shoulder and he stands firm and begins firing at you as you are firing

1077
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:25,600
at him.

1078
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:26,600
I take my shots.

1079
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:29,940
They turn my daddy into a goddamn mechanical man.

1080
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:37,580
And as you say that, he turns the assault rifle onto you and begins firing, landing

1081
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:40,260
11 points of damage.

1082
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:42,140
That takes me down to one hit point.

1083
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:45,940
At one hit point, the body of John Lee Pettymore hits the ground.

1084
00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:49,660
I need you to roll a constitution check to stay conscious.

1085
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:56,500
32 on a 50, so does Khan go down with willpower?

1086
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:57,500
Yes.

1087
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:58,500
Okay, so I fail.

1088
00:52:58,500 --> 00:52:59,500
You fail.

1089
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:03,940
Kevin turns a sort of sickly black for you.

1090
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:11,620
The camera pans out and sees Kevin walk over to the body of John Lee Pettymore.

1091
00:53:11,620 --> 00:53:21,100
There is no remembering in his eyes and he fires his assault rifle into your chest for

1092
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:29,340
a full clip and the body of John Lee Pettymore is just gyrating on the ground.

1093
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:38,740
The blood is spattering everywhere and Kevin is standing above you with a cold, dead face

1094
00:53:38,740 --> 00:53:45,420
with no remorse and no understanding of what he was doing.

1095
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:47,600
That still seems like I couldn't come back.

1096
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:49,260
You said you're going to spend the luck.

1097
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:50,260
Yeah.

1098
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:58,040
The world is dark, but you still feel very much alive.

1099
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:01,800
You actually feel something very specific.

1100
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:09,280
You're moving like go-gurt busting out of a plastic tube by pressure alone.

1101
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:17,720
You feel yourself squeezed out of a dark constricting space onto the cold, hard floor and rolling.

1102
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:23,920
Then your limbs extend from your form and slam into the file cabinet walls on either

1103
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:25,020
side of you.

1104
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:32,020
It gives you the leverage you need to fling your silver, round frame at your target.

1105
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:38,580
As you land, one of your appendages slices into the soft tissue on the back of your dad's

1106
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:39,580
neck.

1107
00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:45,660
Another snaps his head forward and you feel the fracture as a third reaches in, gripping

1108
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:52,100
the top of the spine where it meets the head, or the C1 vertebrae, and you rip the entire

1109
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:59,620
spinal cord out of his body in one swift motion, promptly forcing yourself into the

1110
00:54:59,620 --> 00:55:06,620
now-vacant spinal column of John Lee Pettymore the Third.

1111
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:08,780
Cool.

1112
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:53,700
How am I the only one trying to pull over How can you have enough drowning out of the

1113
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:54,700
walls?

1114
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:55,700
There's no fire at all.

1115
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:56,700
No fire at all.

1116
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:57,700
Fight, fight, street me down Takes me back to where you're from

1117
00:55:57,700 --> 00:55:58,700
Don't stop a dying love Don't push on to your own

1118
00:55:58,700 --> 00:55:59,700
Don't stop a dying love Don't push on to your own

1119
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:00,700
Don't stop a dying love Don't push on to your own
