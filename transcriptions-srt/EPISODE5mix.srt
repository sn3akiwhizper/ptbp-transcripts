1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,760
What is up my people, it is your friendly neighborhood DJ Wolf the dog.

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:16,680
As always we are coming at you live and uncut from 694.2 PTPP contentions latest and greatest

3
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,560
radio station.

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:23,160
Wolf is here with some hot scoops of news.

5
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,320
Now the county said that the body from the junkyard had the organs of someone who died

6
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:32,840
200 years ago but the skin and hair of someone who died yesterday.

7
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:38,120
Somebody get Ripley's Believe It or Not on the line because that is some unbelievable

8
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,120
shit.

9
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,400
Charles, a drunk man and friend of the missing John Peters went to the police station to

10
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:49,120
get answers before pulling a gun and running away upon hearing the sound of a car crash

11
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,400
in the parking lot.

12
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:58,280
Sounds like it is about to hit the fan and the it is shit my babies.

13
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,240
Kathy Piston shot Keith Vigna in the foot.

14
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:05,680
He snooped around her property until trying to stow away on her school bus full of homeless

15
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,680
folks.

16
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,600
He heard himself falling from the emergency hatch in the back.

17
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,880
Now sounds like that's what you get for being a damn snoop.

18
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:18,660
Now John Lee Patymore seems to believe some hooded robot man gave him a message.

19
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:22,260
Now we've all had a dream like that before am I right fellas.

20
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,820
Now about that crash.

21
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:28,900
Seems to have been a stolen black SUV t-boning George Piston's truck while it was parked

22
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,580
in the police station lot.

23
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:33,820
Now how drunk you gotta be to hit a parked car?

24
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:39,460
Now I want y'all to tell your mama, tell your papa, there's a new band in town and it is

25
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:43,380
kudzu with no backbone.

26
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:15,740
Keith Vigna give me a drive roll at a minus 20.

27
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:18,180
Hell yeah I love that.

28
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,580
Oh I passed a 13 on a 20.

29
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:28,620
You come sliding out drift style into the county road that the black SUV is on and you

30
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:35,840
are immediately in pursuit alongside two other police cruisers and the black SUV is taking

31
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:43,120
off and takes a left into the entrance for the water park splashylvania.

32
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,400
So you guys pull up to the entrance of the vampire themed water park and see a large

33
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:54,420
wooden sign that reads splashylvania in all caps above a cartooned vampire wearing floral

34
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,960
swimming trunks and riding a surfboard.

35
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:03,500
A caption bubble extends from the summertime villain's mouth that says you'll want to splash

36
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:08,780
your buds.

37
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:14,980
And below this delightful signage is a black SUV that is crashed into the turnstiles at

38
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:15,980
the entrance.

39
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,660
What do you guys want to do?

40
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,380
Can we tell if it is occupied?

41
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:24,500
Doors on the left side on the driver's side are both open and there seems to be no one

42
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,500
in the SUV.

43
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,900
I want to pull up and check out what's inside of the SUV.

44
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,920
I'd pull up in a like whatever the formation would be to keep the car pinned if it were

45
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,320
to suddenly back up.

46
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,320
Awesome.

47
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,320
Same.

48
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,800
Approaching the black SUV when you look inside there doesn't seem to be much in it.

49
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,640
It's a pretty clean car.

50
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:46,080
There are no people inside this black SUV.

51
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,840
But there's animals and things?

52
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

53
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,840
Tons of animals.

54
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,320
There's squirrels everywhere.

55
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,320
And a dragon.

56
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,320
Objects.

57
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,320
There's no people.

58
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,200
There's a dragon.

59
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,200
Roll initiative.

60
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,680
There's some paper towels.

61
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,680
Dragons are spooky.

62
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,680
Thanks mom.

63
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,680
Thanks mom.

64
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,680
Thanks mom.

65
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:12,080
So walking into the empty park you see signs for a couple different rides.

66
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:18,880
There is the Two Fanged Plunge, Holy Water Falls, and a ride called The Stake, which

67
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:24,480
is a log flume ride but the front of the boat is sharpened and at the bottom of the ride's

68
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:28,680
steep drop there is a massive ornate heart the riders float through.

69
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,680
Awesome.

70
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,680
That's badass.

71
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:37,800
Yeah, I mean I know we're here to do a job but I fucking love the Stake.

72
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:43,000
Go ahead and roll alertness for me.

73
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Quit fail.

74
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I pass.

75
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
47 on a 70.

76
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Pass with 4.

77
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I got an 88.

78
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Nice.

79
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:56,360
Alright, so John and Clark, the two of you see all the villains while Keith walks over

80
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,360
his shoelaces.

81
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,360
Oh wait.

82
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,960
Yeah, if you want to describe what you're doing.

83
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,160
Well, I'm going to switch out the dice first off.

84
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:10,160
Second off, yeah, I got shot in the foot and so I'm going to hop it on one leg.

85
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,160
God damn.

86
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,160
Kathy shot me in the foot.

87
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,160
Why?

88
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,160
Oh, I have a lot to tell you.

89
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,160
Can it wait?

90
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:23,160
It can wait but it's pretty important but I'll let you know later.

91
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,160
Well, I guess Clark and I will pursue on foot but...

92
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,160
I'll hop behind.

93
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:33,160
Okay, so the two of you would see across the park, it's a really small water park, but

94
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:40,760
across it you see standing atop the two-fanged plunge is Julie Maxwell in a hospital gown

95
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:44,560
with a terrified Leo piston kneeling in front of her.

96
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:50,080
Leo is kneeling at the top of the water slide where a rider would wait impatiently for a

97
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:55,880
tanned teen to give them the green light and Julie Maxwell cackles into the night sky and

98
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:07,720
screeches the world is not our own and little else matters except for the black shiny devil

99
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:14,700
and the underground temple from which it shall rise but if there's a tiny chance that justice

100
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:22,920
matters then my sister deserves this fat fuck to bleed out and die and she fires and you

101
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:28,480
see a spray of red explode out of Leo piston's stomach and his body slumps forward and begins

102
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:36,240
sliding down the steep yellow slide, a streak of red trailing, his flinching body roll sanity.

103
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,680
I failed.

104
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,560
I passed with a one.

105
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,560
Is that?

106
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,560
Oh, that's a crit.

107
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,560
Yeah, yeah.

108
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,560
I passed with a six.

109
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,960
That means everyone who's your friend gains one.

110
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,240
No, I failed.

111
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,760
Okay, so if you succeed, you lose no sanity.

112
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,640
If you failed, you lose one sanity.

113
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,640
What do you guys do?

114
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,640
Open fire on Julie.

115
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,640
I think that's what...

116
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,640
She just shot a dude.

117
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,640
I think she's going down.

118
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,640
Yeah.

119
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,640
Okay.

120
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,640
Roll firearms, everybody.

121
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,640
21.

122
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,640
On a 60.

123
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,640
Holy fuck.

124
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,640
I rolled a one again.

125
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,640
Oh my God.

126
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,640
Holy shit.

127
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:16,200
Before any of us get our guns out, Clark has just shot her right through the eye.

128
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,200
Yeah.

129
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,080
Do you want to narrate it or...

130
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,840
I mean, it's that.

131
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:27,820
As soon as that blood spray hits, I'm already efficiently out, gun drawn with a pistol from

132
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:28,820
this far away.

133
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:29,820
Yeah.

134
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,640
Just took a luck shot and nailed her.

135
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:36,920
Went right through her left eye and the back of her head just explodes through.

136
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,920
A reflex.

137
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:44,520
Clark, obviously, any loss of life is regrettable and not what we want, but that's not the outcome

138
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:49,100
we desire, but that was tight as fuck.

139
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:59,640
The body of Julie Maxwell also falls onto the slide and begins sliding down the two-fanged

140
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,640
point.

141
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,640
Oh no.

142
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:13,760
And as her body slides to the bottom of the slide where Leo Piston's body also sits, you

143
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:23,180
see the bodies of both Julie Maxwell and Leo Piston are picked up and slammed into

144
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:28,520
the ground repeatedly and at an absurd rate by some unseen force.

145
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:33,840
And then, as if they were never there at all, their bodies are gone.

146
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,840
Roll Sanity.

147
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,280
Crit success.

148
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,280
Nice.

149
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,280
Fail.

150
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,280
I pass.

151
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,800
I don't know how though.

152
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,800
Yeah, no.

153
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,160
That was honestly one of the most, just Terry and you say that, was one of the more fucked

154
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,360
up things I've heard in Delta Green.

155
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,880
I don't know how to explain being okay with seeing that.

156
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,880
Exactly.

157
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,200
Visualizing that, there's no way you come out of that all right.

158
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:05,800
John Lee Pettymore, you are going to lose one sanity, but gain some terrifying insight.

159
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,560
And who failed?

160
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,560
I did.

161
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,560
Keith Wigner failed.

162
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,560
Clark.

163
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,560
Just a regular pass.

164
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:17,360
So, Clark, you were going to roll one D4 and you lose four sanity.

165
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,080
Keith Wigner, I need you to roll a D4 as well.

166
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,080
One.

167
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:27,520
One plus four is five and you lose five sanity.

168
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:32,680
I need Joe and Thomas to leave the room.

169
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,680
No.

170
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,680
Get the fuck out.

171
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,680
Luke?

172
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,680
Who?

173
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,680
Luke?

174
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,680
Who?

175
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,680
Keith Wigner.

176
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:51,360
Covering the ground where Julie Maxwell and Leo Piston's bodies just existed, there is

177
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:58,000
now black, shiny, viscous sludge.

178
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:07,040
Seemingly inside this muck is the thrashing bodies of Julie Maxwell and Leo Piston.

179
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:13,880
Their hands reach out, trying to escape this thing that has trapped them, but their struggle

180
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,080
does not last long.

181
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:23,840
Their limbs seem to fold into this ooze, becoming one with the sentient mass of goop that is

182
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:27,280
now sliding across the ground toward you.

183
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:30,640
What do you do?

184
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,000
I hop away.

185
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,960
I forgot your fucking name.

186
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,960
Okay.

187
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,960
Perfect.

188
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:45,400
I literally 180 and just start pogo sticking my way towards my car.

189
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,400
Okay.

190
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,720
Do you say anything to the other two?

191
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,320
I just, I scream at the top of my lungs.

192
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,960
We'll wait for them to come back.

193
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:59,760
Keith Wigner, if you would like to describe your actions.

194
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,760
And I run off.

195
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,760
I hop off.

196
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:06,760
He begins hopping as fast as he can in the opposite direction.

197
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,600
Did he just Wile E. Coyote out here?

198
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:19,760
That's never, I mean, that's aside, that's the Wile E. Coyote sound.

199
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,680
I've never seen a one footed man move so quickly.

200
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:28,260
Well, it seems like Keith might need a mental health day, Clark.

201
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:31,680
So he takes off running, screaming, hopping, hopping, hopping, screaming.

202
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:37,320
I'm probably still a little bit in shock that I just shot and killed her and then saw that

203
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,320
crazy shit.

204
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,280
I don't know if I even notice him running off.

205
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,280
I cautiously approached the pool where they landed.

206
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,520
Yeah, I'm with him.

207
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:49,600
Did anything fall out of their pockets while their bodies were being?

208
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,640
Is there gore on the sidewalk?

209
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,640
Yes.

210
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,640
Yeah.

211
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,640
Yeah.

212
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:59,700
Blood and viscera is sitting at the bottom of where like the pool of water that you splash

213
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:04,700
into at the bottom of a water slide is, there's now a pool of blood.

214
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:05,700
Jesus.

215
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,460
Well, it's not great.

216
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:10,460
What the, what the fuck?

217
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:16,460
You ever, you ever, you ever seen anything like that before?

218
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,460
Yes.

219
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,460
I'm sorry.

220
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,460
No.

221
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,700
Where'd, where'd the bodies go?

222
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,260
Your guess is as good as mine, Clark.

223
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:26,260
I look up.

224
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:32,820
Listen, frankly, none of this seemed too weird to me.

225
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:39,180
I've inexplicably kept a cool and level head throughout all this.

226
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:44,660
John, I think you were rationalizing in your head a way for this to be, well, some air

227
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:52,380
currents came up from the, uh, the subterranean waterways underneath the park.

228
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:56,820
They got caught, uh, you know, above a great kind of like, you know, Marilyn Monroe's

229
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:03,260
score score score, Marilyn Monroe's skirt, how it got thrown up in the air by that.

230
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,260
Yeah.

231
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,260
By that old great.

232
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:07,500
I think something like that happened here repeatedly with two bodies.

233
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,500
That makes sense.

234
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,500
Of course.

235
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,500
It makes sense.

236
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,500
Yeah.

237
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:16,500
Looking back, you guys see Keith is still hopping as fast as he can and he is finally

238
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,140
bouncing dot in the distance.

239
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:20,780
He's, he's, he's out of the spot by now.

240
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:21,780
I holler.

241
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,180
Hey Keith!

242
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,180
Hey Keith!

243
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,180
No!

244
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:30,180
Do you guys not see that shit?

245
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:33,180
Uh, what do, uh, what do you guys do?

246
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:36,680
That's a good question.

247
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:41,620
I think we call, let's just jump right back into some like real low key investigation.

248
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,620
The FBI.

249
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,620
Yeah.

250
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,620
Well, this is a pickle.

251
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:51,020
I'm going to follow up on that weird camera.

252
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,020
You got it.

253
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,020
You got everything here.

254
00:13:53,020 --> 00:14:02,020
Is there a way to call the president?

255
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:07,300
As you guys walk back to your police cruisers, uh, the SUV is still sitting there.

256
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:13,140
And John, as you, um, as you get to your car, uh, you notice that real quick, we shut the

257
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:15,020
water park down for the day.

258
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,020
Oh yeah.

259
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,020
Yeah.

260
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:19,460
And you're probably going to call Tim and have him come out.

261
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,980
I think this is definitely federal.

262
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:23,980
You want me to go higher?

263
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:24,980
It's Ray.

264
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:25,980
It's Ray.

265
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,380
No, it's always been Tim.

266
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,380
Yeah.

267
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,380
Ray.

268
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:32,420
As far as I recall, it's always been Tim.

269
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,420
Yeah.

270
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,660
The guy who does all the stuff for you, like.

271
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:36,660
That's Tim?

272
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:37,660
Yeah.

273
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:38,660
He's Tim now.

274
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,660
Well, it's always been Tim.

275
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,660
It's always been Tim.

276
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,660
Of course it has.

277
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:42,660
Yes, it always has been.

278
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:43,660
Cool.

279
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:44,660
Glad we're all on the same page.

280
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:50,620
I'm sitting in my cruiser, just like ghost white, staring ahead, sweating.

281
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,740
Have you sought medical attention for your foot yet?

282
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:58,140
Okay guys, I got to go over a few things with you before we part ways.

283
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:02,900
Are you leaving the force?

284
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:06,540
So maybe after today.

285
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:09,540
So my foot, I probably do need to get this looked at.

286
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:13,940
Kathy shot me as I was Kathy piston, George's wife.

287
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:17,980
As I was approaching the house, I thought that they were all, they were gone, but she

288
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,260
was still there.

289
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,500
She shot me in the foot, not realizing it was me.

290
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,580
I went into the farmhouse.

291
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,120
She wrapped my foot up for the time being.

292
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,980
It's okay, but it hurts real bad and I'll probably bleed through these bandages pretty

293
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:29,980
quick.

294
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:33,440
But anyway, after she shot me and wrapped me up, she gave me some coffee and then her

295
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,260
alarm went off and she had, she just left.

296
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:38,500
And so I snooped around, I looked through the farmhouse.

297
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:42,740
I looked through the small farmhouse that was there that Leo lives in and the barn and

298
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:47,000
I didn't find anything in any of those classic vigna.

299
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,200
As I was walking to the second house, I saw the big warehouse that they have where all

300
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,200
the pigs are.

301
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,580
I saw that door was open and I saw it close.

302
00:15:55,580 --> 00:16:00,320
And so after I looked in the barn, there were some school buses parked next to the warehouse

303
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:05,240
and I snuck into one of those school buses to see who came out of the warehouse.

304
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,700
I assumed it was Kathy.

305
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:10,900
She and about a hundred homeless people got on the bus that I was on, crammed in there

306
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,100
and started driving off.

307
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,100
I freaked out.

308
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:20,160
I opened up the back door, fell out of it and hopped my way back to the cruiser.

309
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,220
And that's when I ran into you guys.

310
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,220
Holy shit.

311
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,220
Yeah.

312
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,220
It seemed like, Oh wow.

313
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:29,220
Were they talking?

314
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:33,460
I was more concerned with not being on that bus anymore because Kathy didn't seem to really

315
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,460
want me around.

316
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:37,440
Also, I told her I had a warrant, which she, she believed.

317
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,060
So I don't think we're gonna have to deal with that anytime soon.

318
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,420
How do you know they were homeless?

319
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,420
Oh yeah.

320
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,480
Oh, they were, they were homeless.

321
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,780
They weren't wearing suits.

322
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:47,780
They weren't.

323
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:48,780
Yeah.

324
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:49,780
Yeah.

325
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:53,860
Uh, it didn't smell like pig shit, but it didn't smell not like big shit.

326
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:54,860
So yeah.

327
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:57,180
The immediate thought of get me the hell off this bus.

328
00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:00,640
And then as soon as I fell out of the bus, I thought, well, maybe I should have stayed

329
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,060
to see where they were going, but they didn't seem to notice me.

330
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,140
I was hiding in the back.

331
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:10,040
And so yeah, I hopped my way back to the cruiser and here we are also, uh, did you guys not

332
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,920
see what I saw in there?

333
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,040
Well, John's got to get theory on that.

334
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:17,480
It was currents of air from the underground.

335
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:23,560
That's a, that's a great theory, but I saw black viscous goo with Leo and, and Julie

336
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:28,800
trying to crawl out of it until it sucked them in and, and they disappeared.

337
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,280
You been trying any mushrooms?

338
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,680
I haven't, but I probably lost a lot of blood.

339
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:36,160
I put my hand to his forehead and feeling for fever.

340
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,200
Ice cold.

341
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,560
He's hallucinating.

342
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,560
I swear to God.

343
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:42,200
That's why I screamed and hopped off guys.

344
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,200
You didn't see that?

345
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,200
No, no.

346
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,200
Oh God.

347
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,760
I saw a very explainable natural phenomenon that happens all the time.

348
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,760
I got a theory.

349
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,840
I got a theory here.

350
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:57,520
You know how, uh, that body we've originally found was blunt force trauma on the, on one

351
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,520
side.

352
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:05,800
That shit that happened to them probably happened to happen to her or it, whatever that body

353
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,800
was.

354
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:10,600
I understand that there have been two incidences of airborne.

355
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:14,800
We need to investigate underground air flow.

356
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,220
Perhaps no one is safe.

357
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:21,160
When I was getting set up back at the station for an interview, we got a call in from the

358
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:26,000
medical examiner about that body out there in the junkyard.

359
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
It's real weird.

360
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,400
I opened my car door and just throw up out of the side of it and then continue listening

361
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,400
to you.

362
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:38,640
The sides of it were that of a body that's been dead for a hundred, 200 years, 200 years,

363
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:44,720
but the skin and hair was deceased as of December 1st yet another perfectly explainable.

364
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:49,040
I just figured they did something wrong in the testing that, or, but honestly you see

365
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,120
it all the time.

366
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,160
Ancient innards.

367
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,720
It just happens to some folks.

368
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,600
You get all rotted in there because of your lifestyle choice.

369
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:01,640
I think something is up that we alcohol, which we have never seen before tobacco.

370
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,200
So I need to go to the hospital.

371
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,120
Did one of you guys hear the stuff that Julie was saying up there?

372
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,840
Yeah, I got it down pretty well.

373
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,840
It sounded something like this.

374
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,360
Oh shit.

375
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,160
Oh, Google docs.

376
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,120
Where are you at?

377
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:23,080
No, this is not what it, no, that's not ringing any bells.

378
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:27,680
You would remember her so clearly.

379
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:35,680
The world is not our own and little else matters except for the black shiny devil and

380
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:39,920
the underground temple from which it shall rise.

381
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:46,280
But if there's a tiny chance that justice matters, then my sister deserves this fat

382
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,960
fuck to bleed out and die.

383
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,240
This seems pretty shut and dry to me.

384
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:57,300
You remember that Polaroid you found that had a shiny black thing in it.

385
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:01,880
And according to Vigna, like shiny black goo, slam these people into the ground.

386
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,820
So I think you're just drawn at straws here.

387
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:07,840
That seems entirely coincidental.

388
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,260
The world is, the world is full of black goos.

389
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:16,220
There's oil, there's dark soup, there's yeah, yeah, yeah.

390
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,220
Dark, dark soup.

391
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,980
You're writing this off too quickly.

392
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,460
No, it was dark soup.

393
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,180
He's right.

394
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:27,520
So as, as you bring up the camera, you were kind of standing in between Vigna's cruiser

395
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:33,180
and your own and you kind of take a look into yours and the camera that you found in Joey

396
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:37,740
Maxwell's car, which is in the back of your police cruiser, obviously that red light is

397
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:41,140
no longer on, but the green light is.

398
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,140
It's turn.

399
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,140
I'd like to inspect the camera.

400
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:48,140
Has it taken a picture or no, the only thing that's different is that it's green light

401
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,140
instead of red light.

402
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:50,140
Yeah.

403
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,980
I want to look through it and then I also, I want to feed it a blank Polaroid.

404
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:53,620
Let's see if we'll take a shot.

405
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:57,060
So it's actually got the paper like already internally in it.

406
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,060
Cool.

407
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,060
I'd take a picture.

408
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,060
Okay.

409
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,060
Of the water.

410
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,060
What was it?

411
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,060
Two fangs?

412
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,060
That was the steak.

413
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,060
No, no, no.

414
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,060
I thought that's where they, she plunged off two fangs.

415
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,060
Okay.

416
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,060
One went down one thing.

417
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,060
The other went down the other.

418
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,060
Yeah.

419
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,060
Real fast.

420
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:17,420
Well, I was going to say, does, do any of our cruisers have dash cams or confessionals?

421
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,020
You would have dash cams for sure.

422
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:19,900
Yeah.

423
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:22,540
I'm getting into my cruiser and trying to pull up the footage of what all just happened.

424
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:29,020
So you wouldn't be able to actually see, well, luck, real luck pass.

425
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:33,880
You would get a very, very slight far away view.

426
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:38,900
You would see the death of Julie Maxwell as well as the death of Leo piston.

427
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,900
Great shot.

428
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:44,740
Um, and then you would probably, I feel like the, the shot would be obfuscated.

429
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:47,260
Is that the word obfuscated?

430
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:53,980
Yeah, obfuscated by attractions and signage of all sorts, but you would see on the camera

431
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:57,740
their bodies at the top peak moving around.

432
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:58,740
Cool.

433
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:05,660
So John, you walk back with the camera to the two fangs, you hold the camera up and

434
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:08,400
the viewfinder looks very normal.

435
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,060
You see what you see.

436
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:16,260
When you click in to take a picture, there is an extremely bright flash that is almost

437
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:22,620
blinding and as your vision comes back into focus, you see a piece of paper being smoothly

438
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:25,260
printed out of the bottom of this device.

439
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:30,180
I'm briefly reminded of reports of brilliant flashes of light coming out of John Peter's

440
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:31,180
house.

441
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:32,180
Roll sanity.

442
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,180
Ooh.

443
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,180
87.

444
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,180
Fuck yeah.

445
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,180
Roll a D six.

446
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:40,900
Oh, you're going to do me like that.

447
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:41,900
Four.

448
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,300
Lose four sanity.

449
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,300
You're starting to.

450
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,300
I believe.

451
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:48,500
You're starting to lose it a little bit.

452
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:56,660
The picture shows a short balding man with large eyes and a tiny nose.

453
00:22:56,660 --> 00:23:04,620
He is bent over head and hands and stocks that are a shiny black material and fool is

454
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:07,340
branded into his forehead.

455
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:12,940
You see an inky black substance all over your hands and dripping onto the ground from the

456
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,900
camera and the picture.

457
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:19,780
It is pooling on the ground and you could swear it is moving.

458
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:22,120
When you blink, the substance is gone.

459
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:28,740
Your hands are clean and you're holding this odd device and this even otter picture.

460
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:29,740
Let's go ahead and get them back.

461
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:33,500
Hey, I'm going to talk to them first.

462
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:37,860
No, I'm going to talk to them first.

463
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:38,860
Okay.

464
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:39,860
Sorry.

465
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:41,860
Hey, how are you doing?

466
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:42,860
Howdy.

467
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:43,860
Proceed.

468
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:44,860
Don't don't.

469
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:51,180
And Clark, the two of you see an extremely bright flash of light coming from where John

470
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,180
is standing.

471
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,180
I look at Clark.

472
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:54,180
What the hell was that?

473
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:55,180
He was taking a picture.

474
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:57,160
It's the flash of a camera.

475
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,540
It was bigger than a regular flash of a camera.

476
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,060
I don't know what kind of camera you're using.

477
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:07,940
I guess it was kind of bright.

478
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:13,740
Is the gate, is the entrance to, uh, is the entrance to, can I fit my cruiser inside of

479
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:14,740
the water park?

480
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,620
I get out of my car.

481
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,180
John, you get that picture?

482
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,180
John doesn't answer.

483
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:22,620
He's just kind of staring at a picture in his hands and like the ground around him.

484
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:23,620
I go walking up.

485
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:27,620
I'm going to hop out with him too.

486
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:28,620
Nice.

487
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:32,020
I think you might want to help Keith.

488
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:33,020
I'll do that.

489
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,020
I'll go and.

490
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,020
Yeah.

491
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:38,900
I put my arm around him and three three legged race it.

492
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:39,900
John.

493
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:40,900
John, what you got?

494
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:41,900
I'm not rightly sure.

495
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:45,060
I look over his shoulder or whatever he's looking at.

496
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:48,140
I pass him the picture and I look at it with him.

497
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:52,820
I cover Keith's eyes.

498
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:58,340
The picture shows a short balding man with large eyes and a tiny nose.

499
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:05,260
He is bent over head and hands and stocks that are a shiny black material and fool is

500
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:07,580
branded into his forehead.

501
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:08,580
Did you say in stocks?

502
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:09,580
Like he's hanging?

503
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,260
It was like just directly in front of me, right?

504
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,260
Like where I took the picture.

505
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:16,540
Like did you just aim it right ahead of you or did you, what do you, the picture's like

506
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:19,700
super zoomed in seeming you don't really see much around.

507
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,380
I'm like reaching out in front of me.

508
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:25,820
I'm waving my hand out in front too.

509
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:26,820
You feel nothing.

510
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:27,820
You feel the air.

511
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:28,820
There's not a man there.

512
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:32,100
John, did you see anything looking through the viewfinder real quick?

513
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:37,340
The two of you, uh, could you roll sanity for me at seeing this picture?

514
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:38,340
I pass with a nine.

515
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,340
I hit a snow.

516
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:40,340
I'm sorry.

517
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:41,340
I failed.

518
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,340
Totally.

519
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:43,340
Keith is fine.

520
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:44,340
And Clark, you lose one sanity.

521
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,340
Keith.

522
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,300
You're probably thinking this isn't a camera.

523
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,800
Maybe it's like a printer of some kind, dude.

524
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,800
This might not be a camera.

525
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:55,860
It might be like a printer of some kind from a different, well, this sounds crazy, but

526
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:57,860
like a different dimension.

527
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:58,860
Now you do sound crazy.

528
00:25:58,860 --> 00:25:59,860
I'm sorry.

529
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:02,420
What kind of, I lost a lot of blood.

530
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:04,580
Tell me a little bit about that black goo you saw.

531
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:07,020
It was like viscous black goo.

532
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:10,700
They were crawling out of it and it sucked them in and then it, and then I ran away.

533
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:16,860
Well, three unrelated incidences of black goo are probably just coincidence, but I am

534
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:24,780
starting to come around to the notion that maybe something strange is happening in contention.

535
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:28,540
In the picture of the guy in the stocks, is there signs of the water park behind him?

536
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:30,140
Uh, no, it's really zoomed in.

537
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,140
Oh shit.

538
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:33,700
You really add the whole back is, is blurry and such.

539
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:39,500
Uh, John just got a text and when he reads it, Hey God, so I haven't told you, um, when

540
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:45,460
I went to the hospital, a madman jumped out at me, possibly a man, possibly mechanical,

541
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:46,460
but he did.

542
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:48,820
Uh, he gave me a note in binary.

543
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:51,660
I had, uh, had drew take a look at that.

544
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:54,900
I think, uh, I think something's going on.

545
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:55,900
All right.

546
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,380
Here, here's what it says.

547
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:01,220
The binary, it translates to I killed the cheese pops, John.

548
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,220
John?

549
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,220
That's me.

550
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:07,740
That's what happened to cheese dad, but death.

551
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,020
What did this guy look like?

552
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:12,220
He was wearing a hood and he was real scraggly.

553
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:13,220
You couldn't see his face.

554
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,220
And you know what?

555
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:16,220
Come to think of it, I don't think I even caught the feller's face.

556
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:21,620
Does the note look like it's to John or signed by John because John Peters is our missing

557
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:22,860
man also.

558
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:24,020
It looks like it's to me.

559
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,020
Cool.

560
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:30,060
I killed the cheese pops, comma John, not I killed the cheese pops, signed John.

561
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,220
It's addressed to John.

562
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,220
Gotcha.

563
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,220
Fun thing.

564
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:40,060
Can you guys roll intelligence for me pass pass fail Clark.

565
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:44,060
You'd still be holding this picture that John just handed you.

566
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:47,060
You're remembering this face.

567
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:53,900
It's obviously a little different now and it's got fool branded into its forehead, but

568
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,860
you're pretty sure that's John Peters.

569
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:59,340
Hey fellas, what's up this year picture.

570
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:03,300
I think, I think this picture is John, John Peters, our guy who's missing.

571
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,300
God, you're right.

572
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,300
Let me take a look.

573
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,300
I pass it over.

574
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,260
This is the same guy from those pictures in John's house.

575
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:10,740
What the hell boys.

576
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:13,280
Is that green light still on the camera or is it red again?

577
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,280
It's red.

578
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:18,780
John Peters cursed this devil camera, cursed this haunted water park.

579
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:23,600
You remember that body in the junkyard, it had, what was it branded with?

580
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,600
This is a fool.

581
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,600
Right?

582
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,600
Yeah, this thing does not like fools.

583
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,600
We got some fools on our hands.

584
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,600
Oh God, guys.

585
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Somebody don't like fools.

586
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
It's the BM.

587
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:42,680
We just need to find out what a fool believes.

588
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,680
Cut in that music.

589
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,680
We'll get those rights.

590
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,680
Yup.

591
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,680
We can definitely afford it.

592
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,680
Call out the dude.

593
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,680
Call out the dude.

594
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,760
I need to get to the hospital.

595
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,760
Oh shit.

596
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,760
Yeah, you're right.

597
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,640
I think I can get myself there, but I'll go with you.

598
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,640
All right.

599
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:02,600
Yes, I'll stay behind and try to put together this tangled web of mysteries that are certainly

600
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:05,680
not currently swamping the resources of this small.

601
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:10,440
While we're at the hospital, maybe we should see if we can get some security footage and

602
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:15,400
see if we can't find out what the hooded figure guy came from or what he looks like.

603
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,400
What was the hooded figure thing?

604
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,400
The one that handed him the note.

605
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,400
He jumped out of me.

606
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,400
Oh, right, right.

607
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,400
Are you going to the city?

608
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,400
Which one did you go to?

609
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,600
There's a clinic in contention, like in urgent care.

610
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,600
That's where I would go.

611
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,600
Yeah.

612
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,240
Okay, so that was the end of the day basically.

613
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:32,240
Well, it seems like we've done all we can do today.

614
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,240
I'm going to take an overnight here at the hospital.

615
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:41,840
Why don't we all just hit the hay, get a good nine or 10, and come back with fresh, yeah.

616
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,240
We took him to the clinic and he's okay?

617
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,240
Yes.

618
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,400
Did I regain any health points?

619
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:49,080
Can you roll to see if he loses the foot?

620
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,240
Be hilarious if I did.

621
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,520
You don't regain any health.

622
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,960
Okay, but I have a foot?

623
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:53,960
You do.

624
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:54,960
Can I walk on it well or no?

625
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,720
No, it's still sprained pretty badly.

626
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,280
But I got crutches or a wheelchair.

627
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,280
Which do you want?

628
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,280
I want a wheelchair.

629
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,280
You've got a wheelchair.

630
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,280
Hell yeah.

631
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,280
That's going to prove problematic.

632
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:07,240
Okay, I guess we'll just leave you here, Keith.

633
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:11,400
I mean, I can still get up out of it, you know.

634
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,920
Yeah, but without crutches.

635
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:17,320
It's a real souped up jazzy.

636
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,600
It's like the one that they had at the clinic.

637
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,920
Yeah, yeah, it's super old.

638
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:25,800
We just find you a couple of real long sticks.

639
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,800
Cool.

640
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,800
Just in case.

641
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,800
It's just you and me now.

642
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:35,800
Finally, we can tell the mic what we can't tell the world.

643
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,800
What we can't tell ourselves.

644
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,800
What we never dare admit.

645
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,800
But what we know is true.

646
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:50,320
So you're sleeping and you're reliving the moment when you saw the black sludge on your

647
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:55,040
hands and dripping from the odd camera and picture.

648
00:30:55,040 --> 00:31:00,520
Your perception changes and you're out of your body, looking at yourself, staring intently

649
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,200
at your hands.

650
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:09,000
You see there's the same viscous muck dripping from your eyes and nostrils as you wake up

651
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
in bed.

652
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:16,520
Yeah, I can't really get back to sleep after that, so I just say some like very abusive

653
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:22,880
things to whichever teenagers are playing Call of Duty at this time of night.

654
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:28,160
I really like, I'm being a dick over voice chat.

655
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,440
Are you good at Call of Duty?

656
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,440
I think he's pretty good.

657
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,440
I think he's probably pretty good.

658
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,440
Yeah.

659
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,440
I think he's put in some hours.

660
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,440
Yeah.

661
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,440
All right, go ahead and grab Luke.

662
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,440
Hey you.

663
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,440
Keith Vigna.

664
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,440
Oh boy.

665
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,440
Shit.

666
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,440
Hey Luke.

667
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,440
Hey.

668
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,440
Keith.

669
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,440
Hey Luke.

670
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,440
Hey.

671
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:52,320
Keith, your eyes open and you see a woman standing before you in your bedroom.

672
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:57,560
She's wearing old timey clothing and she stares angrily at you.

673
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:03,060
She lunges toward you, picking you up and throwing you to the ground.

674
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:07,800
You fall into the floor of your bedroom and then you wake up in bed.

675
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:12,000
I rub my eyes and I look around the room and wonder if that was real or not.

676
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,880
But I have seen enough shit that I think it is.

677
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,060
There's no one in your room.

678
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,060
What time is it?

679
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,060
Three in the morning.

680
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:19,760
I'm going to get up and look around my house.

681
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,760
Just do a quick sweep.

682
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:21,760
Nothing?

683
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,760
Nothing.

684
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,720
I'm going to lay back down but probably have some trouble falling asleep.

685
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,720
Probably so.

686
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:28,200
You want to grab Joe for me?

687
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,200
Yep.

688
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:34,240
Clark, you go to bed that night, you crack open your TV dinner.

689
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,640
It's a Salisbury steak tonight.

690
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,640
Oh.

691
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,080
He was looking forward to it.

692
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,080
Gross.

693
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:44,160
And you're watching Wheel of Fortune and then you see a man underneath you and you're not

694
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,160
on your couch.

695
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:51,960
The man underneath you is struggling to breathe as you tighten your grip around his neck.

696
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:58,520
You look up after the life leaves his eyes and see an empty dark alleyway as you wake

697
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:02,200
up on the couch with infomercials playing on your TV.

698
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:05,400
Oh, what the hell was that?

699
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,400
Yeah.

700
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:11,240
Yeah, you probably clean up, try to go to sleep.

701
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,240
Yeah, go to the bedroom.

702
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,240
Sounds good.

703
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:19,880
Okay, so you guys get up and you meet at the police station around the normal time.

704
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,880
11, 11.30.

705
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,880
Eight o'clock for Clark.

706
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,280
You know when crime starts.

707
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,080
Eight o'clock for Clark Bishop.

708
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,520
A little bit later for the other two probably.

709
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:32,440
I think today I get there on time because I didn't really go to sleep last night.

710
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,440
Gotcha.

711
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,000
I get there late but for the same reason.

712
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,320
Drew seems to be in pretty low spirits after the events of the past two days.

713
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,800
Today is December 3rd.

714
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:45,040
Been two days since all this crazy stuff has started.

715
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:49,760
How'd you sleep last night, Clark?

716
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,440
I mean I had some nightmares.

717
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,560
I think everybody's gonna have some.

718
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:57,360
Yeah, well what, along what lines?

719
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,520
After what we saw.

720
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,520
What happened?

721
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:03,480
Oh, I saw a dark alley.

722
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,760
It was just real spooky.

723
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:10,600
Yeah, I had a dream that like an old time lady picked me up and threw me through my

724
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,600
floor.

725
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,680
Yeah, it was really scary.

726
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:17,280
Do we really need to hear about your fucked up sexual fantasies?

727
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,200
Did you have any fucked up sexual fantasies last night?

728
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:24,280
He like wipes at his eyes like without really thinking about it and says no.

729
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,440
Okay, must just be the two of us then.

730
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:31,200
I mean yeah, you see anything as violent as what happened last night, you're gonna think

731
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,200
about it.

732
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,200
Some weird dream.

733
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:36,400
Your body's just trying to process what you've gone through.

734
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,400
That's all it is.

735
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:41,760
Drew, have you heard from Maggie, or Officer Cook?

736
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,760
Captain Cook?

737
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,760
Chief Cook?

738
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:51,080
No, I've called the Chief quite a few times, but I haven't been able to get a hold of her.

739
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,080
Could you call her dad?

740
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,080
Yeah, hey Drew buddy.

741
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:58,000
We kind of forgot to mention her dad might be dead, if you could look into that.

742
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
The Chief's father?

743
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Yeah, Pops.

744
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,120
Okay, yeah, I'll look into it.

745
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,120
Great.

746
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,240
You didn't do it right?

747
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:08,240
Just playing.

748
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,320
John's eyes narrow a little bit though as he looks at Drew.

749
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,560
Doing a role he meant.

750
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,160
Crit success.

751
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:20,100
He's so scared that you might be serious.

752
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:22,920
John knows that and revels in it a little bit.

753
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:27,040
You guys have never really been on great terms, and so he's like ugh.

754
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:31,080
John's not a great guy.

755
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,080
No shit.

756
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:38,400
Okay, I'm thinking I kind of want to follow up on this whole, the homeless people at the

757
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,600
Pistons house and their warehouse.

758
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:45,680
I don't know if we should go ask them about that, or if we should just do a little investigating.

759
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,640
We saw Leo Piston die last night.

760
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,640
That is true.

761
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,640
Maybe we should leave him alone.

762
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,640
That probably closes that thread.

763
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:59,040
I feel like we should maybe try to figure out some more stuff before we talk to the

764
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,040
Pistons.

765
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,040
Right, maybe we'll have some cool down.

766
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,520
Look at all those homeless people.

767
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,600
There's only 5,000 folks in this whole town.

768
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:07,600
Has anyone notified the Pistons about Leo?

769
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:10,480
I haven't, and I don't know if we should just yet.

770
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:17,360
It would be probably strange for you guys to confront George and Kathy with the death

771
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:20,200
of George's brother without a body.

772
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,480
There is a pool full of his gore.

773
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,920
Let's just leave it be for now.

774
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:24,920
Take him to there.

775
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:25,920
Yeah, here's what.

776
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,440
There's a little bit of a scalp.

777
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,200
Here's what I'm thinking.

778
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:36,320
That last picture we saw was of John Peters, so maybe we should go back to that case and

779
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,800
see what happened to him.

780
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:42,880
Honestly, the branding, the stocks, I think we've got some kind of deviant sex cult on

781
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:50,200
our hands just fucking degrading this town, this town, each other, this town, our values,

782
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,200
faces.

783
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:56,120
Should we go back to John Peters' house, or what do you, I don't even know what strings

784
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,120
to pull.

785
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,320
John pulls out the keys.

786
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:02,660
I had a hunch that these might be a storage unit on these G numbers here.

787
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:09,360
There's a note on your desk, John, that the storage unit that these keys are likely for

788
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,160
is called A Plus Storage.

789
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:15,640
They're the only storage units in town that have a G building.

790
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:25,560
I'll ride with one of you guys, because it feels real bad, but I got a wheelchair I can

791
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,440
fold up and throw in the back of your cruiser.

792
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,240
That's those cool sticks we found.

793
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,120
Yeah, they were all out of the clinic.

794
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:33,800
Yeah, they've had shortages on crutches.

795
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:38,120
I took one of the wheelchairs, so I'll throw that in the back of your cruiser and ride

796
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,120
with you, Clark.

797
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,520
Yeah, that's fine with me.

798
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,520
Cool.

799
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,220
I'm gonna wheel myself over to outside.

800
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:50,080
You guys roll up to A Plus Storage, and there's a small parking lot with a gate, and there's

801
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:54,800
a small house looking kind of thing to the right with a front door.

802
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,160
It's a small, probably one-room building.

803
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,480
Their open sign is on.

804
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,200
Okay, what units are these?

805
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,480
What are the numbers on those?

806
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,480
G units.

807
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,040
Which G units are they?

808
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,040
10 through 12.

809
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,040
10 through 12.

810
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,040
Let's go check them out.

811
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,040
Let's start with 10.

812
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,040
Yeah.

813
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,040
What if we all open one, and we open them all at the same time?

814
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,040
I honestly was thinking about that.

815
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,040
Yeah, sure.

816
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,040
Why not?

817
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,320
Don't they come in different sizes?

818
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:23,320
These are all the ones that are probably 10 foot by 10 foot.

819
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,320
Nice.

820
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:25,840
From what you can tell.

821
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,840
I can't open one up right now.

822
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,520
I'm gonna sit at my wheelchair and watch you guys open them up.

823
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:33,160
Yeah, it'd probably be way easier for me to describe it one at a time.

824
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:39,320
I would actually, if you could lay down the descriptions of each one and then play them

825
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,320
simultaneously.

826
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,320
At the same time.

827
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,320
Gotcha.

828
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,320
Yeah.

829
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,320
We'll get it in post.

830
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,320
We'll wait.

831
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,720
Okay, let's start with 10.

832
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:47,720
You open up G10.

833
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:51,400
G10 is filled with crates that are stacked three high.

834
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:57,520
There is also a pallet on which is sitting a large cube shaped object covered in so much

835
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,680
plastic wrap that its contents are obfuscated.

836
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:07,640
Each crate is wooden and stamped US Military in all caps on the side.

837
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:12,960
Inside these crates are guns, ammunition, and heavy weaponry.

838
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:19,200
This includes pistols, shotguns, rifles, a shoulder mounted anti-aircraft weapon, an

839
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:25,240
EMP rifle, a grappling gun, a small gun that shoots tracers, lots of grenades, and a few

840
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,240
other items.

841
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:29,120
Well, this could be the locker of any honest citizen in contention.

842
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:34,700
You can each come up with anything that you want to be in here in one of these crates

843
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:38,520
and if you roll for luck and I approve it, then it's in one of the crates.

844
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:39,520
Okay, cool.

845
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,520
Oh shit.

846
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,600
I want all the things you already said.

847
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,880
Those are already there.

848
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:44,880
Holy shit.

849
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:45,880
What the fuck?

850
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:48,480
Who's got the best, what are our firearms?

851
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,200
You guys each get to come up with one and each roll luck.

852
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,200
Okay.

853
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,200
I don't know what to wish for.

854
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,600
Like a bad ass shotgun, a sniper rifle.

855
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,600
Well, I feel like those are already in there.

856
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,600
I know.

857
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,600
Wasn't that all?

858
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,600
There were shotguns.

859
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,840
There doesn't seem to be a sniper rifle.

860
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:03,840
So that could be one.

861
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:07,880
So sniper rifle, there wasn't anti-aircraft and there's an EMP rifle?

862
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,880
There's an EMP rifle, yeah.

863
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:13,680
Well, that's actually going to come in handy because I do think we're dealing with some

864
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,680
robots.

865
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:17,360
Do you want to go ahead and roll luck, Thomas, for a sniper rifle?

866
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,360
No.

867
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:21,920
I want something bigger.

868
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:22,920
Something more spectacular.

869
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:26,840
Hey, is there a tank in here under all these crates?

870
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,000
Hey, is there a tank in here?

871
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,560
Is there anything not guns that could be like a nice vision goggles?

872
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:36,160
It's just one really sweet vintage cotton candy machine.

873
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,880
I mean, it can be anything, guys.

874
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,600
I want that gun from Men in Black, the little tiny one.

875
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,600
The mighty cricket?

876
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,600
Yeah.

877
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,600
Oh, sorry.

878
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,600
Noisy cricket.

879
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,600
We all want noisy crickets.

880
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,600
Too late.

881
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:48,840
Okay.

882
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,840
Noisy crickets, please.

883
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,440
Does it have to exist on earth?

884
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,440
Tiny powerful guns.

885
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,520
I mean, that's all that is.

886
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:57,520
I want to roll for a super tiny powerful gun.

887
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,520
Okay.

888
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,400
No, regular tiny super powerful.

889
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,400
Okay.

890
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,400
Go ahead and roll luck.

891
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,400
20.

892
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:07,520
You find a very tiny, very powerful gun.

893
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,100
Hell yeah.

894
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:14,440
What about a really sophisticated in-ear communication pieces?

895
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,440
Oh, I hate that.

896
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,440
Yeah.

897
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,440
That might be too game-breaking.

898
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,440
We've already got radios.

899
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,440
We've got radios.

900
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,440
We've got cell phones.

901
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:23,280
I just thought it would be if we were sneaking around, we could use them.

902
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,080
They like read your thoughts and send them to the other players.

903
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,080
Okay.

904
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,200
These aren't like unnatural items.

905
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,120
These are just crazy technological items.

906
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:35,640
That's my luck roll, by the way.

907
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:38,460
I'm randomly rolling.

908
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:41,200
Thomas just rolled an odd one.

909
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,200
Wait.

910
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,200
Can I change mine?

911
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,200
No.

912
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,200
Oh, fuck.

913
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:47,960
Give your idea to someone else.

914
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:54,520
Well, I wanted a really cool wheelchair.

915
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:59,880
Can I please?

916
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,800
You can convince one of them to do it.

917
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:05,960
Guys, if one of you wants my really powerful tiny gun, you could get like guns.

918
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:09,500
You want a turret mounted wheelchair?

919
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:12,000
I don't know about that.

920
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:17,340
I want a gigantic fucking 50 cal sniper rifle, the kind that can take down helicopters and

921
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:18,800
like large trucks.

922
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:19,800
Roll for it.

923
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:22,280
Yeah, one.

924
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:24,080
Please roll for it.

925
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,080
Dude.

926
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,080
Yeah.

927
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,080
It's so good.

928
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,080
If only.

929
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,080
Yeah.

930
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,080
You got it.

931
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,080
Okay.

932
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:32,080
Joe, what are you thinking?

933
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,080
I don't know.

934
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,080
Mortars.

935
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:35,080
I didn't know I was going to get a match.

936
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:36,080
It's a real shame we don't edit this part.

937
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:39,160
Some people, when they play a game like this, might take a moment to think.

938
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:40,840
There might be a lot of downtime.

939
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:41,840
We don't.

940
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:45,800
You will never hear that because it doesn't happen.

941
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,800
So are you thinking weapons or like a gadget?

942
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:51,000
I keep waffling back and forth, but I mean either one would be fine.

943
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,760
A waffle iron.

944
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:53,760
Wish for a waffle iron.

945
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:57,720
Like a really nice set of golf clubs.

946
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:00,900
A lifetime supply of the TV dinners.

947
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:02,540
We should have a mortar.

948
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:07,280
What about just like a really fancy, cool ass, uh, like revolver?

949
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:11,080
Just like what's dirty hair you use in that a big ass revolver?

950
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,320
I don't know anything about guns.

951
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:15,600
I think, I think real big revolver is pretty cool and coppish.

952
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:17,000
Opposite of what I got.

953
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
But also...

954
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,960
It's a huge, weak gun.

955
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:27,360
Consider we might have a, uh, a compound like full of hundreds of homeless people.

956
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:29,280
I think we should get some mortars.

957
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,840
What are you trying to say, John?

958
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:35,640
I think we should be prepared to shell vast numbers of the enemy.

959
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:38,160
Who's to say they're the enemy?

960
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,160
Or what about like a drone?

961
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:40,160
Yeah, right.

962
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:43,280
The fact that this is a rollpoint armed drone.

963
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,280
They're probably just misunderstood.

964
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,760
Yeah, I don't know.

965
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:48,280
It's between a drone and a big ass pistol.

966
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:50,280
Oh dude, drone, drone, drone, drone, drone, drone, drone, drone, drone, drone.

967
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:51,280
Should I get a drone?

968
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,280
Can I get a drone?

969
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:53,280
I hope you fail your roll.

970
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,280
But yeah, you can roll.

971
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:55,280
Pass.

972
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,280
All right.

973
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:57,280
Yes.

974
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,280
We got a drone.

975
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:00,880
Yeah, we've got a big ass predator drone.

976
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:01,880
Okay.

977
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:03,560
It can be just the...

978
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:04,560
Pull it back.

979
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:05,560
All right.

980
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:06,560
Hey.

981
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:07,560
It's a nice one though.

982
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:08,560
It's nice.

983
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:09,560
Cool.

984
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:11,960
I'm going to start cutting into that plastic wrapped cube.

985
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:12,960
Okay.

986
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,160
I want to examine it before.

987
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:20,240
As you're examining it, you examine Keith Vigna cutting into this giant plastic wrapped

988
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,240
cube.

989
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:27,680
And as you dig your knife a little bit too far into it, a white powder starts pouring

990
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:28,680
out of it.

991
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:29,680
Let me see that.

992
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:30,680
Step aside.

993
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:35,720
I roll aside.

994
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:43,800
As you begin to take off the outer layers of plastic wrap, you would see that this is

995
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:46,960
bricks upon bricks of cocaine.

996
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:51,140
Guys, there must be 25, 20 bricks of cocaine here.

997
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:55,680
It is precisely way more than 25 bricks of cocaine.

998
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,600
This is an entire palette.

999
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:04,880
And as you begin counting, based on the math that you guys are, I'm assuming, great at

1000
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:11,120
based on your characters, it is precisely 479 bricks of cocaine.

1001
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:12,120
Hell yeah.

1002
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:13,120
Quick math.

1003
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:18,360
I mean, it is 478.

1004
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:20,400
Write down 478 bricks of cocaine.

1005
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:21,400
Okay.

1006
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:23,680
One brick is clearly missing from the pile.

1007
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,600
I think that we can come back to...

1008
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:29,520
Someone must have gotten here before us.

1009
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:30,520
Useful items to have.

1010
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:31,520
I don't know.

1011
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,400
An army of homeless people.

1012
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:36,760
If you guys want to do a quick Google search, a brick.

1013
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:44,720
What to do when you find a weapon is worth $25,000, which means an entire palette is

1014
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:48,160
worth roughly $12 million of cocaine.

1015
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:52,680
Guys, I don't know what I'm talking about right now, but what do I do?

1016
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:53,680
Because I'm Thomas.

1017
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:54,680
I'm not.

1018
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:55,680
I think we found a green room.

1019
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:56,680
Maybe.

1020
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:57,680
So I drop...

1021
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:58,680
What are the green boxes?

1022
00:45:58,680 --> 00:45:59,680
Yeah.

1023
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:00,680
Cool.

1024
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:01,680
The Gs.

1025
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:02,680
They're in the Gs for green.

1026
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,960
This is a pretty poppin' box.

1027
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,960
You want to go to the next one?

1028
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:07,960
Yeah.

1029
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:10,600
You guys close this one down.

1030
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:11,600
And lock it back up.

1031
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:12,600
Lock it back up.

1032
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:13,600
I take that.

1033
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:14,600
50 cal.

1034
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:15,600
Ammunition for same.

1035
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:16,880
I pocket some pistols.

1036
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:17,880
Yeah.

1037
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:19,880
Let's load up some guns and stuff in the back of the cruisers.

1038
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:23,880
You guys can drive your two cruisers back there and pile some stuff in there.

1039
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:24,880
Cool.

1040
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,920
And I pocket my regular tiny super powerful gun.

1041
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:27,920
Of course you do.

1042
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:28,920
I'll name it later.

1043
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:29,920
Perfect.

1044
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:30,920
What's its name?

1045
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:31,920
I'll name it later.

1046
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:35,040
Oh, that's not a very good name.

1047
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:42,920
Inside G11 is a burlap sack containing $50,000 in shredded blue dye stained banknotes, a

1048
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:48,960
piece of notebook paper with poorly drawn diagrams and nearly illegible writing, two

1049
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:58,600
25 pound bags of potatoes, a ziplock bag containing five bulbs of garlic, a garlic crusher, an

1050
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:07,380
empty test tube, and a syringe, a small drawstring Nike bag, a three million candle power hand

1051
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:15,480
held spotlight, a well filled toolbox, a black leather backpack, a bottle of caffeine pills,

1052
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:21,760
a carton of cigarettes, three shovels, a small digital scale, a syringe labeled morphine,

1053
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:26,640
a handful of ski masks, walkie talkies, and a burned CD.

1054
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:27,640
Could you repeat that?

1055
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:28,960
Inside G11.

1056
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,280
What is on the, is the burned CD marked?

1057
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:34,120
It says monster mash mash.

1058
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:35,120
Dope.

1059
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:36,120
Yeah.

1060
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:37,120
Hell yeah.

1061
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:38,120
Okay.

1062
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:44,880
So, real fast, just to throw it out there, Joe, the Delta Green player is super stoked

1063
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:50,120
about having all this stuff, but like we're police officers investigating a missing person.

1064
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:53,240
Like we just, we're just taking all of the shit we find.

1065
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:54,800
That seems a little weird.

1066
00:47:54,800 --> 00:48:01,000
I think he would rationalize it that he's seen some fucked up shit last night and he

1067
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:05,640
wants to be prepared for anything and this seems like it's heaven sent.

1068
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:06,640
I love it.

1069
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:07,640
That's right.

1070
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:08,640
That's right.

1071
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:09,640
This is the Lord's word.

1072
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:13,600
So it looks like we might be dealing with like some bank robbers.

1073
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,360
I want to look in the Nike bag.

1074
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:17,000
There's nothing in there.

1075
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,520
Is there anything in the leather backpack?

1076
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:24,000
The leather backpack contains a set of lock picks, wire cutters, wire strippers, a crimping

1077
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,840
tool, flattened Phillips head screwdrivers, and a lockout tool.

1078
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:28,840
Cool.

1079
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:29,840
Grab that bad boy.

1080
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:30,840
I mean, grab everything.

1081
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:32,840
There's morphine that could keep us going.

1082
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:36,800
We go out and call Drew and ask him to send a U-Haul down here.

1083
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,880
Do you want to do that?

1084
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:39,880
Yeah.

1085
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:40,880
Kind of, yeah.

1086
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:41,880
Yeah, let's do that.

1087
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:42,880
Well, actually, we have the key.

1088
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:43,960
Logistically, we have the keys.

1089
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:45,120
This shit is all here.

1090
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:46,120
This could be our base of operations.

1091
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:47,120
That's true.

1092
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:48,120
Usually as a safe house for ourselves.

1093
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:51,200
But what if they have an extra set of keys?

1094
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,200
Let's get out of here.

1095
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:53,200
Let's get this stuff.

1096
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,280
Let's U-Haul it out.

1097
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:55,580
People might try to take it.

1098
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:57,880
Just anybody might come in here and try to take it.

1099
00:48:57,880 --> 00:48:59,320
We're confiscating it for evidence.

1100
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:00,320
Yeah, exactly.

1101
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:04,440
We can put it in the evidence room, which is probably pretty sound.

1102
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:05,440
You do have an evidence room.

1103
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:06,440
Yeah.

1104
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:07,440
We'll put it in there.

1105
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:08,440
Let's open.

1106
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:09,440
Yeah.

1107
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:10,440
What's behind door number three?

1108
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:14,800
A trip to France.

1109
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:22,240
Inside G12 is a four-wheeler with dried dirt and clay caked all over the thing, as well

1110
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:26,400
as a couple of plastic trunks.

1111
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:31,560
Near the door is a small chunk of paper that has been folded into the size of a business

1112
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:36,820
card, and against the back wall is a small table with some papers on it.

1113
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:38,320
Was there a paper in G11, too?

1114
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:39,320
No.

1115
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:40,320
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1116
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:41,320
Sorry.

1117
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:42,320
There was a piece of notebook paper.

1118
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:43,320
With the scribbles, yeah.

1119
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:45,360
Poorly drawn diagrams and nearly illegible writing.

1120
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:47,000
Do any of you guys have heavy machinery?

1121
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
No.

1122
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Don't think I have any repair shit.

1123
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Yeah, I don't see any repair.

1124
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Okay.

1125
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,080
I want to find someone who would know more about that.

1126
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:55,480
I want to look at the small chunk of paper first.

1127
00:49:55,480 --> 00:50:01,400
The small chunk of paper, as you unfold it, there are some ripped up bedding stubs inside

1128
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:02,880
of it that fall out.

1129
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:09,720
The piece of paper is on a thicker cardstock, and looking at it, you can tell that this

1130
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:15,720
is the translator paper on which people place their bets to see what they're betting on.

1131
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:21,960
So it's got the odds, and each number from the bedding stubs is in relation to a name

1132
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:27,000
on the bedding paper, and it's got a date at the top, and it says October 31st.

1133
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
What are the names?

1134
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:33,440
There were three things that you could bet on on October 31st.

1135
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,800
Hold on.

1136
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:37,560
Did you like that dick I drew, Zach?

1137
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:39,360
I did like that dick you drew, Thomas.

1138
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:40,760
You drew the stinky foot?

1139
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:41,760
Did you do better?

1140
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:43,080
Oh, the stick's a real stinky foot.

1141
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:44,080
It's a stinky foot.

1142
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:45,080
Did you like that dick I drew?

1143
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:46,080
Did you like that dick I drew?

1144
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:47,080
That dick you drew?

1145
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:48,080
That.

1146
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:49,080
Wowee!

1147
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:58,480
Every time you drew that dick you drew.

1148
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:08,440
The three names are Oz, Mayhem, Wolf, Miles, Detonator, Carver, and Carl Blitzkrieg Anderson.

1149
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,880
Are any of us familiar with those names?

1150
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:11,880
Is this like MMA?

1151
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:12,880
Do we even?

1152
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:13,880
We got no.

1153
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:14,880
It sounds like boxers.

1154
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:16,160
Carl Blitzkrieg Anderson.

1155
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:21,120
At the bottom it said versus Planet Juggernaut.

1156
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:26,960
Is there any way that John Lee Pennymore doesn't know about a place called Planet Juggernaut?

1157
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:28,600
It was versus tonight.

1158
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:31,680
Oh, Planet Juggernaut is- Something these three things are versing,

1159
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:32,680
I think.

1160
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:33,680
Oh, God.

1161
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:34,680
So cool.

1162
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:35,680
Super cool.

1163
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:42,600
The ripped up bedding stubs, you can tell he lost, lost, lost, and over the night lost

1164
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,480
$5,000.

1165
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:51,040
The last fight he bet on something with like 30 to one odds.

1166
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:52,680
They were all- Not smart.

1167
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:54,200
And they were all kind of bad odds?

1168
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:55,200
Yeah.

1169
00:51:55,200 --> 00:52:01,320
The first two were probably closer to five to one, six to one, and then the last one

1170
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:02,320
was 30 to one.

1171
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,640
So he gets like desperate after losing that money?

1172
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:05,640
Exactly.

1173
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:09,760
Does a Google search for any of those names turn up information on the participants or

1174
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:10,760
the sport?

1175
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:11,760
Oh, yeah.

1176
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,640
Give me the name of one of those fighters.

1177
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:15,080
Oz Mayhem Wolf.

1178
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:16,080
Yeah.

1179
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:24,080
So Oz Mayhem Wolf, it will come up that he has been in like low time MMA fights or amateur

1180
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:27,360
cage boxing or cage fighting, whatever that sport's called.

1181
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:31,080
It's professional fighters, but in cages built by amateurs.

1182
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:32,080
Nice.

1183
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:38,000
So it's just like, there's a risk that it's really shoddy.

1184
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Yeah.

1185
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
No joke.

1186
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:44,480
What's in the plastic trunks?

1187
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:49,720
Inside one of the trunks is a box of assorted batteries, spools of electric wiring, three

1188
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:56,320
disassembled handguns, and an impossibly clean machete sitting atop three full suits, including

1189
00:52:56,320 --> 00:53:02,120
shirt, tie, and shoes, all covered in dirt, clay, and black stains that look to be blood.

1190
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:06,120
Do we need to take a sanity check for seeing an impossibly clean machete?

1191
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:07,120
Luke.

1192
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:08,120
Yes.

1193
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:09,720
Luke.

1194
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:10,720
Yes.

1195
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:15,240
As you approach the other plastic trunk, this one has the lid fastened.

1196
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:18,360
The stench is nearly unbearable.

1197
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:20,400
The trunk is clear and without-

1198
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:23,200
I bet there's a hundred homeless people on this truck.

1199
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:33,760
Without opening the lid, you can see only a dried black crust, which is painted on every

1200
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:36,760
bit of the trunk's insides.

1201
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:42,440
I'll investigate this one back at the lab.

1202
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:46,480
I'm not going to open it in here right now, but let's go see what those papers-

1203
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:47,960
Yeah, take a look at the table.

1204
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:48,960
Okay.

1205
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:55,120
You guys walk back and there is a note handwritten on a piece of paper.

1206
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:57,000
What's that say, John?

1207
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,200
The cabin is in the woods.

1208
00:53:58,200 --> 00:53:59,200
Love that movie.

1209
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:01,920
Stark West from the end of the trail about two and a half miles.

1210
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:02,920
K.

1211
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:05,800
We took care of nine of them as well as the leader.

1212
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:06,840
Okay.

1213
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:12,160
And there is also a sheet that seems to be ripped out of a notebook.

1214
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:14,880
This one is also handwritten in different handwriting.

1215
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:21,800
It says, the work is difficult and particular, but I've had 12 successes.

1216
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:24,840
Life isn't as complex as they believe.

1217
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:25,840
They are quite simple.

1218
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:27,680
It will be their downfall.

1219
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:32,160
And the last is, it's a cutout from an old newspaper.

1220
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:35,240
Cole's Orphanage, new school under modern etiquette.

1221
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:38,480
We are here to serve the beautiful community of contention.

1222
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:42,280
Is Cole ... Do you remember Cole's Orphanage?

1223
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:43,440
I don't ... That doesn't ring a bell.

1224
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:44,440
The only thing I can think about-

1225
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:49,240
Didn't we used to go to school with hundreds of smelly orphans?

1226
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:52,680
Well, this probably doesn't mean anything.

1227
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:55,200
Let's crumble a month down the way.

1228
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:56,520
Cole's Orphanage.

1229
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:58,600
Cole was the counterpart to beans, right?

1230
00:54:58,600 --> 00:54:59,600
Yeah.

1231
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:00,600
Silas Cole, right?

1232
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:01,600
Oh, yeah.

1233
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:02,600
Yep.

1234
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:03,600
Okay.

1235
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:06,280
I'm going to ask some old-timers around here and see if they remember that.

1236
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:12,600
Silas Cole is still known as being one of the founders of this town.

1237
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:17,000
He was the owner of the mine for a couple of years.

1238
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:25,000
And his wife, Mary Cole, did a lot of good in the community, and the library is named

1239
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
after her.

1240
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,780
It's the Mary Cole Library.

1241
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:32,720
So one could assume that someone opening this orphanage probably named it after her.

1242
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:36,240
Is there any sign on the clipping of the newspaper what newspaper it came from?

1243
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:37,840
The Contention Chronicle.

1244
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:41,580
But I don't remember a Cole's Orphanage, because I am 37.

1245
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:43,560
It must have opened and closed real quick, right?

1246
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:47,640
Yeah, we should keep this on our radar and try to ask Drew to find out some stuff about

1247
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:48,640
it.

1248
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:49,640
Cool.

1249
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:50,640
Is U-Haul here yet?

1250
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:51,640
Yes.

1251
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:52,640
Do you want to load literally everything?

1252
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:53,640
Yeah.

1253
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:54,640
Mm-hmm.

1254
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:56,600
I also want to ride out of here on that four-wheeler.

1255
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:57,600
Does a four-wheeler run?

1256
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:58,600
Can you drive my cruiser?

1257
00:55:58,600 --> 00:55:59,600
Are there keys to the four-wheeler?

1258
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:00,600
Yes.

1259
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:01,600
Cool.

1260
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:02,600
Are you actually going to ride it out?

1261
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:04,480
Yeah.

1262
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:05,480
Okay.

1263
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:06,480
I'll drive your cruiser back then.

1264
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:10,400
I take my shirt off and I get on the four-wheeler.

1265
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:17,000
Just John and some a little bit too tight britches hopping on this four-wheeler without

1266
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
a shirt on.

1267
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,520
Is this like the three bears pants situation?

1268
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:22,720
The farts are just right.

1269
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:27,360
What should we do?

1270
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:32,280
I think take it all back to the evidence room and sort it out into different categories

1271
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:33,960
Catalog it all?

1272
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:37,480
Yeah, catalog it all and then try to do some investigating on the stuff that doesn't make

1273
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:38,480
sense to us.

1274
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,320
Well, man, there's just so much crime all of a sudden.

1275
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:43,480
Why does it fall to us to deal with that?

1276
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:49,040
Quick cut to the sick montage of you guys loading everything into the evidence room.

1277
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:54,920
Like spraying each other with bullets.

1278
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:55,920
Roll firearms.

1279
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:56,920
Throw encasings.

1280
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:57,920
Throw it, yeah, exactly.

1281
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:02,120
I get tired so I do a quick bump and I'm like, ready to go?

1282
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:03,120
Oh yeah.

1283
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:07,240
I meant to ask you, are you doing any of that cocaine?

1284
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:08,760
I'm not right now.

1285
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:10,600
I'm not doing it right now, but yes.

1286
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:12,480
Keith has been known to dabble.

1287
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:13,480
Yeah.

1288
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:14,480
Clark is a straightener.

1289
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:15,480
Under Clark's eye.

1290
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:16,480
I'm adjusting.

1291
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:21,440
John is taking this to the family reunion and selling it.

1292
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:22,440
I'm not doing it with Clark next to me.

1293
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:26,840
Do you think a contention cop makes a fucking lot of money?

1294
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:27,840
No.

1295
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:29,760
He does not.

1296
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:30,760
Okay, so can we cut to...

1297
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:31,760
It's all catalogued.

1298
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:32,760
Yeah.

1299
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:33,760
Absolutely.

1300
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:34,760
Cool.

1301
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:35,760
Wow, guys, we really put our heads together and made that happen.

1302
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:37,360
You guys really worked through the day too.

1303
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:39,680
You skipped lunch and now it's done at 2 p.m.

1304
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:40,680
How nice.

1305
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:44,280
In the process of cataloguing stuff, did anything new catch our eyes?

1306
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:48,480
Because that's the time when anything would have crossed our vision in particular.

1307
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:50,320
I mean, did you want to look into anything?

1308
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:53,320
I gave you basically the outline of what each thing is.

1309
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:58,200
I want to get Drew to get info on Cole's orphanage and then also see if he can find

1310
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:00,600
anybody that knows about those diagrams that we saw.

1311
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:01,600
Okay, cool.

1312
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:02,600
Very good.

1313
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:04,080
Do we want to do anything with the crusty tub?

1314
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:05,080
Oh, yeah.

1315
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:06,080
Now that we're back...

1316
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:07,080
Yeah, we need to check it out.

1317
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:08,080
I want to...

1318
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:11,560
I mean, maybe it's gore, but it might also be...

1319
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:13,480
Somebody might have isolated some of the black stuff.

1320
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:16,760
Should we do that in the evidence room or should we go outside or...

1321
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:17,760
I don't know.

1322
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:18,760
I'm kind of nervous about it.

1323
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:19,880
Clark is kind of nervous about it.

1324
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:22,880
I'm nervous about it too because this is shit that Keith has seen.

1325
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:26,960
Those lockers were full of weaponry, so if this is some kind of weapon...

1326
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:29,960
Man, I hope nobody comes looking for us.

1327
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:30,960
How about this?

1328
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:31,960
Because we ticked our fangs.

1329
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:32,960
I'll go into...

1330
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:33,960
I assume...

1331
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:35,560
Do we have like a jail cell?

1332
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:36,560
Yeah.

1333
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:38,960
I want to go into one of those with this tub and open it up.

1334
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:40,440
You're taking that upon yourself, Keith?

1335
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:43,000
I've got one leg and I'm doing it.

1336
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,440
I'm interested too.

1337
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:51,080
The rancid smell of old metal hits your nostrils and atop this pile of what looks like a messily

1338
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:56,360
chopped up human body sits a woman's head split down the middle and pulled apart with

1339
00:58:56,360 --> 00:59:00,480
a small silver sphere sitting in between the two halves.

1340
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:01,480
Well, this could be anything.

1341
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:02,480
Hell yeah.

1342
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:03,480
Real sanity?

1343
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:04,480
Pass.

1344
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:05,480
I passed.

1345
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:07,280
I passed.

1346
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:08,960
You all wear old hands.

1347
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:10,960
I crit pass if that helps me in any way.

1348
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:11,960
Oh, yeah, it does.

1349
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:12,960
How about you don't look?

1350
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:13,960
Okay.

1351
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:14,960
Yeah.

1352
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:15,960
Does that work for you?

1353
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:16,960
For sure.

1354
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:19,680
Keith and John, you both lose one sanity on a pass.

1355
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:21,040
Are you going to put the lid back on?

1356
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:22,040
Oh, yeah, I am.

1357
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:23,040
Okay.

1358
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:24,040
Actually, wait.

1359
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:29,120
I'm going to like snap for evidence, snap a picture of this and see can we identify?

1360
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:30,120
Identifiable.

1361
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:31,120
Yeah.

1362
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:35,080
The only thing that's really, I mean, it is cleaved into.

1363
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:36,080
Yes.

1364
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:38,200
Cleft in twain.

1365
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:39,200
If you will.

1366
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,080
Clove in twove.

1367
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:43,240
It's cloved in twoved.

1368
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:44,680
And if you put the halves together.

1369
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:46,720
If you smash them together.

1370
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:52,360
It's like trying to make a face.

1371
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:58,520
So it's, you say it's identifiable, but we can't, I mean, we recognize this person?

1372
00:59:58,520 --> 00:59:59,520
No.

1373
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:02,160
But it's identifiable to someone that would have known this person.

1374
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:04,600
Like did you mean it's recognizably a person?

1375
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:07,080
It's recognizably a woman's head.

1376
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:09,800
But like, it's not really, it's so old.

1377
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:10,800
This has been.

1378
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:12,800
Well, that's, how about this?

1379
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:17,360
I'm going to take a picture of it, take a picture of it, close it back up and send this

1380
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:19,200
box to the corner.

1381
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:20,200
Let him deal with it.

1382
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:24,400
Before we do that, I want to take a look at the little silver ball in the skull.

1383
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:25,400
Do you want to grab it?

1384
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:26,400
Yeah.

1385
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:27,400
Let's grab it.

1386
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:28,400
Okay.

1387
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:29,400
You grab it.

1388
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:30,880
Look, it's a little silver sphere.

1389
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:32,140
About how big?

1390
01:00:32,140 --> 01:00:34,560
About the size of a large marble.

1391
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:39,840
And by large marble, I mean it's one inch in diameter.

1392
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:41,840
So the radius is a half inch.

1393
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:43,880
I hold onto it for good luck.

1394
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:44,880
What's the circumference?

1395
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:45,880
Awesome.

1396
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:46,880
Oh shit.

1397
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:48,960
I don't know that good a man.

1398
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:52,560
Should we send this to the corner just to see if we can get anything out of it?

1399
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:55,400
It didn't like attack and kill us, so I assume.

1400
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:57,560
Why would you assume a dead body would do that?

1401
01:00:57,560 --> 01:01:00,520
I've seen some fucked up shit today and yesterday.

1402
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:01,520
Like what?

1403
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:32,160
How am I the only one trying to pull over How can you have enough drowning out of the
