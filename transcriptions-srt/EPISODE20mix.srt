1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,880
Greetings my sheeple, it's your shepherd, wolf the dog, and I'm here to shear all your

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,120
wooly little coats so y'all can be a little more comfortable today.

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,040
And when I say shear your coats, I really mean give y'all some updates on what's really

4
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:25,000
going down here in contention from 694.2 PTBP my babies.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,540
This week on Howlin' with Wolf, your best buddy wolf is gonna read one of those fine

6
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:36,540
5 star reviews from iTunes because it makes wolf feel oh so nice and makes him feel like

7
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:42,740
he's part of a community instead of just isolated in this basement studio here in dreary old

8
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:43,740
contention.

9
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:53,540
Emma Mara was kind enough to write a 5 star review titled Horror, Jokes, and Mystery!

10
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:59,460
The review reads, A really great listen if you love D&D podcasts that have a strong narrative

11
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:00,740
focus.

12
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:05,100
Really fun for those of us that care more about the mystery than about the mechanics

13
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,700
of dice rolls.

14
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:11,300
This one has a mix of good humor and a pretty chilling story line.

15
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,300
Hell yeah, Emma.

16
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:18,700
Your buddy wolf loves a set of mechanics that don't interfere with the story telling.

17
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,820
Last time the story was getting wild.

18
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,620
It's the news y'all.

19
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:28,820
A vocal group of the contention population are protesting and letting these officers

20
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:30,740
know how they feel.

21
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:36,820
Drew apologized to the officers for not passing along critical information like calls about

22
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:42,620
missing persons, animals in the ponds and creeks, and a voicemail from the feds.

23
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:49,540
Doug, Dr. Marie Jacobs' husband who is currently inhabiting the body of the cat Salem, showed

24
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:54,740
the officers the animals are hiding in the water because the oily substance cannot get

25
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,260
them in the ponds and creeks.

26
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:04,700
Randy Angst, dentist, estate salesman, and historical society member reveal some interesting

27
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:10,700
information to the officers about the picture from the odd camera John found in Julie Maxwell's

28
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:14,740
car as well as about Cole's orphanage.

29
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:21,660
In James the mill worker's house, they found a cache of guns hidden under the coffee table,

30
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:27,260
a bunch of cleaning supplies and random materials and a small enclave behind an oil painting

31
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:33,500
of a rose, a few loose tiles in the kitchen where something buried has been dragged out,

32
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:39,900
and a 12 foot deep pit under a trap door with two corpses and an officer Clark Bishop at

33
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:40,900
the bottom.

34
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:46,220
A heavy artillery weapon is being fired into the house from the front yard.

35
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,340
This shit is intense y'all.

36
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,780
You know what though?

37
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:54,720
This calls for the premiere of a brand new song here on PTPP.

38
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,060
This is Kudzu with No Backbone.

39
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:35,380
Okay, so Clark is stuck in the bottom of a viscerally foul smelling 12 foot deep pit

40
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:41,460
next to two corpses looking up at Keith and John who is lowering down one pant leg of

41
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:45,140
Randy Angst's shit spoiled slacks.

42
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:51,060
Just then, a brutally loud noise erupts from outside in the front yard and items in the

43
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,580
house begin shattering.

44
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:58,980
You are being fired on by some large artillery weapon.

45
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:04,540
Your ears are shot and your vision clouds as dust billows about the room.

46
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:10,900
The drywall is ripped to shreds, letting cold air and moonlight into the house.

47
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:15,260
I need you to roll dodge in order to run or die for cover.

48
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:19,740
Clark, you're actually in cover right now.

49
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:21,220
What's going on up there?

50
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,220
I got a...

51
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,220
I don't pass.

52
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,340
39 out of 30.

53
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,060
I do pass 42 out of 50.

54
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:30,180
I don't remember putting points into dodge, but I'm really happy I did.

55
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,180
Okay.

56
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:34,260
Success is going to gain you one D6 of cover.

57
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:37,460
So what are you hiding behind after you roll?

58
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:38,460
We'll find out.

59
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,460
Okay, yeah.

60
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:40,460
I got a five.

61
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:46,940
I'm on my way to get those shit pants, so I tumble into the bathroom and take Randy

62
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,620
Anx with me into the tub.

63
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:49,620
Awesome.

64
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:50,620
Fucking baller, dog.

65
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:51,620
Pantsless Randy.

66
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:52,620
Pantsless Randy.

67
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:57,860
These extremely large rounds are still going to fly through the house, so I need you both

68
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:00,980
to roll luck to see if you get hit.

69
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:04,620
15 on a 55.

70
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:05,620
Two on a 65.

71
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,260
Way to roll good, boy.

72
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,860
We are some lucky boys.

73
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,260
You lucky sons of guns.

74
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,260
All right.

75
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,260
I need...

76
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,260
Call my mom a bitch.

77
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,260
I need all of you to roll.

78
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:16,260
Take that out.

79
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,260
Take that out.

80
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,260
I love my mom.

81
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:24,020
Call my mom a bitch.

82
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:28,580
My parents were humans and not firearms.

83
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:31,980
I need you all to roll sanity for me.

84
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:32,980
Just a zero one.

85
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,980
Oh, what's my sanity at?

86
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:35,980
Oh, I pass.

87
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:36,980
Including me.

88
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,980
Including you for the fire.

89
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,980
Oh, I pass.

90
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,980
13 on a 29.

91
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:45,980
I got a 50 on a 20, so I don't pass.

92
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:46,980
Oh, no.

93
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:47,980
50 on a 29.

94
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:48,980
So I still don't pass.

95
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,660
John, you just lose one.

96
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:51,980
The other boys don't lose any.

97
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:54,540
Keith, you're going to be the only one who can see this.

98
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,180
I would tell them anyway.

99
00:05:56,180 --> 00:06:02,540
The front door of the house flies back into the foyer like a playing card being thrown.

100
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:06,420
A staggering figure walks slowly through the doorway.

101
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:12,660
He is a looming, overweight man wearing an all-black combat uniform, and he has a large

102
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:15,080
scar over his right eye.

103
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:20,680
He holds up his left hand and you see his arm is cut off at his wrist, but there is

104
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,940
a wire attached to the nub.

105
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:29,100
You hear a zzzzip as the wire begins retracting into his arm and you see the front door whip

106
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,740
back into his possession.

107
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:33,620
He holds it up like a shield as he faces you.

108
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:34,620
Roll Sanity.

109
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:37,140
They just gave us a D&D boss.

110
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:39,700
We just got into Resident Evil.

111
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,620
I pass again on a 10 on a 26.

112
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:46,820
Okay, Keith, you just let out a shriek as you lose one sanity.

113
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:51,220
That was really good.

114
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,660
You take direction really well.

115
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:57,820
If only we had equipped ourselves with all these weapons and body armor.

116
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:01,700
I was just supposed to say, did we officially put them in the car?

117
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,300
We did nothing with them.

118
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,660
So they're still just on that table, right?

119
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:08,860
And I'm like very close to that table, right?

120
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,860
Tell me when it's my turn.

121
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:11,860
Keith, it's your turn.

122
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:12,860
What do you do?

123
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:13,860
I forgot what we were doing.

124
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,500
Like how far away is the table full of guns?

125
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,540
It's a move action away.

126
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,540
Okay.

127
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,180
Let me ask you this.

128
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:26,180
Can I pull my sidearm and shoot at him while I move to that table?

129
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,180
Yes.

130
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,180
In one move.

131
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,660
You will take a negative 20 percent.

132
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,660
On my firearms?

133
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,660
Yes.

134
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,020
I rolled a five.

135
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,020
Hell yeah.

136
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,020
Fuck yeah, dude.

137
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,020
Is it too late?

138
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:40,860
I guess I already rolled, so it's too late for me to do like a called shot.

139
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:41,860
Yeah.

140
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:42,860
Okay.

141
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:43,860
Okay.

142
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:44,860
Then I just shoot at him.

143
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:48,740
You move toward the flipped over coffee table full of guns and body armor and such as you

144
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:51,500
fire at this giant man.

145
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,500
Quick question.

146
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,740
I don't know if we said we should put that on or if I said I...

147
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:56,740
Should.

148
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:57,740
Okay.

149
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:00,740
So go ahead and roll a d10 for damage.

150
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:01,740
10.

151
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:02,740
Holy shit.

152
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:03,740
No, it's a...

153
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:04,740
It's a one.

154
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:05,740
Fuck.

155
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:06,740
It was a one.

156
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:07,740
God damn it.

157
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:08,740
Oh, wait.

158
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:09,740
But that was a...

159
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,740
Yeah.

160
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,740
I'll re...

161
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:12,740
Yeah.

162
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:13,740
It was a one.

163
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:14,740
Okay.

164
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:20,740
So you were firing center mass at this guy, but as you're running away...

165
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,700
Am I running away or towards him?

166
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,060
You're running away from him toward the table.

167
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,060
Okay.

168
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,060
I was thinking that it was...

169
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,060
So it's not in between us.

170
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,060
No.

171
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,060
Okay.

172
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:34,700
As you're running toward the coffee table, you are firing at him and you clip his arms

173
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:41,060
and you hear one ricochet off, but you hear another one go in, but it's not a through

174
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:44,160
and through and you just hear this like, okay.

175
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:47,220
So it's like the bullet is lodged into one of his arms.

176
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,220
Yeah.

177
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:50,020
As I'm running and shooting in between...

178
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,260
How many shots do I fire?

179
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,260
Three.

180
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:56,780
In between shots, I'm screaming mainly at John, but also to Clark.

181
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,380
Hey guys, we got company.

182
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,380
I need help.

183
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,380
John, what do you do?

184
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:02,180
I say, Randy, you stay right here.

185
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,740
Are there two stories or one story in this house?

186
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:05,740
One.

187
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:06,740
Okay.

188
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,380
How close is the bathroom to the back door?

189
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,380
Halfway.

190
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:13,540
Hey, just remember the sniper rifle is in the bathroom with you.

191
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:17,140
I just remembered that the sniper rifle was in the bathroom with me.

192
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,140
Sorry.

193
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:22,740
Randy rolls over in the bathtub and he was like laying on it.

194
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:23,740
Randy.

195
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:26,340
Randy, do you know how to use a pistol?

196
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:28,260
Oh yes, of course.

197
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,260
Really?

198
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,260
Did you just stay here?

199
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:32,540
I should probably just stay here.

200
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:33,540
Okay.

201
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,820
All right.

202
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,460
You stay put, buddy.

203
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,380
Contention PDs on this.

204
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:43,100
And I bust out the door with my pistol in one hand and like sniper rifle at my hip.

205
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:46,020
You're immediately looking down a hallway that looks into the foyer.

206
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,600
The foyer is the room this is all happening in?

207
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,540
The foyer is the room where this man is, yeah.

208
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,540
Can I see him?

209
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,540
Oh yeah.

210
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:52,540
Okay.

211
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:55,220
He's on the other side of the hole in the ground where Clark resides.

212
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,220
Okay.

213
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:01,260
So I take some cover behind the bathroom door, temporarily holster my pistol, and I'm going

214
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,060
to take a sniper rifle shot.

215
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,660
Like I'm going to line it up and try to plunk this guy in the head.

216
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:09,340
I don't know if that's a called shot, but I want to use the best ... I'm just going

217
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,340
to shoot him with a sniper rifle.

218
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,340
Okay.

219
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,340
Sounds good.

220
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,340
Yeah.

221
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,340
Just straight up and down.

222
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,340
Firearms roll.

223
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,340
98 on a 60.

224
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,340
98 on a 60.

225
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,700
Could have been worse.

226
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,740
You accidentally shoot yourself in the head with a firearm.

227
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:27,180
You shoot out the window in the front of the house that looks out on the street.

228
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,680
Clark, it's your turn.

229
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,300
How deep is this hole that I'm in?

230
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,300
12 feet.

231
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,300
How deep is this hole that I'm in?

232
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,300
How tall are you?

233
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,300
Probably six foot something.

234
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,300
Yeah.

235
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,660
Is the hole perfectly square?

236
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,460
Am I in an enclosed space?

237
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:41,460
Yes.

238
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:42,460
What are the dimensions?

239
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,460
Five by five.

240
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,460
By?

241
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,460
Five.

242
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,460
So it's-

243
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,460
No.

244
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,460
Five by five by 12.

245
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:49,460
Yeah.

246
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:55,300
He's just standing there, his head's broken up.

247
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,300
Totally exposed.

248
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,300
Guys.

249
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,300
Guys, help me.

250
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,300
He's like standing-

251
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:02,740
The giant guy just kicks Clark's head off.

252
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:04,300
Five by five by 12.

253
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:08,900
I got nothing, so I'm going to look through the pockets of these people down here.

254
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:13,060
He's just kidding.

255
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:15,020
Clark is becoming one of us.

256
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,020
Police work.

257
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,020
I got nothing.

258
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,780
Police work never sleeps.

259
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:23,100
Rifling through the pockets of these corpses, you find-

260
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,100
A ladder.

261
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,100
Sweet.

262
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:28,700
Go, go gadget ladder.

263
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:36,740
You find a piece of paper that has a circle on it, a filled in circle, and that circle

264
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:40,460
is surrounded by six circles.

265
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,460
I remember that.

266
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,660
I remember that too.

267
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,900
And it's hand drawn.

268
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:46,500
Hey, they like the faux place, just like us.

269
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,500
Fuh?

270
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,500
Yeah.

271
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,360
What is the Fuh place called?

272
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,360
The Daily Fuh.

273
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,480
The Daily Fuh.

274
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:59,900
This giant man in the all black combat uniform with the large scar over his right eye steps

275
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:07,020
forward and looks down into the pit at Clark Bishop.

276
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:11,740
And he holds out his other hand and he aims it at you.

277
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,580
I need you to roll dodge.

278
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:17,020
Is his other hand a wire thing too?

279
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:19,660
So far it looks like a hand with a glove on it.

280
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,220
I do not pass.

281
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:23,020
97 on a 50.

282
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:26,420
He does.

283
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:30,840
So he shoots straight down at you and you try to dodge out of the way and you lose five

284
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:38,820
damage as his hand reaches completely into your shoulder and grips.

285
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:41,420
Wait, did his arm stretch?

286
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:48,580
His fist shot off of his arm down into the pit at you and then grabbed onto your shoulder

287
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:54,720
where your collarbone is and then gripped into your skin and his fingers are inside

288
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,900
you as he's holding onto your shoulder.

289
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,860
His hand is still attached to his arm though?

290
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,560
Yeah, by a wire.

291
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:09,660
So I need you to roll unarmed combat against his in order to get this out of your shoulder.

292
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:17,580
His is definitely armed combat.

293
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,580
It doesn't work twice.

294
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,580
I pass.

295
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:20,580
25.

296
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,860
25 on a 70.

297
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,860
You're 70 unarmed combat?

298
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:25,860
Mm-hmm.

299
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,860
He's 72 though, right?

300
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:28,860
And you're rolling against him?

301
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:36,900
He's 70 so he has to roll higher than a 25 but under a 70 and the suspense is great as

302
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:40,540
Zach fiddles around the floor to find the dice that he dropped.

303
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,540
Zach.

304
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:42,940
Ripping his earphones out.

305
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,500
Zach, would you like some dice?

306
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,500
No!

307
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,180
Where did it go?

308
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:49,420
Daddy would you like some sausage?

309
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,260
Daddy would you like some sausages?

310
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:53,180
Joe, what did you roll?

311
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,980
25 on a 70.

312
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,860
It is staying in there.

313
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:04,700
The fist is locked into place and it is actually his turn again.

314
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,700
How?

315
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,820
He's got crazy decks or something.

316
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:08,820
Oh, I'm sorry.

317
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:09,820
No, it's not.

318
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:10,820
It's Keith's turn.

319
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:11,820
That's what I fucking thought.

320
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:18,060
Is it going to take a whole like move to grab a gun or can I grab a gun and shoot at him?

321
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,620
You can grab a gun and shoot at him.

322
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:20,620
Okay.

323
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:21,620
What's my options here?

324
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:27,020
You got a couple assault rifles and some heavy pistols, some light pistols.

325
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,260
Actually here's what I want to do.

326
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,260
I want to grab.

327
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:33,540
Is it just body armor like a bulletproof vest or tell me if I can do this.

328
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:37,260
I'm going to grab a bulletproof vest and a gun and hide behind the table.

329
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,580
Yeah, you can definitely do that.

330
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,580
What do I need to roll?

331
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,580
Nothing.

332
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,580
That's what I do.

333
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,580
Okay.

334
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,700
Wait, so what are my gun options here?

335
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,700
Assault rifles.

336
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,020
I don't know anything about guns.

337
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,020
Okay.

338
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,500
Grab the bulletproof vest, throw it on.

339
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:54,560
I grab a fully automatic assault rifle and then I duck behind the, you know, flipped

340
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,540
over table or you know, whatever it is.

341
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:57,540
John, what do you do?

342
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:00,620
I take another shot at him from behind the bathroom door.

343
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,620
Fire away.

344
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:03,940
91.

345
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:08,060
You miss opposite like you overcorrect and shoot out the window on the other side of

346
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:09,060
the door.

347
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,060
Getting close.

348
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,060
Clark, it's your turn.

349
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:16,660
I want to take my hand and do a quick wrap around the cord and use that as my repel cord

350
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:18,460
and walk up the wall.

351
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,460
Hell yeah.

352
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,460
Yes.

353
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:25,820
Legit, that's the coolest thing any of us have done in any campaign.

354
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:30,420
And the reason that you don't have to roll is as such.

355
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:34,780
That's so badass.

356
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:37,860
What do you do when you're teetering on the edge at the top?

357
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:40,920
When you say teetering, am I out of the hole?

358
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:45,540
I'm saying as you get, as you come out of the hole, I'm going to let you do one thing.

359
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,540
Uh, yeah.

360
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,540
I'm just going to shoot at him.

361
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:48,540
Describe it.

362
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,540
Uh, well, hang on.

363
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,540
Roll and then we'll, uh.

364
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,540
Hang on.

365
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,540
Yeah.

366
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,540
Hang on.

367
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:54,540
There's the combat ones over there too.

368
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:55,540
I know.

369
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:56,540
I know.

370
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,540
You can't roll and then do the minus 40.

371
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,540
Right.

372
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,780
Cause that's what I would have done when I got a five.

373
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:04,060
I'm going to do a, uh, I'm going to do a fuck.

374
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,060
I'm just going to shoot at him.

375
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:11,000
Um, I I'm hoping that I, he should have his, uh, yeah, I'm just shooting at him.

376
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Just shooting at him full on shooting at him.

377
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,520
And I am not hitting him with a 98 on an 80.

378
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,980
The wire is slack.

379
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:25,600
Uh, as you make it up to the top, as he, you are firing at him, he literally just grabs

380
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,580
onto your hand and moves it away from you actually hitting him.

381
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:34,680
And so you're firing up at the ceiling and it's his turn.

382
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:38,400
I need you to roll against unarmed combat.

383
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:43,480
I was going to say maybe he has some different dice.

384
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,420
Pass but not a great pass.

385
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,240
It's 21 on a 70.

386
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,240
That's a pretty good pass.

387
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,240
Okay.

388
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:54,040
Uh, he passed with a 22 on a 70.

389
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,040
Fuck.

390
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:59,480
Critical success.

391
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:07,280
So you actually, oh, I'm just realizing what happens now.

392
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:16,160
He retracts his hand and the wire begins zipping back into his wrist nub.

393
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:24,280
And as it does, I need you to roll a constitution, a very important constitution check.

394
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,860
Pass 52 on a 65.

395
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:33,680
The wire cuts through your skin as it retracts back as it's wrapped around your forearm.

396
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:39,020
It cuts all the way into your skin, but it doesn't go all the way through.

397
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:45,420
You can actually feel this wire rubbing up against your nerves on one side and your bone

398
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:46,840
on the other.

399
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:54,520
And a unfathomable pain is coursing through your entire body and you become lightheaded

400
00:17:54,520 --> 00:18:01,200
as he brings you in and punches you directly in the mouth for 11 damage.

401
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,120
Oh man.

402
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,460
Your mouth was so purdy.

403
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:08,800
I'm glad I didn't touch the suit of armor.

404
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:13,840
I'm at seven hit points.

405
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:21,520
My mouth and arm.

406
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:31,040
Yeah, that's, so you are, he, he lets go of you and retracts fully, but you are on the

407
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,040
ground.

408
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,380
Keith, it is your turn.

409
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:36,360
You are hiding as this is happening to officer Bishop.

410
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:41,120
You are hiding a tactical.

411
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,720
I have nothing against it.

412
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,600
Okay, so I got a question.

413
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:49,880
Forty if partially behind cover or minus 40 I am at that point or can I stand up and like

414
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,640
not be, Oh yeah, that's for the opponent.

415
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,800
Oh, perfect.

416
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,800
Okay.

417
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,200
I need this described to me.

418
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:00,160
He's got one hand has the door as a shield.

419
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,240
Yep.

420
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,800
Clark is on the ground.

421
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,800
He's on the ground.

422
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,800
He's not being held up.

423
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:10,200
So if I do a cold shot to like just shoot at, shoot at the guy, but not, I don't necessarily

424
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,200
want to do a headshot.

425
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,160
I just want to shoot and not hit the door.

426
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,160
Oh yeah.

427
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,160
That would be a called shot.

428
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,160
Minus 20.

429
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,160
Yeah.

430
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,160
Fuck.

431
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,160
That sucks.

432
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,160
Cause you, you would have hit him.

433
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,160
I would have hit him.

434
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,160
Oh, that sucks.

435
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:28,680
Uh, so you are firing at him and he holds up the door and I'm also how far away from

436
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,680
him am I?

437
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,680
That's cool though.

438
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,480
Well, you're in the living room and he's in the foyer.

439
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,760
The coffee table is in the living room and you hit on the other side of it.

440
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,760
So you're at least 25 feet away from him.

441
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,760
Okay.

442
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,640
So I'm going to take this into consideration.

443
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:47,440
I have a fully automatic rifle and I'm shooting through a presumably wooden door.

444
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,440
Oh yes.

445
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,760
The uh, the door gets, uh, so what'd you roll?

446
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:59,640
So I rolled a 64 on a 70 minus 20 minus 20, but you cut the door in half and he is like

447
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,240
crouched behind it.

448
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:07,680
And as the door falls, you see him pop his head with the scar over his right eye above

449
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,560
the door and just stare at you.

450
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,840
John, what do you do?

451
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:16,040
I am aiming this turn, which will give me 20% to hit on the next turn.

452
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,040
Awesome.

453
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,440
I wish I'd read that card a turn ago.

454
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,360
Clark, what are you doing?

455
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,520
Scrambling as far away as I can.

456
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,520
Okay.

457
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:28,240
Probably toward John toward getting deeper into the house.

458
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,640
Is there anything in this game since I'm not taking a combat action that I can go even

459
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,280
further than I normally would be able to?

460
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,280
Yeah.

461
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,520
I would like to get really fucking far into the house.

462
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,520
Where do you want to go?

463
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,520
Maybe back.

464
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,520
Behind the bathroom.

465
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,520
Behind me.

466
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,520
Behind John.

467
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,520
Crawling like through the kitchen door.

468
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,520
Yeah.

469
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,520
Cool.

470
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,280
I'm still aiming, but I do like with one hand, I like help reel him in.

471
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,280
Nice.

472
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,280
Cool.

473
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:53,400
This massive dude throws down the half door that Keith just shot through and begins running

474
00:20:53,400 --> 00:21:01,760
toward Keith at full speed while reaching behind him and pulling out a giant metal crowbar

475
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,740
from off of his back.

476
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:11,720
And he jumps and he is going to try to bring it down on Keith over through the coffee table

477
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,540
on the other side of it where you're hiding.

478
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:21,160
So he has a 50%, you're going to roll dodge, but you get to add 20% on it for being behind

479
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,160
cover.

480
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,160
Okay.

481
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,160
That gives me 60.

482
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,160
Fuck.

483
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:29,160
It's a crit fail.

484
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:32,560
66 on a 60.

485
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:38,320
Oh, Keith, that's a, that's a pretty big bummer.

486
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,320
Yeah.

487
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,240
Uh, it is a big bummer.

488
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:44,040
Oh my God.

489
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:52,160
Keith, this dude, you just hear this like as the floor is moving, as this giant dude

490
00:21:52,160 --> 00:22:01,360
comes running toward you and then you hear quiet as a giant metal crowbar just slams

491
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:07,920
into your side and it doesn't, it doesn't poke you, but he straight up just like baseball

492
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:12,820
bat swings it into your rib cage that doing 11 damage.

493
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:15,820
That puts me at nine.

494
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:21,180
He turns his head and looks away from you and Keith, it appears that this man's face

495
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,700
is a mask.

496
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:28,660
You can actually, as he's been jostling himself about, you can see the glinting metal shine

497
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:36,020
from beneath as his skin sloughs off of its current placement.

498
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:44,700
So does this whole like the head skin fall off or does his face?

499
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:47,780
His whole head skin is just slightly askew.

500
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:48,780
Okay.

501
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:50,620
It's loud to one side.

502
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:51,620
Yes.

503
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:58,960
I don't know if it's realistic after taking a hit like that for you to be able to do anything

504
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,260
besides like get away.

505
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,740
Oh, it's not realistic.

506
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:02,740
It's your turn though.

507
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:03,740
And you can do anything.

508
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:04,740
Yeah.

509
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:05,740
Get this.

510
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:06,740
Get this fucker.

511
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:12,860
I mean, he used a door as a defense mechanism, so I think that he could be, you know what

512
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:18,500
I, what I do is I, so he's like standing what, like a foot away from me.

513
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,500
Yeah.

514
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,500
Don't be afraid to get creative guys.

515
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,500
Okay.

516
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,220
So what I'm going to do, can I, can I stand up?

517
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,460
Have we tried talking to him?

518
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:27,300
I got creative and lost an arm.

519
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,300
I want to stand up.

520
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,300
Tell me, tell me what I can do from this.

521
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:35,780
It might change my mind of what I want to do, but I want to stand up, jump on his back

522
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:42,580
since he's not facing me and use my lock picking skills to try to like, he's a, I think he's

523
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:43,580
a robot.

524
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:46,060
So I want to like unlock his head from his body.

525
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,420
That's fucking awesome.

526
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,420
Yeah.

527
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:50,100
You got creative.

528
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:55,880
So I'm going to have to have you pass two tests in order to accomplish this.

529
00:23:55,880 --> 00:24:00,780
The first will be anything against his strength.

530
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:05,080
So whatever you think you're going to use to hold on or stay put is his strength on

531
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,080
top of him.

532
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,080
Can I know that or not?

533
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,820
I mean, no.

534
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:09,820
It's high.

535
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:10,820
Okay.

536
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,980
So this guy's a nerd.

537
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:15,260
You can do anything that like would make sense against that.

538
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,260
I guess.

539
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,260
Yeah.

540
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:19,820
So I mean athletics, strength, strength is my highest.

541
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:20,820
Dexterity.

542
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:21,820
I don't know.

543
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:22,820
Yes.

544
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:23,820
Okay.

545
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:24,820
I'll use decks, which is 60.

546
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:25,820
Okay.

547
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:26,820
So you're going to bear or even dodge.

548
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:27,820
Like you just got to be like six.

549
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:29,540
He's going to be my highest.

550
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:35,900
So the dice don't like us tonight.

551
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:36,900
Yeah.

552
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:37,900
You should stop using those two.

553
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:38,900
Yeah.

554
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:43,780
I'm going to do you jump onto his back and he immediately just grabbed the like grabs

555
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:47,220
you and throws you over him into the wall.

556
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:52,140
So you go flying over his back into the wall, like upside down.

557
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:53,740
You hit flat, right?

558
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:59,020
You're back against the wall and then you slide down the wall and you take four damage

559
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:00,020
guys.

560
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,020
I'm very close to dying.

561
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,020
These are good boys.

562
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,020
Roll with these.

563
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,020
John's your turn.

564
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,020
I want to try a couple of things.

565
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:08,300
Let me know if I can do this with my move, but I am, I'm going to move on a look real

566
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,300
quick clock.

567
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:12,740
You get, I give him a weary thumbs up and start to get up back to my feet.

568
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:13,820
You're just looking at your arm.

569
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:15,060
It's fucking cheese.

570
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,060
Okay.

571
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:17,060
I'm looking at his chair.

572
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:18,900
I'm trying not to look at his cheese arm.

573
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:19,900
Yeah.

574
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:20,900
Uh, but I see that he's okay.

575
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:25,660
I am going to run down the hallway, peek around the corner through the door that apparently

576
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,460
would look into the foyer and the living room.

577
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:28,460
Right.

578
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:31,300
So I'm going to level my gun at him, but I'm going to, I am going to try something we haven't

579
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,300
tried yet.

580
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,300
I'm going to shout.

581
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,300
Freeze.

582
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,300
Contention PD.

583
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,300
Great.

584
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:40,580
And I would like to roll a persuade.

585
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,180
No, I don't have to.

586
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,180
That's not going to work.

587
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,820
I mean, don't say that.

588
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:47,380
Just do it.

589
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:50,300
Go ahead and roll persuade if that's what you want to do.

590
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,300
No.

591
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,620
What I want to do is shoot him with the sniper rifle.

592
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:53,620
So yeah.

593
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:55,020
I mean, what do you want to do?

594
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:58,280
Uh, does he still get a plus 20 aim or no?

595
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,860
He did spend a whole turn doing it.

596
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:01,860
Boy.

597
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:02,860
That's hard.

598
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:03,860
Yeah.

599
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:04,860
That is hard.

600
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:05,860
I don't see me getting a bonus here.

601
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:06,860
Yeah.

602
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:07,860
Exactly.

603
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:08,860
I was, I was aiming.

604
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:09,860
He moved.

605
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:10,860
We would want the same courtesy to us.

606
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:11,860
Yeah.

607
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:12,860
Exactly.

608
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:13,860
Exactly.

609
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:19,540
Like if Zach was like, well, actually the MPC kid chucked up in a, and so you fucked.

610
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:20,540
We would hate that.

611
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:25,180
So yeah, I'm just going to move to where I can see him shout, freeze, contention PD.

612
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:29,340
And then before I wait for response, uh, I'm going to just blast him.

613
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:30,340
Okay.

614
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:31,540
Actually, how about trying to blast him?

615
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:33,760
He freezes.

616
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,900
If you pass a persuade, I will give you a plus 20 on your shot.

617
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:38,900
Ooh.

618
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:39,900
I like it.

619
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:40,900
Like I confuse them enough.

620
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:41,900
Exactly.

621
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:42,900
86.

622
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:43,940
86.

623
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:44,940
Fuck.

624
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:45,940
On a 60.

625
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:48,580
You guys remember earlier when I said we were rolling good, boys.

626
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:49,580
Sorry.

627
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:50,580
Yeah.

628
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:51,580
That stopped.

629
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:52,580
All right.

630
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:53,580
Roll that firearm straight up and down.

631
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,580
25 on a 60.

632
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:56,580
All right.

633
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,300
Two D 10 for damage.

634
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,300
Two D 10.

635
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,300
Fuck yeah.

636
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,300
Eight.

637
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,300
Eight.

638
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,300
Or 35.

639
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:05,300
Depending on what you want to get.

640
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,300
Describe it.

641
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,540
I see him just on instinct.

642
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:10,740
I shout that idiot shit, which obviously isn't going to stop a robot.

643
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:12,940
I'm like, freeze contention PD.

644
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:14,620
And I'm just, I'm shooting from the hip.

645
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:20,460
Like I've just got a high powered rifle in pretty close quarters and I just take a shot.

646
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,460
Where does it hit?

647
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:22,460
Right in his gut.

648
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:23,460
Okay.

649
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:24,460
Yeah.

650
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:30,660
And you hear this like, that satisfies John Lee Pennymore.

651
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:31,660
Clark, it's your turn.

652
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:35,060
I want to make my way to behind John again.

653
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,700
Can I use my good arm to shoot my pistol?

654
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:37,700
Yeah.

655
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:42,660
I want to shoot my pistol at the robot at the thing that's buzzing at this point.

656
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,820
Some kind of beautiful mechanical man.

657
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:45,820
Yeah.

658
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:48,100
This is the first time you guys have noticed anything weird.

659
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:51,460
I mean, outside of the arms flying off of him, that actually might've been the biggest

660
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:52,460
tip off.

661
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:53,460
Now they think about it.

662
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,460
The hands flying off.

663
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:55,460
Yeah.

664
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,460
Yeah.

665
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:57,460
And then maybe the fact that yeah, bullets didn't go through him earlier.

666
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:58,460
Okay.

667
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:59,460
So you knew he was a robot.

668
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:00,800
Also, I met a robot earlier in this campaign.

669
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,800
Did you?

670
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,800
Yeah.

671
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:06,340
Well, I met a wizard who passed me binary and I assumed he was a robot.

672
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:11,020
I'm going to pull around, get up behind John and I've got a clear sight on the...

673
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,020
You do indeed.

674
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:14,780
And I'm going to take a shot at the boy with my good arm.

675
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:20,780
Roll firearms and yeah.

676
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:21,780
Just roll.

677
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:22,780
I pass.

678
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:23,780
Crit pass.

679
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:24,780
Crit pass.

680
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:27,780
33 on an 80.

681
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:28,780
Okay.

682
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:29,780
Describe it.

683
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:30,780
You do 10 damage.

684
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:31,780
Hang on real fast, Keith.

685
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:32,780
You got thrown off him, right?

686
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:33,780
You're not on him anymore?

687
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:34,780
Correct.

688
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:35,780
I'm shooting at his head.

689
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,220
I'm on John's shoulder to steady it.

690
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,220
Yes.

691
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,220
Hell yeah.

692
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:43,420
And that gives me a real perfect line of sight on the guy's head and I pop, pop, pop, pop.

693
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:48,180
You fire your weapon into this guy's head and what happens is really fucking weird.

694
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:53,540
So each shot makes his neck snap back as his head recoils from the bullets.

695
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:59,020
His entire torso reclines fully like he's prepping to do the limbo, but his bottom half

696
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:01,660
stays completely still.

697
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:06,860
And like a spring, his body snaps back into an upright position and you see the skin drooped

698
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:10,420
over his face is covered in bullet holes.

699
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:16,940
The skin is all loose and off kilter and you can see a shiny metal where this thing's skull

700
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:17,940
should be.

701
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:20,820
Guys, we didn't ever consider it if this was a Terminator.

702
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:21,820
So send your help us.

703
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:25,260
No, I was going to make like a John Connor joke, Sarah Connor joke.

704
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:26,260
Go for it.

705
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:27,260
There's a John Connor, right?

706
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:28,260
That's your son.

707
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,260
Yeah, he's the other one.

708
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:32,140
Like a Schwarzenegger impression for us.

709
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:33,140
Yeah.

710
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:39,180
Hello, my name, oh boy, dude.

711
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,180
What was it about?

712
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:45,740
Like the, like the eighties that was like, yeah, we like buff Eastern European actors.

713
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:49,780
Well, that's just where all the buffest act, see, we as a people have always loved our

714
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:54,060
buff actors, but yeah, but like used to, it was like the buffest dudes were, and also

715
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,940
Austria is not Eastern European.

716
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:58,220
That is as Western European as it gets.

717
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:01,780
Well, it's on the border between the two, but it's like, so fucking German.

718
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:05,900
Well, they once ruled an empire with Hungary, which is very Eastern.

719
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:10,500
See, that was only 15 seconds of stuff that'll get edited out.

720
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:15,500
What the fucking fans come back for time and time again is these neat little tidbits that

721
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,580
we give them.

722
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:24,340
So the, see the thing about the Austro-Hungarian empire, so Franz Ferdinand, you take me out.

723
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:34,820
We good?

724
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:35,820
Let's keep going.

725
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:36,820
Yeah.

726
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:42,620
So you begin singing, take me out as this robot man snaps back into place and it is

727
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:45,360
now his turn.

728
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:50,900
This giant being turns and looks at Keith Vigna who is on the ground and he moves his

729
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:55,500
torso like he's going to approach Keith, but his bottom half isn't functioning.

730
00:30:55,500 --> 00:31:00,420
His head begins whirring and popping little crackles and short stunted movements.

731
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:05,700
With a look of realization, the metal skull turns its attention to the two officers on

732
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,780
the other side of the room.

733
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:09,740
You see one of its eyes is dead.

734
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:15,780
You put a bullet right through it, but the other eye stares directly at Clark and John.

735
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:20,660
He holds out both arms and shoots his fist at the two of you.

736
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:23,100
So I need both of you to roll dodge.

737
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:25,980
18 on a 50.

738
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:28,820
64 on a 50.

739
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:29,820
I do not pass.

740
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:32,700
John Lee Pettymore didn't know what dodge meant in the skill chart.

741
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:35,780
He rolled a 50 on a 50 against John Lee Pettymore.

742
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:38,500
Oh, that means he hits me, right?

743
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:43,680
Okay, so he rolled a 50 against John Lee Pettymore and a 47 against Clark Bishop.

744
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:49,300
And so these come at you, they're coming in real hot.

745
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:53,180
Nine damage on John, three damage on Clark.

746
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,500
I'm at four hit points.

747
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,500
I'm at five.

748
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:59,740
I don't think we're going to make it to the mill today, boys.

749
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:10,400
You say as this fist completely rips into your rib cage, the fist goes right into John's

750
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:17,180
rib cage and holds on tight and you can actually feel the fist clench down and grab two of

751
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:20,220
your ribs and bring them closer together.

752
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,780
Oh my god.

753
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:26,100
Yeah, I would like to spend 10 points of luck to avoid that.

754
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,100
Oh, cool.

755
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:30,920
This is the first luck spend of the entire campaign.

756
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,820
What does that rule say on luck?

757
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:37,860
Spend 10 points to avoid major damage that reduces damage by 1d6.

758
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:42,640
If I get six more hit points, that would be insanely helpful to me, but even one is very

759
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,640
handy at this point.

760
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:51,160
All right, so John spends 10 luck putting his luck down at 45, roll that d6 to get six

761
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,160
hit points back.

762
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,160
Four.

763
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,160
Oh, pretty good.

764
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,760
He gets four hit points back, putting him at nine.

765
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:05,160
As the fist tries to reach completely in, its fingers only actually go skin deep.

766
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:09,680
It actually gets caught on a screw that was put in there from my sprint racing days and

767
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:13,080
jammed and it can't bring my ribs together like it wants to.

768
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:22,640
And the claw actually grabs onto the forearm that had been recently shredded on Clark.

769
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:28,480
Just pushing that nerve right up against the bone and the two are rubbing against each

770
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,480
other.

771
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,480
Uh, go ahead and nevermind.

772
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,480
Nevermind.

773
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,480
You're dead.

774
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,480
You're dead.

775
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,480
Fuck you.

776
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,480
You're dead.

777
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:43,920
So now I need you guys to both roll against his unarmed combat to try to get out of this

778
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,920
grapple.

779
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:49,680
Okay, the baseline unarmed combat status, 40% if you don't modify it at all, which I

780
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,680
have not.

781
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,680
58.

782
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,680
I don't pass.

783
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:56,920
67 on a 70.

784
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,320
That's a great fucking roll.

785
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,320
Hell yeah, dude.

786
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,320
It is indeed.

787
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,200
And you actually win your roll.

788
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,200
Fuck yeah.

789
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,040
He passed against Clark with an eight.

790
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:09,440
So John, your fist is staying in.

791
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,080
It's hooked on that screw.

792
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:18,000
And Clark, describe how you get this, uh, this inspector gadget go-go fist off of your

793
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
forearm.

794
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,840
I use my gun to pry off the fingers.

795
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,840
Tink, tink, tink.

796
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,840
Ooh, badass.

797
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:28,560
Yeah, that's very cool.

798
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,040
And it is Keith's turn.

799
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:36,160
Is there any way I could roll luck to see if this body armor that I put on might have

800
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,680
a knife in it?

801
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,480
You have a knife on you already.

802
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:42,120
Oh yeah, can I see if there was a bazooka in my pants?

803
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,120
Wait.

804
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,120
Well, no, I don't.

805
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,120
Well, I do have a knife on me already.

806
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,280
I would imagine that you have a knife.

807
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,960
You live in the country, you're a police officer, I'd imagine you have a knife on you.

808
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:52,320
Okay, so can I describe the knife I have on me?

809
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,480
You can describe a pretty common knife that you would have on you.

810
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,040
I want to describe like a...

811
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,800
That Gipu being a knife guy.

812
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:03,600
I've got a four foot long knife.

813
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,160
I mean, some people might call it a sword, but yeah.

814
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,840
I'm not going to go that far, but hold on.

815
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:15,280
I take the broadsword off my back and with both hands more like a scythe, I take my spear.

816
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,520
I know what I want to do.

817
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,520
Let me describe it.

818
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:24,880
So I pull out, it's like a pocket knife in the sense that it folds into itself, but I

819
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,400
pull it out and it's like a four inch blade.

820
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:35,080
I want to get up off of the ground and run with my knife and just chop the wires that

821
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:41,680
are connecting his hands to these people and just cut the wires and then just like run

822
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,680
through.

823
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:43,680
Okay, awesome.

824
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:48,980
If you're going to do it to both of them, I'm going to do a negative 20 on both rolls.

825
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:52,480
Not to be super selfish, but he is only embedded in me right now.

826
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,040
So if you did one of them.

827
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,040
Well, that's true.

828
00:35:55,500 --> 00:36:00,080
Would you give me a negative 20 on the second one and a regular one on the first one?

829
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,100
I'll give you a negative 40 on the second one.

830
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,320
And a regular on the first one?

831
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,320
I like that.

832
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,320
Yeah.

833
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,800
So what's the first one is connected.

834
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,920
Did you know you can barter with your...

835
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,400
Who's connected?

836
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,400
You?

837
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,400
Yeah.

838
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,800
I mean, honestly there's only one wire like connected the other wire.

839
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,800
Okay.

840
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,800
Then I'll just do the only taught wire.

841
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,800
Yeah.

842
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,800
Okay.

843
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,800
Let's take this back.

844
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,800
Yeah.

845
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,800
Hold on.

846
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,800
So I pull out my knife.

847
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:28,600
I'm going to use my orange blade pocket knife and I'm going to run and just try to cut the

848
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,680
wire that's connected to John.

849
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:31,680
Okay.

850
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,680
And that's going to be a strength roll.

851
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:33,680
Roll a strength roll.

852
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:37,680
That's a crit success.

853
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,840
11 on a 50 fuck.

854
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,360
Fuck yes.

855
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,680
This makes me very happy.

856
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:44,680
And I'll tell you why.

857
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:45,680
Oh no.

858
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:46,680
No.

859
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:49,680
Not for any devious reasons.

860
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,680
Anytime.

861
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:51,680
Zach is happy.

862
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:59,200
No, it is because I was going to have to be a stick in the mud DM who is like, actually

863
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:03,000
that wire is made from a very strong.

864
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,720
So only a critical success could actually cut through it, which you did.

865
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:12,000
Are we peeking hard?

866
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Yeah.

867
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Oh yeah.

868
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Every time we cheer.

869
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
So how do we fix that?

870
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Let's cheer away.

871
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,120
All clear.

872
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,120
John is no longer grappled.

873
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,160
Let me fucking describe it, dude.

874
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,160
Oh, sorry.

875
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,640
Do it.

876
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,080
So I get up off the ground.

877
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,760
I like collect myself.

878
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:34,240
My back hurts really bad and I look and see what just happened.

879
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:40,000
I pull this pocket knife that you could barely call a pocket knife out of my back pocket.

880
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:47,680
I flipped the blade up and it's like three inches wide, four inches tall.

881
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:54,480
And I hold it with both of my fists out in front of me.

882
00:37:54,480 --> 00:38:01,240
And I run as fast as I can, arms wide out in front of me and just run into this wire.

883
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:09,240
You just run straight and use it like a lightsaber or a simple machine.

884
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:12,360
And I run through it and it cuts through it like butter.

885
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:21,400
And as I do it, I look into the one eye of this monster and I flip it off.

886
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:27,120
And then I, as soon as I hit the wire, obviously like tension comes and it kind of like throws

887
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,120
me off.

888
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,120
It cuts through the wire.

889
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:35,560
I fall down and roll and I roll and I get back up and just two fingers, two middle fingers

890
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,840
up to this robot.

891
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:37,840
Hell yeah.

892
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,840
John turn.

893
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:39,840
John turn.

894
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:40,840
John, it's your turn.

895
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:41,840
John turn.

896
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:48,080
Can you imagine as I get released from this thing's clutches that I probably in pain,

897
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:51,480
like at least fall on a knee to the ground?

898
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,480
Absolutely.

899
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,800
Uh, because it did pull you forward as the tension.

900
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,800
Okay.

901
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,080
So I'm in the foyer now a little bit.

902
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,080
A little bit.

903
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,080
Yeah.

904
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,920
Uh, he's still in the living room.

905
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,440
He is indeed.

906
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:10,300
And the fist is still clenched around my, okay.

907
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:11,300
In your body.

908
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:12,780
Ouchies.

909
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:13,780
Ouchie mama.

910
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:16,700
Well, I don't have time to worry about that.

911
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:20,700
I am going to, I'm just going to try to shoot from the hip with a sniper rifle again.

912
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:22,920
That does do more damage than my sidearm, right?

913
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:23,920
It does indeed.

914
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:29,260
And it doesn't even matter cause it's the same, but yeah, uh, same firearms go 37.

915
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:30,500
I finally pass.

916
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:34,380
Roll two D 10 for damage, uh, eight.

917
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,380
Cobains.

918
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:36,380
Describe it.

919
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:37,960
So I fall into my knees.

920
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:41,920
I guess he's still in front of me because he shot at us from inside that room.

921
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:42,920
So I'm in pain.

922
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:47,760
I'm clutching at my side, but I bring the sniper rifle up from the hip and I just try

923
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,080
to shoot him kind of in the gut again.

924
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,080
Awesome.

925
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:59,560
Firing through his, his midsection, you get two shots just right through his gut.

926
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,560
That's the sound of sniper.

927
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,560
That's a good one.

928
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,560
That's good.

929
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,560
And a foyer.

930
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:14,160
It's like

931
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:18,000
as like the inside of him is just going crazy.

932
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:23,600
There are wires flying out of his midsection and his head is just kind of like shaking

933
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:27,500
back and forth and it's really weird.

934
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:35,820
You probably wouldn't notice it if you weren't peeking so fucking hard on Coke right now,

935
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:45,500
but you actually see this guy, his face grimace and his teeth clench.

936
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:48,220
I shout, Hey guys, it can feel pain.

937
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:51,860
And then I also say, take that weird science.

938
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:52,860
Perfect.

939
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:55,460
Clark, it's your turn.

940
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:56,460
Finish him.

941
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:58,420
I want to shoot.

942
00:40:58,420 --> 00:40:59,420
I want to shoot at it.

943
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:00,420
Do it.

944
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:01,420
Nope.

945
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:04,420
I do not pass.

946
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,420
98 on an 80.

947
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:07,420
98?

948
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:08,420
A couple 98s.

949
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:09,420
Yeah.

950
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:10,420
We might need some different stones.

951
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:11,420
Hey, try those.

952
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:12,420
Try those.

953
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:13,420
They spit hot fire.

954
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:14,420
Oh, darn.

955
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:15,420
I got to go buy more dice.

956
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:16,420
Oh shit.

957
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:17,420
Do you want to buy dice tomorrow?

958
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:20,860
Cause it's been a minute for me.

959
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:22,420
Maybe you need different stats.

960
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:23,420
Oh,

961
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:28,380
Fucking burn dude.

962
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:30,380
Come on man.

963
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:31,380
Fucking burn.

964
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:32,380
What the fuck dude.

965
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:40,020
Maybe before you buy a new dice you should check your decks.

966
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:45,940
It is the shiny headed robot man's turn and he sets his sights on the meat boy that just

967
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:48,020
cut off one of his hand wires.

968
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:53,300
So I need a strength roll from Keith or an unarmed combat check, whichever one's higher.

969
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,180
I did strength, which is 55.

970
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:56,180
I got a 34.

971
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,660
You were doing 55 in the 34.

972
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:11,060
You lose the opposed contest that you were in with this man as you lose the torso of

973
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:27,780
this being becomes unattached from the legs beneath it and a small jet pack begins shooting

974
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:36,340
flames, begins shooting flames from the bottom of the torso as it runs, as it runs, as it

975
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:44,220
flies towards Keith, it reaches down, zips back into one decent hand, grabbing you by

976
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:53,180
the throat and flying you out the window of the living room into the front yard.

977
00:42:53,180 --> 00:43:00,160
I need you to roll an extremely important strength or unarmed combat contest.

978
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:06,040
As you fly through the window, you have a chance to break free from this robot.

979
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:12,680
19 out of 55, but also that's a competition, so maybe not so good.

980
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:13,680
That sucks.

981
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:14,680
I hate that.

982
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:15,680
I'll roll it in front of you guys.

983
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:18,960
He has a 70.

984
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:19,960
He fails.

985
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:24,080
You just cartoonishly clutch.

986
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:25,680
You rolled a 94.

987
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,160
94 on a 70.

988
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:28,320
He grabs you by the throat.

989
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:31,620
He grabs you by the throat and as you bust through the window.

990
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:36,640
I bite into his mechanical hand.

991
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:37,640
Shatter your teeth.

992
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:40,520
Two of my teeth break off.

993
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:41,520
Which two?

994
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:42,520
Now you're from contention.

995
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:43,520
These two right here.

996
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:44,520
Okay, cool.

997
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:45,520
Describe them.

998
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:46,520
It's an audio podcast.

999
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:51,820
My canine and the one next to it going to the middle, I don't know what that one's called,

1000
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:58,560
break off and I realize, oh, I can't bite a machine and so I just poke my finger into

1001
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:03,460
his one good eye.

1002
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:10,420
As you do that, the robot man releases you and you fall into the front yard as the robot

1003
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:16,220
flies up towards the sky and explodes in a firework-like explosion.

1004
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:18,620
Holy shit, good work guys.

1005
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:21,060
You just had to poke it in the eye the whole time.

1006
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:23,300
Let's try that with all the enemies from now on.

1007
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:29,460
I land on my back, breath gets knocked out of me, but I look up as he's exploding and

1008
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:38,020
I put my hand up to my forehead and I salute and I go, skyrockets in flight, baby.

1009
00:44:51,060 --> 00:45:10,980
How am I the only one trying to pull over How can you have enough drowning out of the
