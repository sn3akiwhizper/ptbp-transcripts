1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,720
Well bake me a cookie and call me a monster, because I'm here to gobble y'all up.

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,480
Nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:14,720
It's your dessert demon daddy, Wolf the Dog, and I'm here to consume your delicious sugary morsels.

4
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:23,800
I am coming at you live from 694.2 PTBP, the only radio station that runs off of pure glucose.

5
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:30,120
Fill me up a tub with maple syrup, because it's time to relax and check in with our newest segment,

6
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,640
Howlin' with Wolf.

7
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:36,360
This Howlin' with Wolf comes from Zachary Fredrickson in Phoenix, Arizona,

8
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,800
who tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending pod.

9
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:46,640
The quickest way to tell your friends you're a nerd who loves putting apples where you can't tan without some effort.

10
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,000
Thanks to Zachary for doing that, and what a great name too.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,720
Anywho, he writes,

12
00:00:52,720 --> 00:01:00,360
I wanna thank my pal, Eld, from the Lancer and PTBP discords for getting me into the show.

13
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:04,880
And the boys from Contention for getting me into Delta Green as a whole.

14
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:12,640
I've been a handler for a few times now, and using the lessons I've learned by listening means it's always a great time.

15
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,160
Eld, we gotta play together again sometime.

16
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:20,320
If anybody was interested in a different type of actual play,

17
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:30,240
check out at FTLcast on Twitter for a ton of great GM-less role-playing games and LGBTQ plus voices.

18
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,720
Keep it up, boys!

19
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,760
Thanks for writin' in, Zachary.

20
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:40,320
I've only met one other Zachary in my entire life, and I've gotta say, wasn't a big fan.

21
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,680
But you, Zachary, I'm a big fan of yours.

22
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,960
Thanks for writin' in, buddy.

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,920
But to that other Zach, you know who you are.

24
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,120
And you know I'm comin' for you, baby.

25
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:57,000
If you wanna write up something for your sugary sweet wolf to howl,

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,160
go ahead and write up a five-star review on Apple Podcasts,

27
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:05,320
and email a screenshot to pretendingpod at gmail.com,

28
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:11,440
or tag at PretendingPod on Instagram or Twitter, and seriously, it's time.

29
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:16,080
I know you've been considerin' it for a while, and never took the initiative,

30
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:22,600
but it's time to demand that your friends, coworkers, and baristas start listenin' to this show.

31
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,680
Think of how easy it would be to have conversations with them

32
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,480
if they could debate who the worst cop in contention is,

33
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,800
or what's goin' on with Maggie Cook, or what the fuck I am,

34
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:41,040
all while you listen to Justin's original soundtrack on our YouTube page.

35
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:48,920
And then, you can both get your Splashylvania FastPasses over at patreon.com slash pretendingpod

36
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:52,920
for an absolute cavalcade of bonus content.

37
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,920
Go ahead and click Details on this here episode,

38
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,560
because the links are indeed in the show notes.

39
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:06,200
The Segway is a two-wheeled, self-balancing personal transporter

40
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,160
brought to market in 2001.

41
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,640
And this is the news.

42
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:18,200
Last time, the group relived a short chunk of time thanks to the chantin' of Don D. Pettymore.

43
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:24,840
The second attempt was much better for Keith Beans and much, much worse for Jack Russell,

44
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,760
who was skewered by the rabbit ball.

45
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:34,840
After John Lee Kevinmore the 3rd realized his goo magic is perhaps endlessly powerful,

46
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:40,960
He created a portal to the other stilted bunker, where Keith had just walked through the hatch door.

47
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:48,280
Clark and John narrowly escaped the wild ball, leaving Leo Piston to yet another hellish experience.

48
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:55,480
Don D followed the boys into this new plane of existence, and John closed the gate behind them.

49
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:02,840
Standing on glowing ground, they saw a towering building made of darkness in the distance.

50
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:08,280
More attention, though, was paid to the monumental pipe floating above them.

51
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:14,120
The inside walls of this tube exude the same bright light they all stand on,

52
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:20,040
and lumbering across the luminous land of this cylinder is an indescribable beast.

53
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:24,920
Taking us now to the scene of a literally breathtaking roar

54
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:30,040
is Dragon N3 with What Kind of World Are You Livin' In?

55
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:43,800
Bad girls on top of the water, Mary and Caroline I'm on the borderline

56
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:51,800
Leaving my mind at your altar Crossing the double line, doing it every time

57
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:57,800
Tell me, what kind of world are you livin' in?

58
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:06,600
What kind of world are you livin' in?

59
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:21,720
Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, 1st and 2nd Samuel, 1st and 2nd Kings, 1st and 2nd Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther, Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Solomon, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Limitations, Ezekiel, Daniel, Hosea, Joel, Amos,

60
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:37,720
Job, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, Malachi, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Acts, Romans, 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, 1st and 2nd Thessalonians, 1st Timothy, 2nd Timothy, Titus, Philemon, Hebrews and James, 1st Peter, 2nd Peter, 3 John's, Jude, Revelation

61
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:43,160
No, it's Justin, Joe, Luke, Thomas, and Zach.

62
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,920
He always mixes that up though.

63
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,120
That's who's in the call tonight.

64
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,280
I've just gotten used to it.

65
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:52,200
Philemon, please roll sanity.

66
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,800
I've made a turnaround, guys.

67
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,880
You're like way into Jesus again.

68
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:04,400
I'm like super into Jesus again, and I think that we need to cleanse this show of our wickedness

69
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:10,720
in our terrible, terrible, sinful ways, and I think we should start off this episode with

70
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,720
a prayer.

71
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,720
I'm good.

72
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,840
Okay, perfect.

73
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,960
That means you're in, right?

74
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,600
Hold on.

75
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:23,520
This is really weird, but my cousin literally just texted me and said this, got high and

76
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,720
had ideas.

77
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,680
What if the Carcano rifle Oswald used was a gun in a Delta Green setting, and every

78
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,800
third bullet was magic?

79
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:39,440
That's a good Delta Green gun.

80
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,800
Did H.W. Bush cast the spell on the gun?

81
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,760
Yeah, I don't know Delta Green lore.

82
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:50,720
Zach, do you think God could make an apple so big that even he couldn't fit it up his

83
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,720
ass?

84
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,960
No.

85
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,120
There's nothing too big that it couldn't fit up God's ass.

86
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,280
There's no problem too big for that.

87
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:12,000
I think G.K. Chesterton and C.S. Lewis argued about that point a lot.

88
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,960
Yeah, who won?

89
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,960
The apple.

90
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,680
Yeah, the apple always wins.

91
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:26,680
When there's one set of footprints, C.S. Lewis won, I think.

92
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,680
Dear Father God.

93
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:34,080
Are you one of the, are you the poopy kind?

94
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:39,080
No, no, more of a Paul guy than a Peter guy, personally.

95
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:42,800
This is like when you asked us to roleplay playing golf.

96
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:48,480
You guys should get more hobbies, like...

97
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,480
Golf and religion.

98
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,480
Golf and religion.

99
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,480
That's the kind of guy I would love to do.

100
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:59,520
You guys should really expand your world view into more like traditional white American

101
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:05,280
things like fundamentalist Christianity and golf.

102
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,760
Wouldn't kill you all to broaden your horizons.

103
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:14,360
All I'm thinking about is how many golf balls versus apples and there's a lot, a lot more

104
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,500
golf balls you could fit in there.

105
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,980
So maybe I will take it up.

106
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:23,360
They do flush golf balls down toilets to show like how, how much water pressure there is

107
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,360
or whatever.

108
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,920
And toilets are kind of like butts because you poop into them.

109
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,960
Wait, I'm sorry, what?

110
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,840
You know, like they show like the water pressure or whatever.

111
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:34,360
They put a bunch of golf balls in a toilet and flush it and it's like, look how much

112
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,320
stuff you can flush down this toilet.

113
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,800
Because you got to see how powerful that flush is.

114
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,800
You got to know.

115
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,640
I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about.

116
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:45,560
It sounds like a guy just came over to your house and like pranked you.

117
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,560
Like what?

118
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,880
He's like, yeah, I'm a plumber, but really it was just like doing everything you could

119
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,880
to break your toilet.

120
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,880
Right.

121
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,880
And he put a little...

122
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,880
Yeah.

123
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,920
We call this the golf ball test.

124
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,920
Look it up.

125
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,280
Golf balls and toilets is the thing.

126
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,880
You can't run with us.

127
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,880
All right.

128
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,880
Uh, let's...

129
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,280
Are you okay, Zach?

130
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:14,680
You had like a real flustered moment after that.

131
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,440
It sounds to me like Justin's not a part of the turbo team.

132
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:24,360
Uh, let's go ahead and get into the, what happened at the end of last session, which

133
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:32,000
is that John created a fucking portal, uh, with his goo magic.

134
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
What are you calling that, Thomas?

135
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,580
Does that, does that sound right?

136
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:40,100
You know, my, my ooze abilities, my, I guess we would say muck magic for alliteration,

137
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,100
but we've never called it the muck.

138
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,700
I like alliteration clearly this arc.

139
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,560
Muck sounds like something fun we could call it.

140
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:49,260
That's also like down homie and would be appropriate for these characters.

141
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,260
Muck magic.

142
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,260
I like that a whole lot.

143
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,260
Muck magic.

144
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,060
We're fighting the muck, but I guess I'm from the muck.

145
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,940
I always knew that.

146
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:57,060
How do you feel right now?

147
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:01,140
You just said without thinking about it, talking about the current campaign, we're fighting

148
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,140
the muck.

149
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:07,380
Uh, there's a bit of a two minded nature there happening within you, I'd imagine.

150
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,380
No, no, no real conflicts.

151
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,380
Okay.

152
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,380
All right.

153
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,380
Good.

154
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,380
Good.

155
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,380
Very straightforward stuff.

156
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:19,100
You know, you can put, you could, John, John Lee Pettymore is a very strong personality

157
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:22,180
and it doesn't really matter what form you put it in.

158
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,620
It's pretty sure it's John.

159
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,060
What's your goal though?

160
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:30,980
Well, you know, even if I was made of this world, I'm from our world.

161
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:33,500
I'm our, I'm fighting for it.

162
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,780
I'm with us.

163
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:35,820
The muck needs to go back.

164
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:38,220
I'm not going to go, you know, I'm one of the good ones.

165
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,220
That's the right answer.

166
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,220
You can stay.

167
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:47,900
So you guys make it through this portal and into a new world that Keith has seemingly

168
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,360
led you through this hatch.

169
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:57,100
You heard a ring-a-ding-ding from the other side of this door that you then walked into.

170
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:03,460
John closed the portal behind you and the hatch door that you walked through disappeared

171
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,740
along with it.

172
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:12,140
And as you guys look around, you see the ground you all stand on.

173
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,820
It's made of light.

174
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:20,680
There's a soft glow that illuminates this new world from below and every direction surrounding

175
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,940
you, what could be called the ground meets what could be called the sky.

176
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:28,620
And it's this blacker than black opaque darkness.

177
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:35,180
And there's nothing on the horizon except for a single imposing building way off in

178
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:37,980
the distance, dimly lit from below.

179
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:45,820
But you can see that it's a slightly shiny pitch black, which I think would trigger your

180
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:53,480
memories back to a specific picture that you found inside Julie Maxwell's crashed vehicle.

181
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:58,100
But Keith doesn't notice any of that because he is staring straight up and each of you

182
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:04,640
understand why he hasn't stopped staring when you follow his gaze up into a tube of pure

183
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,800
light hanging above.

184
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:13,320
The interior wall of this incandescent pipe is made of the same light you currently stand

185
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:20,240
on and there seems to be only complete darkness beyond its well lit passage.

186
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:25,200
So imagine, yeah, someone who is just extremely massive out of this world bigger than you

187
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:31,880
is holding a them sized toilet paper roll above the world that you are in.

188
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:37,880
The interior of the toilet paper roll is made of this pure light, but the outside of it

189
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,260
is made out of pure darkness.

190
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:45,640
And so you can see up through it past all the light is darkness as well.

191
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:53,560
And inside this immense, resplendent toilet paper holder, consistently plotting the glowing

192
00:12:53,560 --> 00:13:00,120
terrain somehow simultaneously moving toward you and staying at a uniform range, there's

193
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:07,200
this towering, lumbering beast seemingly made of the darkness that surrounds everything

194
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,320
in this place.

195
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:16,280
It walks on two massive legs the size of trees, its broad shoulders swing back and forth high

196
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,780
above the glossy ground.

197
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:26,200
As you all stare, its image seems to form and reform over and over like incomprehensible

198
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:30,600
little glitches and you cannot fully make sense of its shape.

199
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:35,120
Real quick, I'm not getting, I don't have a clear picture of the tube.

200
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,280
Can you do it one more time or tell it to me in a different way?

201
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,960
Yeah, I don't actually either understand.

202
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:45,040
This creature is walking on the light plane inside the tube?

203
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:54,320
Yeah, so imagine that gravity is pulling everything inside this tube to the walls of the tube,

204
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,540
the internal walls.

205
00:13:55,540 --> 00:14:00,220
So this thing's walking on a different level of gravity from you guys.

206
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:05,780
It's walking down, but it is clearly like on the wall of the tube.

207
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,380
Like a hamster wheel?

208
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:10,020
Yeah, like a sideways hamster wheel.

209
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:15,940
So imagine that this notebook is what you guys are standing on, okay?

210
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:22,780
Now above you is the toilet, I'm holding up a toilet paper roll above the notebook.

211
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:30,860
From where you are, you can see all around, you basically just see a circle, like an oval

212
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,980
in the sky made of light.

213
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:38,820
But then as it moves around, this thing is not stagnant, it's kind of moving.

214
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:44,560
It is always directly above you and also very much not all at the same time.

215
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:50,320
So it is a round circle that then you can see as you're looking straight up, you are

216
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:57,720
seeing the inside of this tube as well as through the tube into the darkness that is

217
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,920
above it.

218
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:05,300
Now inside the tube, if you guys are looking straight up, there is this creature inside

219
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,520
the tube and it's massive.

220
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:16,420
And I imagine the tube to be gargantuan in nature, we're talking hundreds of yards across.

221
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:22,300
So this creature, while not taking up a ton of room inside of this tube, also you can

222
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:25,440
see how huge this thing is.

223
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:30,820
The creature is walking along it, but it could also be walking along this side or across

224
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:37,340
the top or across the other side or across the bottom, always seemingly lumbering toward

225
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:42,300
you and keeping the exact same distance away from you all at the exact same time.

226
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,380
Is it bipedal?

227
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,500
It is bipedal.

228
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:48,140
Its feet are rooted on whatever side it's on, but its head is always in the middle.

229
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,140
Yes.

230
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,140
Cool.

231
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,860
Which means that this thing is fucking huge.

232
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:52,860
Good screenshots, Luke.

233
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:53,860
Thank you.

234
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:56,380
I knew those would come in handy.

235
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:57,380
Does that make more sense?

236
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:59,460
It does make more sense, for sure.

237
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,900
Everyone notices, everyone rolls sanity.

238
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:08,820
What about those of us that have maybe very little sanity?

239
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:09,820
I failed.

240
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:12,860
You should have rolled a three like me.

241
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:16,460
I grabbed a different character sheet just off the top of a pile of character sheets

242
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:19,020
and I was like, how do I have fucking 40 sanity?

243
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,340
I'm kicking ass right now.

244
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:24,060
Oh no, I've only got 10.

245
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:32,180
Justin, Dondi Pettymore looks up and just has this like, of fucking course reaction.

246
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,180
I failed my sanity.

247
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:35,700
I failed, but not over my power.

248
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,780
John Lee Kevinmore the third loses zero sanity.

249
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:44,620
He just sees the agitation on the faces of those around him as they show the telltale

250
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:47,700
signs of losing a little bit of their minds.

251
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:50,460
And he then becomes agitated because it's like, what?

252
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:55,980
Come on, guys, we go through this shit every day at this point.

253
00:16:55,980 --> 00:17:01,220
It's good to be in a game where you present a very, what you think is a very cool monster

254
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:09,420
and then someone succeeds on their sanity check and says, I'm over it.

255
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:13,900
It's not even, it's not even, you know, of course it's a cool monster, but like, is it

256
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:14,900
breaking?

257
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:18,180
Why is it still breaking your minds?

258
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:20,980
Get over the world you knew and embrace, embrace the muck.

259
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:23,140
Keith Vigna lose one sanity.

260
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:26,280
Clark Bishop sees something a little bit different.

261
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:31,640
Not only does Clark see what this is, but he also sees the history that he has with

262
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,640
this creature.

263
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,040
So I need you to roll a D4.

264
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,040
It's a two.

265
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,400
Lose two sanity.

266
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:43,120
Hey, uh, Don, what did that phone look like?

267
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,760
It looked like a old, like old school rotary phone.

268
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,720
So that's not, that's not the phone we're looking for, is it?

269
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,560
No, I do not think so.

270
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,360
I can't say that that looks much like a rotary phone.

271
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,240
I start running towards the building.

272
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:01,360
Can we hear anything in this space other than the roars of the monster?

273
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,540
There's a slight hum in the air in the distance.

274
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:10,240
It's not completely silent, but you can't make out what the hum in the distance is.

275
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,240
Where are they?

276
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,360
Where are they?

277
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,800
Where is who, Clark?

278
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,840
The circle.

279
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,700
The last time I was here, the circle was here.

280
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,700
They were chanting.

281
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,040
They were chanting to keep this creature at bay.

282
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,040
I don't, I don't see them.

283
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,040
I don't hear them.

284
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,040
Where are they?

285
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,040
This can't be good.

286
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,220
This can't be right.

287
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,220
This can't be right.

288
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,220
This can't be right.

289
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,220
This can't be right.

290
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:30,220
This can't be right.

291
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:31,220
This can't be right.

292
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,220
That's the thing.

293
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,220
That's the thing I've been telling you guys about.

294
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,220
And the circle was keeping it here.

295
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,220
And if they're not here, I don't, I don't know what's, I don't know what's going to

296
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,220
happen.

297
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,220
I don't know what's going on here.

298
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,220
Do you remember what they were chanting?

299
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,480
Hey handler, can I, Joe doesn't for sure.

300
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,980
Could Clark do a role to see if he remembers?

301
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:43,980
Yes.

302
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:52,720
Do an intelligence at a, okay, I'm going to do negative 20 for how many lives you've lived

303
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,360
since then.

304
00:18:54,360 --> 00:19:01,100
Another negative 20 for seeing this thing and being in its presence and then a third

305
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:11,080
negative 20 for the sheer horror of being sent to another realm by a little bug that

306
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,080
was attached to your foot.

307
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:18,820
So I've got a 55 so I can only crit fail this.

308
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:19,820
It's a 29.

309
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:20,820
Okay.

310
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:28,380
I thought I was giving you like a slight chance, not a zero chance, but even if it was negative

311
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,380
40, he would have failed.

312
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:31,620
No, I can't for the life of me remember what they were saying.

313
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,300
I didn't really care about chance back then.

314
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,340
I wasn't paying attention.

315
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:39,140
Your mind was like fucking split in half in that moment when, when you got sent to this

316
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:43,140
other plane of existence for a moment, honestly, I've been kind of hoping I could run into

317
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:47,340
some of those circle of knowledge guys while we were here and they'd help us get back.

318
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,980
So that kind of blows my pant plan out to shit.

319
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,460
I don't, I don't know what's going on now.

320
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:55,700
Well, I mean, if we could remember that chant, maybe, you know, we could go back and grab

321
00:19:55,700 --> 00:20:01,180
Leo and sit him here to die for eternity while he chants it, or we could at least say something

322
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,180
temporarily.

323
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:04,100
It seems like that's kind of a dead end though.

324
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:07,860
Yeah, it'd be a good idea if I could just remember that damn chant.

325
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,860
How far away has Keith gotten?

326
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:12,380
I was going to say, am I actually making progress?

327
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,380
Yeah.

328
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:17,780
The world around you guys is stretching as Keith is running away from you.

329
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:21,540
In my vision, is the building getting any closer to me?

330
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:23,680
Yeah, ever so slightly.

331
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:27,660
And then all of a sudden I need Thomas and Joe and Justin to take their headphones off.

332
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:30,300
Uh oh, I hope I'm alive when they get back.

333
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:36,620
Well, at least one of you probably will be as you are running.

334
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:46,380
You are completely caught off guard by this humanoid figure hanging by its ankles.

335
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:53,380
Some darkness has pulled itself and you see it's holding on to the bone right above the

336
00:20:53,380 --> 00:21:00,820
ankle and it is rubbed down through this man's pants to where the pants are cut and it is

337
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,460
rubbed through the skin.

338
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:08,300
There's blood pouring down the man's legs up toward his torso and then onto his face,

339
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:13,180
a face that you recognize that is beet red.

340
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:20,260
And there are two belts pulled tightly around his neck.

341
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:26,700
The word fool is branded on his forehead.

342
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:38,380
And Keith beans, you are looking directly into the face of Keith beans, your own face,

343
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,720
maybe a year or two older.

344
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:47,300
And he is wearing clothes that you recognize as clothes that you wore when you were going

345
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:50,220
under the name Silas Cole.

346
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,220
Damn.

347
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:56,860
Well, so I'm running and this thing like just pops up in front of me and I smack right

348
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:58,620
into the body.

349
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:04,900
It takes me a second to realize and I look down and he's dead obviously, right?

350
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:05,900
He's not.

351
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,340
His face is completely red.

352
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:12,180
You've you've kind of woken him up and you said he has two belts around his neck, two

353
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:15,020
belts around his neck, no belts on his pants.

354
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:20,740
I look and I see the belts and I want to try to like get them from around his neck, like

355
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:26,340
take them off.

356
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:30,060
Are you, who are you?

357
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:32,980
Who are you?

358
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,380
His eyes get huge.

359
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:35,380
Keith.

360
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:36,380
Yeah, that's me.

361
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:37,380
It's me.

362
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,380
It's you.

363
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:39,380
It's me.

364
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:45,700
Are you, are you Keith or are you, are you Silas?

365
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,700
Yes.

366
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,100
How'd you get here?

367
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,140
She threw me through the hole.

368
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,140
Who did?

369
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,540
She threw me through the hole in the ground.

370
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,540
Mary.

371
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,540
Mary.

372
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:58,100
How long you been here for?

373
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:02,340
Oh, I guess that'd be like a bunch of years, right?

374
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,340
Uh huh.

375
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,340
Yeah, a bunch.

376
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:09,820
Uh, you, he like tries to reach out to grab you and you see like his hands have been hanging

377
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:13,620
down to the ground below his head for who knows how long.

378
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:14,620
They're completely red.

379
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:17,860
Uh, he seems to have no use of the fingers.

380
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:24,060
So he's just kind of like prodding at you, uh, with these unmoving phalanges.

381
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:31,340
And he's like, let me try to get you down.

382
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,940
Get the blood out of your head.

383
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:39,100
I want to like touch the goo, whatever is holding him up is, am I able to manipulate

384
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,100
it at all?

385
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,100
Yeah, it's malleable enough.

386
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,100
You can manipulate it.

387
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:45,820
I just try to pull him down and like stretch it out enough to where it breaks.

388
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:51,220
Yeah, it's, it's honestly, it's being hung up by nothingness up into the air, up into

389
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:58,100
the sky around you as if, uh, it is, it stretches out and then kind of snaps.

390
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:00,580
I'm thinking like laughing, like Laffy Taffy.

391
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:02,740
If you like stretched out Laffy Taffy.

392
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:03,740
Yes.

393
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:06,060
Perfectly dark Laffy Taffy.

394
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:08,660
I don't know what, stand up.

395
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:11,620
Can you stand up?

396
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:16,020
There is no blood in the whole bottom half of his body.

397
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:23,260
And so as he's trying to stand up, I start massaging him from his head down to try to

398
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,260
put the blood back down.

399
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:36,660
Yeah, I think like this seems like, that seems like the perfect moment for the rest of the

400
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:40,460
group to come up and meet you.

401
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:43,620
Tell you they're sorry.

402
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:57,100
Okay, uh, Luke, go ahead and take off your headphones for a second while they catch up

403
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,340
with you.

404
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:59,340
Real quick.

405
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:03,180
In all that time you were just with Luke, did he make it to, um, did we see him like

406
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,180
go in the tower?

407
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,220
No, no, no, no.

408
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:09,580
He made it about a third of the way before you see that there's something else in the

409
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:14,100
distance that he is, he's dealing with, uh, another body there.

410
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:21,580
Uh, it was hanging upside down at first and then he like pulls it down to the ground.

411
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:27,060
And then as you continue approaching, he kind of gets it up onto its feet.

412
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,780
Can we make out the figure from here?

413
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:30,500
Do we, is it a person?

414
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:34,860
If you guys get to the point to where you can make out who it is, then I'll have Luke

415
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,620
back on the call cause you guys will be within earshot.

416
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:38,620
I'm good with that.

417
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,820
Is Don with us?

418
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:40,820
Yes.

419
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:42,020
What about mentally?

420
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:45,020
Not so much.

421
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:49,780
Don's kind of muttering to himself about like the phone over and over again.

422
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:54,020
Now that we've come in here, he's like, where, why did the phones, I thought we heard the

423
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,020
phone in here.

424
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:58,260
I don't, we need to find the phone.

425
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:02,820
He's staring at the tube still while you guys are talking and muttering to himself about

426
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:03,820
the phone.

427
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:07,740
Good point Don, we did hear the phone from in here, so presumably the phone is somewhere

428
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,740
around here.

429
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:13,460
Yeah, we gotta, we gotta find, we gotta find that phone.

430
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:15,820
John, your friends are weird.

431
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:21,180
I think we need to get together and use this here petty more magic that we possess.

432
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:26,340
I've been calling it muck magic, but I've taken to calling it as of late.

433
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:27,340
That's wonderful.

434
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:28,340
That's beautiful.

435
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:31,540
Hey, you know, you know, Uncle Don, you seem, you seem just a little bit rattled.

436
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:36,940
My muck magic, my, my spider senses, as it were, they're kind of sending me towards a

437
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:37,940
Keith's direction.

438
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:41,220
I think we should maybe go check that out and see, see if he's sure these friends of

439
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:42,220
yours are reliable.

440
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,860
We got an important mission right now.

441
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,100
We got to find that phone.

442
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,100
Oh Lord.

443
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:51,600
No, but they are definitely connected with the phone and everything.

444
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:56,160
So like it's, we sticking with them is probably the best direction towards that.

445
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,740
If you think so.

446
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:58,740
We got it.

447
00:26:58,740 --> 00:26:59,740
We got to find that phone.

448
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:00,740
All right.

449
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:08,620
So like I said, my, my, my muck Dar, my, my, my tingly connection to this world, you know,

450
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:10,100
it seems to be pointing me towards Keith.

451
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,100
Let's just head that way.

452
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:15,340
And I grabbed him by the shoulder and I kind of, I kind of push him towards that direction

453
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:17,220
and start walking with him and guiding him.

454
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:21,260
I slap his arm off me and walk that direction by myself.

455
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:23,980
Such a healthy family relationship.

456
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:29,860
Not like a mean slap, but you know, I'm like, yeah, like uncles do.

457
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:34,260
You know, an uncle slap.

458
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:40,740
The three of you approach a site that I'm going to let Keith describe or Luke rather.

459
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:48,260
So you see a man sitting on the ground in front of Keith and Keith is putting his hands

460
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:51,900
around the man's head like this.

461
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,220
We can see that, but you're going to have to describe it for the listeners.

462
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:56,580
He's like two hand jerking off the whole head.

463
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:57,580
Yeah.

464
00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:02,740
Like massaging his head with his hands around his head and like pushing down and then like

465
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:10,820
going down his shoulders or like up his hands and down his body and like rubbing him down.

466
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:18,300
And then as you get closer, you see that the man in front of him on the ground has just

467
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:21,100
looks like all the blood is in his head.

468
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:26,060
And after you kind of get over that, like the kind of purpley red on his full forehead

469
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:29,540
is the brand fool.

470
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:35,420
And after you see all that, you realize that the man is Keith beans.

471
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:38,140
Oh shit.

472
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:40,300
But he's got some old timey clothing on.

473
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,300
Oh shit.

474
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,740
Is he like visibly older or?

475
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:46,580
Few years I think is what, not much.

476
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:49,940
Is he responding to our Keith's touch at all?

477
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:50,940
Oh yeah.

478
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:51,940
Thank you.

479
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,940
Thank you Keith.

480
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:54,940
This is getting out of hand.

481
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,940
Now there's two of them.

482
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:57,940
Guys.

483
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,860
I found me.

484
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,500
It's Silas Cole.

485
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,500
Yeah.

486
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:07,900
What happened to make you sound like that?

487
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:12,620
And he points it to belts that are on the ground and he points at his neck.

488
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:16,180
He had these belts around his neck and he was hanging upside down and I'm just trying

489
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:19,620
to get the blood back down into the rest of his body.

490
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:24,140
And I'm still massaging his head.

491
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:32,020
Oh God.

492
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:37,940
I forget Keith that you did pass that EMT class so you do know exactly what to do in

493
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:38,940
these situations.

494
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:44,380
Hey Silas, Silas, Keith, put your arm, raise your arms up so the blood goes down into the

495
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:46,380
rest of your body.

496
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:47,660
His arms go up in the air.

497
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:53,100
Keith, why does, why does Silas Cole look, it's you, but you said it's Silas.

498
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,900
I don't, I don't understand.

499
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:57,660
I thought I had told you this before, but.

500
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:58,660
Yeah, you have.

501
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:02,740
I'm just, I'm as Clark seeing two Keith's before him and you're calling one Silas.

502
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:04,700
I feel like it needs to be reiterated.

503
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:12,420
Well, just, he's Silas and I'm Keith, but I'm, I'm remembering now as a, as I see it,

504
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:16,900
as I see him, uh, he said he got thrown into a hole and that's how he got here.

505
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:24,180
And I remember when I was him, I got thrown in to a hole by Mary.

506
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:29,140
But if I was him, but I'm me, but I.

507
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:30,940
When did, when were you him?

508
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:36,500
Uh, well, a long time ago, right?

509
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,500
Roll sanity.

510
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:48,420
Thomas, I'm sorry to bring it up again, but can you move the microphone in a better position

511
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:49,420
for you?

512
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:53,060
Uh, I, yeah, it's that or me like breathing right into the mic.

513
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,060
Like yeah.

514
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,060
Okay.

515
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:56,060
I get that.

516
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:59,100
It's just, when you do lean forward, then we get really, really good audio.

517
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,060
But then when you don't, it isn't good.

518
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:03,060
Yeah, I understand what you mean.

519
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:08,580
But I think you're a great person and you're a good friend and a great role player.

520
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:09,580
And I love you.

521
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:10,580
I love you too.

522
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:14,100
But I do take that all intensely personally and I'll never forgive you.

523
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,100
Good.

524
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,100
Good.

525
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:17,100
That seems, that seems perfect.

526
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,100
That seems right.

527
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:20,940
But I, I have learned my lesson and I'll definitely just keep all that in mind and not like I'll

528
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:22,980
keep that in practice.

529
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:28,020
Luca, how'd you do on the sanity check?

530
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,500
I failed.

531
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,500
Regular fail.

532
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:31,500
Okay.

533
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:36,580
Just lose one sanity is you can't remember when you were Silas or when you were you and

534
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:40,200
you think maybe that you're both at the same time right now.

535
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,200
Isn't that you?

536
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,200
I mean, it is you.

537
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,200
Yeah.

538
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,900
I look at, I look at him and I punched myself in the stomach.

539
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:46,900
Did that hurt?

540
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:47,900
No.

541
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:48,900
Okay.

542
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:49,900
Just.

543
00:31:49,900 --> 00:32:00,220
But I, there's so much pain going on in my throat and my head that I don't know if a

544
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:03,060
stomach punch would really do much damage right now.

545
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:06,940
I start rubbing his throat like you would a dog that you're trying to get to swallow

546
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:10,940
a pill.

547
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:14,820
Remember in Looper when they torture that guy by like removing parts of him in a different

548
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:18,780
time and all of a sudden his little bits are gone in this time?

549
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:19,780
That shit was crazy.

550
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:20,780
That was crazy.

551
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:24,780
God, I hope that doesn't happen to us.

552
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:28,980
Just something to keep in mind if you ever, you know, get out of line, Silas.

553
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:36,220
Not that we have that capability, but come on, you know, we could figure it out.

554
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:38,620
You're a past version of, of Arky.

555
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:39,620
Do you know us?

556
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:41,620
Do you, are you, do you know who I am?

557
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:42,620
Yeah.

558
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:43,620
You're the overseer.

559
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:49,260
Oh, you know me as the overseer.

560
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,260
That's that's, that's kind of.

561
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,260
No, you're Clark Bishop.

562
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,260
You're my partner.

563
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:55,260
But we talked about it like, oh, who's the chosen one?

564
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,260
He's ball.

565
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:58,940
You know, that's, I don't know you.

566
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:03,660
And he points at Dawn and he's like, I don't know who you are, but I don't know who you

567
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:04,660
are either.

568
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:05,660
God damn it.

569
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:09,540
Did you become Silas Cole after one of our days waking up in the mausoleum?

570
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:16,780
Yeah, it was when you were up in the mausoleum and I went down underneath Bean's Pond and

571
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:23,900
then I saw Tildy and I used the gun and I was Silas Cole.

572
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:26,300
Am I going to have to rerecord all of your lines?

573
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:30,260
Yeah, and you're going to have to, you're going to have to pop yourself in the throat

574
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:32,380
a couple of times before you do.

575
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:36,180
Yeah, he's, he's right.

576
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,180
I remember now.

577
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:44,140
So then, so then after you were thrown as Silas Cole into a hole, a, a Cole in a hole,

578
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:46,300
then you woke up again in the mausoleum with us?

579
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,300
No.

580
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,300
No, not you.

581
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:49,300
Our Keith.

582
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,300
Sorry.

583
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,300
Sorry.

584
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,300
Not you.

585
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:53,300
Oh, you want to hear mine though?

586
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:55,500
Don't we, didn't we just figure yours out?

587
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,780
Just the past, not the, not the present.

588
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:02,380
Oh, I kind of assumed since you got here, you just been hanging, uh, what's, what's

589
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:03,380
been going on?

590
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:05,380
I just been hanging.

591
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,380
Okay.

592
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,380
Yeah.

593
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,380
Yeah.

594
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,020
But all the people I put here did this to me.

595
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:12,180
Once you got here or before you got here?

596
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:13,180
Once I got here.

597
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:14,180
Gotcha.

598
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:15,180
Okay.

599
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:17,380
So there's, there's other people around and Clark starts looking around.

600
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:19,140
What do you mean the people you put here?

601
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:25,340
You remember when we put, when, when we put the people, when we put the people in here

602
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:26,500
to get rid of them?

603
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:30,740
Like the professor and the rancher.

604
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:31,740
That's right.

605
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:34,740
Cause we got the big judge, the big judge was Mary.

606
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:35,740
Yeah.

607
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:36,740
That's right.

608
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:38,340
Mary got a hold of Judge Cortland.

609
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:39,340
Good God, Keith.

610
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:42,860
How many did you kill in the service of contentions founding?

611
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:51,100
I mean, I, I really, when I was him, I had, I would say literally no control over my actions.

612
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,100
Yeah.

613
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:55,740
But isn't that just what the Nazi said?

614
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:56,980
I'm not saying you're a Nazi.

615
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:59,140
I'm just saying you're, you're saying like a Nazi.

616
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,140
I'm not a Nazi.

617
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,140
Yeah.

618
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,540
But Silas says things like a Nazi.

619
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:03,540
I'm Silas Cole.

620
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:04,540
No, you said it.

621
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:05,540
And I'm Keith.

622
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:06,540
He's me.

623
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:07,700
And no, but he's him.

624
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,460
I'm not him right now.

625
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:10,460
He is me though.

626
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:11,800
I'm him, but he's not me.

627
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,280
And I'm him, but I'm not him.

628
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:18,300
I'm going to, we, we, we should draw a big mustache on one of you just in case we ever

629
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,300
get you confused.

630
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:24,760
You see the giant brand on one of the foreheads that says fool.

631
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:27,140
No, I think a mustache would be...

632
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:31,020
John still takes out a Sharpie and...

633
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:32,020
And puts it on your Keith.

634
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:34,960
A fancy little, yeah, on our Keith.

635
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:35,960
Okay.

636
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:38,460
There we go.

637
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:41,900
Now we'll just remember Keith has, has the, the fetching.

638
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:44,180
You better not draw a Hitler mustache on me.

639
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:45,820
No, I didn't draw you Hitler mustache.

640
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:49,880
I really like this fella named Jimmy Buffett and he's got a song called Pencil Thin Mustache

641
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:53,660
about all the movie stars that you grew up watching.

642
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:54,660
Yeah.

643
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:55,660
It's on that.

644
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:58,460
It's, it's a couple tracks after that I think on the greatest hits maybe.

645
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:01,660
But yeah, you got a little, a nice little Clark Gable mustache.

646
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:02,660
Well thank you.

647
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:05,540
But maybe we gave it some, some fun little twists up at the end.

648
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:06,540
Yeah, I think we did.

649
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:07,940
Look, there's a happy little twist.

650
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:11,620
You said Mary threw you in the portal.

651
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:13,780
This question goes out to any Keith.

652
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:16,620
How did you, how did, why did Mary turn on you?

653
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:24,820
Well, Mary was his ball, you know, that I made, that he made, that we made, and it got

654
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:26,220
into...

655
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,220
He high fives you.

656
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:28,220
I high five him back.

657
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:29,220
How's his hands looking?

658
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:35,780
As soon as he high fives you, he's like, ah, and like kind of shakes him, shakes him out

659
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:40,660
because it would hurt so much if you high five someone with all the blood still like

660
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:41,660
in your hands.

661
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:49,940
I mean, yeah, so the ball that we made, ball, which is Mary, got in a big old guy, giant

662
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:58,980
guy, and he, you know, basically killed, kind of got rid of us.

663
00:36:58,980 --> 00:36:59,980
A giant guy?

664
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:00,980
Big old guy.

665
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:03,540
Is that guy up there in the toilet paper tube?

666
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:05,740
No, not that big.

667
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:07,940
Also what do you know about that, I point up?

668
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:11,820
You know, Clark was babbling a little bit about it, but it seemed like he, he had taken

669
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:12,980
leave of his mind there.

670
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:17,180
He seemed to think that there should, should be others, other people, other...

671
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:21,860
Yeah, uh, Fool Keith, uh, you've been here for a while, have you seen other people around

672
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:22,860
here?

673
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:25,940
Have you seen, when I was here a long time ago, there were people who were kind of keeping

674
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:27,540
that thing at bay, and I don't see them here now.

675
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:30,220
Have you seen them go anywhere, do anything, or?

676
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:34,820
They used to, ah, they used to, there used to be people there, yeah.

677
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:35,900
What happened to them, do you know?

678
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:39,500
Nope, they're just not there no more, but that thing's bigger now.

679
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:44,140
You said you got kicked out of there, and I point to the building, you got kicked out

680
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:45,140
of there?

681
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,140
Who kicked you out?

682
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,140
A long time ago.

683
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,140
Who kicked you out?

684
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:58,900
Gambler, named Thomas, uh, the professor, and the rancher, and, uh, bartender, the piano

685
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:02,320
player, they were all super angry that I'd thrown them down here.

686
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,900
Why were you throwing them down here again?

687
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,980
Again, this goes out to either Keith.

688
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:07,980
They were finding out about the residue.

689
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:08,980
Right, right, right.

690
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:09,980
Residue?

691
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:10,980
I've been calling it a muck.

692
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:11,980
Mmm, I like that.

693
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:12,980
Good name.

694
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:15,980
Wait, were we using the residue to make stuff?

695
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:19,980
When we made stuff, the residue is the magical brite product.

696
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:20,980
Okay.

697
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:21,980
Silas?

698
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:22,980
Nah.

699
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:24,980
John, John's getting real serious here.

700
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:30,980
So you're, you are the, the Keith who became Silas, and, and made ball?

701
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:31,980
Yeah.

702
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:37,980
At long last, this is my, my real daddy.

703
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:38,980
Ahhh!

704
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:45,980
And he reaches out, and he's gonna swipe, uh, some of the, uh, muck from your face,

705
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:50,780
and he puts it on his thumb, and then he swipes it across your forehead, and he says,

706
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:51,780
Simba!

707
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:54,980
Did you just lie, you just lying king to me?

708
00:38:54,980 --> 00:39:00,780
Oh my god, I kneel down, I kneel down in front of him, and I start rubbing his head like

709
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:01,780
Keith is.

710
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:02,780
Yes!

711
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:04,660
Thank you, Daddy.

712
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:06,660
Thank you, thank you for accepting me, Daddy.

713
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:08,660
Oh, you're beautiful.

714
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:10,660
Thank you, I try, I hope I'll make you proud.

715
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:12,660
Have you, have you had children?

716
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:16,660
No, I'm a bit of, you know, I'm a bit of a, bit of a hound dog, bit of a bachelor,

717
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:18,660
race car, former race car driver, you know.

718
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:20,660
He, he puts out a fist to pound it.

719
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:22,660
Yeah, I pound it.

720
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:24,660
Can I ask you just one question, Daddy?

721
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:26,660
Of course.

722
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:28,660
Why did you bring me into this world?

723
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:33,540
Well, it's tricky, because I, I already did.

724
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:35,540
So then I did it again, because I already had.

725
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:40,540
Ain't that just why parents keep having babies, you know, when you get right down to it?

726
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:45,540
Just doing what's expected of you, or what you think's expected of you.

727
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:47,540
I get it, I get it.

728
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:50,540
Alright, so it's not like I was planned, but you had to do it, I get it, alright.

729
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:54,540
I have as much of a valid reason for existing as any of these guys did.

730
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:56,540
I think so, yeah.

731
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:02,420
Silas, are you saying you only did things because they, it happened already?

732
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:04,420
And you're just trying to do them?

733
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:06,420
I didn't have to try.

734
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:10,420
I just did what I did, and it happened to be the thing that already happened, because that's what I did.

735
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:12,420
That's deep, that's like Eastern.

736
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:14,420
You're so wise, Daddy.

737
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:18,420
Wow, that is...

738
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:22,420
Daddy, if we get out of here, can we have a catch?

739
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:25,420
Of course.

740
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:28,300
Right on, right on. Thanks, Pops.

741
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:41,300
I hate to break this up as sweet as it is, but I, you know, before I ran right into you, I was trying to get to that building because of that, as I point up.

742
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:50,300
And when you point up, you all look and see this thing, it has been getting a little bit closer, you think, than the last time you saw it.

743
00:40:51,180 --> 00:41:01,180
And you remember that this Silas Cole version of Keith did say that since the people around it have gone, that the thing has been getting bigger.

744
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:15,180
And then you look back down at the building in the distance, and you all see, making its way toward you, across this twinkling terrain, is some sort of four-wheeled personal vehicle.

745
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:18,180
Like a double-wide motorcycle.

746
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:29,060
But as soon as it starts to get close enough for you all to recognize the wheelsman of this sort of smart car without the little doors or roof, a portal opens up right above it.

747
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:40,060
A very similar portal to the John Made Hole you all just recently escaped through, and crashing down onto the back of this tricycle with the same amount of wheels in the front as in the back,

748
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:50,060
is a gaunt woman with crazy hair and enormous thick glasses that make her already large eyes look even bigger.

749
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:59,060
She wears jeans and a white t-shirt with a leather jacket, and four wiry metal tendrils protrude from the back of her neck.

750
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:09,060
One dethrones the previous driver of this four-wheeler, tossing him behind like carelessly placed banana peels in Mario Kart.

751
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:14,060
As the other three plant themselves firmly into the fluorescent floor below.

752
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:30,060
Rose Mary, but this time with periods after each letter in Mary, holds on tight to her mechanical steed with 42 horsepower, and her long silver limbs fling her up high into the air,

753
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:43,060
so high in fact that she seems to click into a new set of gravitational rules, and she falls wheels first onto the ground of the bright cylinder that hangs above this place,

754
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:54,060
and houses the lumbering Gigantam Bropithecus, and the consistently one-upping itself ATV drives up and away from you.

755
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:56,060
Holy shit.

756
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:57,060
Damn.

757
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:59,060
Holy shit.

758
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:01,060
So anyway, could we have a catch sometime?

759
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:14,060
So basically this four-wheeler's heading toward you guys. It's in between you and this imposing building off in the distance that's made out of a shiny black substance,

760
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:25,060
and suddenly a portal opens up above the four-wheeler. Rose Mary, M-A-R-Y, comes down and lands on the back of the four-wheeler.

761
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:33,060
One of the four metal tendrils coming out of her neck rips the driver off of the four-wheeler and tosses them behind her,

762
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:49,060
and then the other three tendrils plant themselves into the ground and fling her and the ATV up into the air so fucking high that they go up inside the toilet paper holder,

763
00:43:49,060 --> 00:44:01,060
cylinder of light that is hanging above you all, and she lands inside of it and starts driving towards this massive lumbering beast that you've seen.

764
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:02,060
Roll Sanity.

765
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,060
Fail.

766
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:08,060
Fail.

767
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:09,060
Fail.

768
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:17,060
This is a zero slash one, so you guys all lose one sanity as you already knew the ball was inside of Rose Mary,

769
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:25,060
because two of you watched Marvin Glass fling the ball at her when it took her over before she fired the gun,

770
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:32,060
and you already knew that these things were capable of, like, insane feats.

771
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:43,060
However, a couple new things. One, just the sheer fact that this thing anime jumped itself with a four-wheeler up that high is fucking crazy,

772
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:53,060
and then for Jon, personally, realizing that you can be in your body and use the metal tendrils is a new idea,

773
00:44:54,060 --> 00:45:01,060
which that could be sanity-blasting in and of itself that you could be a Spider-Man villain if you so choose.

774
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:10,060
If you were to look at the back of Jon's neck, you might see some tendrils, like, just bubbling up beneath the surface in anticipation.

775
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:13,060
This is dope.

776
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:15,060
Everybody roll unnatural real quick.

777
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:19,060
Crit pass.

778
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:21,060
I crit pass too. I got a 22.

779
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:22,060
Holy shit.

780
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:23,060
I got a 55.

781
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:24,060
And I got a 9.

782
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:27,060
I bet my roll be the most important one.

783
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:30,060
I bet you fail.

784
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:32,060
Hold on, I lost one of my dice.

785
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:38,060
That happened to me earlier, and I couldn't find it, and now I'm rolling with my second choice dice.

786
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:41,060
Are you fucking kidding me? I got a 71 on a 70.

787
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:43,060
Oh, shit.

788
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:46,060
That other dice was probably a crit success.

789
00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:48,060
I don't know why I did that voice.

790
00:45:52,060 --> 00:46:04,060
Dice truly do tell a story, and oftentimes they follow the history, lore, and plot of what's happened in the campaign leading up to this point, which is always handy.

791
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:10,060
Yeah, that's because they're controlled by God, who wants us to have a cool game.

792
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:13,060
Oh, good. I'm glad that you've seen the light.

793
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:18,060
If you have a lame role-playing group with bad rolls, it's because God doesn't love you.

794
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:20,060
You just gotta pray harder.

795
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:24,060
Get them rolls right. Get them rolls right, boy.

796
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:29,060
Rolls right with God, rolls right with me.

797
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:32,060
And you guys are standing there.

798
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:35,060
And you guys are standing there.

799
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:48,060
Dawn, you don't see fucking anything, but the other three see a bright flash of light right in front of you.

800
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:52,060
And Thomas, take off your headphones real quick. Justin, same with you.

801
00:46:52,060 --> 00:47:15,060
Clark and Keith see the translucent, spindly hand holding an old, strange-looking camera with a green light lit as it takes a picture of the three of you standing on this luminous land with darkness in the sky behind you.

802
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:38,060
And the face of Marvin Glass, the orifice with just red lipstick outlining a hole, is only seen for a glint, just a moment in your mind before the bright flash of this camera snaps you back to your current existence.

803
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:41,060
This thing blipped in for only a moment.

804
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:42,060
Dope. Holy shit.

805
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:44,060
Sick. So sick.

806
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:46,060
Holy shit.

807
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:50,060
I rub my eyes and I'm like, did anyone else see that?

808
00:47:50,060 --> 00:47:53,060
Clark is also just kind of blinking real hard.

809
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:59,060
I think I saw it. I saw it was him. Did you see it?

810
00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:01,060
I saw him, too.

811
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:03,060
Yeah, what are y'all talking about?

812
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:05,060
You remember seeing that picture, don't you, Clark?

813
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:08,060
Yeah, and so I guess we just saw him take it?

814
00:48:08,060 --> 00:48:09,060
I think so.

815
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:10,060
Is that what that was?

816
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:11,060
I'm sorry, what did y'all see?

817
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:13,060
It was Marvin.

818
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:14,060
Taking our picture.

819
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:15,060
Taking whose picture?

820
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:17,060
Ours. Here, standing here now.

821
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:19,060
You've seen a picture of that?

822
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:21,060
I'm pretty sure.

823
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:25,060
Yeah, me and Keith were in his office at one point. I don't know if you remember.

824
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:27,060
A couple days ago.

825
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:29,060
You were underwater at the time, I believe.

826
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:32,060
Yeah, no, I'm not allowed to listen to those episodes.

827
00:48:32,060 --> 00:48:38,060
And he had a picture. He'd taken it with the camera with the tubes on it.

828
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:40,060
And he kept asking us why we were in it.

829
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:42,060
And at the time, we sure as shit didn't know.

830
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:46,060
But now we know. I guess it was now.

831
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:49,060
Back then, he took our picture now, right?

832
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:53,060
I still couldn't really answer his question if he asked me right now.

833
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:54,060
Exactly, yeah.

834
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:56,060
At least I know where we were?

835
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:59,060
Well, that's a fun little Easter egg, I guess.

836
00:48:59,060 --> 00:49:03,060
Anyway, you think Rosemary's gonna kill that thing?

837
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:07,060
Real fast, the timing is still all-timey weirdness here.

838
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:13,060
Because he showed us that picture, and then Rosemary did her shit in the office, and she fired the gun.

839
00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:16,060
And now we see, presumably, that she ended up here.

840
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:20,060
But he'd already taken the picture when we saw all that.

841
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:28,060
But just now, we saw that Rosemary came down through a portal, went tearing off into the glowing light up there on the ATV, and then the picture got taken.

842
00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:30,060
So there's something weird still going on with all this.

843
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:32,060
Oh, there's something weird going on here?

844
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:45,060
Literally, the second Keith moves into frame and pokes at the little metal tendrils coming out the back of your neck.

845
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:48,060
I give him an uncle slap.

846
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:50,060
The pet and uncle slap away.

847
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:52,060
Ouchie, ouchie.

848
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:54,060
Don't touch my spine.

849
00:49:55,060 --> 00:50:02,060
This all just reiterates that time doesn't move the same here, which could be to our advantage or disadvantage. I don't know what to make of that.

850
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:05,060
All things are happening at once, maybe? I don't know.

851
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:08,060
Well, it could be, but probably not, but maybe.

852
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:13,060
I turn to fool Keith. Fool Keith, how long have you been here? From your perspective?

853
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:21,060
It sounds like it was to hang you from your feet for a year. Would you be able to know that it was a year?

854
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:23,060
Yeah, like if I had a watch or something?

855
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:25,060
You don't really have day and night cycles here, I guess.

856
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:29,060
No, it's always bright from the bottom and dark from the top.

857
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:32,060
How many years would you guess you couldn't guess how many years you've been here?

858
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:35,060
Like a hundred and forty.

859
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:38,060
That's a long time. I'm sorry. I'm sorry about that.

860
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:42,060
That means apparently you don't age here either.

861
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:48,060
Or need food or water, I guess. Was somebody feeding you? Was somebody keeping you alive here?

862
00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:51,060
No, never got hungry. Never got thirsty.

863
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:58,060
I had thought maybe you had peed and pooped all over yourself hanging upside down, but luckily that probably wasn't an issue.

864
00:50:58,060 --> 00:51:00,060
No pee-pee, no poo-poo.

865
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:06,060
I want to look up and see what's happening up above us right now.

866
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:12,060
The all-terrain vehicle is driving toward the Gigantam Rapithecus.

867
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:16,060
Do they either one seem to be making progress towards each other very much?

868
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:17,060
Nope.

869
00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:21,060
So, Keith, you said the Circle was keeping that thing up there.

870
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:23,060
No, that was me.

871
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:24,060
Sorry.

872
00:51:24,060 --> 00:51:25,060
Was I saying that?

873
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:29,060
No, Daddy. I just got Clark and Keith confused.

874
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:31,060
Something weird's happening here.

875
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:35,060
Yeah, I think you're right. Damn.

876
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:42,060
Why did the Circle want to keep this thing up there, and what do y'all think Mary might want with it?

877
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:48,060
The way it was conveyed to me, there's a chance that that's the only thing the Circle of Knowledge has ever wanted, was to keep that thing here.

878
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:56,060
They seemed to think that it was kind of the Destroyer sort of be-all-end-all. If it got out of here, things would be bad.

879
00:51:56,060 --> 00:52:03,060
And I'm a little fuzzy that there's, I think, the Overseer. I think the Overseer is supposed to do battle with that thing maybe.

880
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:08,060
He's like the savior that is going to stop that thing once and for all.

881
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:10,060
Yeah, and you're the Overseer.

882
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:11,060
Should we boost you up there?

883
00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:13,060
And we're here.

884
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:20,060
I'm not the Overseer yet though, guys. I don't know anything like old Clark does. Clark old does shit that I can't even dream of doing.

885
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:22,060
Maybe you become it when you defeat this thing.

886
00:52:22,060 --> 00:52:31,060
Yeah, and I mean if you are the Overseer, eventually it means you are the Overseer now. It's been inside you the whole time.

887
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:33,060
Like ball was inside John.

888
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:35,060
But not the whole time, was it?

889
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:36,060
The whole time.

890
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:37,060
Yeah, the whole time.

891
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:39,060
Oh, the whole time.

892
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:40,060
Mrs. Doubtfire, you guys like that scene?

893
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:42,060
It's a fun movie.

894
00:52:42,060 --> 00:52:43,060
The whole time?

895
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:44,060
Anyway.

896
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:47,060
Or like Harry Potter. Always.

897
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:53,060
I always cry at that scene. You know that movie is about kids' parents dying. That tears me up every time.

898
00:52:53,060 --> 00:52:54,060
Or like Sandlot.

899
00:52:54,060 --> 00:52:57,060
Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu

900
00:52:57,060 --> 00:53:00,060
Yeah, that dog. That big funny dog.

901
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:01,060
Yeah.

902
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:02,060
He's scary, but ultimately he's a sweetheart.

903
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:06,060
So Clark, if you were going to fight that thing right now, how would you do it?

904
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:14,060
I mean, Jon, you remember when we were fighting Anne, I did do a little bit of what seemed like magic.

905
00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:18,060
I was just repeating what I heard though. I don't know if... I can't like create.

906
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:19,060
I don't think.

907
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:24,060
What if you can though? What if like that circle was just saying the words you say right now?

908
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:30,060
I was hoping that when I found my parents' book that I could use that to figure out more stuff. I just...

909
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:35,060
Just say some bullshit and we'll see if that like giant stumbles or something. I don't know.

910
00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:37,060
Too-doo-hock-a-noo. Try that.

911
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:39,060
Try too-doo-hock-a-noo.

912
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:40,060
Don.

913
00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:42,060
Maybe it coming out of your mouth gives it power.

914
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:50,060
Clark summons up all his gusto that he can and kind of walks away from the group a little bit,

915
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:55,060
cracks his neck, looks up at the monster up there and with...

916
00:53:55,060 --> 00:54:00,060
And as you walk away from the group, you see that the man who was thrown off the back of the four-wheeler

917
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:05,060
as the portal opened up above and a man got thrown off the four-wheeler.

918
00:54:05,060 --> 00:54:08,060
He's been walking toward you slowly this entire time.

919
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:11,060
And he's pretty much up on you at this point.

920
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:16,060
And so you can keep talking for sure and give it a go.

921
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:25,060
But just to let you know what you see, which is a slender, muscular man in a black t-shirt.

922
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:33,060
He's got tribal tattoo sleeves on both arms going down to his hands and fingertips.

923
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:38,060
Friend is branded across his forehead.

924
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:40,060
Joe, do not let him distract you.

925
00:54:40,060 --> 00:54:45,060
He knows that if we say too-doo-hock-a-noo right now, the game's over. We win.

926
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:49,060
Don't get sidetracked.

927
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:53,060
And he's carrying a huge stick, like a staff.

928
00:54:53,060 --> 00:54:58,060
And the staff is made out of, you guessed it, pure darkness.

929
00:54:58,060 --> 00:55:00,060
I was going to say wood.

930
00:55:02,060 --> 00:55:05,060
Clark nods at him and says, hey, Jermaine.

931
00:55:05,060 --> 00:55:10,060
Too-doo-hock-a-noo! Too-doo-hock-a-noo!

932
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:13,060
Was it Jermaine? I was looking up which one it was.

933
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:14,060
It absolutely is Jermaine.

934
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:15,060
Fuck yeah.

935
00:55:15,060 --> 00:55:18,060
As you start saying too-doo-hock-a-noo, he's like, oh, hey.

936
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:25,060
Do I roll unnatural for my too-doo-hock-a-noo, or does nothing happen?

937
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:29,060
You know, we're kind of making it up as we go.

938
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:34,060
You certainly roll unnatural for your too-doo-hock-a-noo.

939
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:43,060
This is either narratively great or narratively awful, but it's an 83 on a 63, so I fail.

940
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:47,060
Wasn't failing an unnatural roll going to be bad?

941
00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:48,060
Yeah.

942
00:55:48,060 --> 00:55:50,060
And it motherfucking is, y'all!

943
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:55,060
This towering, lumbering beast plotting for it on two legs seems to...

944
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:07,060
As it realizes that it has been unleashed from the treadmill spell that had been previously put on it,

945
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:14,060
and it begins, boom, boom, boom, moving faster and faster and closer and closer toward you.

946
00:56:14,060 --> 00:56:20,060
And as it reaches, the ATV is going straight towards it, and the two are about to collide.

947
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:22,060
Clark is yelling back to the guest, bad idea, bad idea, bad idea!

948
00:56:22,060 --> 00:56:25,060
And he's going to start trying to get toward the building.

949
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:27,060
Just say it louder.

950
00:56:27,060 --> 00:56:37,060
Rosemary leaps from the back of this all-terrain vehicle and wraps her tendrils around the beast,

951
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:43,060
creating a sort of saddle on this thing as she rides on the back of his neck

952
00:56:43,060 --> 00:56:52,060
as this gigantic umbropithecus with Rose M-A-R-Y on the back of it leaps from the edge of the cylinder

953
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:58,060
and lands on the same plane as the five of you.

954
00:56:58,060 --> 00:56:59,060
Oh, fuck.

955
00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:03,060
Jon goes from six to midnight and considers betraying humanity for the first time.

956
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:07,060
Hell yes.

957
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:10,060
Fuck me.

958
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:28,060
I'm on the borderline, leaving my mind at your altar.

959
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:32,060
Crossing the double line, doing it every time.

960
00:57:32,060 --> 00:57:38,060
Tell me what kind of world are you living in?

961
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:47,060
What kind of world are you living in?

962
00:57:52,060 --> 00:58:12,060
What kind of world are you living in?

963
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:21,060
What kind of world are you living in?

964
00:58:21,060 --> 00:58:23,060
What kind of world are you living in?
