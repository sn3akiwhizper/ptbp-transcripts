1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,080
Greetings, my chubby babies.

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,160
It's your thick fat daddy Wolf the dog,

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,760
here to slap, lap, and crap

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:12,080
right into your chunky little ear holes.

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,100
I, of course, am emanating from the basement.

6
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:21,100
694.2 PTBP, from the future to the past.

7
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:26,520
But the past is your present?

8
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,640
I don't know, time travel confuses me,

9
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,040
but I still do it constantly

10
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,760
because it makes my innards feel frisky.

11
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,040
Speaking of frisky business,

12
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,520
this week's Howlin' with Wolf is from

13
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,800
at Shemelan Shmusk, who tweeted about the show

14
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,840
and tagged that pretending pod.

15
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,360
It's that easy, y'all.

16
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,800
They right, hell yeah.

17
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,400
From Adam to Eric,

18
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,720
thank you for letting me know about this podcast.

19
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,360
It made the first few months

20
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:01,200
of baby Aurelia's life even better.

21
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,780
Recently, I took her to her six month checkup,

22
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:09,000
and after they gave her her shots, they cut my dick off.

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,140
Turns out it's actually pretty common.

24
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:15,200
We love you all the way from DC, DTF.

25
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,640
Well, Adam and Eric, I hope y'all have fun

26
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,160
running around dickless or whatever.

27
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:25,240
Do y'all know how they dispose of discarded dongs?

28
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:30,240
I sure do, and I'll never tell how or why I know

29
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:35,680
or what kind of wine goes best with a wok-fried wang.

30
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,660
Remember, if you think we deserve it,

31
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:40,720
spread around some internet love

32
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,000

00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,920
Also, my producer says the current plan

37
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,400
is to record another Q&A episode for this here main feed

38
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,760

45
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,000
Me, I'm tired of the past.

46
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,200
It's given me them blues.

47
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,600
Thank fuck this is the last broadcast

48
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,580
I'm blasting out old news.

49
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,760
Last episode, the PCs all signed some sort of paperwork

50
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,360
to partner with the calm, comfy campground

51
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,440
on something called Operation Hole Puncher

52
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,440
in a room filled with the flowers found all over the island.

53
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,000
The memories continued to bounce around,

54
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,480
from a cottage filled with security equipment

55
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,560
to the rounded-off meeting room

56
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,440
dealing with a broad woman and a scrawny man

57
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,180
who were attempting to spray them

58
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:01,760
with some sort of spray made from the flowers on the island.

59
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,160
Angela, when cornered and confused

60
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,880
by the actions of the group,

61
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:10,160
began chanting something strange and lost in translation.

62
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,400
With time being all finicky,

63
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,400
I'm assuming this may perhaps be the last time

64
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,660
I'm asked to choose a brand new track

65
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:20,520
to premiere on this audio cast.

66
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:24,400
And I've been saving this one for this perfect moment.

67
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,840
I have the distinct pleasure to present to each of you

68
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,680
for the very first time, Dream Girl with Pretty Sexual.

69
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,440
["Pretty Sexual"]

70
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,440
[" Working For You"]

71
00:03:41,440 --> 00:04:03,520
["

72
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:11,920
Mr. Zach's Wild Bone."

73
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,240
Mr. Zach's Wild Bone.

74
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,240
Is that why...

75
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:20,520
Even though it won't be in the video.

76
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:24,240
People are like, what the fuck is this dialogue?

77
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,680
I want to get off Mr. Bone's wild ride.

78
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,680
Hi, Zach.

79
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,680
Hey, Joe.

80
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,680
Hey, Justin.

81
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,680
Go fuck yourself up.

82
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,680
That's nice.

83
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,680
Good burp, Luke.

84
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,840
You're being mean to me, Zach.

85
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,840
Oh, I don't think so, personally.

86
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,200
I personally do think so.

87
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,200
Oh, okay.

88
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,200
Personally.

89
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,840
Could you just give me a rundown of how I've been mean to you?

90
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,840
That way I can better myself?

91
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,840
No.

92
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,840
You called him ugly.

93
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,200
You called him stupid.

94
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,240
You hurt me emotionally.

95
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,440
You have been hitting him a lot.

96
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:54,360
Yeah, you just punch him in the shoulder like really hard all the time.

97
00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:01,320
These are all fair, but do you have any real ones?

98
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,880
I like when you sit on my chest.

99
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,760
I don't like when you hurt me the other way.

100
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:11,800
Well, you should say the safe word, which is...

101
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,800
Papa Zechariah.

102
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,480
Oh, that's when I stopped.

103
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,640
Anything referring to me being a father?

104
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,640
No, I'm out.

105
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,640
Dad.

106
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,640
Dad.

107
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,560
Oh, no, dad.

108
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,560
Finish it.

109
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,560
Say daddy.

110
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,120
No, daddy is hot.

111
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,120
Dad is disturbing.

112
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,440
Yeah, that's why I want you to finish it so I can finish.

113
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,440
All right, so...

114
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,440
You're my male father figure.

115
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,880
Oh, okay.

116
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,680
We need to take this all out.

117
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,680
All of it?

118
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,680
Yeah.

119
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,680
Some of it.

120
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,680
Okay, let's start now.

121
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,680
Hey, Zech.

122
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,680
Hey, Joe.

123
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,880
Would you fuck, Justin?

124
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,880
Would I?

125
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,880
Have I?

126
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,880
Did I?

127
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,440
You had a rough middle school, didn't you?

128
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,160
Doesn't everybody have a rough middle school?

129
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,160
Nah.

130
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,160
Okay, well...

131
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,200
Nah, we're all super cool in middle school.

132
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,800
That's why we have a role-playing podcast.

133
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:21,040
Well, I'm glad you guys let me join you.

134
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,360
How's everyone's week going?

135
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,360
Better than middle school.

136
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,360
About the same as middle school.

137
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,040
It's a real middle school kind of week.

138
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:34,920
I get teased a lot by my peers.

139
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,920
Shut up, Justin.

140
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:41,840
I'm about to start spring break and then not have to go back to class afterwards, so that's

141
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,840
nice.

142
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,840
That's wild.

143
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,840
Pretty much.

144
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,840
Aren't you a little old to be in college?

145
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:51,360
Shouldn't you just quit like the rest of us?

146
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,360
Nah.

147
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,360
I like them young.

148
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,360
Oh, no.

149
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,360
My teacher's younger than me.

150
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,360
Oh, yeah.

151
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:05,360
You just like to learn from the people who are like the newest to the technology.

152
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,360
There's a creepy Tony LaRosa bobblehead licking down approvingly at Luke.

153
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,360
Hey, Tony.

154
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:18,360
I love the things you do.

155
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,360
Holy shit.

156
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:25,360
This is for five people in our listening audience, but have you guys seen the video of Tony LaRosa?

157
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,360
The DUI thing?

158
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,360
The DUI in Florida in the early 2000s.

159
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,360
No.

160
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,360
It's pretty good.

161
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,360
It's amazing.

162
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,360
I haven't.

163
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:38,360
Okay, Tony LaRosa, former manager of the St. Louis Cardinals.

164
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,360
Rip.

165
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,360
Rip.

166
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,360
Good team.

167
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,360
Yeah.

168
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,360
Anyway, he-

169
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,360
The MLB.

170
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,360
Oh, yeah.

171
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,360
He fell asleep at a stoplight in Florida during spring training.

172
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,360
What?

173
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,360
Just fell asleep, stopped in his car.

174
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:58,360
There's an interview with him at the police station where he's just wasted, and he's like,

175
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,360
do you know what I do?

176
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,360
I'm in professional baseball.

177
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,360
Oh, no.

178
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,360
Anyway, it's good shit.

179
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,360
That's super cool of him.

180
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,360
Well, God damn it.

181
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:20,360
He also took Albert Pools to that fucking Glenn Beck rally for America.

182
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,360
I didn't know that.

183
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,360
Yeah.

184
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,360
How did Albert feel about that?

185
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:30,360
No, that he was super into it because they're all rich, Christian.

186
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:36,360
The two sometimes go hand in hand, other times not, and today we're playing a role playing

187
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,360
game.

188
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,360
Are you sure?

189
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:43,360
Any of you who are just now joining us here on Pretending to Be People, let's give them

190
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,360
a quick rundown.

191
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,360
So on December 1st-

192
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,360
Bold of you to assume we remember the stories.

193
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,360
No, let's just do it real quick from start to finish.

194
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,360
I show up every day just like blank.

195
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,360
End of sentence.

196
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,360
I was curious.

197
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,360
All right, well, start blank today.

198
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,360
This is not a good start.

199
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,360
Walter and Alan Grimes in the lead, Charles Digby and Roger Fairfield in the middle, Bradley

200
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,360
Cooper and Jack Russell in the back.

201
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,360
You are all paddling for your lives.

202
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,360
I need everyone to roll a sanity.

203
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,360
I pass.

204
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,360
Failed, 94.

205
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,360
I pass.

206
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,360
On a-

207
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,360
Oh, no.

208
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,360
49.

209
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,360
Oh, shit.

210
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,360
99.

211
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,360
Yes.

212
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,360
That's a great success, right?

213
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,360
Almost 100.

214
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,360
Joe and Luke, if you guys could leave the room real quick.

215
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,360
Oh, no.

216
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,360
Don't leave.

217
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,360
He'll do bad things.

218
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,360
Luke, no.

219
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,360
Goodbye forever.

220
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,360
We're about to drown in this lake.

221
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,360
Oh, no.

222
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,360
No, we're about to get eaten by a big thing.

223
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,360
Or fully absorbed into the system.

224
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,360
Oh.

225
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,360
We'll start working against them.

226
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,360
You guys failed sanity, which means that you turn around now.

227
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,360
Sometimes it's a good thing.

228
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:08,360
That Martin Cupertino, you're actually in the same canoe as Jack Russell.

229
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:14,360
In the next canoe forward, we've got Charles Digby, who looks back just in time to see

230
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:21,360
an unspeakable worm-like abomination erupts above the surface of the water.

231
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,360
This thing rises 10 feet up out of the black inky darkness.

232
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:32,360
It is tube-like, covered in a squamous black partially translucent membrane.

233
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:39,360
Its body is segmented, and toxically green pulsating arteries and veins can be seen through

234
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,360
its thin-looking exterior.

235
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,360
It has no identifiable eyes or nose.

236
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:52,360
Its cavernous, circular mouths, one sitting just inside the other, are lined with hooked

237
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:57,360
teeth, and it spits out a saliva that is somehow darker than black.

238
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:04,360
From this maw, a sharp stylet protrudes, like something between a tongue and a noodle-like

239
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,360
needle.

240
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:10,360
It plunges down and attaches to the top of Jack Russell's head.

241
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:16,360
And then it rips him out of the back of the canoe, sucking the short, portly man up into

242
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:23,360
its round, teeth-encircled mouth, before slipping quickly and quietly back into the pitch-black

243
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,360
water of Lake Calm.

244
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,360
I need you both to roll a d8.

245
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,360
One.

246
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,360
Yeah.

247
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,360
Oh, what was that?

248
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,360
Squamous.

249
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,360
What was that?

250
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,360
Squamous.

251
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,360
Squamous.

252
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,360
Did I say it right?

253
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,360
I think you did.

254
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,360
I thought it was squamous.

255
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,360
I rolled a five.

256
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,360
Okay, so you lose five sanity.

257
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,360
Cool.

258
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:52,360
Martin Cupertino loses five sanity, and Charles Digby just loses one sanity.

259
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:55,360
You know, this can't be real.

260
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:02,360
Martin Cupertino, I need you to put in order fight, flight, and freeze from most likely

261
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,360
to least likely.

262
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,360
Flight, fight, and freeze.

263
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,360
Well, yeah, if he thinks he can't match it, flight.

264
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,360
If he has no choice, fight.

265
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,360
I think the last thing he would do is freeze.

266
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,360
Okay, sounds good.

267
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,360
So if you roll a one, you'll freeze.

268
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,360
If you roll a two or a three, you'll fight.

269
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,360
And if you roll a four, five, six.

270
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,360
On a d6?

271
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,360
You will flight.

272
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,360
Three, which is fight.

273
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,360
Fight.

274
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:29,360
This thing is all the way back down in the water, so you are now alone in your canoe,

275
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,360
ready to fight.

276
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,360
What do I have on me?

277
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,360
Do I have a syringe?

278
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,360
Do I have anything else?

279
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:41,360
You've got the map, and the syringe, and the cassettes.

280
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,360
Nice.

281
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:49,360
I unspool the cassettes and aim to choke the sea creature.

282
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:56,360
No, I think I get the syringe out, pokey, and in one hand, and he's ready.

283
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:00,360
This guy sucks, but he does know martial arts.

284
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,360
He knows it.

285
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,360
He can do it.

286
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,360
I don't like to say that he can, because he sucks, but he can do it.

287
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,360
He can do it.

288
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,360
He's pretty good at it.

289
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,360
So he's ready.

290
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,360
He's in the canoe.

291
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,360
Oh, my God.

292
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,360
He's just like, fuck you.

293
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,360
Fuck you, you worm piece of shit.

294
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,360
And if it's him or the worm, it's going to be him and the worm.

295
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,360
Okay.

296
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,360
Yeah, fuck yeah.

297
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,360
Then you'll get a bonus if it comes for you next.

298
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,360
Joe, Luke.

299
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,360
Fuck.

300
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,360
Joe, a microphone?

301
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:35,360
Do we say it in the mic?

302
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,360
Joe.

303
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,360
I'm sorry.

304
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,360
We're both sorry.

305
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,360
Walter Grimes.

306
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,360
You're still rowing and rowing, and Alan is like, we got to keep rowing.

307
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,360
We got to keep rowing.

308
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,360
So I need you to roll a strength or an athletics or swimming.

309
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:00,360
Walter succeeds on his check and does some good rows.

310
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,360
Walter does?

311
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,360
Or Alan does.

312
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,360
Sorry.

313
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,360
Walter fails.

314
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,360
Walter fails.

315
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,360
Okay, so you guys keep rowing.

316
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,360
You're getting almost to the shore on the opposite side.

317
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,360
You're very, very near the shore on the opposite side.

318
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:18,360
Roger Fairfield, you're in a canoe with Charles Digby who...

319
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,360
Roger, uh, uh, uh, uh.

320
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,360
We got to row.

321
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,360
We got to row.

322
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,360
We got to row.

323
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,360
He looks, I'm frozen staring behind us.

324
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,360
Oh shit.

325
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,360
I'll look behind me.

326
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:36,360
You look behind you just in time to see the water just kind of like, and there's nothing

327
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:42,360
there, including the nothingness that used to be Jack Russell, who is no longer in the

328
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,360
back of the canoe.

329
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,360
You just see Martin Cupertino by himself now.

330
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,360
And what is he doing?

331
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,360
Was he in front or back?

332
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,360
He was in back.

333
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,360
Let me just say that.

334
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,360
Sure.

335
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:58,360
Like he took time when they were fleeing at the start of this to say to Jack Russell,

336
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:01,360
like, no, I'm in back.

337
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,360
I steer.

338
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,360
It's the power position of a canoe.

339
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,360
So yeah, I mean like who was in back?

340
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,360
Me.

341
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,360
Okay.

342
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:14,320
So Jack Russell gets eaten and uh, I guess I've got to do everything myself and he paddles

343
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,320
that much harder.

344
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:19,240
So I need you all to roll, uh, Justin and Thomas, Martin Cupertino and Charles Digby

345
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:22,960
will be at a negative 20% for failing their sanity checks.

346
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,960
Okay.

347
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,120
I, I fail.

348
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,680
I would have passed except for that negative 20.

349
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,680
Yep.

350
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,680
What was I rolling?

351
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,680
Athletics?

352
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,680
Yeah.

353
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,680
Yeah.

354
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,680
I passed.

355
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,680
Oh wait.

356
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,680
Athletics.

357
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,680
I thought sanity.

358
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,680
No athletics.

359
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:42,400
Negative 25 minus 20 is 45 I pass 39.

360
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,400
I failed.

361
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:48,360
Am I just like, let's get the fuck out of here, Roger.

362
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:51,120
I don't like his little chart that I see over there.

363
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,520
I've got a little chart that they can see, so I'll just show it off.

364
00:15:54,520 --> 00:16:01,520
But basically there are four blank boxes for each canoe and the Grimes have three boxes

365
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:05,060
marked off because they are the closest to the shore.

366
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:09,180
And then Fairfield and Digby in a canoe have two out of the four boxes checked.

367
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,180
Oh no.

368
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:12,180
I thought most boxes was worse.

369
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,180
Turns out it's good.

370
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:15,860
The least boxes checked.

371
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:20,100
Martin Cupertino just has one box checked out of four to get to the other side.

372
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,120
Well, that makes sense.

373
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:27,820
At this point, I'm going to roll a D six to decide as the water around all of you begins

374
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:34,620
to move and something massive underneath is choosing its next target.

375
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:39,220
We're going to say a Cooper Martin Cupertino.

376
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,220
You're one.

377
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,680
Uh, we got, you're rolling a D six.

378
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,260
I'm rolling a D six.

379
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:46,340
Roger Fairfield is two.

380
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,340
Charles Digby is three.

381
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,980
Walter Grimes is four.

382
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:54,500
Alan Grimes is five, six re-roll miss.

383
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,500
It stays dormant.

384
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,500
How about that?

385
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,500
A good option.

386
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,500
I'm, I'm four.

387
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,500
I don't know.

388
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:03,220
Which dice did you just roll?

389
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,220
It's a one.

390
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,220
Martin.

391
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,980
That's Martin Cupertino.

392
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,820
So the water around you.

393
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:10,820
Shit.

394
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:11,820
Wow.

395
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,820
Jack just built a whole cocktail.

396
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:18,300
Hey, it looks okay.

397
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:23,220
We were in a real tense moment.

398
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:28,380
There's another ice cube.

399
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,380
We got him a sippy cup.

400
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:32,940
I got a closed lid on that there, bud.

401
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:36,540
Have you been recording our casual conversation this whole time?

402
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:40,380
No, he just, that is, that is from the country.

403
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,660
That is from the country.

404
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:42,660
Praise.

405
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,380
No, I'm back.

406
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:51,780
So that noise that you just heard was me spilling my drink all over myself and over a lot of

407
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:52,780
XLR cables.

408
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:57,940
That's what he calls simultaneously coming pissing and shitting his pants.

409
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:58,940
Typical Zach.

410
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:01,220
Spilled my drink.

411
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:04,780
My cochlea just exploded everywhere.

412
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:05,780
That's what it's called, right?

413
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:06,780
No, you're close.

414
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:07,780
You're very close.

415
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:08,780
It's Ploweka.

416
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:11,780
That's what it's called, right?

417
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:12,900
So, implant.

418
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:22,700
So it's not often that, all right, so piss, shit, and jizz just spewed out of Zach's ears.

419
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:25,420
All right, shit.

420
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:32,540
Okay, so it's not often that I would do this, but it makes sense that in that moment I'm

421
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:37,820
going to use my actual actions instead of my dice roll.

422
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:45,140
I had just rolled a one on your actual, I don't know what you mean, this giant abomination

423
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:51,180
coming for Martin Cupertino, but I was reaching for my dice to roll that attack.

424
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:56,380
So instead of that attack roll, I'm going to use the fumble because Zach fumbled my

425
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,500
attempt to grab the dice.

426
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,500
Gotcha.

427
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,500
Yeah.

428
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,500
You blundered.

429
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:05,020
I blundered and therefore- Our actions in this world affect their world.

430
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,020
Oh my God.

431
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,060
That's too much responsibility.

432
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:12,100
If we kill Zach, he can't do any bad stuff to us anymore.

433
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,100
Oh no.

434
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,300
He couldn't do any good stuff either.

435
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,300
Oh.

436
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,300
That's true.

437
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,300
When has he?

438
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,300
Aw.

439
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,300
Aw.

440
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,420
Not true.

441
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:23,420
He flosses before every session.

442
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:26,580
Like a big old silk pillow.

443
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:29,380
So basically you all- Body pillow.

444
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:35,900
Turn around just in time to see this absolute tube-like creature comes 10 feet out of the

445
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,540
water- And spills its drink.

446
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:44,820
And spills its drink all over, so actually- Shit.

447
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:49,660
So what happens is the Grimes and Roger Fairfield haven't seen this yet, so I'll describe it

448
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:52,820
once again, but it rises 10 feet out of the water.

449
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:59,440
It is an unspeakable worm-like abomination, tube-like, covered in squamous black partially

450
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,660
translucent membrane.

451
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:07,860
Its body is segmented and toxically green pulsating arteries and veins can be seen through

452
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:10,340
its thin looking exterior.

453
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:13,660
It has no identifiable eyes or nose.

454
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:19,440
Its cavernous circular mouths, one sitting just inside the other, are lined with hooked

455
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:24,000
teeth and it spits out a saliva that is somehow darker than black.

456
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:30,720
And actually, instead of going for an attack on Martin Cupertino, all of this spit comes

457
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,280
out and just lands all over the canoe.

458
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:40,880
You can roll a dodge or a dexterity to try to avoid this goop getting all over you.

459
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,200
Didn't you say it already failed?

460
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,520
Yeah, it failed- But it vomited.

461
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:47,560
Literally grabbing you and- Doing a bad.

462
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,560
Pulling you in.

463
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,160
It just gaks.

464
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,720
It does what Zach did.

465
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:55,920
Okay, I got a 61.

466
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,280
Roll athletics since that's a 65.

467
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,280
There you go.

468
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,780
So you swiftly move in this canoe from the back up to the front real quick.

469
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:10,060
As the back gets completely drenched in this goop that is blacker than the water of Lake

470
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:16,560
Calm, which you thought was already so dark that it basically pulled light away from the

471
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:21,880
viewer's eyes and you guys can roll again to try to paddle away.

472
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:25,440
Roger, pull it together.

473
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,160
Athletics or what?

474
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,160
Anything that'll work.

475
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,160
So swimming, athletics.

476
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,160
Pass.

477
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,160
42.

478
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,960
I was hoping I could say, you got it, bud, but I failed again.

479
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,280
As I'm telling him to pull it together, I also failed more.

480
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,760
I'm like, oh, cramp.

481
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,600
So you guys both failed?

482
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,600
Yeah.

483
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:48,840
So as this goop just gets all over the back of Martin Cupertino's canoe, he jumps back

484
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:54,080
and keeps paddling from the front with such a swiftness that he pulls up even with Roger

485
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,120
Fairfield and Charles Digby.

486
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:01,920
Just huge plunging drives into the water as he's fucking crewing it.

487
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,380
Swiftly moving, yeah.

488
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:06,320
Swiftly through the water in perfect, literally-

489
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,320
Stroke.

490
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,320
Stroke.

491
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,320
Stroke.

492
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,320
Stroke.

493
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,320
He's saying that.

494
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,040
We got to do it like that.

495
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,040
My arms hurt.

496
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,040
He's going to hear sticks.

497
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:20,920
So the Grimes actually reach the shore on the other side and immediately Alan's like,

498
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,800
we got to get up onto the shore.

499
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,600
And he's trying to pull the canoe up onto the-

500
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:32,120
I'll grab underneath where I was sitting and just, yeah, sprint, bringing it up on shore.

501
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,920
And you guys are up on the shore.

502
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:38,400
Now we've got three people in the water, so I'm going to roll another D6.

503
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,680
Oh God, I'm so nervous to like move.

504
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,120
Need a cup holder for you.

505
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:50,440
All right, so one and two are going to be Martin Cupertino, three and four is Roger

506
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:54,480
Fairfield, and five and six is Charles Digby.

507
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,480
Cocked.

508
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,640
Crack die.

509
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,640
That's a two.

510
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,640
Two correct die.

511
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,640
Who is two?

512
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,740
Martin Cupertino.

513
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:03,740
This thing hates him.

514
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:06,320
Quit being mean to Tommy.

515
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:10,400
I mean, Martin is the one who should be.

516
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,400
Yeah.

517
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:15,120
This thing's coming for you.

518
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:19,140
Just jump, like comes out of the water, almost like a proboscis, but like something from

519
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:23,980
inside its maw is coming toward you and is trying to attach to the top of your head.

520
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:29,320
How are you going to try to dissuade it from taking you into itself?

521
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:33,880
I reach back behind me and grab the now departed Jack Russell's paddle.

522
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,520
Actually, it would be right next to me because he was in front.

523
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,520
Exactly.

524
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,520
I grab that and I just try to shove it up the maw instead of my head.

525
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,520
Absolutely.

526
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,520
Okay.

527
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:48,360
So go ahead and roll melee weapons or karate.

528
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:51,240
I think I actually do have a martial arts skill.

529
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,800
Where is it?

530
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,640
If you wrote it in, it'd be on the left.

531
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,000
Was it just your unarmed combat?

532
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,720
It is my unarmed combat.

533
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,120
Can I roll athletics or actually no, melee is better.

534
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,120
Melee.

535
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,360
Melee.

536
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,360
Meal worm weapons.

537
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,360
Yes.

538
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,000
50 on a 50.

539
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,480
I rolled a 10.

540
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,480
So you win.

541
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,480
Yeah.

542
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:18,240
So as this thing comes down, this like noodle like needle coming out of the middle of its

543
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:23,600
circular vast mouth is like trying to fight its way through.

544
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:29,920
So Martin Cupertino with his left hand is still plunging his paddle into the water.

545
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,920
Left.

546
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,920
Right.

547
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,920
Left.

548
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,920
Right.

549
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:39,360
And he reaches behind him for the paddle of the departed Jack Russell.

550
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:44,800
And he just like jams it straight into the air behind him at where he thinks the mouth

551
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,800
is.

552
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:49,240
And it just happened to be the moment where this proboscis was coming in straight at your

553
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,240
head.

554
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:56,280
You knock it back and as the maw like gets pulled down with this weird style that's protruding

555
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,800
from its mouth.

556
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:06,960
You like jam the or in sideways like in star Wars when Luke gets the in the compactor.

557
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,960
Yes.

558
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:08,960
No.

559
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,960
In the mouth.

560
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:10,960
The rain core.

561
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,960
The rain core.

562
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:12,960
Yeah.

563
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,960
I keep its jaws open.

564
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:14,960
Yeah.

565
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,960
Yeah.

566
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:16,960
And it lets it lets out this.

567
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:25,360
That might be a really cool OS startup sound.

568
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,760
But he's now he's now he's paddling with both hands.

569
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,760
All right.

570
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,000
Everybody roll athletics except for Luke.

571
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
You're good.

572
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
You're safe.

573
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Can I pass 16?

574
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Yeah, absolutely.

575
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,380
As they're rowing and rowing, what are the Grimes doing?

576
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:39,380
I pick up.

577
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:45,260
I want to find a medium sized rock that's like kind of sharp and I'm going to skip it

578
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,800
at the monster.

579
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,800
Fantastic.

580
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:52,560
So you'll do that to help aid if it's coming at someone on the next attack.

581
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,800
Roger fails again.

582
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,560
For every one of these, I rolled a 92, a 93, and a 96.

583
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,560
Oh my God.

584
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:01,920
Roger Fairfield can't canoe to save his God damn life.

585
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,920
I mean, literally.

586
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,920
He really can't.

587
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,920
He rolled a 92, 93, and 94.

588
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:05,920
I know.

589
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,920
I know.

590
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,920
Why didn't you lie?

591
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,920
I should have lied.

592
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:09,920
I should have lied.

593
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,920
I passed.

594
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,920
Hang on.

595
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,920
Let's go back.

596
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,920
It was a 92, a 93, and a 94.

597
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:14,920
Roll again.

598
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,920
We'll do everything for you.

599
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,920
I passed as well.

600
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,920
All right.

601
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:22,840
So Fairfield Digby and Martin Cupertino, the canoes are side by side at this point and

602
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:29,480
you guys are one success away from being safe on the shore on the other side as this water

603
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:35,880
moves and you feel the canoes, both of your canoes just kind of like lift up a little

604
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,160
bit as you're rowing.

605
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:44,600
One two for Martin Cupertino, three four for Roger Fairfield, five six for Charles Digby.

606
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,140
That's a four.

607
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:47,420
That's Roger Fairfield.

608
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,920
You deserve it.

609
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,920
Okay.

610
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:56,040
So first, as this thing is coming, as this thing is coming up out of the water, I want

611
00:26:56,040 --> 00:27:00,800
to roll from Walter Grimes for skipping a rock.

612
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,800
Whatever it is.

613
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,740
It's a 98, so I fail.

614
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:06,480
The rock is too big and it skips twice and then it flunks.

615
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,480
You just drop it.

616
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,480
My wrist.

617
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,480
Ow, my hand.

618
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,480
Yeah, no.

619
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:22,880
Alan will take a page out of your book and try to do the same thing.

620
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:28,280
And he too fails, so there will be no assist on this, Joe.

621
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:36,600
So as this thing is coming up out of the water, emitting this weird, almost green, almost

622
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:40,720
dark, just like liquid that is all over its body.

623
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:47,400
It's actually like an oil now that is covering the top of Lake Calm surrounding you.

624
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:51,420
And it is coming down straight for your head.

625
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,840
What are you doing?

626
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:56,840
Having seen Martin just handle it with his oar, I'm going to try and if it's coming straight

627
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:01,000
down at me, I want to knock it like a baseball bat would be knocking a ball out of the air.

628
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Absolutely.

629
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Go ahead and roll.

630
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,560
Is that melee or unarmed?

631
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:09,000
That'll be melee.

632
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
You mean that thing I don't have?

633
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,120
A ninety-two.

634
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:18,160
I'm going to use, this is the third set of dice I've used, but I'm going to change the

635
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,160
dice again.

636
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,160
Let him re-roll.

637
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,160
Let him re-roll.

638
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:26,360
I rolled an eighty-four, so I failed.

639
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:34,880
And so as this water beast rises up and comes down toward you, you bat away just enough,

640
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:40,520
kind of throws it off its trajectory, and the proboscis goes right into the canoe in

641
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:45,900
between you and Charles Digby, and it actually punctures into the canoe, so you'll both take

642
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:51,320
a negative twenty percent on your next athletics checks to try to get to the safety of the

643
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,320
shore.

644
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,320
Wonderful.

645
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,320
Now you're taking me down with you hun.

646
00:28:55,280 --> 00:29:04,880
But it is now back under the water, and you guys are rowing for your lives.

647
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,120
I finally pass one.

648
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,320
I get a forty-three.

649
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,880
But wait, with your minus twenty percent?

650
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,880
I don't pass.

651
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,880
Fuck!

652
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,880
Well, me neither.

653
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,880
Shit.

654
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,600
It doesn't really matter.

655
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,320
Wait, is this good or bad?

656
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,320
This is bad.

657
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,320
You know it's terrible.

658
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,320
You rolled a one hundred.

659
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,320
Yeah, I rolled a one hundred.

660
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,320
I rolled a one hundred.

661
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,320
A one zero zero.

662
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,320
Yep, that's a hundred.

663
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,320
Aw.

664
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,320
Wait, did you say you rolled a ninety-six?

665
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,320
Okay.

666
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,320
Earlier?

667
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,320
Earlier, yeah.

668
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,320
A one zero zero.

669
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,320
That should have been a crit fail.

670
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,000
A one zero zero is a no.

671
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Did we make that rule?

672
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I forgot about that.

673
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,280
Yeah, it's the opposite of sixty-nine.

674
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:48,960
Martin Cupertino will actually lose one of his successes on that, so Fairfield and Digby

675
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:54,680
take the, uh, we're going into, like, percentiles of how much land is left between you and the

676
00:29:54,680 --> 00:30:00,360
shore, and you guys still have one success left, but now Martin Cupertino needs two or

677
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:06,640
one critical success in order to make it to the shore as the water around you begins to

678
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,640
bubble.

679
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,920
I don't like this new mechanic, because it's scary.

680
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:13,000
This chase, this water monster chase mechanic?

681
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Yeah.

682
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,200
Well, tough shit, because it's going to come up in every situation from now on.

683
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,600
That's a five.

684
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,920
That's Charles Digby is getting it this time.

685
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,920
No.

686
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,920
Like, good getting it, or?

687
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,920
No.

688
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,520
Charles Digby's getting it.

689
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,520
Getting it.

690
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,800
Charles Digby can get it.

691
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,000
Let's see if Charles Digby can get it.

692
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
What do I need to roll?

693
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,960
You need to roll whatever you're going to do to try to avoid getting sucked up into

694
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,520
the worm.

695
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,960
The water worm.

696
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,680
Can I just, like, aggressively paddle forward?

697
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,440
The thickest can beat the worm.

698
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:52,560
It would freak out and be, like, to try and get out of its, like, path or-

699
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,160
Yeah, you would have to-

700
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,720
Would I still get my decrease, though?

701
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,720
Yes, you would.

702
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,760
Okay, then I won't do that, because that will be hard.

703
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:03,360
I mean, I'm not going to talk into my mic anymore.

704
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:07,040
I'm just going to move all the way over here.

705
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,560
A sharp tongue is coming at you currently.

706
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,560
What are you doing?

707
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:13,400
I think I'd probably want to do, like, a similar thing, where, like, I want to bat it away

708
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,400
with the paddle.

709
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,840
Are they, like, big, sturdy paddles I'm assuming?

710
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:20,080
Yeah, I mean, it's not original, but it has worked, so let's give it a go.

711
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,440
I don't have any fucking other stuff to use.

712
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,440
I know.

713
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,440
I was trying to come up with something original, too, and I couldn't-

714
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,440
You're stuck up on the water.

715
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:29,440
It doesn't lend itself, so give it a go.

716
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,440
Okay.

717
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,080
I rolled a 4.

718
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,560
I rolled a 22.

719
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:39,160
I rolled a 29 for my rocks skipping.

720
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,160
Oh, nice.

721
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,160
Unfortunately-

722
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:44,520
This is a very loyal little robot boy.

723
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:47,800
That won't be able to help as-

724
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,720
So it skips over and hits the worm, and nothing happens.

725
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:55,520
Yeah, it actually hits the worm, and it's got a really thin exterior, and so you see

726
00:31:55,520 --> 00:32:02,120
one of the arteries of this thing just, like, flops out of the skin, and this toxically

727
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:06,960
green, like, liquid begins pouring on top of Lake Calm.

728
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,960
Can I roll damage?

729
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:08,960
Sure.

730
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,600
What'd I roll?

731
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,040
A rock.

732
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,040
D4.

733
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,040
D4.

734
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:16,040
A tiny boy.

735
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,320
2.

736
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,440
Fuck you, worm.

737
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,080
And it lets out a little, like, little one.

738
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,080
Just a little guy.

739
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,080
Just a little guy.

740
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,080
Just a little guy.

741
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,080
However-

742
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,520
Can Alan help, too?

743
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:33,720
Help me throw every rock he can find.

744
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,720
He failed.

745
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,720
Oh.

746
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,720
Fuck you, Alan.

747
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:43,560
As Charles Digby just yells, fuck you, Alan, this sharp stylet protrudes, and it's this

748
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:52,360
tongue, noodle-like needle plunges down and attaches to the top of Charles Digby's head,

749
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:57,560
and it is ripping you up into its maw currently.

750
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:03,560
You guys have one action to try to fix this, otherwise he's going into this creature.

751
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,880
Well, Roger's gonna try and pull him down.

752
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:06,880
All right.

753
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,680
And what is Martin Cupertino doing?

754
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,040
What is Walter Grimes doing?

755
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,040
Growing, for sure.

756
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:15,160
I just threw the rock, and I'm picking another one up.

757
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:19,160
I'd like to use this opportunity to get another box checked on them.

758
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,840
Okay, yeah, you can.

759
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:23,840
So go ahead and roll.

760
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,840
97.

761
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:25,840
97.

762
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,840
The roll.

763
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:35,000
He's rolling backwards, because he's too shocked to think.

764
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
I'm gonna roll strength.

765
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:42,760
And I will roll strength against you, which is an 80.

766
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:47,680
Well, that's a five.

767
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,880
Oh my God, he rolled a three.

768
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,680
That's a three.

769
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,680
Yeah.

770
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,680
Incredible.

771
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,680
Holy shit.

772
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,680
Absolutely incredible.

773
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:59,680
Holy shit.

774
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:04,960
Charles Digby, as this thing has you by the top of the head, it's literally pulling you

775
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,800
up and you're five feet off the ground.

776
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:14,240
The only thing keeping you connected to this canoe is Roger Fairfield, who has hands on

777
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:19,840
both of your feet and is just in a tug of war with a giant Xenonema toad.

778
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:23,280
And he's just pulling and pulling, and this thing's pulling at your head.

779
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,360
I need you to roll a constitution.

780
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:28,480
I also like to think I'm trying to punch it in the head.

781
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,480
Yes.

782
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,480
I'm just like, fuck off.

783
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,480
Constitution.

784
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,480
Oh, good.

785
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
That's not super high.

786
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
I pass.

787
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,680
53 on a 55.

788
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:44,720
You feel your spine literally is trying to disconnect itself as this thing is pulling

789
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:52,760
you apart and you reach up and grab onto this thing's tongue just in time before it snapped

790
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:57,600
your spinal cord and ripped your head off of the rest of your body.

791
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:03,700
You and Roger Fairfield together just like snap this thing off your head.

792
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:06,440
You are now, what was your hair situation like before?

793
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:09,240
It was, I'm just, you know, short brown hair.

794
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:14,280
You know that sketch from I Think You Should Leave where you can hire someone dressed in

795
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:19,240
a gorilla costume to come rip your toupee off?

796
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:23,040
Well that happens and you get scalped.

797
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,920
You hired a nematode.

798
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:31,040
Your head is bleeding to the point to where your eyes are having trouble seeing through

799
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:39,280
the Goldeneye style blood rushing down your face, but your back just popped in the best

800
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,280
way.

801
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,880
You decompressed my spine, bro.

802
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,960
Thanks dude.

803
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,240
And as it pops off, it flings itself backward.

804
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:51,480
It was putting so much into it that it just rips backward into the water as it falls backwards

805
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:59,720
and you fall onto Roger Fairfield in the canoe safe for now but bleeding all over everything.

806
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:03,200
Is it like if George Costanza got like a head wound right on top?

807
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,200
Yes.

808
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,200
Like they have the little sides?

809
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,200
Yeah.

810
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,200
You're Costanz-ing.

811
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:16,680
However, where the bald spot is is just raw blood and like skin that is like three layers

812
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:20,760
less than it was epithelially speaking.

813
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:23,360
I got to piss.

814
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,360
Oh, thank you, Joe.

815
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,360
I got you, man.

816
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,360
Thank you, Joe.

817
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,360
I love you.

818
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:31,360
Dude, speaking of Costanza.

819
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:40,240
For just imminent consumption, dirty Hershey's.

820
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,240
Dirty Hershey's.

821
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,240
Y'all heard about that dirty Hershey's?

822
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,240
Those Hershey's clerks.

823
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:48,040
Dude, dirty Hershey's is my favorite rapper and it's also me.

824
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,040
I'm dirty Hershey's.

825
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:53,000
Yeah, I'm definitely going to call every bout of diarrhea from now on.

826
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Dirty Hershey's.

827
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Dirty Hershey's.

828
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:00,680
That's what I call other Eagles fans who are from Hershey, Pennsylvania.

829
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:02,680
It was too far.

830
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:03,680
I got it.

831
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,680
It was too far.

832
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,680
Elbow bump.

833
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,680
Elbow bump.

834
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:07,680
I mean, you can get it but it doesn't make it good.

835
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,680
Thank you.

836
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:09,680
Did you hit record?

837
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,680
Yes, I did.

838
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:11,680
Are you sure?

839
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:17,520
You want to try again after that Hershey, Pennsylvania joke?

840
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:21,080
Yeah, I don't want to miss out on dirty Hersh.

841
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:24,760
As this thing flops back and just lands in the water.

842
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,880
How dong-like is this thing?

843
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:27,880
That's what I was thinking.

844
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:30,400
It's pretty dong-like.

845
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,720
Just the dong flapping around.

846
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:37,480
Have you ever opened your penis hole and it looks like weird little lips?

847
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,720
Is that what its mouth looks like?

848
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:40,720
Ow.

849
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:45,240
It's like a urethra with multiple circular teeth all inside of it.

850
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:49,320
Do you guys have dick teeth?

851
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,320
How do you forget?

852
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,200
Do you guys have tails?

853
00:37:52,200 --> 00:38:00,200
How do you process the urine crystals if you don't have dick teeth?

854
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:05,680
Bradley Cooper, Charles Digby, Walter and Alan Grimes, and Roger Fairfield, you are

855
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:14,360
all standing in the room where you met for orientation and two steps forward, three steps

856
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,360
backward.

857
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,360
Oh, wait.

858
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:21,520
How are we supposed to feel motivated to escape this creature on the lake, Zach?

859
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:26,680
You don't know how to feel about anything currently because your mind is being moved

860
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:29,480
from place to place so constantly.

861
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,360
Where's everyone at mentally?

862
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,360
Which room are we in?

863
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,360
I'm on the lake.

864
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,440
I'm still on the lake.

865
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:38,440
And yet you're standing in this room and you have this spray bottle in your hand.

866
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,440
Which room are we in again?

867
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,440
The meeting room.

868
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,520
And did Angela just close the door on us?

869
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,960
Well, Angela's not in here.

870
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:47,800
I know, but does it feel like the time when she just closed the door on us?

871
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:48,800
I don't know.

872
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,200
I think the whole point is to determine that sort of thing.

873
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,200
Do you?

874
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,200
Okay.

875
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,200
Well, okay.

876
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,560
I've got the spray bottle in my hand.

877
00:38:55,560 --> 00:39:00,520
I'm kicking open the outside door and I'm looking for any motherfucker who works here

878
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,520
to spray.

879
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:05,440
As you kick out the outside door, you guys all look out and you see that it is completely

880
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,440
empty.

881
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:11,260
You see that there is the desk on your left and there's the water cooler with the coffee

882
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:15,080
machine on your right and it is dead silent and there's no one around.

883
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,080
I want to look at Charles.

884
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,080
Is he scalped?

885
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,080
No.

886
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:20,580
Do I remember that I got scalped?

887
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:21,580
Yes.

888
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:22,580
I'm like...

889
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:23,580
Oh, sorry.

890
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:29,020
As you poke at your head, you feel just immense pain rushing through like the back, your back.

891
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:30,020
Like it's just like...

892
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:31,900
The memory of pain or...

893
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:36,500
Like yeah, it's like an idea of pain that is just like streaming down your back and

894
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,500
yet you feel hair.

895
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,700
And I look at Roger and I'm like, am I...

896
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:40,700
No, you're fine.

897
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:41,700
You're fine.

898
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:42,700
You're fine.

899
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:43,700
You're fine.

900
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:44,700
And then I'm like...

901
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:48,700
I can like feel my fucking back just rushing with pain.

902
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,180
I'm like, oh, my fucking back.

903
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:52,100
And I'm like, look, look, look at it.

904
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,100
Look at it.

905
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,100
And I like lift the back...

906
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,100
My back shirt up.

907
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,100
I look at it.

908
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:57,100
It's fine.

909
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,100
You're fine.

910
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,100
You're fine.

911
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,100
You're fine.

912
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:01,100
You're fine.

913
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:02,100
Calm down.

914
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,100
Calm down.

915
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,100
You're fine.

916
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,100
Oh, God.

917
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:06,100
As you lift it up though, you do notice that you have the little mark on the inside of

918
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,100
your elbow pit.

919
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,100
Oh, fuck.

920
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,100
Do you...

921
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:10,100
Do you...

922
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:11,500
Do you have this?

923
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:12,500
I...

924
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,500
I...

925
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:14,500
I still do.

926
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,500
Yeah.

927
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,500
Yeah.

928
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:17,500
We tried.

929
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,500
We...

930
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:19,500
Walter and I, we were throwing rocks.

931
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,500
We were trying to...

932
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:21,500
I think we're saved.

933
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,500
I don't...

934
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,500
Alan, do you have a mark?

935
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:28,860
And he holds up his arm and pulls up his shirt and there's a mark on the inside, little blood

936
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:30,360
dried up.

937
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:34,620
I want to run behind the desk and see if there's a gun underneath.

938
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:36,660
Roll search.

939
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:38,620
Fail.

940
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:39,960
You do not find a gun.

941
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:44,820
There's no gun there, so you do find a gun.

942
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:47,680
This game's wild.

943
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,400
I have a question to ask Zach that they shouldn't listen to.

944
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,400
Oh, okay.

945
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,400
Take your headphones off, I guess.

946
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,400
Thomas.

947
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,000
Why don't you just ask him?

948
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,720
Is it my first time again or is that...

949
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:58,720
No.

950
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:59,720
You remember everything.

951
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:00,720
You're back.

952
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:04,060
What did you touch?

953
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:08,240
And that echoes in your ear of Jack Russell saying, what did...

954
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,920
What did you touch?

955
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:10,920
What did you touch?

956
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:11,920
There you go.

957
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:12,920
That was nice.

958
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:13,920
What did you touch?

959
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,920
Just echo, echo, echo.

960
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:16,920
Is he in the room?

961
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:17,920
Nope.

962
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,260
Is there any kind of...

963
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:20,480
Can I roll some kind of...

964
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,840
Why, just spill your beans.

965
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:26,400
Can I roll some kind of search to see if there's been a trace of someone in here or does it

966
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,720
look totally untouched?

967
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:31,220
It's not that it's abandoned, but there's just no one in here right now.

968
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:36,640
It's as if when you first came in to a calm, comfy campground, there was no one in the

969
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:37,640
lobby.

970
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:38,760
It's exactly like that.

971
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,800
Is there any other kind of search role I can also do for anything?

972
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:45,840
Well, if you're wanting to find something, you could roll search if you'd tell me what

973
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:46,840
you're trying to find.

974
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:49,480
Oh, then no.

975
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:52,560
I'm searching the secret places for something interesting.

976
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:58,920
Oh, can I search for the McGuffin to solve all those problems?

977
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:02,480
I'd like to find the Maltese Falcon, please.

978
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,040
Oh, I didn't...

979
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:08,320
Oh, no, I got a 69, which does that a crit success?

980
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:10,320
That is a crit success.

981
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,320
Crit success.

982
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,320
Whatever this is.

983
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:13,320
Okay, yeah.

984
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:21,280
So Charles Digby is looking all around, and he finds a tape with James saying, here's

985
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,080
what's going on.

986
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:30,920
Well, distraught, you put your hand up against the wall, and you feel the wall begin to give

987
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:34,680
way a little bit as you found this secret door.

988
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:42,920
And as you push into it, this room opens up, and looking into it, it is a long, long room.

989
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:48,080
You can't see the end of it, and it is lit by the floor, and the darkness is coming from

990
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:54,120
above, and there's these shadows of all these metal shelves, and you have opened up a secret

991
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:57,080
door into the room with all the tapes.

992
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:59,280
Geographically, where is this room?

993
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,200
It's just around the corner from the meeting room.

994
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:04,880
It was down a slight hallway from where you guys were.

995
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:08,160
Sure, but if the island is the face of the clock, what time is it at?

996
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,160
We're in the center.

997
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:10,160
Two o'clock.

998
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,160
Aren't we?

999
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,160
What?

1000
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,160
It's at two o'clock from the center?

1001
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,160
It doesn't matter.

1002
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:18,280
Then why is the island the face of the clock?

1003
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:22,440
This is all you've given us.

1004
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:24,400
Can I roll to see if I have my tape player on me?

1005
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,400
Yeah.

1006
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:26,400
Luck?

1007
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,400
Yeah, 50-50.

1008
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:28,400
I don't.

1009
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:29,600
What?

1010
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:30,600
Aww.

1011
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:31,600
This is that room.

1012
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:32,600
This is that room.

1013
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:33,600
We were in here before.

1014
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:34,600
Do you guys remember that?

1015
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:39,600
Do you remember the room with all the tapes?

1016
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:40,600
I remember.

1017
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:42,720
We should find a way to play one.

1018
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,440
Yeah, I want to go further in.

1019
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:45,760
Are you guys all going further in?

1020
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:49,400
Can I search for a tape player, like, in the office or something?

1021
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:54,280
We're not, because Martin Cupertino has continued to run out the front door, and he's running

1022
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:55,280
towards the boat docks.

1023
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,600
What are the rest of you doing?

1024
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:57,880
Searching for a tape player.

1025
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:01,240
As you look around, it's just shelves, shelves, shelves, shelves.

1026
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:02,240
I don't know.

1027
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,040
I want to try and find our shelves again.

1028
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,040
Yeah, I'll go with it.

1029
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,280
Or is it so gargantuan?

1030
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:09,120
I mean, looking into it, it is infinite and vast.

1031
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,120
Oh, okay.

1032
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:11,600
But you can try if you want.

1033
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:12,760
Roger Fairfield, what are you doing?

1034
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:13,760
I don't know.

1035
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:16,080
I don't know what Roger would do right now.

1036
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:17,600
He's freaked out, but he doesn't...

1037
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:18,880
I don't think he would run for the boats.

1038
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,840
I think the boats are the last thing he wants to be on.

1039
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:24,480
Yeah, I mean, especially with what happened to my head.

1040
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:27,280
I'm like, I don't want to even try to go back there.

1041
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:31,800
He's going to yell for Angela and then maybe go into that back office that we saw James

1042
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,040
in previously.

1043
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:36,760
As you're hollering for Angela, can you do it for me real quick?

1044
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:37,760
Angela!

1045
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:38,760
Angie!

1046
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:39,760
Angie!

1047
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:44,200
That begins to echo out and just reverberate and repeat.

1048
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:49,560
Walter and Alan Grimes, Charles Digby, Roger Fairfield, and Martin Cupertino, you are all

1049
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:51,600
walking through the woods.

1050
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:53,240
You're surrounded by trees.

1051
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:54,320
You're running through the woods.

1052
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:55,320
You're running through the woods.

1053
00:44:55,320 --> 00:45:00,920
Martin Cupertino, you have the map out, and you're leading the group through this jungle

1054
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:03,320
trying to find the door.

1055
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:08,240
Charles Digby, you feel blood rushing down your face.

1056
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:13,080
I need you to roll a D6 and half it for damage.

1057
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:14,080
Two.

1058
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:17,440
All right, lose two hit points.

1059
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:18,440
He rolled a four.

1060
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:21,200
Made a two in his mind.

1061
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,200
Quick math.

1062
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,640
The fuck up, John.

1063
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,240
Give away the secrets.

1064
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:33,080
I'm not good at math, but I think we all assumed he rolled a four when he got to it.

1065
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:38,760
Okay, so who is helping Martin Cupertino with the map, or are you guys allowing Martin Cupertino

1066
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:41,200
to just lead you with his skills?

1067
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:45,200
Before that, I assume I'm wearing an over shirt or something.

1068
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:50,560
Can I tear it up to make a weird little bandage for my head, like a little hat for my head?

1069
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:51,560
Yes, absolutely you can.

1070
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:53,820
I want to cover up my sad head.

1071
00:45:53,820 --> 00:46:00,180
Can I use intelligence to read the map?

1072
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:01,180
It'll be survival.

1073
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:04,180
Does anybody have a good survival?

1074
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:05,180
Nope.

1075
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:06,180
I do.

1076
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:11,860
I feel like there's other ways to read a map, but I think if maybe you were smart enough,

1077
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:13,740
you could figure out what it was telling you.

1078
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:15,900
You could do intelligence at a negative 40.

1079
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:17,940
That's still better than survival.

1080
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:18,940
What's your survival?

1081
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:20,740
I'm actually pretty good at maps.

1082
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:21,740
It's part of my job.

1083
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:22,740
It's part of what I do.

1084
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:23,980
I can read it for you.

1085
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:25,260
I can navigate it.

1086
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:28,660
But you also think your fake wife is real, so...

1087
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:30,140
My wife-wife is my wife.

1088
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:31,560
Can we trust you?

1089
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:32,560
It's my wife.

1090
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,100
I don't know where she is.

1091
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:35,380
Hey, ease up on him.

1092
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:37,020
He can still read the fucking map.

1093
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:39,740
I need to ask Zach something without you guys hearing.

1094
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:40,740
Tough shit.

1095
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:45,740
What the fuck is wrong with Tom and us?

1096
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:46,740
Hey, Joe.

1097
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:52,420
So, Joe remembers that when I was in the office with James, he asked if I was single.

1098
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:55,740
You gave me a not yes.

1099
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:58,060
Does that come back to Roger at any point?

1100
00:46:58,060 --> 00:47:02,460
Yeah, let's say that it comes back to you right now as he's asking about your wife.

1101
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:03,460
Okay.

1102
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:04,460
All right, let's do it.

1103
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:05,460
Everybody back.

1104
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:11,140
So, Martin Cupertino is pressing Roger Fairfield about his wife.

1105
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:12,140
Press me.

1106
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:13,140
Press him, baby.

1107
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:17,060
Hey, why don't we have your fake wife read this map?

1108
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:18,060
My wife is real.

1109
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:21,500
We've been together for...

1110
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:23,740
We've been together for...

1111
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:25,820
I met her.

1112
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:27,260
I don't...

1113
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:28,620
I was...

1114
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:34,380
I was talking to James and he asked if I was single.

1115
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:35,380
I said yes.

1116
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:36,380
I said yes.

1117
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:37,380
I said yes.

1118
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:38,380
I don't...

1119
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:39,380
Who's...

1120
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:40,380
I don't...

1121
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:41,380
I don't...

1122
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:43,660
I don't have a wife.

1123
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:44,660
I don't have a wife!

1124
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:45,660
Hey, buddy.

1125
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:48,580
I feel like all the answers are on the other side of this door.

1126
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:49,580
Can you help us get there?

1127
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:50,580
Yeah.

1128
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:51,580
Yeah.

1129
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:52,580
Yeah.

1130
00:47:52,580 --> 00:47:53,580
Yeah.

1131
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:54,580
Yeah.

1132
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:55,580
Yeah.

1133
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:56,580
Yeah.

1134
00:47:56,580 --> 00:47:57,580
We gotta get out of here.

1135
00:47:57,580 --> 00:47:58,580
We gotta get out of here.

1136
00:47:58,580 --> 00:47:59,580
That's where...

1137
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:00,580
Hey, maybe Angie's on the other side of the door.

1138
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:01,580
I don't...

1139
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:02,580
I don't know who she is.

1140
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:03,580
I don't know who she is.

1141
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:04,580
Okay.

1142
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:05,580
Just calm down.

1143
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:06,580
Just calm down.

1144
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:07,580
The answers are on the other side of the door on this map.

1145
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:08,580
Okay.

1146
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:09,580
Now, here's the thing.

1147
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:10,580
So, when you guys roll, who is reading the map?

1148
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:11,580
Are both of you reading the map?

1149
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:12,580
I think...

1150
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:13,580
Yeah, I think both of us.

1151
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:19,000
I need you both to roll into my little box that I'm holding.

1152
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,820
It's Joe's dice rolling box.

1153
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:24,380
And I need you guys to roll into it and not see the result.

1154
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:25,380
Oh, shit.

1155
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:26,380
Because...

1156
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:27,380
Because you're gonna lie?

1157
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:28,380
Like, what?

1158
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:29,380
So...

1159
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:30,380
Because...

1160
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:35,180
Because I'd like the game to go a certain way, but...

1161
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:38,980
Depending on whether or not you succeed or fail, I will tell you which way you think

1162
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:39,980
you should go.

1163
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:44,420
I don't want you to know whether you've read the map successfully or not, so I want you

1164
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:46,020
both to roll into this.

1165
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:47,020
Okay.

1166
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:48,020
Cool excuse, but...

1167
00:48:48,020 --> 00:48:49,020
Joe, look at it.

1168
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:50,020
Check it out.

1169
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:51,020
Check it out.

1170
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:52,020
He's busy counting.

1171
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:53,020
Look.

1172
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:54,020
Okay.

1173
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:58,740
What do you have for intelligence minus 40?

1174
00:48:58,740 --> 00:48:59,740
30.

1175
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:00,740
Okay.

1176
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:01,740
And what do you have for survival?

1177
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:02,740
40.

1178
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:03,740
Okay.

1179
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:08,740
So, as you guys are approaching, you're following the line on the map to the door.

1180
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:15,660
And you notice directly across from you on the line where you are heading from off the

1181
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:22,500
trail toward the door, you're about 20 yards away from where you think the door is, there's

1182
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:24,220
a cave opening.

1183
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:29,940
And then above that, there's a slight opening in the trees that leads above the cave.

1184
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:37,860
I'd like to roll to double check.

1185
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:41,140
We've got to be really careful about how we read this map.

1186
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:48,660
Martin Cupertino, you are positive that you should go above the cave and about.

1187
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:55,100
Roger Fairfield, you're pretty positive that this map is leading you into the cave and

1188
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:56,940
then out through the door.

1189
00:49:56,940 --> 00:49:59,460
Fuck, and this is based on how we rolled?

1190
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:00,460
Yep.

1191
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:01,940
And we don't know how we rolled.

1192
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:02,940
We don't know.

1193
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:03,940
But we don't know.

1194
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:04,940
Okay, so how do we feel about how we did it?

1195
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:08,020
I will tell you, one of you succeeded and the other one critically failed.

1196
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:09,020
We got that.

1197
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:11,020
One of them critically failed.

1198
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:12,020
Oh no.

1199
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:13,020
Listen.

1200
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:14,420
We need to go through those trees.

1201
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:19,940
I mean, I read the map, I work with, I'm an archaeologist, I follow maps to places all

1202
00:50:19,940 --> 00:50:20,940
the time.

1203
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:21,940
It's through the cave.

1204
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:24,700
Everybody follows maps to things as much as an archaeologist does.

1205
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:25,700
We all drive somewhere.

1206
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:27,820
It's not like you're a fucking mapologist.

1207
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:33,940
I have to decipher strange maps sometimes and this is a strange map and I feel confident

1208
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:34,940
it's through the cave.

1209
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:37,260
I think your result is pretty strange.

1210
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:40,460
Why the fuck would we get out of the forest through a cave instead of going through the

1211
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:41,460
clearing in the forest?

1212
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:43,480
Why is it called a door on the map?

1213
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:44,860
There's no door here.

1214
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:46,540
It's all symbolic.

1215
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:49,780
There's got to be another entry on the other side of the cave.

1216
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:50,780
It's our way out.

1217
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:52,880
Everyone, you go your own ways.

1218
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:54,420
You figure it out for yourselves.

1219
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:56,140
I'm going through the tree.

1220
00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:57,140
Who's following Martin Cupertino?

1221
00:50:57,140 --> 00:51:00,140
Don't go into the caves, you fucking idiot.

1222
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:02,860
Don't go into the caves?

1223
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:04,680
Come on.

1224
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:08,340
We could split into two groups and check both of them.

1225
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:12,100
That's what we're demanding happens here.

1226
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:14,180
You need to figure out which group you're in.

1227
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:19,540
If you want to die or go into the dark cave, I guess I don't know if it's death.

1228
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:22,020
If you, if you want to get out of here, you go through the caves.

1229
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:26,020
If you, if you just want to explore the forest more, go up there, I guess.

1230
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:29,820
I'm going to go with Roger because I've been with him through so much already.

1231
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:30,820
You fucking idiot.

1232
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:39,340
I was like, I don't know what I rolled.

1233
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:42,620
I know what I think is happening.

1234
00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:50,660
Walter, honestly, you're, I don't know what happened before this.

1235
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:51,780
Look at me.

1236
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:55,180
I don't know what we were before this.

1237
00:51:55,180 --> 00:51:58,060
Do you have the memory of us in the flower room?

1238
00:51:58,060 --> 00:52:00,940
I think that we should split up.

1239
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:03,860
It's time for me to go on my own.

1240
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:10,220
And you see Alan Grimes face just drops literally of sadness.

1241
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:11,220
It doesn't fall off.

1242
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:15,220
No, it doesn't fall on his face.

1243
00:52:15,220 --> 00:52:16,220
There's no fake faces.

1244
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:20,460
In this one, there will be in the next one.

1245
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:25,900
I know you don't like dark places and I start walking towards Roger.

1246
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:30,380
Why are all the player characters going to die?

1247
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:32,100
All right.

1248
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:37,620
I walk off through the light in the woods.

1249
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:43,660
Alan Grimes looks back at you, Walter, as you're walking away from him.

1250
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:48,580
If you turn back, you see a single tear is falling from his eye.

1251
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:53,980
I honestly, I don't know that you were my son.

1252
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:57,060
But I thought of you as my son.

1253
00:52:57,060 --> 00:53:00,620
I'll see you at the end, dad.

1254
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:05,020
I don't want that loser going with me.

1255
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:13,220
Why don't you go into the caves and Alan Grimes just stands there and kind of shook, not wanting

1256
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:17,220
to offend anyone, but clearly not wanted by either group.

1257
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:18,220
Yeah.

1258
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:22,060
Go into the caves, you feckless, perhaps sunless piece of shit.

1259
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:24,060
Jesus Christ.

1260
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:28,580
Well, I've got a cube to launch.

1261
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:32,800
I can't deal with this shit any longer and I certainly can't deal with you.

1262
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:43,340
I don't know, but based on my memories, I am not, I don't think I am a good person and

1263
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:46,300
I don't know if I deserve to leave.

1264
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:47,300
All right.

1265
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:51,340
Well, why don't you go fight that worm monster single-handedly and let the rest of us get

1266
00:53:51,340 --> 00:53:52,340
the fuck out of there.

1267
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:57,180
As you're saying that to each other, he is walking back down the trail away from you

1268
00:53:57,180 --> 00:53:59,740
all back toward like calm.

1269
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:02,420
That affects Martin in no way.

1270
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:07,660
Walter feels really, really sad for the first time ever.

1271
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:09,200
It fills you.

1272
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:12,780
These emotions are running wild within you.

1273
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:18,180
I like get down, like drop to my knees and I actually start to cry.

1274
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:22,300
And actual tears are pouring from your eyes.

1275
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:24,300
Watch your electronics.

1276
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:26,900
Walter, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's okay.

1277
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:30,460
He wasn't, it sounds like he wasn't really your dad or something.

1278
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:34,940
He, I don't, I just, I don't know what to think.

1279
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:38,260
I, there's just so much going on.

1280
00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:40,460
I just can't compute it all.

1281
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:41,460
It's...

1282
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:42,460
Roger's going to try and comfort you.

1283
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:44,740
I mean, there's this kid crying in front of him.

1284
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:49,940
Charles Digby only knows how to comfort things in one way, which is patted on the head.

1285
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:50,940
Like his pet cat.

1286
00:54:50,940 --> 00:55:00,380
He's like, it'll be okay, but he does like a pat on the head and he's like, Hey, Hey,

1287
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:02,380
Hey, it'll be okay.

1288
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:03,840
I've got a little bit of persuade.

1289
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:06,380
Is there a role that I would do to like comfort somebody?

1290
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:08,460
So psychotherapy would be comfort.

1291
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:09,460
I don't have any of that.

1292
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:10,460
You got 10%.

1293
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:11,460
I got 10%.

1294
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:12,460
Let's fucking do this.

1295
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:13,460
Okay.

1296
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:14,460
I quit.

1297
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:20,460
Smack him on top of the head.

1298
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:21,460
Bad.

1299
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:22,460
I failed.

1300
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:23,460
Also.

1301
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:24,460
Yeah.

1302
00:55:24,460 --> 00:55:25,460
Yeah.

1303
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:27,460
Slap yourself together.

1304
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:28,460
Yeah.

1305
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:33,380
He like hits me in the head and I just get down.

1306
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:35,420
I pat you too hard where it's like not comfortable.

1307
00:55:35,420 --> 00:55:40,100
I'm just like completely prone facing the crook of my elbow crying.

1308
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:57,500
Pooper Tino, fuck that guy fart and pooper Tino fucking got him.

1309
00:55:57,500 --> 00:56:00,440
We fucking got him guys.

1310
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:03,820
What's going to work teamwork.

1311
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:05,740
That's from the wonder pets.

1312
00:56:05,740 --> 00:56:06,740
That's cool.

1313
00:56:06,740 --> 00:56:16,620
I need to hear stuff in the room that I know I'm going to edit out later.

1314
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:18,460
Who's leading the charge into this cave.

1315
00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:19,460
I assume it's Roger Fairfield.

1316
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:20,460
It's gotta be Roger.

1317
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:22,300
He's a he meant about this game.

1318
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:27,540
So Walter, you've just been consoled very poorly by two grown men.

1319
00:56:27,540 --> 00:56:36,420
When I was a scalped man, when I hear them walking towards the cave, I kind of just like

1320
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:41,700
look over and for a split second I try to decide if I'm going to the cave or running

1321
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:45,840
after my dad, but I realized I've made that decision.

1322
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:49,860
I get up and there's like dirt and mud all over my face and I start following them into

1323
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:50,860
the cave.

1324
00:56:50,860 --> 00:56:56,480
The cave opening is large enough for two or three people to go in at a time.

1325
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:57,480
It's not too small.

1326
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:01,740
There are a lot of caves around here in Missouri that the entrance to the cave is literally

1327
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:04,700
like you dive in head first and your feet go in the air.

1328
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:05,700
It's not one of those.

1329
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:06,980
It's like the smallest cave.

1330
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:07,980
Exactly.

1331
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:12,020
Like the largest cave opening in the world.

1332
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:17,380
This one, you can, you can easily like kind of a crab crawl on your, on your hands and

1333
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:25,380
the palms behind you kind of into it and scooch on your butt into a pretty large opening immediately

1334
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:30,380
where you hear the drops of water and the distance.

1335
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:32,120
And besides that, you hear nothing.

1336
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:34,260
This cave system is moist.

1337
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:36,480
Do we have mites and tights?

1338
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:38,460
It is much colder here.

1339
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:41,140
You got mites and tights for days.

1340
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:45,500
Far more tights than mites at this first opening area.

1341
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:50,060
So you're kind of dodging them with your mouth and making sure that no of the drip drops

1342
00:57:50,060 --> 00:57:53,780
get in your grill as you, as you scooch down in.

1343
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:56,380
But then you can kind of stand up and you're standing on this.

1344
00:57:56,380 --> 00:58:03,900
It kind of looks like a tongue almost the way that it is like going in texture or shape.

1345
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:09,660
It's both, I would say it's both, it's smooth and wet and there's a line down the middle

1346
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:14,460
and you can kind of like put one foot on each side as you move forward.

1347
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:17,780
And the light behind you is the only thing guiding you for now.

1348
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:20,500
Do you guys have any lighters or anything on you?

1349
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:24,740
I'd assume Charles Digby might be a smoker, but that's just an assumption.

1350
00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:25,740
Yeah.

1351
00:58:25,740 --> 00:58:27,340
Because he went to be incognito.

1352
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:28,340
Exactly.

1353
00:58:28,340 --> 00:58:30,340
He smokes a lot.

1354
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:33,400
I put my arm out like this.

1355
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:34,400
Like what?

1356
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:37,320
Forearm phasing up, palm up.

1357
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:48,400
And I like touch in the crook of my elbow and my eyes light up a little bit and it projects

1358
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:49,400
some light.

1359
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:55,060
Uh, that doesn't happen, but you think it does as you put your finger there, then let

1360
00:58:55,060 --> 00:58:57,880
me do something else.

1361
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:58,880
Do I notice?

1362
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:02,640
You guys look over and is he like holding still and he's like doing it.

1363
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:07,480
You guys look over and Walter is holding his thumb over the crook of his elbow and he's

1364
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:10,760
like blinking really intensely and he's confused.

1365
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:11,760
Hey bud.

1366
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:12,760
What?

1367
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:13,760
What?

1368
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:14,760
Are you, what are you doing there?

1369
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:17,560
This should be working, but what should be working?

1370
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:18,640
Never mind.

1371
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:21,760
I look at Roger and I was like, this kid's got some fucking screws loose.

1372
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:23,000
There's something wrong that's certain.

1373
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,680
We gotta take care of him.

1374
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:27,200
You guys have like a flashlight or a lighter or anything?

1375
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:28,920
I whip out a little Zippo.

1376
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:35,840
Yeah and the Zippo is enough in this like pitch darkness to expose a large opening ahead

1377
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:42,600
of you and there it, it gets smaller and smaller and the distance about 25 yards away.

1378
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:50,240
And then there's another opening down there and you, uh, you see there seems to be a path

1379
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:52,220
laid out from here to there.

1380
00:59:52,220 --> 00:59:54,560
Almost like people have been through here before.

1381
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:58,480
I'll lead the way and I hold the lighter kind of in front while guiding them.

1382
00:59:58,480 --> 00:59:59,480
I'll follow.

1383
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:00,480
Same.

1384
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:07,600
And as you're going forward, you notice that you're now only lit by the slider.

1385
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:12,560
When you turn back around, you see no natural light coming from behind you.

1386
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:16,880
Guys, there's, didn't we just come from that direction?

1387
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:23,200
I don't, I don't see, I don't see the, is there wind kicking in that's making the flame

1388
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:25,160
go a certain way or is it still air?

1389
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:27,520
It is still air.

1390
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:31,040
Some of the stalactites must be in the, blocking the light.

1391
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:32,400
Let's just forge on.

1392
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:35,080
Yeah, let's press on I guess.

1393
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:36,080
Yeah.

1394
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:40,040
I think Roger right now is a little bit maybe wondering if he read the map right, but he's

1395
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:41,040
still going.

1396
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:46,080
So you guys go into this next little opening and there is a slide down.

1397
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:50,320
It's a, there's a bunch of different rocks and stuff, but it's been smoothed out over

1398
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:51,320
time.

1399
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:56,760
There seems to be water trickling in this area just to your left and just to your right,

1400
01:00:57,080 --> 01:01:03,280
but there's a rock kind of stairway leading down a little bit and you notice that you're

1401
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:11,600
now in a room that is probably 40 yards by 40 yards and at least 40 yards high as well.

1402
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:15,400
And you're like up at the top currently looking down into it.

1403
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:18,960
And earlier you said that there are signs that this is a used pathway.

1404
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:20,360
People have been here, yeah, for sure.

1405
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:23,800
I say, I'm, I think, I think we're going the right way guys.

1406
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:26,080
There's, there's, there's signs that people have been through here.

1407
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:27,080
Everyone has to be down here.

1408
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:28,080
Let's, let's keep going.

1409
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:29,080
Let's go.

1410
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:32,560
Do you guys think Rollo will recognize me?

1411
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:33,560
Without your hair.

1412
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:34,560
Without the hair.

1413
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:35,560
Oh yeah.

1414
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:36,560
How's that?

1415
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:37,560
How's that feeling?

1416
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:38,560
Feels bad.

1417
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:40,560
There's not a lot of skin up there.

1418
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:46,400
So you guys make your way down into making our way down to making your way down into

1419
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:49,640
this part of the cave in your home now forever.

1420
01:01:49,640 --> 01:02:05,920
So you guys get down this little like rock kind of stairwell and you realize your clothes

1421
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:07,480
are getting muddier and muddier.

1422
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:12,880
It's much cooler now than it was when you were out back in the woods.

1423
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:18,720
Obviously you're in a fucking cave, roughly 52 degrees is what I'm thinking Fahrenheit.

1424
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:23,560
I was just watching a formula, it doesn't matter, but I was watching drive to survive

1425
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:27,640
the formula one Netflix show and they were like, yeah, it's fucking hot.

1426
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:29,580
It's 32 degrees.

1427
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:34,520
And I was like, ah, Americans, we're idiots.

1428
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:35,520
Whoops.

1429
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:40,720
Anyway, so you guys make it down and it is for our international listeners.

1430
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:41,720
That's 11.1 degrees.

1431
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:48,120
Yeah, it's like 11.1 degrees Celsius and thank you, Luke.

1432
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:55,120
As we're wandering around and passing the time, I'm like, Hey bud, why do you, do you

1433
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:57,280
think you're a robot?

1434
01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:00,340
Cause no, no, no.

1435
01:03:00,340 --> 01:03:04,280
We need to, if he's going to be with us, we got to know what's happening upstairs with

1436
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:05,280
him.

1437
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:06,280
He's right.

1438
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:07,280
Were you trying to do something?

1439
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:08,280
Were you pressing into your arm?

1440
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:09,280
What were you doing?

1441
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:12,880
I'm not supposed to say, I think you should say, I saw whenever we were in that meeting

1442
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:17,600
room together, you like shut down when someone touched under your chin.

1443
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:18,600
What was that?

1444
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:22,800
I, my dad, he's your, he's your not dad.

1445
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:26,520
My dad made me, are you talking about Alan made you?

1446
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:27,520
Yeah.

1447
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:28,520
I am.

1448
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:29,800
We're pretty sure now that he isn't your dad.

1449
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:31,120
Is that, isn't that right?

1450
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:37,080
I mean, in a way he is, but I'm, I was never born.

1451
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:41,100
When you said he made you, did you mean that in the way that you mean that he made you?

1452
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:42,140
You think he made you?

1453
01:03:42,140 --> 01:03:43,360
I know that he did.

1454
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:44,360
He built you.

1455
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:45,360
He built me.

1456
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:48,720
But I don't, I don't think that's, I don't think that's right.

1457
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:49,720
I don't think he built you.

1458
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:52,960
I don't think a robot could cry like you did back there.

1459
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:57,920
Well, I came to this Island to see if I could pass as real.

1460
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:04,200
So I guess one good thing out of this is that it worked, but you are, you are, you are real

1461
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:05,200
Walter.

1462
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:07,720
You're, you're not a maid thing.

1463
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:13,800
You you're cyborgs aren't real, but then I'm not real, but you are real.

1464
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:16,040
And I, uh, I want to pinch his arm.

1465
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:17,200
You can feel that, right?

1466
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:20,200
I was programmed to feel, oh boy.

1467
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:26,680
When you got touched under the chin and you shut down, what did that feel like to you?

1468
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:29,440
I just black out or sleep, I guess.

1469
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:36,200
And sometimes I just can't move well from our perspective.

1470
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:42,400
You just closed your eyes, but what did you think happened?

1471
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:43,480
I shut down.

1472
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:47,640
I, my dad made me and there's, there's more of me.

1473
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:49,520
He was going to sell me.

1474
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:54,880
And you get hit with a memory from before you were at calm, comfy campground.

1475
01:04:54,880 --> 01:05:01,880
You're in a cage and you're in a warehouse and it smells, it's fucking musty.

1476
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:06,140
Like a junior high locker room that was abandoned over summer break.

1477
01:05:06,140 --> 01:05:14,660
This warehouse is filled with these cages, cramped, rusty, covered in a layer of condensation

1478
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:16,060
due to the humidity.

1479
01:05:16,060 --> 01:05:20,240
And each cage has a kid in it, roughly your age.

1480
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:25,740
And there must be hundreds of you all stacked three cages high, separated just enough to

1481
01:05:25,740 --> 01:05:33,860
limit physical contact and walking through the maze of cages and this vile warehouse

1482
01:05:33,860 --> 01:05:42,100
is Alan Grimes, followed by a few men who are hanging on his every word.

1483
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:44,900
Some are orphans, some were collected from the streets.

1484
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:49,540
Others had parents who were more than willing to trade them for drugs.

1485
01:05:49,540 --> 01:05:52,940
And that's where the learning center comes in.

1486
01:05:52,940 --> 01:05:55,940
These kids have no place in this world.

1487
01:05:55,940 --> 01:05:58,380
They do not exist.

1488
01:05:58,380 --> 01:06:05,460
And they could, therefore, be extremely useful to each of your organizations.

1489
01:06:05,460 --> 01:06:06,460
Uh.

1490
01:06:06,460 --> 01:06:11,740
You all right, Walter?

1491
01:06:11,740 --> 01:06:17,800
Is he like completely dazed out right now?

1492
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:23,980
It feels like my mind is broken for a second and then I have to get back to Alan.

1493
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:28,140
And I start like clawing at the wall, like jumping and clawing at the wall.

1494
01:06:28,140 --> 01:06:35,540
And the camera zooms out as we see Walter Grimes just clawing, mud, pulling up in his

1495
01:06:35,540 --> 01:06:41,100
nail beds as he's trying to get through this wall.

1496
01:06:41,100 --> 01:06:47,500
And we see Charles Digby and Roger Fairfield just take a step back and watch.

1497
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:51,380
And you are now in this even larger room.

1498
01:06:51,380 --> 01:06:53,260
You can roll search if you want.

1499
01:06:53,260 --> 01:06:54,480
I do.

1500
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:55,480
Search or survival?

1501
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:56,480
Search.

1502
01:06:57,480 --> 01:06:58,480
I'm gonna do search.

1503
01:06:58,480 --> 01:06:59,480
Success.

1504
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:00,480
Uh, success.

1505
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:01,480
I success.

1506
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:08,400
With all of you succeeding, you each look around and the stairs that you just took down

1507
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:12,600
here that kind of like carved out stairs that made you think that this has been traveled

1508
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:17,200
before are no longer there.

1509
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:23,800
And it is just a smooth slide that goes at like an 11 degree angle straight up and then

1510
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:30,440
surrounding you on the other side are equally tall walls about 40 yards high and you are

1511
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:37,400
lit only by this very still flame that is casting each of your shadows onto these walls

1512
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:38,400
surrounding you.

1513
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:41,120
But is there no, no break in the walls anymore?

1514
01:07:41,120 --> 01:07:42,120
Roll Sanity.

1515
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:43,120
Uh oh.

1516
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:45,120
Uh oh.

1517
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:46,120
Seven.

1518
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:47,120
This seems fine.

1519
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:48,120
Uh, 14.

1520
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:49,120
I'm fine too.

1521
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:51,120
Yeah, you guys just can't see it.

1522
01:07:51,120 --> 01:07:52,120
Oh shit.

1523
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:53,120
Then yeah, you guys are fine.

1524
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:57,360
You just can't, you just can't see it right now, but you just haven't found it yet.

1525
01:07:57,360 --> 01:07:58,360
It's no big deal.

1526
01:07:58,360 --> 01:07:59,360
Oh.

1527
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:00,360
Uh, yeah.

1528
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:02,960
Roger is going to start running his hand on the nearest wall and going in a perimeter.

1529
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:04,360
Yeah, it won't take long.

1530
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:05,360
We'll find, I'll find it eventually.

1531
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:06,360
Yeah, exactly.

1532
01:08:06,360 --> 01:08:07,360
Yeah.

1533
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:09,640
We're kind of like, Oh, I feel like since it's so, is it just like pitch black except

1534
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:10,640
the lighter?

1535
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:11,640
Exactly.

1536
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:12,640
Have you guys read yellow wallpaper?

1537
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:13,640
The short story?

1538
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:14,640
A long time ago.

1539
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:15,640
Yeah.

1540
01:08:15,640 --> 01:08:16,640
This is reminding me very much of this.

1541
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:23,480
So I will just cut to a scene where the three of you are all like conga line style basically

1542
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:26,880
with the lighter in front, holding your hands up to the wall.

1543
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:27,880
Exactly.

1544
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:34,540
And as we pan out, we see that the handprints that have been going around this room have

1545
01:08:34,540 --> 01:08:44,080
been going time and time and time and time in memoriam and you've made smooth hand prints

1546
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:50,240
all across this wall repeatedly for who knows how long.

1547
01:08:50,240 --> 01:08:53,320
Holy fucking shit.

1548
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:55,320
Fuck.

1549
01:08:55,320 --> 01:09:08,400
What's Martin Cupertino thinking as he leaves these three, four even, and heads above the

1550
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:11,560
cave off through the opening in the trees?

1551
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:12,560
Nothing in particular.

1552
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:16,620
He's just completely, he doesn't have a single doubt about his own rightness.

1553
01:09:16,620 --> 01:09:23,040
And then all of a sudden, as you're walking, you just stop because you run into a wall.

1554
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:24,440
Literally.

1555
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:25,880
It's like there's a wall in reality.

1556
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:26,880
Yeah.

1557
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:29,320
I can see like forest through the other side, but I bulk it.

1558
01:09:29,320 --> 01:09:30,320
Yeah.

1559
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:35,920
And then as you like reach out for it, you can tell that it is this like energy that

1560
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:37,880
you can't quite move through.

1561
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:38,880
Okay.

1562
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:42,200
I would like to meditate and get in tune with this energy.

1563
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:43,800
Full power.

1564
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:47,600
23 on a 50.

1565
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:53,460
After a short period of meditation, you open your eyes back up and you can very clearly

1566
01:09:53,460 --> 01:09:59,880
see where this wall goes up and looking up behind you, you see that it creates a dome

1567
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:03,900
over the sky above you and you're on the very edge of it now.

1568
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:09,040
And just to your right, there's a little opening where there is no energy.

1569
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:10,720
I'd like to walk through that.

1570
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:17,120
As you walk through the opening, this headache that you didn't even realize that you necessarily

1571
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:24,440
had just dissipates and you feel free for the first time and you don't know how long.

1572
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:29,320
And you do exactly what Thomas just did, which was exhale and like roll your eyes back in

1573
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:31,320
the head.

1574
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:32,320
Pleasure.

1575
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:33,320
Okay.

1576
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:38,320
Martin immediately takes out his 90s cell phone and he calls the secretary.

1577
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:43,120
Bring bring bring bring Cupertino's office.

1578
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:45,040
Why do you sound like Jack Russell?

1579
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:50,040
Cupertino's office.

1580
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:51,440
Cupertino's office.

1581
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:52,840
You know who the fuck this is?

1582
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:53,840
What fucking year is it?

1583
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:54,840
Oh my God.

1584
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:55,840
Martin.

1585
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:56,840
What year is it?

1586
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:58,840
It's 26 years ago.

1587
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:00,200
Everyone knows that.

1588
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:05,920
He takes a deep sigh of relief.

1589
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:07,040
Perfect.

1590
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:10,240
I'm still 26 years in the future.

1591
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:11,840
Well, 26.3.

1592
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:13,360
That's what I've calculated.

1593
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:14,640
It's cube about to launch.

1594
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:17,840
It hasn't been postponed yet, but is it ready?

1595
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:26,240
Yes, it's it's going to launch cube and send me a fucking helicopter.

1596
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:28,240
Hey, you won.

1597
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:36,240
Yeah, I've never done that in a dream.

1598
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:41,120
Roger Fairfield, Charles Digby, Alan Grimes and Walter Grimes, you're all sitting in a

1599
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:47,320
half circle in the meeting room about to have orientation and a man walks in wearing a white

1600
01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:52,560
button down shirt, gray slacks and black dress shoes and he sits at the chair in front of

1601
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:54,680
you and he says, hello there everyone.

1602
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:58,800
My name is James and I am the executive director here.

1603
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:02,480
Welcome to calm, comfy campground.

1604
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:06,160
Oh, what the fuck?

1605
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:09,640
Fuck you, Zach.

1606
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:12,680
What the fuck?

1607
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:14,480
I don't understand.

1608
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:18,800
I feel like Clark could benefit a lot from this, but he doesn't know it.

1609
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:33,920
What's up everybody?

1610
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:34,960
It's Zach.

1611
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:39,200
So the world is pretty wild right now.

1612
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:42,520
Before I address how we're handling it here at pretending to be people, I just want to

1613
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:49,800
say we wish you all the best during these unprecedented times for me personally, yesterday

1614
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:53,960
COVID-19 hit a bit closer to home than I'd have liked.

1615
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:58,960
My dad had just finished a 14 day quarantine after coming into contact with someone who

1616
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:05,400
is Corona positive and the symptoms hit him like a truck on day 15.

1617
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:09,940
This thing is real and it fucking sucks.

1618
01:13:09,940 --> 01:13:16,520
Please stay home, wash your hands and if you're young and staying safe, please offer to make

1619
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:21,260
grocery and pharmacy runs for the older and immunocompromised in your lives.

1620
01:13:21,260 --> 01:13:24,440
We can make it through this mess together.

1621
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:29,620
I know it's hard to stop touching your face, so maybe wear gloves that you've dipped into

1622
01:13:29,620 --> 01:13:33,000
spoiled milk and let dry in the sun.

1623
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,260
Maybe that.

1624
01:13:34,260 --> 01:13:39,080
So we are currently waiting on the rest of our equipment to come in the mail so we can

1625
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:41,620
begin recording remotely.

1626
01:13:41,620 --> 01:13:46,220
We've never done this before, so we might be taking a week off to figure out the logistics,

1627
01:13:46,220 --> 01:13:51,100
but my hope is to put out this Q and A episode Friday, April 3rd.

1628
01:13:51,100 --> 01:13:55,540
So post those questions on the thread in the subreddit ASAP and as for our patrons

1629
01:13:55,540 --> 01:14:00,060
over on Patreon, I will make an announcement once all our equipment is in and we have everything

1630
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:06,020
set up and we know what we're actually doing, but we are so looking forward to making your

1631
01:14:06,020 --> 01:14:09,500
patronage really worth its belt size.

1632
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:14,840
For those of you who don't know, I work as the director of human resources and community

1633
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:20,880
outreach for a small business that owns five bars and I bartend a couple nights a week

1634
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:23,680
as well for extra money.

1635
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:29,800
The main thing I did was plan big events.

1636
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:34,460
But even with all this shit, I'm not as worried as I probably should be.

1637
01:14:34,460 --> 01:14:41,640
These moments of crisis bring out a compassion and empathy in people that is so heartening.

1638
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:45,040
So if you have the ability, please take this time.

1639
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:50,280
Reach out to an elderly neighbor, Venmo a friend who's in the service industry, Zoom

1640
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:55,720
with your family and friends and let them know how much you love them.

1641
01:14:55,720 --> 01:15:03,040
There are three more story arcs left in this campaign, and I am so absolutely fucking stoked

1642
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:04,440
to see what happens.

1643
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:09,040
I love you all, thank you so much for listening and supporting the show.

1644
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:45,040
Thank you so much for watching, and I'll see you in the next one.
