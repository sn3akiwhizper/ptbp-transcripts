Y'all ever tasted sour cream and thought to yourself

30
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:22,820
The amount of sour in this cream is not nearly enough for one such as I so

31
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:27,460
You let it sit in the jar outside for a few days now

32
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:33,100
That's some sour shit and a little chunky, you know old wolf loves his crystals

33
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:36,300
But in the words of the Queen Jada essence hall

34
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:40,380
Misdirection herself look over there. It's the news

35
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:47,780
Last time lots of information was shared and then Keith went berserk on little old

36
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:53,700
Mildred Mitchell John kicked things off by telling the group about his uncle

37
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:57,980
Don D. Pettymore who could burn folks with his hands

38
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:02,300
John also recalled being chased by two tall gaunt

39
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:10,140
Fancy men in suits while being pushed in a wheelchair by Uncle Don Keith also remembered seeing those lemmy

40
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:16,620
Translucent fellas infiltrate his father's estate the day Ferguson was given the watch

41
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:24,220
John put the watch on and saw his daddy steal him the vector and adopted baby from the Kane

42
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,500
Family burning down their house

43
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:33,460
But unaware of Adam Kane's survival Keith slapped the watch on and saw John murder him and

44
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:38,340
Clark in order to take the watch and walk down into beans pond

45
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:44,900
But the watch didn't come off his wrist when he came back to reality and he became real

46
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,060
suspicious of John

47
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:53,260
Shit got heated with Mildred Mitchell blaming the three PCs for her granddaughter Tilly B's

48
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:56,900
Disappearance showed them a picture of the founders of

49
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:02,920
contention the face of Silas Cole had settled on the face of Keith Vigna and a

50
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:09,900
Reflection in the glass looked a whole lot like that miss until DB Keith lost it and Keith did up

51
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:15,300
Grinding the old stoner into the old stone ground. This was a step too far

52
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:22,980
Harry and Gary asked them to leave at gunpoint and the three headed south into a tunnel and toward

53
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,500
beanspond

54
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,460
Never mind

55
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:32,620
They completely ignored the spell that fell out of Mildred Mitchell's back pocket as well as the fact that Casey

56
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:38,700
Kristoff the longtime janitor of the first Church of contention was clearly

57
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:46,620
Eavesdropping instead of reading his book. It'd be a shame if old Casey wasn't actually down there in the sewers to avoid

58
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:50,060
Big Daddy Kane, but rather doing

59
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:56,880
Reconnaissance for his employer. Well, what do I know? I'm just here to deliver you a brand new song

60
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:03,040
premiering shit non-stop every week or day or a few hours or like

61
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:05,680
25 minutes in game time or even sometimes

62
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:10,060
In the past and hopefully in season 2 or whatever

63
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:15,860
This one's new when it's just for you. It's kazoo with no backbone

64
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,060
You

65
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,640
Thanks for having me yeah problem Joe, yeah

66
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,600
Thanks for having all of us Luke. I understand you've been playing Crusader Kings. I have

67
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:58,880
Zach your couch is pretty comfy and Ramona is sleeping on top of the other one and she's very cute

68
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:03,920
Luke's internet hasn't been working. So we're using lots of hand sanitizer and

69
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,640
Keeping him just in the living room. Yep

70
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,160
I'm here

71
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:16,640
Ramona likes the smell of the germ X she likes to I was petting her but she kept wanting to lick my hands

72
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:24,020
Well, don't let my cat lick the poison off of your she does she's not gonna have any germs in her mouth by the end of

73
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,020
the night

74
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:33,480
Zach the president implied that things like this are not only fine, but beneficial. So oh well

75
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:38,420
Oh God, he also said if we stop testing the numbers will be very low

76
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:44,440
Which is true. Yeah, it's been proven, correct

77
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:51,480
Yep, welcome to hell world fuckheads. Oh

78
00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:00,840
You thought you were gonna get away from the world by listening to a role-playing podcast we've all been touched by the devil hands

79
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,440
Don D. Petty more patient zero

80
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,480
God-dang Don D. Don D. I wonder when he'll show up

81
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:19,620
Yeah, so much happened last episode that I kind of forgot that that's where we started was a man who could burn other people with

82
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,620
his bare hands I

83
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:25,960
Thomas and I hadn't talked about the past of that and

84
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:32,220
Hearing that it was just a staple in their childhood camping trips was pretty horrifying to hear

85
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:40,600
It's like I'm trying to think of like anything my family or like like a weird trick and uncle can do or something

86
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:46,200
But nothing really matches. Yeah, my uncle can pull his thumb clean off. He puts it right back

87
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,200
My uncle that's so on multiple occasions has stolen my nose off of my face

88
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:58,300
Oh shit, but it's he always puts it back sometimes not right away, which is scary, but

89
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,880
He lost it one time we had to look all around it was in the couch

90
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,080
Yeah

91
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,120
uncle

92
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:13,880
Dave all uncles are Dave all uncles are Dave. I have one uncle Dave. I have an uncle Dave

93
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:19,560
I have an uncle Dave. Really? I have two uncles named Dave. You got a Jimmy and I got a Jimmy

94
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,920
So maybe they're all Jimmy. Oh, I've got a Jimmy to

95
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,000
Story. Yeah, me too. My uncle Donny's name is Jimmy now. I

96
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:32,160
Renamed Dave who didn't exist in the first place. Welcome to 84

97
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:39,800
Pretending to be people where everybody's uncle has a name. Wait, how many uncles do you have just on your dad's side?

98
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,720
Six and how many else

99
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:51,480
Yeah, I just won wait, but they all live together. Yeah. No, they did it one point

100
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,640
They actually didn't their ages were so like the oldest to the youngest I think is an 18 year difference

101
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,240
So they'd weren't ever in the house all at the same time. I don't think oh

102
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,480
Can you imagine getting rid of one and then there's just a new one all the sudden there about yeah

103
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:10,240
Their numbers didn't change at all. Definitely after the first one like grew up a little bit

104
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,760
They were like, oh shit. These things are handy if you teach them how to like

105
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:22,920
18 years of like fresh kids definitely seems like some kind of forced labor program or like

106
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,120
Something they were getting out of it

107
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,200
Not joy or love you can get that one, too

108
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,720
How do ants get made

109
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,520
In pursuit of an ant

110
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:49,460
Wait wouldn't if your uncle fucked your grandma you would get you get you get a grant grandpa

111
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:53,160
Well, no, we only discuss you get another you get an aunt you get an aunt

112
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,640
If your uncle fucked your grandpa then you'd get another mom

113
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,720
All right, you you would get another

114
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,500
Grandma, cuz if you fuck your dad you get a mom

115
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:10,280
So if your uncle fucked your grandpa by the trans you would get a grandma another grandma

116
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:14,600
I was never good at biology in school. So I don't know if this really checks out. It's like

117
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:20,400
And recessive jeans and stuff. Yeah, you have to look at the Punnett Square. Yeah

118
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,400
Invented by

119
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,360
Who's who is that guy

120
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:35,300
Recessive gene and a dominant gene and Taylor has two recessive genes

121
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,920
Then when we have sex, we'll get a great-grandma

122
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
correct

123
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,640
What was that now I got to figure out

124
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:51,320
Who's the guy that figured that out his name was something he was like a monk or a priest or something

125
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:58,240
I bet Thomas will be upset that you had to google it. What who discovered recessive genes Thomas was it Mendel?

126
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:05,700
Yep, Gregory. Yeah, Mendel men who actually I don't know if you guys knew this same guy is Rasputin people

127
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:09,320
Don't know that but he's the same guy. It's the exact same guy

128
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,600
Yeah, he just went by Gregory when he was doing science

129
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:23,920
Close enough for me. Have you guys been watching the great on Hulu never heard of it? No, I hear it's good though

130
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,960
It's really good. It's it's the guy who did the or the people who did the favorite?

131
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:33,080
So it's a lot of that movie rule same sense of humor style, and I don't know what the favorite is

132
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:40,120
Who knows your guys Lanthimos is last movie with oh I did see that that was really good. Yeah, Emma Stone and

133
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,040
Holly Coleman leak Peaky Blinders. Yeah, I'll be sure

134
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,040
Paulie Shore and Nicholas Holt

135
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:52,800
So Nicholas Holt is that there's one of the main characters in the in the great and he's fucking great in it

136
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:59,420
It's a really surprisingly. So I was a big skins UK fan when I was it. Oh, is that

137
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:04,620
What's the code Tony Tony stolen yes season one Tony

138
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:13,220
Alright, so Clark Bishop and John Lee Pettymore the third they're walking down this tunnel having just been essentially forced out of this room

139
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:17,500
By the only two people you've been able to trust and contention thus far

140
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:25,260
Essentially, yeah, that didn't feel too good you catch up and you see Keith Vigna on the right side of this tunnel again

141
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,260
This is an arched

142
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:34,180
Very Ninja Turtles arched roof above you with a pathway on the right pathway on the left and then sewage sludge

143
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:38,420
Slowly moving in the middle. You see me on the right side

144
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:45,980
I'm on my back and I've got my left hand that has the watch on it and I've got both my feet on

145
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:51,460
my arm just trying to like pry the watch off my wrist and

146
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:56,980
I'm crying and he's crying because you can see the scrape of skin coming off

147
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:01,140
and blood and I'm also he's also crying cuz he

148
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:07,580
Potentially just killed someone Keith Keith Keith Keith calm down buddy. Hold on

149
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:12,560
No, I got this is just fucking I know we got to get it off, but that's not working. Look at that

150
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:17,300
That's not like you're hurting yourself there Keith. It hurts. It does. I just we're gonna get it off

151
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,740
We're gonna get it off. Was she was she?

152
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,740
I

153
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:26,020
Still breathing when we left Keith, okay. Can you are you sure?

154
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,620
Yeah, we're sure

155
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:29,820
Why?

156
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,820
Why did you do that? I?

157
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:37,700
Don't know. I thought maybe she had something to do with this being stuck on it

158
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:44,180
I don't I just don't think straight when shit like this happens anymore. I can understand that

159
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:48,300
Think things will set us off at the drop of a hat these days. It seems like

160
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:53,440
We've seen a lot. We've seen a lot in the last few days on are you still gonna shoot us when we get there?

161
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:57,460
Maybe man, I don't know. I got two guns now, though

162
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:05,680
Okay, listen, all I'm saying is you you do some crazy shit you attack, you know an old lady that we find there

163
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,940
yeah, maybe I'm gonna have to shoot you but if you fucking just

164
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:15,540
Okay, well maybe you can you walk in front me and Clark can walk behind you just to make me feel better

165
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:21,260
Absolutely. Are we I don't even know if we're going the right way. I I get in front of them

166
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,260
But then I turn around with gun strong

167
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:30,900
Just what just playing just plants that's not very funny John a people

168
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:35,260
He's got you know, it's a tense situation. Somebody's got to diffuse it a little bit

169
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:41,900
So I've livened things up get get get a little get a little joy in our heart after you beat that old woman half to

170
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,900
death fucking psychopath

171
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:49,940
It wasn't really me. It was I don't know something in me. Just I

172
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:53,340
Didn't I didn't want to do it. I didn't mean to but

173
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:57,360
Let's just get let's just get to the fucking pond

174
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:02,580
Gary said we were we were heading in the right direction you that you happen to pick the right tunnel to to crawl

175
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:06,900
Good it's probably cuz I'm the Savior and I just have that kind of intuition now

176
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:12,020
Sure, all right, I pet you on the back I roll my eyes at Clark

177
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:15,620
Yeah, I roll I roll back as I'm patting you on the back. Yeah, that's it

178
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,260
You nailed it

179
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,260
Yes

180
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:24,760
Would while we're walking there would this be a good time to discuss something?

181
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,860
we haven't really talked a whole lot about we found out that we

182
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,380
You know kind of

183
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,380
Maybe from one point of view

184
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:35,580
from a certain perspective

185
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:40,820
Might have let Adam Cain's wife and his children burn to a little crisp in a minivan

186
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:45,260
I mean we we just ran that help we tried to help

187
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:49,620
I know but it doesn't seem like people think we did it seems like they really think we just

188
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:56,080
Let them burn up and then we left town. We can a Adam Cain you what you're technically his

189
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:02,720
A kind of his brother. Yeah, we've now learned that his entire family was killed and he was a sole survivor

190
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,640
because of Kevin's slobiness

191
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:10,840
Or perhaps ill ill got it. Sorry Murphy's going crazy. So good. Gotta stop him

192
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,400
You can hear Tyler from back the way you came

193
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,040
yelping out

194
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:20,600
Tyler did like us Keith hops in the sewage and starts splashing around

195
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,360
Keith roll Constitution

196
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,080
To not get gonorrhea

197
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:35,960
No, what do you get from from poop? Maybe like E. Coli or pink eye pink eye or

198
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:42,200
What's something else you can get what happens if you eat poop Thomas? What happens if you eat poop?

199
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:49,360
I think that depends on the poop a lot of people do ingest other people's poop to improve their gut biome

200
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:54,640
Oh, I thought they shot it up their butts like a like a like a tall boy. They make little poop pills

201
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,600
No way according to Illinois Poison Center eating poop is minimally toxic

202
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,440
So I think

203
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:08,920
You should eat poop. That's also is that core prophagia, huh? Is that what it's called?

204
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:13,400
It was enough syllables to be right co prophagia. Let's get back to the convert

205
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:20,520
What were we talking about out of character when John you were telling us the story the the canes also adopted you, right?

206
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:26,360
Like right I had been a yeah, it's so first exactly and Kevin stole me because

207
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:31,320
He and my my my saintly mother were trying to have a baby and could not conceive

208
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:38,320
Gotcha, and so God saw fit to put me a child of destiny and ball in front of him

209
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,680
Because I am the Savior we did we did try to save Adams family in that wreck

210
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:48,720
I obviously didn't go to according to plan but we tried and there was a crowd around there that saw us trying to help

211
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:53,720
I think John you might have scared him off with a couple gunshots, but they saw that we were helping I

212
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,880
Don't think that's you know

213
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:03,120
Cuz the the person we've been around who's been close to Adam was was Carrie in the body of Drew and the story

214
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:10,480
She told us seems like Adam Kane and the town's version of things right now is that we let them die and then left town

215
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:18,280
Yeah, that's sucks for him that he's lost two families in a horrible horrific fire

216
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,640
accident

217
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:25,960
Well, maybe not accident for the first it certainly adds a layer of terror to that memories. Yeah

218
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,460
guys, I tried my hardest to keep it from happening, but

219
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,360
Well also so we've

220
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:47,760
Valiantly if I remember guys, we've also all had have we all had encounters with those crazy

221
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,720
Creatures before I mean Marvin things

222
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:56,200
I I mean like I told you guys before I got this watch stuck on me that I

223
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:59,240
Saw three of them at least when I was a kid

224
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:05,620
In my in my yard before before my dad gave this watch to my brother in my memory

225
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:12,700
It was a they were chasing the I I would say a rogue figure but these days it's the road figure

226
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:16,080
I think it's the same one. We've been seeing it might be old me

227
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:22,000
I think it's old me that people seem to think it's old bar called Clark old and they were chasing you after your after your

228
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:28,600
Accident John. Well, yeah that the last day of my racing career is kind of one big concussed blur

229
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,720
But as far as I remember it, yeah

230
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:40,520
They started chasing me and Don D that day these things have known something about us long before we ever did

231
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:45,280
Yeah, maybe so they were they were targeting each of us and mine was I was only

232
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,840
Forwarded by old me. He put chains around the library door

233
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:54,040
That's where I was in the library and he put chains around the door and then took maybe he took the heat off of Mary

234
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,920
On the front it says the Mary Cole Public Library

235
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:16,000
It it seems like the yeah those those men those those those creatures in suits

236
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,480
They were after after each of us and it sounds like I gotta have Justin change the map

237
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,960
Well shit I

238
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,400
How all this is just all the shits happened so fast

239
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,360
I don't know what I don't know what to think about any of it

240
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:36,640
Don't you done this all like then propose the idea that we're pawns in something else's game

241
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:42,720
There was a there was some old man that told Gary that gave Gary Daley's grandfather a book and told him to put a spell

242
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,360
on us, I don't know I mean and then these things were chasing us and

243
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,080
Maybe you two are pawns, you know

244
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:54,200
Gary just showed us that thing that Harold Dorsey wrote and you know

245
00:20:54,200 --> 00:21:01,520
We saw that John Peters thing in Harold's thing. It says that you know, Maggie was trying to tip him off

246
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:07,920
Do you think you know, maybe she knows more about this than she lets on or oh

247
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:14,760
Certainly Maggie knows a lot more than she lets on perhaps except maybe to you Clark. I mean, I don't

248
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:21,400
Whether or not we believe everything she said I think I've told you everything that she told me that there's the possibility now that

249
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:25,360
It's either not the Maggie that we knew or it's it is a Maggie

250
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:30,120
We knew and she maybe hurt the one that we didn't know or I don't know. I don't know what's going on now

251
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,680
I think we may need to get a hold of her before we go to

252
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:40,840
Confront Kane. I don't even know what we're gonna do about that. We've certainly got a lot to think about

253
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:45,320
Let's just do one thing at a time. There's a giant spider on my keyboard right now

254
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,920
Yeah, John rolls his eyes your keyboard a

255
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:59,960
Spider on your keyboard. I've never heard of that one before

256
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:06,600
Well, it's do any of y'all have any money on you right now. I got three dollars

257
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:15,100
How about we wage your three dollars apiece on what on ourselves being the same

258
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:22,100
Well, I if I think it might be all three of us or I don't care if it's me or you or Clark or all of

259
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:26,020
Us but it is me. So sure. I'll bet my three dollars

260
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:36,740
About it Clark, it's just three dollars. Just a friendly little wager. I mean, I don't want to bet against saving the world

261
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:42,520
Is that the bet we're making that now now the bet is that you'll save the world, but it's three dollars

262
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,820
It's just you know

263
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:47,860
It's not gonna feel too bad when you both, you know have given me six dollars

264
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,860
That'll

265
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:55,620
Be nine dollars. Yeah, I mean sure. Yeah, sure. Oh, I guess I'll bet on it

266
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:58,180
Hey, I'll race you do to the end of the tunnel. Yeah, I think I see

267
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:03,420
I don't know what time of day it is, but I think I see the light up there if it is daytime

268
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:08,400
Bet you can't beat me. I've start sprinting. I don't think Clark is gonna race

269
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,260
John races

270
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:13,900
All right, roll athletics the two of you

271
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:21,180
John Lee petty more the third than Keith Vigna are racing down this very narrow pathway. Yeah, which is a

272
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:30,020
25 as you guys are racing John Lee petty more you are

273
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:37,460
a little bit behind because as you're saying like let's race keeping it just like took off and started sprinting and you chase after him

274
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:39,980
And right when you're about to take the lead from him

275
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:44,500
He trips over his own feet and lands face-first

276
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:48,420
In the sewage just off to the left of the right side of this path

277
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:53,460
That was confusing and lands face-first in the sewage in this little

278
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:57,340
Small pathway that goes down the middle of this tunnel that you're in

279
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:01,140
John just breezes past and raises both his arms in the air

280
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:09,140
He just won the fucking Boston Marathon and both of your hands are now lit by sunlight

281
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:14,980
That is coming in from a drain a storm drain. You're the it now and

282
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:24,420
As I as I casually walk up to the point that Keith fell in I tried and offer a hand to help him out of

283
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:30,900
There I stand up just the entire front side of me is covered and just thick

284
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,660
green and brown

285
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,260
Goo and

286
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:42,460
I open my eyes and like you can just see my eyes are the only thing that aren't just covered in that color and

287
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:46,540
Clark

288
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,660
What do I do

289
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,620
Grab Clark's hand

290
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:06,340
And it kind of squids I try to like walk out of the middle and yeah, it's just like squeezing out of my shoes and

291
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:15,820
Turn around and see this and I have to like suppress a strong Samaritan urge to mercy kill them both

292
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:20,620
Let's go ahead and get some Constitution rolls for

293
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:23,780
for how vile this is

294
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:31,300
Keith you're at a negative 40 on this roll for being the one who fell in I have a plus 10 for my robot abilities

295
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:35,920
At a negative 40, I would have 30 and I just rolled at 31

296
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:43,580
Brings me up to 70, but I rolled a 75. Oof. What'd you give me negative 20 for having it all over your hand?

297
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:46,460
I pass a 72 on a 95

298
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:49,740
All right, 80 Clark is the only one who is not just like fully

299
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:57,340
Wretching right now and the other two of you you're gonna take a negative 20 on all rolls until you can

300
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:01,340
Figure out a way to alleviate this situation. So your abs are just like

301
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:04,740
overkill working themselves because of how

302
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:13,100
I like get near the storm drain. I take my shirt off and I try to use the

303
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:20,860
Backside of it that's not like covered in stuff and try to like wipe my arms off a little bit and wipe my face

304
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:23,980
and then I walk up to Keith's clean back and

305
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:34,140
Yeah, so now I'm I'm shirtless my face has less goo my arms have less goo

306
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:41,720
My hair's like matted on my face because of that and then I've got my big shorts on and you have John's vomit all over

307
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:47,060
and I as I take a couple more steps, I realize that my

308
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:52,880
Shoes are just soaked. So I go ahead and take my shoes and socks off to all right going barefoot

309
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:57,660
That may be an issue if you need to step on stuff on spikes

310
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:02,340
Role-playing baby

311
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:06,620
Didn't suspect my knife floor

312
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,360
You wanted to have a race did you

313
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,340
I'm gonna go pee. Okay

314
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:22,860
The fucking echo and your cavernous living room it that's perfect

315
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:37,060
Keith vigna as you look up out of this storm drain

316
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:41,320
You see the neighborhood that surrounds beans pond

317
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:48,540
You can't quite see into the pond where the water is from this angle, but you know exactly where you are guys

318
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:54,340
I think we're we're near Maggie's do you see smoldering remains of a house? I

319
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,980
Can only smell one thing

320
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:03,740
Guys take a look. I think we're here and then I pull my phone out and

321
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:08,220
Type in something into my phone minimally toxic, okay

322
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:23,700
Yeah, you probably probably don't want to use that phone again to get around some Clorox whaps though

323
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:32,200
Yeah, I'll wash off in the pond when you say that you'll wash off in the pond you immediately remember your conversation with Claire

324
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:37,980
Blankenship. Oh, yeah, there ain't no water in the pond. Do you guys want to crawl out first?

325
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,600
So you don't have to you know, crawl through

326
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:47,040
All this Clark happily takes him up on that. Yeah, we'll go and we'll go and order of soil

327
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:52,720
I guess least the most I need everyone to roll to take out their headphones

328
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,360
Power huh

329
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,880
Yeah

330
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:07,360
Fail 96. Wait, what is it's a negative what for my rules? You're a negative 20. I

331
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,640
pass an 18

332
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:16,840
60 fail 87 on a 30. Okay Thomas and Luke take off your headphones

333
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,840
Oh

334
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,880
Clark as you crawl out when you stand

335
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:36,960
you can see that beans pond has been completely emptied of its contents and

336
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:42,340
There's just this muddy basin there in the middle of this little like

337
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:47,900
Neighborhood where these streets kind of cross and in the middle of this pond

338
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:54,940
right next to a mostly buried metal door in the ground you see a

339
00:29:55,540 --> 00:30:00,380
Tank of fish to the brim just teeming and inside

340
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:05,740
there is a gaunt little boy and he is

341
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:09,780
Drowning and he is desperately trying to stay afloat

342
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:16,060
But there's so many fish in this tank that they seem to be keeping him down how far away from all this

343
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:16,500
Are we?

344
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:22,260
okay, so literally you're on one side of the street when you when you get up and the pond is on the other side of

345
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:24,260
the street across from you and

346
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:29,220
Then the pond starts what like 10 yards past the other side of the street

347
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:32,500
And so the middle of the pond is probably 15 yards past that

348
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:37,980
So the middle where this is happening is about 25 yards away, okay, so yeah beans pond is not very big

349
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:43,580
It's just like a no like a little little water hole, you know here and there it kind of mushrooms

350
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:48,540
It's bigger at the top than it is at the bottom. Okay, and you can take your headphones off

351
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:50,740
Cool

352
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:05,740
Thomas as John Lee Pettymore climbs up out of this you see that across the street from where you are is beans pond and

353
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:11,420
In the very middle of beans pond, which is now a muddy basin

354
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:14,260
sans water sans fish

355
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:18,060
Just mud and in the very center

356
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:23,340
there is a mostly buried metal door in the ground and

357
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,220
Standing there right next to it is Pastor Adam Kane

358
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:36,700
Wearing an old motorcycle helmet that seems to have some weird tubes and you can kind of see that the red light is

359
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:40,780
Lit on it John draws his gun and tells him to take the helmet off

360
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:46,260
Oh

361
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:53,220
Luke yes, as you crawl out you're just scraping this

362
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:59,620
Disgusting refuse on to the side of the concrete as you drag your way out and it's kind of like building up

363
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:02,060
you know as you pull yourself out and

364
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:09,540
When you kind of stand up you see that across the street is beans pond, but there's no water

365
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:11,500
There's no fish just as you expected

366
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:15,380
But what you didn't really expect is to see you know in the very middle

367
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:19,860
there's a mostly buried metal door in the ground and

368
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:24,620
Sitting right next to it is an old motorcycle helmet

369
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:30,220
With strange tubes and the light on it is green

370
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:32,220
Oh

371
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:47,580
And as soon as you're all standing up there John Lee Pettymore the third pulls his gun and hollers take off the helmet

372
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:51,140
Take it off now. What would help would help with John?

373
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:58,760
Who's wearing a helmet Adam Pastor Kane? What he's standing on the door? I don't there's no there's nobody there John

374
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:02,680
There's like there's a kid who's floundering over there in that tank of fish right there. What do you talk?

375
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:07,520
Well, no fish. There's just the helmets near the door on Adam Kane

376
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:12,160
What clearly you two are not savior material and I pulled the trigger

377
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,800
roll firearms three you fire and

378
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Joe Luke take your headphones off

379
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:34,880
Thomas when John Lee Pettymore fires aims true world damage rolled e10 eight

380
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,640
immediately let me roll Constitution

381
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:45,520
Pastor Adam Kane falls backwards and the helmet flies off of his head into the mud behind him and he lays

382
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:51,360
Motionless on the ground right next to the metal door that is mostly buried in the ground

383
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:55,680
I run up to administer first aid. Okay, John begins running into

384
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,280
beans pond

385
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,280
Rolled dexterity for me

386
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:03,220
43 on a 45. Oh, yeah

387
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:09,200
so as you kind of like get up to the edge you see it's just mud slide kind of down and

388
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:13,160
You can put your feet wide enough apart to kind of

389
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:19,800
balance as you kind of slide down into where the bottom of the pond was and

390
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:23,880
You run up to administer first aid

391
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,280
Oh

392
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:38,200
Clark Bishop you see John Lee Pettymore fire his weapon into this tank and

393
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,240
You see a lot less

394
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:48,840
Movement from inside only the fish are going crazy and you see the water begins turning red

395
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:56,920
Okay, Clark. What do you do? I'm running up to get a better look at what's what's

396
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:02,520
Following John I'm following John I think right and he run in in the same direction that I would want to be running

397
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:10,280
Absolutely, go ahead and roll a dexterity to try to like get into the bottom of the pond without slipping and falling. I

398
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:13,980
Pass a 25 on a 60. All righty

399
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,980
I

400
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:28,340
John Lee Pettymore fires his weapon hits one of the tubes on this old motorcycle helmet the tube

401
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:30,660
explodes just this and

402
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:38,140
Then he runs into the base and slides down the side and then Clark Bishop follows right behind him. I run after

403
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:39,860
them

404
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:40,900
To

405
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:46,100
Amazing go ahead and roll dexterity as well at a negative 20 as you're sliding down

406
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:52,340
You can see this mud. It just kind of looks like the refuse that is all over you

407
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:55,660
I gotta check my decks minus 20 to see if I pass

408
00:35:56,500 --> 00:36:03,580
Shirtless you have these giant. Oh nice. Okay, so I have 50 decks minus 20 is 30 and I rolled

409
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:07,140
79

410
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:11,700
I

411
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,300
Had to do some math in my head

412
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:19,900
But I fail Keith vignette eat shit as he's trying to get into this pond

413
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:27,140
slips falls face forward into the mud and begins slowly sliding down the

414
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:29,620
pond wall as

415
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:33,780
the other two make their way into the very center and

416
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:38,860
Immediately shots begin firing from either side of you

417
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:44,180
Keith vignette

418
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:46,140
You're face down in this mud

419
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:50,740
You can feel yourself kind of sliding forward and then all of a sudden you feel a bullet

420
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:58,140
Pierce into your ribs on your left side and you don't know whether it went all the way through but breathing becomes

421
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:01,340
Extremely difficult as you take seven damage

422
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:04,140
Shit

423
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:10,460
Except you can't really breathe in too much because it's just mud all up in your face spot and shit

424
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:15,580
Clark Bishop, it's your turn. What do you do?

425
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,060
Clark wants to run up to

426
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:24,340
The tank that I see and try and put myself between it and one of the you said it was coming from both sides

427
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:30,900
Right the shooters. Yep, put the tank between one and another shooter and try to return fire from where I think it's coming from

428
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,460
Okay roll

429
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:34,460
search

430
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:39,620
To see if you can figure out where these shots are coming from not alert news

431
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:47,620
49 on us 20 for search. What's your alertness 70? Oh, man, your alertness is so much better than your search

432
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:54,660
No, that'll play that'll play alertness would come in here because you're focused on doing something else and the shots are ringing out

433
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:56,180
so you can kind of

434
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:59,900
immediately see that there is a privacy fence and

435
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:07,060
You see that there's a gun being held just like over the fence. That's just like firing. What do you do?

436
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:10,460
I would like to try and fire at where I see the hand coming from

437
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:16,220
I would be aiming for center mass if I could picture a person standing behind it through the fence. Okay, roll firearms. I

438
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:25,740
Pass 47 on an 80. Okay, then roll a detentive damage. We'll subtract two for fence cover. We'll subtract one

439
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:27,540
It's just a wooden fence

440
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:35,340
Three okay minus one is two and you hear a yelp come out from that side a female voice screams out in pain

441
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:41,460
John Lee Pettymore the third. What are you doing slowly realizing that if Adam Kane was wearing the helmet and

442
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:46,380
Had already swapped that I might have just shot someone dear to me

443
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:53,040
What if even he swapped drew out of Carrie Paige's body into his body and he's in Carrie Paige's bodies

444
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:58,120
Anyway, I'm running up to I'm running up to the person I just shot and you you made it their last round

445
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:02,180
So what are you doing you your goal was to get first aid on to this person?

446
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:07,480
But shots began ringing out you can change what you were doing if you want or you can continue trying to do first aid

447
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:11,120
I don't have a great first aid. Can I try to persuade them to first aid their selves?

448
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:20,420
Yeah, he is still conscious oh no, he is unconscious he failed his constitution check I'd like to persuade him to become conscious

449
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:22,420
When

450
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:25,320
When I see Clark

451
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:29,700
Shoot the person behind the fence or return fire in that direction

452
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:35,660
I spin around the other direction and try to see where the other fire is coming from and I've got I've got both John's gun

453
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:41,580
Man what a episode

454
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:43,580
Title

455
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:45,860
90 on a 60

456
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:52,140
It's not the kind of episode title you typically want but a 90 on a 60 is an equivalent of what you tried to say

457
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:56,220
With your words and so it's your firing with both John's gun

458
00:39:57,060 --> 00:40:03,420
Neither one hits as your oh as you're trying to figure out where it came from where you fuck. Sorry

459
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:10,500
You know, I just looking without you're just looking you cannot figure out where this these shots are coming from from the other side

460
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:14,440
I fire a couple impotent shots into the air just to try to intimidate them

461
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:18,980
That is the John Lee petty more way Keith Vigna. What are you doing? I want to ask you a question real quick

462
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:20,900
I'm Zach. You can ask me a question at any time

463
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:24,980
I guess they already know about that. I'm like part robot or whatever, but

464
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:29,900
Would that have had any effect on when I got shot or was that I don't remember

465
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:32,620
well mechanically

466
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:38,100
Unfortunately, we didn't make that a thing which seems like it should have been it's probably doesn't matter

467
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:40,440
I could have done better. But here we are. Okay

468
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:45,700
Okay, so I was shot in the left side, right? Yeah, correct

469
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:52,640
I like sit up or like sit on my butt. I wipe all the mud off my face and I blow

470
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:59,340
the mud out of both my nostrils and then I shove my finger up my nose and

471
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:04,700
get a little bump do you have on your character sheet what the

472
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:11,780
Improvement is for doing that it has varied. Yeah, it was willpower based, but we weren't we're not really

473
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:18,740
If you lose 10 luck, then I'll let you go ahead and make an action this turn. How about that? Okay, I'll

474
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:22,460
Lose my 10 luck that I made the other day

475
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:29,020
And I just want to sprint back up the wall of the not pool

476
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:30,540
Absolutely

477
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:34,180
Since I got shot in the left side. I want to like look over to that direction

478
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:36,860
Is that where Clark is shooting at?

479
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:42,460
I was picturing in my head that I was shooting to the right because that was where the tank kind of was

480
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:47,020
Like I would put myself shooting over it to the right. Yeah, he was shooting the right

481
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:52,140
So John was shooting up in the air, but he was looking left. I'm gonna draw a quick map real quick

482
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:57,000
Keith you got hit from the left side, which is the side that

483
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:03,000
John is kind of looking for someone on that side. So I want to turn around run up the

484
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,600
wall of the pond and

485
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:11,520
So that at that point I'll be on my right look over to the right and do I see any anybody or any?

486
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:14,360
first off go ahead and roll a

487
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:20,040
Dexterity or athletics to get back up without slipping at a negative 20 still fail

488
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:23,800
So as you're trying to slide back up, you're kind of looking off to the right

489
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:30,360
But you can't get your grip on this mud for long enough to be able to keep your head straight

490
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:37,840
especially with this deep pain coming in your side and shots begin firing off once more as

491
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:42,020
The shots fire off. None of you get hit Clark

492
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:49,480
One of the bullets flies right by your ear and the other ones are all hitting the mud right next to Keith Vigna

493
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:53,460
Clark Bishop, it's your turn is the person behind the fence still shooting

494
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:56,880
Yes, I'm gonna shoot again. I want them to stop shooting

495
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,760
Roll it up, baby

496
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:04,400
Pass 23 on an 80 roll a d10 a

497
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:11,640
Two okay fence is still in the way so you kind of aim low and you

498
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:20,920
There that was a weird noise it wasn't the correct noise, sorry, okay, that was an alarming noise. Yeah

499
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,920
Specifically wasn't Drew's voice, please. No

500
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:32,400
Okay, John Lee Pettymore, what are you doing since they kept firing on us?

501
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:38,760
have I now identified where the fire on the left is coming from if you roll a search or an alertness with a

502
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:42,560
Plus 20 since they've done been firing she haven't teen

503
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:49,260
Yeah, you actually see that there is someone hiding behind a grill in someone's backyard

504
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:52,900
There's no privacy fence on this backyard and on their deck

505
00:43:53,220 --> 00:44:00,260
There's a little propane grill and there's someone hiding right behind it and they keep poking up and firing

506
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:05,460
I'd like to fire back anything cool. This is the end of your stakeout, buddy

507
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:15,380
Plus 20 on the firearms check 29 roll a d10 for damage 3 I rolled the tens one

508
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:17,380
Will you give me the 30?

509
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:24,340
You fire and you hear a man's voice cry out and he's like

510
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:29,180
Keith Vigna, what are you doing stuff? I'm gonna try to get out of the

511
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:32,860
Pond again, and yeah, you'll be able to make it out on this turn

512
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:36,140
Okay, I do that and then when I hear John yell

513
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:40,780
I want to look over and can I see the guy too or do I need to roll a check?

514
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:41,700
No

515
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:48,140
Now the John has shot him and he's kind of shown himself both people have been shot and you guys kind of know where they

516
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:50,780
At least were last round at the beginning

517
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:57,820
I'm going to pull my gun out and run towards the grill and I'm gonna fire as I'm running

518
00:44:57,980 --> 00:45:00,960
Go ahead and roll a negative 20 a 9

519
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:03,780
So yeah, I'd be 10 for damage

520
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:06,340
6 yeah, I'll do

521
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:13,940
Cool as you're running you're kind of like slipping on the mud a little bit and you're smelling all of this shit and mud

522
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:14,500
that's just

523
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:19,780
Covering you at this point and you fire and you hit this dude as he's like laying on the ground

524
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:20,900
John hit him

525
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:27,260
He kind of fell over and you fire you hit him right in the torso and he kind of rolls over and he's facing

526
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:33,220
you and you see at this point Asher little who is one of the parents of

527
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:39,880
Aiden and Alice little who went missing a couple days ago and you see that he has

528
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:46,920
Laser faded jeans that are bedazzled and he's wearing a long-sleeve shirt that is skin tight to his

529
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:50,980
Crossfit body and the front of the shirt has a picture of his children

530
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:59,000
Aiden and Alice who are twin nine-year-olds and he is wearing a fair amount of makeup and he is rocking some Yeezys and

531
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:02,000
he is crying out in pain and

532
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:05,820
You don't know if he's gonna be able to get back up, but he is not

533
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:11,840
Unconscious yet. Was he one of the guys in one of the cars or trucks?

534
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:16,160
That was the Impala that was coming after you guys that had a refrigerator

535
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:22,880
Yeah, he was driving that longs to the littles and you recognize the two of them from driving it and they are

536
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:28,100
members of the first Church of contention and now the first

537
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:35,100
Creek family of contention from behind the fence the gun raises again just fires

538
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:38,960
Aimlessly hitting the mud around you

539
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:41,700
but asher little

540
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:47,780
Mustering all this strength like like the end of that Keanu Reeves Patrick Shweezy movie

541
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:54,260
But instead of moving to fire up into the air. He just fires directly at Keith Vigna and he hits him

542
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:57,140
There's seven more damage. Oh

543
00:46:57,620 --> 00:46:59,620
Fuck

544
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:07,180
Yeah, you're just out in the open yeah, I'm at 10 health at this point you're 24 total

545
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:11,700
Yep, holy shit when you went from 17 down to 10

546
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:17,420
he hits you in the hip and you feel it hit the bone and

547
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:22,900
You think it might have cracked as you begin like limping?

548
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:27,820
Toward him in that direction and you you're just oh my you

549
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:32,620
Real crunch, you know, you you don't feel good. It's pain

550
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:38,980
I've never been shot by a gun, but my drugs helped me any with that pain. No, okay

551
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:43,820
Okay, and an adrenaline doesn't help them with the pain. Oh, yeah. Okay. Yeah sure. Yeah

552
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:48,900
You've been shot twice once in the ribs once in the hip and you're still standing. So yeah fucking helps

553
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:51,140
There we go, okay

554
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:58,800
Again, I'm just gonna continue limping as fast as I can at him Clark Bishop. You're up and as this round begins

555
00:47:59,660 --> 00:48:03,420
Clark Bishop, there is no tank here

556
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:11,100
There are no fish here and John Lee Pettymore the body that is right next to you not there

557
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:14,140
the only thing the two of you see on the ground is

558
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:18,620
Is this metal door that is mostly buried

559
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:23,660
Looks completely sealed and it says here lies the beans

560
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:26,780
scientists beyond measure

561
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:32,380
Saviors of the world god damn it if he's the fucking Savior

562
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:41,320
Clark Bishop, what do you do seeing the fish tank disappear kind of throws me, but I'm yelling back at Keith Keith

563
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:46,000
They're shooting at you get down and I would like to try and see if I could pry that door open

564
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:49,200
Like that's the only thing I could find cover if I could get that door open

565
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:56,760
I'm trying to write open as you try to find any sort of crease or anything. There's nothing

566
00:48:56,760 --> 00:49:00,340
There's no handle on this door. There's no hinges on this door

567
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:05,880
It almost doesn't even look like a door other than the fact that that's how I've described it so far

568
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:08,200
Like

569
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
An impassable metal plate

570
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:13,560
yeah, almost like

571
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:20,160
Yeah, an impassable metal plate. I couldn't have said it better myself. I'll just edit out you saying it and then I'll say it

572
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:22,840
perfect

573
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:27,360
Listeners may not know but I've come up with the entire story and plot of

574
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:32,960
Podcast as we go and I just generously let Zach edit that out. I

575
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:36,820
Hope he doesn't accidentally leave this one in this time

576
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:43,720
He's a promise and he would definitely knows exactly what's going on at all times

577
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:50,640
100% command of the story the characters the events as they have transpired thus far

578
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:53,720
I'm all over it, baby

579
00:49:56,480 --> 00:50:01,700
Clark as you're trying to figure out how to open this door you look up and you see that there is no fish tank

580
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:03,820
Whatsoever in front of you roll sanity

581
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:12,060
Yeah, baby, it's a 70 that's a fail over my power

582
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:16,260
Oh my god, Zach on the fucking webcam just started like

583
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:22,060
Curling his fingers like a super when he heard that Joe had rolled over his power

584
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:28,820
What do I lose you just lose one sanity, but you also lose your shit

585
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:31,900
So Clark was going to hit the deck since he doesn't have any cover

586
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:37,860
But now he's gonna stand up like nothing could hurt him and charge the person behind the fence

587
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:40,700
Shooting the whole way as he runs so we'll go

588
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:49,980
negative 20 for blinding anger on the firearms check as you make your way up out of the muddy basin that you have found yourself in a

589
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:54,100
bowl of slop I pass a

590
00:50:54,580 --> 00:50:57,700
52 on a 60 nice roll a d10

591
00:50:58,820 --> 00:51:06,180
6 you fire in and you actually have knocked away enough of this fence at this point that

592
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:12,940
You see a woman who is wearing a skin tight t-shirt that has two children's faces

593
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:20,180
On it and you recognize these two children as Aiden and Alice little gonna sexualize a grieving mother. I

594
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:23,060
wasn't going to

595
00:51:24,060 --> 00:51:29,380
What just happened skin tight t-shirt, oh, that's all that it takes for you

596
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:38,520
They do CrossFit man, I don't know what to tell you I am aroused and offended

597
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:43,260
Typical

598
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:52,220
And you hit what is very likely in your mind Avery little and she falls backward and

599
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:56,740
You just hear this moaning. How about that? Do you like that Thomas?

600
00:51:57,380 --> 00:52:00,180
From behind the fence that's been blown away

601
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:13,780
John Lee Pettymore, it's your turn rule the body that was once there is no longer. I need you to roll sanity

602
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:17,800
He's gonna freak out but that's also a huge relief to him 13 pass

603
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:24,920
Okay, you don't need to freak out and you don't need to lose in the sanity you are extremely relieved that you didn't shoot

604
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:28,320
What might have been a person is Asher still firing?

605
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:33,640
Yeah, and he's a he's actually he's firing at Keith vignette and he's falling

606
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:36,880
I fire at Asher go ahead and roll that firearms check

607
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:39,680
16 well d10 for damage

608
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:42,560
to mmm

609
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:44,680
As

610
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:50,160
You fire it's not enough to take him down as blood splatters on the concrete behind him of this

611
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:56,320
This little back deck that he's on but his eyes are wide open and his aim is still

612
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:01,720
Directed at Keith vigna who is slowly trudging toward him and Keith vigna

613
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:05,080
It is your turn and it is likely an important one

614
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:09,520
Can I just say something guys say something that you're allowed to it's a podcast

615
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:12,680
There's only four of us you got no, you know when Joe and I

616
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:20,000
Farcically disappeared these children, you know a very a very light-hearted

617
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:23,640
Goofy

618
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:31,160
Almost whimsical. Yeah cartoonish disappearance Mary Poppins esque. I thought that'd be the last we heard of it. I didn't realize

619
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:34,440
There would be these kind of consequences

620
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:37,560
angry citizenry angry parents

621
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:43,900
Didn't really think anybody would miss the kids while this shit was going down, but I yeah

622
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:46,940
I just want to say admire here

623
00:53:56,920 --> 00:54:00,240
Just kidding, I'll probably amp it up Keith vigna. What are you doing?

624
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:06,360
The pain is starting to get to me. So I am gonna like get down on my knees and

625
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:08,960
Like

626
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:21,260
Get down on my knees and aim at Asher and fire Adam shirtless he's covered in all sorts of

627
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:38,360
Hey

628
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:45,120
Luke yeah, what are you doing, man? I just tell you I'm on oh shit. I

629
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:49,080
Shot him

630
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:51,080
Tell you to roll firearms

631
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:53,520
69

632
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:58,580
Don't don't touch him. Don't move your hands. Don't move your hands. Don't move your hands put the other one up in the air

633
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:00,960
Are you gonna run in there and check? Yes, I am

634
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:07,880
Guys if he if he moves his hands, you tell me we're on him Luke move your hands

635
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:19,920
Don't need to I did it don't have to lie to us. He's not in the room. Holy fucking shit. It's a goddamn 69

636
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:28,520
I was about to actually scream, but then I remember my girlfriend went to bed and was like, please don't scream

637
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:33,800
But it was a 69, honey

638
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:37,680
She can't argue with that, right

639
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:41,160
She gets it what are we talking about?

640
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:46,680
Just how I told my girlfriend I wouldn't scream during this session and I really wanted to win the girl

641
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:49,560
Would you confirm that?

642
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:53,800
Taylor's asleep. So I thought you're talking about me running through the house

643
00:55:57,360 --> 00:56:00,500
Saying I could be like, well, it's not as bad as what's act

644
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:06,480
Exactly. Can you imagine being married to that monster? Okay, so

645
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:14,760
Keith do you want to shoot this dude dead? Do you want to keep him alive or do you want to hit the propane tank?

646
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:20,600
Okay. Yeah, I want to kill him. I want to hit him actually fuck it. I want to hit the propane tank

647
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:24,020
These both have consequences. I'm sure

648
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:28,300
Yeah, we stopped whose house is this stop getting shot

649
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:35,180
It's season two you guys are just playing citizens in contention and then all of a sudden

650
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:42,300
Okay, so I dropped down on my knees and

651
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:46,160
I like have Asher in my sights

652
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:53,100
But I just noticed the propane tank that's right next to him under the grill. I aim a little bit left

653
00:56:53,820 --> 00:57:01,460
Fire a couple rounds the propane tank explodes and I say soy beans puto

654
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:06,300
That's actually dope that means I am beans bitch

655
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:15,220
It's also a cross-lingual soybeans, but

656
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:22,060
Okay, that was incredible take ten look back

657
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:25,220
sweet, thanks

658
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:29,420
Did you actually roll for any of that that was the 69 that was my 69

659
00:57:30,540 --> 00:57:32,540
That's why he's allowed to do whatever he wants

660
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:37,140
After it explodes I

661
00:57:37,180 --> 00:57:43,180
Look down into the pond and want to start heading towards those guys. Okay. Yeah for sure

662
00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:47,340
I just assumed that the fiery explosion killed him it did

663
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:51,380
Tight, I knew that already though. I didn't even have to see it

664
00:57:52,340 --> 00:57:55,420
So Keith you don't even look behind you as this

665
00:57:56,140 --> 00:57:58,140
grill explodes

666
00:57:58,180 --> 00:58:05,740
throwing the body of Asher little through the backsliding glass door of this home as it

667
00:58:05,740 --> 00:58:07,740
glass shatters and

668
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:13,140
Your eyes are set at the bottom of the pond

669
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:17,580
but above that Clark Bishop is walking up the other side and

670
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:23,660
Makes his way to the fence and as you're trying to look through where you've been shooting through the fence and these holes that you've

671
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:24,660
made

672
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:29,620
The person you've been aiming at seems to have crawled out of view. What do you do?

673
00:58:29,620 --> 00:58:35,380
Have I got my eyes out? Am I still under that over the power role? Have you got?

674
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:39,180
Yaws out Thomas you into it

675
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:41,300
No

676
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:45,480
Don't like any of you needlessly sexualized sexualized in this

677
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:52,520
And yes, you are you are done Clark with your yeah. Yes. I kind of want to just yell

678
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:58,160
Stop stop shooting. I'll stop shooting. Stop shooting and I'll stop shooting. Do I get any you just hear?

679
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:01,720
Prayer. Yes. Thank you Jesus. Oh god. Yes

680
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:09,600
no, and there's times like these where retribution is the only necessary thing in the eyes of those who are light in the Lord and

681
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:10,840
To

682
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:13,040
pervade the evil of this world

683
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:18,400
We must desecrate the bodies of those who are succumbing to the pleasures of this earth

684
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:23,400
Can I strafe left and right around that hole to try and get an angle that I can see?

685
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:29,720
Yeah, as you strafe through the hole and see her she is on the ground directly aimed up at you

686
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:33,640
She'd readied in action with a successful firearms check and she fires

687
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:37,240
Directly through the hole at you and rolled a nine

688
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,240
For

689
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:41,640
Damage

690
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:45,720
For damage, yeah, what were you Alan hit point? I'm at 20

691
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:51,040
Okay, so you go down to a well, I'm sorry. I'm at 26. I was full goodness gracious

692
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:55,380
So you go down to 15 quick math. That's uh, you do that's 11

693
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:59,880
yeah, I would be not that you go down to 17 and

694
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:04,680
That's slow math. Well quick math isn't necessarily good

695
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:09,400
First math

696
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:12,960
First math Beth math. Oh, that's

697
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:16,960
First math best math

698
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:19,400
hard to say

699
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:21,400
first math best math

700
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:28,200
All right, so we've got a new math best math. Yeah, say it faster though first math best math

701
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:31,400
first math best math

702
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:35,120
Well, I shouldn't be in radio Clark you got hit

703
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:39,600
We've it's a wall for the radio

704
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:47,000
so Clark gets hit directly in the shoulder and you just feel the blow back through and

705
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:55,560
It's your turn. I want to shoot her a return fire. I want to return fire. She just shot me. I wanna shoot her

706
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:58,520
roll firearms

707
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:03,520
I pass a 36 on an 8k roll damage

708
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:08,760
Fuck a three. Yeah, that'll extinguish her life. So

709
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:16,820
As you put out this fire of a human being John John Lee Pettymore comes up behind and surveys the scene and says

710
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:20,040
Ashers to ashers dust to dust

711
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:26,480
And Avery's to Avery's I think mine was better

712
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:30,840
Kind of why I think I'm the savior I'm running over to him

713
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:35,800
And I'm like guys did you hear what I said, did you hear what I said when I shot it I

714
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:43,920
Got him. Yeah, you were said you were talking about soybeans. Yeah, it's Spanish. Did you hear my thing about Asher's to Asher's?

715
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:46,520
Yeah, that was really good, too. Thanks

716
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:52,200
So did you did you destroy the helmet Oh

717
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:56,040
When you shot it Clark is looking puzzled at you

718
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:59,000
But I never I'm there was never a helmet guys

719
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:06,800
Right down there and I point when you look down you see no helmet and I need you to roll a sanity. Oh good

720
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:10,680
72 so over my power and

721
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:17,640
Fail and how many and how many do I lose just one? Okay, I hit my breaking point

722
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:28,040
I

723
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:33,880
Look go ahead and roll a D 100 and for each time you roll it out of three times

724
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:41,240
I will tell you what your option of a mania will be from the table 10 from Call of Cthulhu 7th edition called

725
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:44,680
Sample mania is okay. First roll is a 14

726
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:48,000
14 is going to be a rhythm a

727
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:52,440
Rith arith mania obsessive preoccupation with numbers

728
01:02:52,440 --> 01:03:00,000
Okay, second one's 29 29 is going to be color o mania obsession with a specific color and

729
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:07,400
57 and 57 is icon o mania obsession with icons or portraits. I'll go with that one

730
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:12,400
Yeah, do you still have that picture? I do indeed. Yep, that'll that'll help. Okay, cool

731
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:14,400
So

732
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:27,240
As Keith Vigna looks at the helmet and Clark Bishop's like there's never a helmet there did

733
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:32,000
One of you took when he took the helmet when he took the helmet who took Keith

734
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:35,520
There was never a helmet there wouldn't help. I saw I saw John shoot the helmet

735
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:41,960
Did did you guys take my picture too? Did you did you take that photo and I have to start searching my pockets?

736
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:45,480
it's in my back pocket and I look at it and I like

737
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:51,440
Hide it from him Keith. This is mine. This is mine Keith. Who's who's in the picture right now?

738
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:56,200
It's still me still me milder grave gave us that picture. We couldn't have taken it. No, no

739
01:03:56,200 --> 01:04:01,440
I'm it like took it from me. Oh, I've still got it. What what's what's the door?

740
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:08,280
Say fucking he's gonna find out just fucking show it says the beans thing. All right, it says the beans thing

741
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:14,960
Here here lies the beans it's safe saviors plural of the world. I want to run down and read it for myself

742
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:17,440
everybody roll power

743
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:19,840
power

744
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:26,720
Pass 31 on the city. I got another nine. I pass a 45 on a 60

745
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:29,640
the door failed

746
01:04:31,780 --> 01:04:37,860
Clark Bishop Keith Vigna and John Lee Pettymore you all won the power contest this time

747
01:04:37,980 --> 01:04:44,020
And you each feel a loosening of some external forces grip on your perception

748
01:04:44,020 --> 01:04:48,580
And the scene, you know and a single blink has changed completely

749
01:04:49,660 --> 01:04:53,160
beans pond is encircled entirely by the

750
01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:58,660
Six-story tall wall of water and the three of you on the inside of the foul-smelling

751
01:04:59,660 --> 01:05:00,900
floating moat

752
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:06,900
Clark and John this unnatural feat of nonsense is right behind you and you can see ice

753
01:05:07,220 --> 01:05:08,700
forming on the water

754
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:16,020
always broken immediately by one of the many fish hopping out sideways and plopping back in with the force of this

755
01:05:16,460 --> 01:05:23,000
horizontal gravity Keith begins running down into the muddy basin to see the engraving on this

756
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:29,060
impassable metal plate careful not to slip and fall face first in the mud again

757
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:33,860
But across the pond on the other bank is a whole situation

758
01:05:34,740 --> 01:05:39,460
Casey Kristoff the mullet rocking janitor of the first Church of contention

759
01:05:40,340 --> 01:05:45,080
holds a pistol to the back of Carrie Paige's head who is

760
01:05:45,580 --> 01:05:51,380
Blindfolded and on her knees and right next to them is Pastor Adam Cain

761
01:05:51,860 --> 01:05:58,140
Wearing the strange-looking motorcycle helmet red light lit and he is driving the four-wheeler

762
01:05:58,740 --> 01:06:04,540
About to drop into this former pond and he's aiming straight for Keith

763
01:06:05,220 --> 01:06:11,800
Strapped to the back of the four-wheeler you found an a-plus storage crashed in the woods and had drew fix up all nice

764
01:06:12,020 --> 01:06:20,060
Strapped in behind Big Daddy Cain is the radio with the odd glass tubes and its green light is lit

765
01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:27,500
And sitting atop this unnatural radio claws holding on for dear life is an extremely

766
01:06:28,140 --> 01:06:30,220
determined black cat

767
01:06:52,740 --> 01:06:54,740
Try

768
01:06:57,500 --> 01:06:59,500
Yeah
