1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,560
What's good, my nasty children?

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:07,000
It's your busted ass ass bustin' Buster Wolf the dog.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,520
And I'm here to bust up them eardrums

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:11,880
with my drumstick tongue.

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,040
Am I Russian or am I dragon?

6
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,320
Who can say?

7
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:20,420
Prepare to get whiplashed like JK Simmons

8
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,840
because we got a new Howlin' with Wolf.

9
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:27,300
Today's Howlin' with Wolf comes from Maury from Seattle

10
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,640
who tweeted about the show

11
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,960
and tagged that pretendin' pod.

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,200
They right.

13
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,420
First things first, Wolf, your dulcet tones haunt my dreams

14
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,680
and your musical taste is always on point.

15
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,080
Much respect.

16
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,800
Mad thanks to the PTBP crew.

17
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,120
Y'all introduce this lifetime D&D player

18
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,200
to the fun Delta Green has to offer.

19
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,000
And last things last, shout out to my friends Darian,

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,880
Ryan, Robbie, and Mike.

21
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,760
You volunteered so I could learn how to be a good handler

22
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:05,760
and I promise to murder you all in fun and interesting ways.

23
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,260
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

24
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:11,360
Thank you, Maury from Seattle.

25
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,040
I once went to Seattle and I saw a whole bunch of crabs

26
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,940
feasting on a mound of rotten hot dogs.

27
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:21,740
Now that is a city Wolf can get inside of.

28
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:25,920
If you wanna howl at your Wolf, tag us on the internet.

29
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,080
Or write a five star review

30
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,400
and shoot us an email or somethin'.

31
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,360
We love hearin' from y'all.

32
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:36,760
All the links are in the show notes.

33
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,480
And while you're perusin' that vast and mysterious

34
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:44,480
worldwide spider butt stuff, go ahead and do Wolf a favor.

35
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,800
Follow at Scott Dorward on Twitter

36
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,120
and check out his various projects,

37
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,880
be they podcast or publication based.

38
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,360
And maybe fill up on hugs when you feel strife.

39
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,240
It's Grady Philip Drug with Real Life.

40
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:06,240
Life, surreal, in retrospect a dream.

41
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:12,880
Easy times, feel less than serene.

42
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:18,880
In the moment it's hard to count your blessings

43
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:23,880
so we long for days gone past us.

44
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:29,880
Grief and strife, bloody, that's Real Life.

45
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,440
All right, let's get gory and vory, baby.

46
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,080
So the rest of you upstairs,

47
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,840
having heard the orifice of the Earth,

48
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,480
having heard the orifice demanding Rothstein

49
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,160
and having lost Rothstein and his panic through the house,

50
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,640
what are you actually doing?

51
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,920
We gotta go.

52
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,720
And Frederick Mellon runs downstairs, takes off running.

53
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,360
This is the only room that we saw from the outside

54
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,120
with a light on in it.

55
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:08,000
There were other lights dotted throughout the house, yeah.

56
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,100
I guess I mean upstairs.

57
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,280
No, this was the only one upstairs.

58
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,440
Freddie, wait, what if the brain's in here too?

59
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,960
Do we wanna kill it before we get like the kids?

60
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,520
I don't, I really don't know.

61
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,560
It just might be good information to have

62
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,960
where this thing's like neurological center is.

63
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,040
Yeah, I mean it can hear us clearly talking about it.

64
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,920
Oh yeah, I mean.

65
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,180
Oh yeah, sure.

66
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,700
Well, it seems to be in a lot of pain.

67
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,280
All it wants is Rothstein right now.

68
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,400
It's probably not gonna answer our questions.

69
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,040
I wanna look around and see if I can spot anything hidden

70
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,420
that looks like some ganglia or neurons

71
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,960
or you know, gray matter up on the ceilings.

72
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,160
Oh, maybe that's why this room looks different color-wise.

73
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,980
Hmm, this is the kind of thing

74
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:51,700
where you should probably consult a medical doctor.

75
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,120
Thomas Dolan, what do you know about this?

76
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,120
I was really, I keep forgetting

77
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,720
that they're not the same kind of doctor

78
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,760
and I was really freaked out

79
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,640
that our medical doctor had just run off, but.

80
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,920
No, he's just a, you know, he's just a psychic.

81
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,160
Doctor, Dr. Coombs, what do you think?

82
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,680
Yeah, it's obviously,

83
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,880
is this a first aid roll or a medicine roll?

84
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,200
Let's say either medicine or biology.

85
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,040
Medicine.

86
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,360
That's a pass, a 58 on a 70.

87
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,120
Okay, you don't see anything in the room here

88
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,400
that looks like gray matter,

89
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,960
but yeah, you're fairly certain that

90
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:38,000
what's inside this room is maybe,

91
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
well, maybe working as lungs or something like lungs.

92
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,740
We seem to be in the respiratory system here.

93
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:50,360
This is all for the breathing of the apparatus here.

94
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,680
The lung and tongue room.

95
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,440
Lung and tongue, yeah.

96
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,800
Maybe the brains are in the attic.

97
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,520
Who said that?

98
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,240
But that is a good point.

99
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,880
Let's have listen rolls off the three of you

100
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,180
who are upstairs.

101
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,720
Just on the off chance you hear something useful.

102
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,000
43 on a 50.

103
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,680
I rolled the worst of the worst, a hundred.

104
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,520
Oh.

105
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,360
I also failed.

106
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,280
Okay, Dr. Coombs is fairly certain

107
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:26,400
that he has heard from deeper within the house

108
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,820
the sound of a slow, steady heartbeat.

109
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:33,920
And you may be able to identify what that is.

110
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,100
What Freddy has heard, however,

111
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:42,100
is the fairly distinctive crunch or cracking sound,

112
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:46,620
despairing scream and loud splash

113
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:49,660
of someone falling through the floor in the kitchen.

114
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:52,660
Heh heh heh heh heh heh.

115
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,980
I'm no medical doctor,

116
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:59,060
but I think I just heard someone fall through

117
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,140
that same hole that I fell through earlier.

118
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:03,500
Carl must have forgotten about the lull.

119
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,580
We should go down there.

120
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,420
There were stairs.

121
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:07,420
There were stairs down there.

122
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,060
Maybe they lead to wherever that hole leads.

123
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,300
You're right, we should go down the stairs.

124
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:14,740
Do we wanna be in the digestive area of the home?

125
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:15,860
What if, wait, real quick,

126
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,620
while we're in this room with the mouth,

127
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:20,260
what if we, I just wanna loudly say,

128
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:24,380
a monster house, we don't have Rothstein.

129
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:26,660
He just fell into your belly.

130
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:29,620
Do not digest him, please.

131
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,580
Or we can't give you what you want.

132
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:36,380
As you say that, it takes another deep breath in.

133
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:38,500
And it says something else.

134
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:44,500
So hungry.

135
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:48,300
And as it says that, its tongue starts coming

136
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,300
out of its mouth and moving towards you

137
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,300
like a huge fat worm.

138
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,900
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

139
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:56,540
Out the door, out the door, out the door.

140
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,940
So you are turning and running.

141
00:06:58,940 --> 00:06:59,780
Yes.

142
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,060
Yeah. Yep, yep.

143
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:01,900
Yep.

144
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:06,900
Ooh, what's this?

145
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,620
The tongue is the part you talk with,

146
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,860
so let's stay around and try to talk with it.

147
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,020
Yeah, I'm hauling ass for sure.

148
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:21,340
Okay, and where are you hauling your ass to?

149
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,380
Ah, it's fucking safe call.

150
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,460
I guess we got a fucking safe call, yeah.

151
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,940
Okay, so speaking of cowl,

152
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:33,940
so you have tumbled down into the darkness below.

153
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:37,340
There is pretty much no light down here.

154
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:40,020
There is a faint, just a faint bit of light

155
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:43,140
coming up through the hole in the ceiling above you.

156
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:47,140
The good news is the landing didn't hurt.

157
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:49,340
The bad news is that's because you have fallen

158
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:53,180
into what feels like several feet of liquid.

159
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:56,060
I mean, you've fallen below the surface

160
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:59,620
and you're going to have to come back up before,

161
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,860
obviously before you can breathe.

162
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:06,100
What I guess I would like is a constitution roll

163
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:09,140
just to see whether you can avoid gasping

164
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:11,780
or doing anything unfortunate under the water.

165
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:12,620
Oh.

166
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,060
Sorry, I said water, it's really not water.

167
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,380
Yeah, it's not water.

168
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,020
I got a 60 on a 40.

169
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:26,020
Oh.

170
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:30,540
Okay, yeah, I mean, obviously this is a huge shock.

171
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:34,780
I mean, you've not managed to get your way up

172
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:35,620
to the surface.

173
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:38,740
There's something bumping around overhead.

174
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:42,580
You're desperately trying not to take a mouthful

175
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:43,980
of whatever this is.

176
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:47,180
You can try to push the roll if you want,

177
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:50,900
just, yeah, but if you fail,

178
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:54,380
you are absolutely taking a lung full of this.

179
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:57,180
It's a 40 on a 40.

180
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,020
Hell yeah.

181
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:58,860
Fantastic.

182
00:08:58,860 --> 00:08:59,700
Oh, that rolls.

183
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:03,180
Okay, so you managed to push your way up to the surface

184
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:07,660
and you take a deep gasping breath of this foul air.

185
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:13,820
But yeah, you didn't inhale any of this,

186
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:18,820
which you realize is probably a really, really good thing

187
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,780
now that you're above the surface.

188
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:22,780
Because now that you're getting your bearings,

189
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:26,860
you can pick up a few things, even though in the darkness.

190
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:29,860
One, and possibly the most important,

191
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:33,860
this liquid that you're in is caustic.

192
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:36,180
It is burning your skin.

193
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,620
It hurts.

194
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:38,940
It really hurts.

195
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,420
It's stinging your eyes.

196
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,380
You can barely see.

197
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,500
Your eyes are filled with tears

198
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,340
and yeah, you can feel your skin burning.

199
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:50,380
You also notice that there are other things

200
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,220
in the liquid.

201
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,340
The thing that was stopping you getting up

202
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:57,060
was maybe an old packing crate that was floating along.

203
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:01,260
There's masses of organic matter of some kind

204
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,300
that's just floating there.

205
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:06,620
Some of these solid lumps of something.

206
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:11,460
And there are also other more solid things

207
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:15,900
that every now and then you feel wriggling under the surface.

208
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,660
Let's have a sanity roll.

209
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,500
Yeah.

210
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,540
I fail.

211
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,780
Okay, let's have another d6 sand loss.

212
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,540
Three.

213
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:30,180
Okay, how much sand have you lost in total?

214
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,140
Prior to this, I've lost eight.

215
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:34,660
Okay, so you've lost 11 total

216
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:37,340
and how much sand do you start with?

217
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,900
40, so 29.

218
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:43,100
Okay, so you are now indefinitely insane as well.

219
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:49,140
So yeah, your grip on what is real and what isn't

220
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:54,820
down there in the darkness is just falling apart fast.

221
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:59,180
I mean, you can hear the sound of this girl sobbing,

222
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:01,380
but you're not quite sure where it's coming from

223
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,900
and every now and then you're certain

224
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:07,340
you can hear other voices crying out down there.

225
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:10,860
These things that are wriggling around under the surface,

226
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:13,940
some of them, yeah, after your experiences

227
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:17,020
with these things that can phase through matter,

228
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,500
yeah, you're certain some of them

229
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,860
are just wriggling inside you.

230
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:28,300
Yeah, and some of the things down there,

231
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:31,420
they feel almost like hands grasping at you,

232
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:34,140
trying to hold you down, pull you under the surface.

233
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,060
Jesus Christ.

234
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:45,020
Okay, so Carl's not doing very good.

235
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:50,020
If I can try to think about grabbing onto that

236
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:53,980
floating thing and trying to hoist myself up onto it.

237
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,820
Sure, then give me a dexterity roll

238
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:58,420
to see whether you can pull yourself on top.

239
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:01,500
44 on a 50, so that's a pass.

240
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,900
Okay, that's good.

241
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,620
Then yeah, you've managed to pull yourself on top.

242
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,460
I mean, the top of it is slippery

243
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:10,900
and the weight inside is unbalanced.

244
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,140
You're pretty much almost pushing it

245
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,540
completely under the surface now

246
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:16,660
with your body weight displacing it,

247
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:21,660
but yeah, you are largely out of the caustic liquid.

248
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,860
You can take two hit points of damage though,

249
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:26,540
just for the burns you've taken so far.

250
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:27,380
Okay.

251
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:31,420
And the rest of you, as you race down to the kitchen now,

252
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,900
yeah, you can see that hole in the kitchen floor

253
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:37,100
is now larger and there is definitely the sound

254
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:40,580
of something large splashing around

255
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,700
down in the liquid below.

256
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:48,140
Can I try to paddle my boat over to a wall of this area?

257
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:53,260
Yeah, well, let's see whether you end up,

258
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:56,700
because you're operating on completely faulty

259
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,220
sensory data at the moment, you're completely lost.

260
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,620
Let's just have a luck roll to see

261
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,380
whether you end up anywhere useful.

262
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,660
No, absolutely not.

263
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:11,700
Okay, so yeah, you're definitely moving.

264
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,620
Okay.

265
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:18,380
And I'm just gonna try to like use my foot as a paddle

266
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:21,060
so I don't get more on my hands.

267
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,700
So I'm just spinning around in a circle.

268
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:28,700
With the skin on your ankle just getting eaten away.

269
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,060
You can't look up and see any light.

270
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,180
Yeah, is there any light coming in

271
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:40,460
from the hole I fell into?

272
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,660
The hole isn't above me?

273
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,860
Yeah, not anymore.

274
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,300
It was when you fell in,

275
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:47,180
but obviously you've moved around a bit since then.

276
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:50,140
Okay, so it's big enough to like have lost

277
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,540
the whole, this room is?

278
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,060
Yeah, you sort of become aware

279
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:56,020
that it's not just like one big room,

280
00:13:56,020 --> 00:14:00,540
that it's sort of like a network of smaller rooms.

281
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,820
All right, let's save the doctor, yes.

282
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:07,780
He's right here, what are you talking about?

283
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:08,820
He's fine, look at him.

284
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:09,740
The other doctor.

285
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,260
Oh, that's right.

286
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,820
Doctor number two.

287
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:14,900
I'm about to be.

288
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:18,660
Alley-oop.

289
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:27,500
All right, so that room's still real slick,

290
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,140
so should we like crawl along the floor

291
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,940
to look through the hole to see?

292
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,820
We don't wanna trust the ground there though, right?

293
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:36,500
Like, I mean, it just gave way under your weight, right?

294
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,020
That's a good point, maybe we just go down the stairs.

295
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,780
I think we should try the thing

296
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,700
that's made to be walked down first, yeah.

297
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:45,420
We've also still got the part of the hose that didn't tear.

298
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,380
Carl.

299
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:51,300
So yeah, from somewhere that you can't quite make out,

300
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:54,460
just echoing through these walls all around you,

301
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:58,580
you can hear the sound of your voice being called

302
00:14:58,580 --> 00:14:59,740
from up above.

303
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,100
Help!

304
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:05,300
I just do it once and then I listen.

305
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:09,780
Almost in answer to that, you can hear another voice,

306
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:13,180
the voice of a little girl from somewhere down there

307
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:16,500
as well going, help, help, help.

308
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,540
There's a little girl down here.

309
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:21,740
That's not my voice, but help me.

310
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,740
Try it in your voice.

311
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,300
I need your help.

312
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,340
Because?

313
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,180
Keep going.

314
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,500
This is a little girl.

315
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,140
All right, we're coming.

316
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,580
Thank you.

317
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,140
That could be Esther, right?

318
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:47,300
That could be one of the kids we're looking for.

319
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,140
Delphinally.

320
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,500
It'd be weird if it wasn't.

321
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,740
So yeah, let's make our way down those stairs

322
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,900
and see just what we see.

323
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,620
Real quick, I don't know if it would be weird

324
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,980
that the people who are kidnapping kids

325
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:02,660
to put bugs in them, alien bugs, to steal their potential.

326
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:03,820
I don't know if it would be weird

327
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:06,220
if they had other kids that we don't know about.

328
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:11,100
You're like, it would be weird if it wasn't Esther,

329
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,260
but I think it would actually really follow.

330
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,700
Anyway.

331
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,540
I agree.

332
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:23,220
But yeah, the stairs down to the cellar,

333
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,660
you can see are covered in the same kind

334
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:28,660
of slick intestinal teeth.

335
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:32,140
Good thing we put these nails in our shoes, right, guys?

336
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,780
Yeah, that was smart, but if we found a sled.

337
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:38,580
Then how would that help us getting back up the stairs?

338
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,660
Tie the hose to the sled.

339
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,500
The hose broke.

340
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,740
The bad hose.

341
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:48,780
Let's go down these stairs with full confidence

342
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:50,260
that we can get back up them.

343
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,500
By the time you go down just a few of them,

344
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,980
you're cut off enough from the light in the kitchen

345
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:58,700
that you're in almost pitch darkness.

346
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:03,540
There is that incredible smell again

347
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:08,540
of just excrement and acid and just foulness.

348
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:13,340
Your eyes are watering from it.

349
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:16,740
And by the time you've made it down

350
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,940
even about a half dozen stairs,

351
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:22,340
you can feel that you are now stepping in liquid

352
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:23,660
and it's getting deeper.

353
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:29,060
I had a friend about 20 years ago, her name was Rose.

354
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:33,460
She survived the Titanic by floating on a door.

355
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,620
She told me all about it.

356
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:37,580
What if we did this?

357
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,140
What if we did the same thing?

358
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,980
Did it fit more than one person?

359
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:44,820
No, but there's a lot of doors in this house.

360
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:49,140
That was actually a really sad part of a story.

361
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,820
I don't want to make you guys cry right now.

362
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,580
But God damn.

363
00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:00,340
I'm already crying because the air is so accurate.

364
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,340
Well, imagine if you had the greatest love story

365
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:05,180
of all time on top of that and it ended in tragedy.

366
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:06,740
That's what happened on a whole door.

367
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:08,340
So let's get three doors.

368
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:16,540
I was talking about sleds earlier, we got some doors now.

369
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,620
You're talking about sleds to get down these stairs.

370
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:23,460
I wasn't saying that it was my idea to float on doors.

371
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,020
I was just saying that we could potentially

372
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,220
sled down the stairs.

373
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:29,740
And then have sled door boats.

374
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:31,980
Sled your boats.

375
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:36,180
I love the idea that you're having this conversation

376
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:39,660
on the stairs while Rothstein floating around in the muck,

377
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:43,140
lost in a blind panic, is just overhearing little shreds

378
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:45,060
of you talking about doors.

379
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:48,380
And love stories.

380
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:49,420
And Titanic, yeah.

381
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:53,380
You brought that screwdriver.

382
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:56,060
We can bust off a hinge or two real quick, right?

383
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,580
Real quick, squeezy.

384
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,900
Well, I think because time is a little bit

385
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:02,700
of the essence here because Rothstein is slowly

386
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,740
getting eaten away by this acid.

387
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:07,340
I think with all the kicking around that you've been doing

388
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:09,180
in it, trying to steer yourself, I mean,

389
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,260
Rothstein's got to take another hit point of damage

390
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:13,180
just from acid burns to his legs.

391
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,540
Hey, I'm down to four.

392
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:15,500
Four hit points?

393
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:16,380
Yes.

394
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,500
Well comment, don't worry.

395
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:23,100
Maybe we should just do a one door boat

396
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,020
and we'll try and navigate that one person

397
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,020
through real quick.

398
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:27,540
Not it.

399
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:30,220
I think if you're trying to get a door off in a big hurry,

400
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:32,660
I do want a mechanical repair role for this

401
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:35,060
just simply because time is a factor.

402
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,660
I believe I have that.

403
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,780
Okay, I've got a 40 in mechanical repair.

404
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,300
We'll see what happens.

405
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,660
Nice.

406
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:43,580
85.

407
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:46,340
Yeah, the first door you go up to,

408
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:49,260
the problem is that this fleshy material

409
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,540
is covered off the hinges and you can't quite see

410
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:55,220
where the screws are and yeah,

411
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:59,460
this isn't really going to be a quick job.

412
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:03,340
You could try potentially going for another door

413
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:06,380
and pushing the roll like that, but if you fail,

414
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:09,660
it's going to take way longer than you planned.

415
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:10,780
Dolan, you're a strong guy.

416
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:13,100
Maybe you could just like jump into the door

417
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:14,380
and bust it down.

418
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,260
I try that.

419
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:17,300
Okay.

420
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,660
Do I use size?

421
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,580
Yeah, I'll take other sizes of strength,

422
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,340
whichever you prefer.

423
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:25,620
I'm gonna go size with a 29 on an 80.

424
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:29,900
You do manage to just kick one of the doors off the hinges.

425
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,580
I mean, obviously it gets a bit damaged in the process,

426
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,540
but there's enough of it that you can use it

427
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,340
as a flotation device.

428
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:40,620
All right, I'll take the door.

429
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:42,940
I'll float on the door.

430
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,140
You're the perfect size for it.

431
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:47,300
Well, I am quite big, but we need the dock.

432
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,780
How big are you, Freddie?

433
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:52,100
I'm smaller than you.

434
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:55,020
Look at us standing here.

435
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,260
You're right, I can tell in an instant that I'm about,

436
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:59,820
you know, if you had to put us on a scale between

437
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:03,300
zero and a hundred, I'd be about an 80.

438
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,420
Yeah, I'd be somewhere around 60,

439
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:07,300
probably 20 less than you.

440
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,180
I reckon I'd be about a 60 also.

441
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,780
Me and Freddie look about the same.

442
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:11,620
Yeah, we're about the same.

443
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:13,340
We're like three quarters of your size.

444
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:15,060
Unfortunately, we need the doctor.

445
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:16,980
So maybe you should go on the door, Freddie.

446
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:17,940
All right, that's fine.

447
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:20,580
And he puts the door at the top of the stairs

448
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:24,460
and sits down on it and says, Rosebud.

449
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:28,140
I don't think we get that reference yet.

450
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:35,380
Now, I do want to say now with Dr. Rothstein down there

451
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:38,260
floating on his crate in the dark and the others,

452
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:40,620
you've heard the other's voices, they've come down,

453
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:41,740
they've gone back up.

454
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:44,700
They're having conversations up above.

455
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,900
You can hear little snippets every now and then.

456
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:50,980
They're talking about doors and boats and stuff like that.

457
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,820
And then they come back down,

458
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:56,460
but they just seem to be leaving you down here

459
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,700
and in the dark on your own.

460
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:02,060
And this acid is just eating you away.

461
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:05,100
Carl thinks it's time to take matters into his own hands

462
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:08,900
and really focuses on trying to get to a wall.

463
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:12,340
I think if you're trying to then just focus your mind

464
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:15,420
like that, that's going to be a sanity role

465
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:17,380
just to see whether you can gather your wits

466
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:18,740
because at the moment, yeah,

467
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:21,620
and just everything is overwhelming you.

468
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,780
I'm pretty overwhelmed still.

469
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:26,940
Yeah, that's not good.

470
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:29,380
Then you'd lose another point of sanity as well.

471
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:34,980
Just in your mind, there's something about this.

472
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:37,460
I mean, you've seen the way space gets warped

473
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:41,740
by the Hawke's Device and the way that it's torn through

474
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:46,300
to other realms and what if there aren't any walls down here?

475
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:50,980
What if you've seen how all that's leaked out

476
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:52,100
from the Hawke's Device,

477
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:56,660
how it's brought other parts of this realm here.

478
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:58,460
What if you're not in the cellar anymore?

479
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:01,660
What if you're somewhere else just floating away

480
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:05,180
further and further away from everything that you know,

481
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:07,580
everything that's real, just getting lost?

482
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:11,660
Don't fucking listen to him, Luke.

483
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:20,260
No, I don't think I'll think that.

484
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:31,900
Oh shit, dude.

485
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:36,140
Yeah, Carl just continues in a circle.

486
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,820
While spiraling in his mind.

487
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:45,900
Yeah, in my just like, in fact,

488
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:50,900
I just sit down on the raft like with my head in my hands.

489
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,300
Actually, that's not a bad strategy

490
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:56,100
because at least it's got your leg out of the acid now.

491
00:23:56,100 --> 00:24:01,100
I didn't realize you were doing it to yourself.

492
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:15,900
So meanwhile, we have Freddy riding a door to victory.

493
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:19,740
You've got the door, you've got it down the stairs.

494
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:23,860
You can use it as a fairly unsteady raft.

495
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:26,700
I'm probably going to ask for a Dex roll at some stage.

496
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:27,540
Perfect.

497
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:31,180
You can hear things moving around in the water.

498
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:35,340
You know, some big things, some small things.

499
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:39,140
You can hear the sound of the young girl crying.

500
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:40,580
And now that you're down here

501
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:44,180
and you've got a better ear for what's going on,

502
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:47,180
you are 99% sure that the voice you can hear

503
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,460
is that of Esther Frain.

504
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:51,220
Esther, Esther, we're coming for you.

505
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,540
We can help.

506
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:55,180
Karl, Karl, we're here.

507
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:56,100
I'm here.

508
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,860
We're going to get you back out of here.

509
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:58,700
Hello?

510
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:05,540
Nevermind, just Esther.

511
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,900
I'm only here for Esther.

512
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:11,900
Oh, hi.

513
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:14,700
I'm here.

514
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,740
Yeah, you sound like you're losing your mind.

515
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,780
Well, it also sounds like he is somewhere

516
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:20,380
completely different in the cellars

517
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:22,900
and where Esther's voice is coming from.

518
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:25,780
So who are you heading towards?

519
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:27,260
Who's closer?

520
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:28,660
I mean, it's difficult to tell.

521
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:31,900
I mean, you're judging this entirely on sound.

522
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:35,060
Rothstein's voice is a bit muffled

523
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:38,260
because he's obviously not in the same room as you.

524
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:40,540
Esther's voice is quiet, but then again,

525
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:45,020
she's a little girl and you don't have any visual cues

526
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:46,660
to really get your bearings.

527
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:48,540
Yeah, I'm going after Karl.

528
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:50,380
Okay.

529
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,220
First.

530
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:57,580
Then, okay, you splash your way through this noxious,

531
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,940
really acidic liquid.

532
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:03,780
I mean, by the time you catch up with Karl,

533
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:07,740
you are going to take one hit point's worth of damage

534
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,620
from chemical burns.

535
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:10,860
You are covered with this

536
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:15,340
and as some of the liquid splashes up over the doors,

537
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:19,300
every now and then you can feel things wriggling in it.

538
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,060
That's unsettling.

539
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:26,660
Well, then I guess you better make a sand roll.

540
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,740
12 on a 63.

541
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,980
Okay, you don't lose any sand.

542
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,300
Nice.

543
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,140
He's focused.

544
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:41,940
Frederick Millen I is nothing if not focused

545
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:45,020
and he is going toward Karl Rothstein.

546
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:47,060
He thinks two heads are better than one

547
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:49,660
for continuing our journey

548
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:54,540
and collecting as many children as possible

549
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:57,620
to save them specifically.

550
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:01,100
You splash your way through the liquid

551
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:05,700
and eventually navigating around a couple of open doorways.

552
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:10,500
You do eventually find this little sort of cul-de-sac where...

553
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:14,420
Can I like make marks with my spade from the tool shed

554
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:18,300
on all the doorways that I'm crossing through

555
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,140
on the hallways?

556
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:24,140
I'm trying to make marks in the membrane to mark my path.

557
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:25,980
Sure, okay.

558
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:28,380
I mean, obviously you're navigating by touch,

559
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:31,220
but you can try to feel for these.

560
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,500
Oh, right, because it's pitch black.

561
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,980
It is pitch black.

562
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:35,460
But I mean, you can leave marks

563
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,780
that you can try to feel again.

564
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,580
Deep wounding gouges.

565
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:40,420
Exactly.

566
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:46,260
But yeah, yeah, you do eventually find Karl

567
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:51,660
down this little cul-de-sac.

568
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:52,780
Karl, thank God.

569
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:54,860
Who is it?

570
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:57,900
Oh yeah, he couldn't recognize me from my voice.

571
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:58,740
That makes sense.

572
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,420
It's Frederick Millen, the voice.

573
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:05,300
Oh, I get my lighter out and flick it

574
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:07,540
so that we can see each other.

575
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:10,780
And he is just a wide-eyed, huge smile.

576
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:14,860
You can see that, yeah, Rothstein in the light,

577
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:19,860
yeah, his skin is just red with burns and blisters.

578
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:23,220
His eyes are swollen up.

579
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:25,140
We gotta get you to the real Dr. Asap.

580
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:28,580
You swear you can see things wriggling in his wet hair.

581
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:32,260
Maybe just run a comb through those locks real quick.

582
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:34,300
Just like shake it out.

583
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,740
I run my hand through my hair

584
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:39,300
and some of it just falls out into my hand.

585
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,140
Yep.

586
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:43,220
We gotta go.

587
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:47,180
And so he'll put his heels on your raft.

588
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:51,900
Lock your legs with mine, put your legs on my raft.

589
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:56,700
That way we both got heels on the other one's raft.

590
00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:00,540
I continue sitting down, just looking up at you.

591
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:02,360
Karl, Karl.

592
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,180
Whatever.

593
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:06,440
Karl, you fucking idiot, we don't have much time.

594
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,880
You put your fucking heels on this raft right now.

595
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,200
We got children to save.

596
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,040
We're here.

597
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,880
You hear me?

598
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,400
If you've given up, if you've given, look at me.

599
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,720
See, I am here forever.

600
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,320
That's on you, but there are other people down here

601
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:20,640
who have not given up and we are going to save them.

602
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,480
You hear me?

603
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,400
We are going to save them.

604
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:26,680
Okay, you lead the way then.

605
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,080
And I just keep sitting.

606
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,960
I'm gonna give you until the next room to start helping.

607
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:38,960
So is Rothstein attempting to follow Freddie or?

608
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:47,960
I thought that, are you staying on my raft or taking yours?

609
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:48,800
No, no, no.

610
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,320
I've still got my heels on your raft.

611
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:54,320
So I'm trying to like, I'm trying to paddle backwards

612
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,480
and drag you along with me, I guess.

613
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,920
But I'm literally only giving you one more room

614
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:01,920
and then I'm leaving you.

615
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,120
Well, then I think, you know,

616
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,160
particularly as you're not getting any help

617
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:11,080
from Rothstein here and you're trying to pull both of these,

618
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:14,560
I do want to roll just to see whether you can do this

619
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,800
without upsetting your raft.

620
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:20,400
And I think actually, because this is a feat of strength,

621
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,360
let's do this as a strength roll.

622
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,920
Yeah, that's worse.

623
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:28,640
It's also Robin at Men in Tights style strength of feet.

624
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,480
Oh.

625
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:38,320
Okay, so I rolled a 52 on a 40.

626
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,120
So I am going to spend 12 luck.

627
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,520
Oh, okay.

628
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,240
Rather than pushing this roll.

629
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,160
Nice.

630
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,800
So yeah, I mean, your feet almost slip off.

631
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,000
I mean, this is really slick.

632
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,280
And yeah, in the little bit of light

633
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:58,080
that you've seen from Rothstein's Zippo.

634
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,200
Yeah, I mean, this is absolutely smeared

635
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,520
with what is undeniably shit.

636
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,520
Awesome.

637
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,680
And you've been feeling your way through.

638
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,800
Rothstein, you don't happen to have like a snack on you

639
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,360
or anything, I'm kind of hungry.

640
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,280
They are just snacks in here.

641
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,360
Oh, fuck.

642
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,640
Once we get to the next room,

643
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:34,400
I kind of snap out of it and I look at Frederick.

644
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,360
But what do you want me to do?

645
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,440
I've got an idea.

646
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,800
You asked me a question and proposed your own,

647
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,800
like you're about to keep talking.

648
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:48,240
We don't have time to discuss how to talk.

649
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,320
And that's a statement.

650
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,800
So what's happening?

651
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:58,000
If we kick the stomach, maybe it will throw us up.

652
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,280
Okay, let's go get Esther.

653
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,880
She would get thrown up too, saved us time.

654
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,560
Let's make sure she's with us when that happens.

655
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:10,120
I stand up and start helping,

656
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,800
but as soon as we get close to a wall,

657
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,000
I'm gonna start kicking it.

658
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,960
But I don't tell him that.

659
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,200
When you say stand up, you mean in the liquid, do you?

660
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:23,200
Because it's not really feasible to stand up on the raft.

661
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:26,960
Then I just paddle with my leg or whatever,

662
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,640
but don't stand up.

663
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,200
Thank you for finally helping.

664
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,040
Okay, now let's go.

665
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:37,040
Let's, I mean, you're trying to get to the sound

666
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,760
of Esther's crying as quickly as possible.

667
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:45,760
Let's again, I think do this as a strength roll.

668
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:51,440
So one of you can make this whichever one of you wants.

669
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,000
What's your strength?

670
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,440
I'm pretty weak.

671
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,480
I'll do it.

672
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,960
Okay.

673
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,400
Because I mean, you'll get there either way,

674
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,600
but it's just a question of how much damage

675
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:05,440
you're going to take on the way from the acid.

676
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,960
How long it all takes.

677
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,360
47 on a 50.

678
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,440
Ooh.

679
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:17,080
So yeah, you each take one hit point of damage

680
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,920
from the acid as you make your way across.

681
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:20,760
Ouchie.

682
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,360
I'm down to three.

683
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:25,040
The skin is like completely gone from my foot.

684
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:29,400
You can feel you're not quite getting the full range

685
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:32,680
of mobility that you used to get in that foot now.

686
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:36,800
And it's probably best not to try to think too hard

687
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,320
about why that is.

688
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,480
But yeah, you make your way over.

689
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:51,160
Are you still using Rothstein's lighter for light

690
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,400
or are you just checking that on when you need it?

691
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,560
I'm keeping it on.

692
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,480
Okay.

693
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,480
So you keep it on.

694
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,600
And yeah, as you get over,

695
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:02,320
you can see over in the far corner,

696
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:07,560
what seems to have been done is someone has built,

697
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:10,840
it looks almost like a jail cell there.

698
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,360
There are metal bars that reach all the way

699
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,640
up to the ceiling.

700
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:18,760
I mean, obviously the liquid is as high in there.

701
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:23,760
You can see that Esther is there on top

702
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:29,200
of a crate that she's sitting on top,

703
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,440
just huddled, looking panicked again.

704
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,000
She's quite badly burnt.

705
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:39,000
There is also a shape floating in the liquid beside her,

706
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:44,520
which yeah, it takes a little while to identify it

707
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,320
even as being human,

708
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,800
but there isn't really that much left of it.

709
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,640
Esther!

710
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,600
Can you get me out of here?

711
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,440
Can you get me out of here?

712
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,880
Yes, Frederick says confidently

713
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,480
and begins paddling quicker and quicker

714
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,680
to get to the metal bars.

715
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:08,680
Yeah, you get up to the bars and yeah, there's a door.

716
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,960
Now that you're closer in the light,

717
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:16,960
you can see the figure that's floating face down maybe.

718
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,680
I mean, it's difficult to tell anymore.

719
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:24,760
It has got the remains of curly red hair on its head.

720
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:27,720
Yeah, we didn't make it in time.

721
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:28,800
Don't look down, Esther.

722
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,640
Just look at us.

723
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,480
We're here to save you.

724
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:35,080
It's me, Frederick Mellon the first, your favorite,

725
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:39,120
and Karl Rothstein, your fifth favorite.

726
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:44,120
After the dead person in the water.

727
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,960
After the dead person in the water.

728
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,120
Nathaniel Coombs and Thomas Tullock.

729
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:57,640
And yeah, I mean, you make it to the door

730
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,600
and that's the point at which you realize

731
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,640
that the door is locked.

732
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:02,480
Well, perfect.

733
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,680
I'm the man for the job.

734
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:04,520
It's a good thing I'm the one

735
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,040
who came down here on this door.

736
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:09,520
And that the lock is not visible

737
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,560
above the surface of this liquid.

738
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:15,720
Oh, I spoke too soon.

739
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,560
I mean, I'm still the man for the job,

740
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,680
but I wish I wouldn't.

741
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,600
I've been in the water.

742
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:29,240
It's be careful.

743
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,360
All right.

744
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:34,400
You know, I'm doing it.

745
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,280
Like he's not gonna not do it at this point.

746
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,120
He's gonna just go for it.

747
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:42,400
Yeah, you reckon that the lock is at least a foot

748
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,000
below the surface of this liquid

749
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,240
and that the only way you're going to get an angle on it

750
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,120
is going to be to get off your raft

751
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,560
and basically stand there up to your neck in this liquid

752
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,720
and try to do it.

753
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,920
How do you get a door off?

754
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,760
What?

755
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,720
How do you sexually pleasure a door?

756
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:03,960
How?

757
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,600
Because he said the only way to do it is to get it off.

758
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,400
Get it?

759
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,240
Do you get it?

760
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:18,200
So, what is your plan?

761
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,280
Are you trying to pick the lock?

762
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,000
Are you trying to go for the hinges?

763
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:22,920
What are you doing?

764
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:27,320
Frederick Millen I knows the best way to break into things.

765
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,160
So can I make an intelligence roll

766
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,880
to see which would be easier for me?

767
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,560
You don't need to make an intelligence roll.

768
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,960
I'll tell you that if you're going to pick the lock,

769
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,640
that's going to be a locksmith's roll.

770
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:40,640
If you're going to try to get the hinges,

771
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,720
you don't necessarily have the right equipment.

772
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,200
So that's going to be a hard mechanical repair roll.

773
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,560
Well, I'll tell you what,

774
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:51,560
between having a 70% chance and a 10% chance,

775
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:58,720
I will go with the 70%.

776
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:03,720
Okay, so can I lay down belly first on my door

777
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:09,400
and then put my hands like armpit deep into the wet?

778
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,600
It's far enough down that if you would try

779
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,800
to reach down that low,

780
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,840
you'd be putting your face in this liquid.

781
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:23,360
All right, then he does that first.

782
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:26,520
Could try to feel around, doesn't quite get in there.

783
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:29,400
And then he's like, ah, fuck, ah.

784
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,400
It's more like putting your face in battery acid.

785
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,240
Yeah.

786
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:36,080
He's not going to actually,

787
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,400
he's just feeling for the lock.

788
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,480
When his nose is about to touch it,

789
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,880
he's like, oh no, okay, I got to get in.

790
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,680
I understand now, right?

791
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:49,680
I'm with you, Scott.

792
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,440
You said, I'm going to do that first.

793
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,920
I was like, you're going to dip your face in the acid first?

794
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,000
So it's more like.

795
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,640
It's like dunking for apples,

796
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,440
except the apples are turds.

797
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,520
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

798
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,000
Yeah.

799
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:13,760
Okay.

800
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,320
So yeah, go face first.

801
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:19,600
Well, Frederick Mellon is not, no Lou Reed.

802
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:23,120
So I'm going to go ahead and get off the door.

803
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,320
Okay.

804
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,240
What was it Thomas?

805
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,520
How do I get off the door?

806
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,280
That's what you got to figure out.

807
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,000
Oh, you jiggle it snob.

808
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,360
Oh, damn it.

809
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:38,800
God damn it.

810
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:46,920
Thank you.

811
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:50,360
That's been pretending to be people with Scott Dorver.

812
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,960
All right, I'm going feet first.

813
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,920
So yeah, you slide off and yeah,

814
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:01,840
you can, I mean, you're not that tall,

815
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:05,480
but you can just keep your head above the liquid

816
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,560
as you work.

817
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,840
I mean, you're having to stand on tiptoes to do so,

818
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,840
but you can.

819
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:12,920
Oh, thank God.

820
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,000
I was just really right.

821
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,520
28 on the 70, so hard success.

822
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,680
Oh, that's a hard success, which is good.

823
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,560
So yeah, I mean, there, I mean,

824
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,880
you're fumbling around with your tools,

825
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,480
unable to see working with this acid

826
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,880
just burning into your skin,

827
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:31,240
but eventually you can feel the tumblers

828
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:36,000
click into place and you can pull the door open.

829
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,480
As you do so, the liquid moves

830
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:42,360
and the floating remains of Billy Spitzer

831
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:45,360
just float out past you disintegrating,

832
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:48,480
you know, bits of his body going in different directions.

833
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,320
Fuck.

834
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:54,320
So he's like, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow,

835
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,080
yay, oh no.

836
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,960
Yeah, what I'll say is for the time

837
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,920
that you're in the liquid doing all this,

838
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:04,160
take a D3 hit points of damage.

839
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,000
Okay.

840
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,000
As you are digested.

841
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,520
So I'm down to eight hit points from digestion burns.

842
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,440
But yeah, I mean, Esther is there.

843
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,840
She's still perched on top of this crate precariously.

844
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:22,840
That's just looking, trying very hard

845
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:25,600
not to look at the remains of Billy as they float out.

846
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:28,080
Eyes on me, Esther, eyes on me, okay?

847
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,560
We're gonna get you out of here now.

848
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:32,760
Look at me, can you tell me, does that flake croak?

849
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,680
Oh, fuck, I'm losing my mind.

850
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,120
Does that crate float

851
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,680
or is it just sitting on top of something?

852
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,840
I don't know, Mr. Hut, I don't know.

853
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:44,720
Is there anything around that looks like it floats

854
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,040
that we could put her on the door?

855
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,840
You also don't know yet that a child

856
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,360
will overweight the door.

857
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,920
That's a good point.

858
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:56,000
Jack weighed down rows, that wasn't gonna work.

859
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,160
But those were- He wouldn't have.

860
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,320
I know, he did it dumb.

861
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,160
So if this kid is smart,

862
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,320
you guys should be fine.

863
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,200
Okay, thank you.

864
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,320
That makes me feel better.

865
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:14,320
So Frederick will kind of push forward.

866
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:17,440
Okay, just like gently shift your weight

867
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,400
from off the box onto this door.

868
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,800
Well, I think with you guiding her,

869
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,360
let's have you make a Dex roll

870
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:25,960
just to see whether you can do this without capsizing.

871
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,480
Art seven, I am rocking.

872
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,640
Fantastic, okay.

873
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:32,040
So you can get both her and yourself on the door

874
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,560
without capsizing it.

875
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,640
All right, Carl, let's get the fuck out of here.

876
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,040
I start kicking the wall.

877
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:42,040
You kick the wall and something in your foot goes crunch.

878
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:46,000
It's probably best not to think about that at the moment.

879
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:46,840
Ooh.

880
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:53,760
So you managed to kick your way over to the door.

881
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:54,800
I mean, in the process,

882
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,480
you are going to take another one hit point of damage each.

883
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:58,960
Okay, I'm down to two.

884
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:04,400
Okay, and yeah, you are going to have to help

885
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,440
Dr. Rothstein up the stairs

886
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:09,040
because the foot that he's been kicking

887
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:11,160
with and navigating with,

888
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:14,320
there isn't really much of it left anymore.

889
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:16,000
There's certainly no flesh on it

890
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,080
and a lot of the bones have dissolved away.

891
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:24,160
It's less of a foot now and more of a nub.

892
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:27,320
Oh, God.

893
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:31,840
Jesus, okay, so he'll kind of like,

894
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:34,720
Fredrick is just kind of like taking on both of them,

895
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:37,520
you know, and is Esther strong enough to just?

896
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,080
Yeah, you can help her up the stairs.

897
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:42,880
If they get to the stairs, me and Thomas are there.

898
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,960
I can help grab people.

899
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,960
Fantastic, okay.

900
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:51,400
Well, I mean, Dr. Coons, as he grabs hold of Esther,

901
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:53,280
yeah, you can start helping her up the stairs.

902
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:54,920
You've got hold of her.

903
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:58,000
What you do notice as you're helping her up the stairs

904
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,800
is under your hands,

905
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:05,320
you can feel things moving beneath the surface of her skin.

906
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:10,280
I try and make eye contact with one of the other guys

907
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:12,880
and give kind of a knowing nod.

908
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,320
We'll be able to take care of you.

909
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:17,600
This is going to be okay.

910
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:18,920
Where's Billy?

911
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:19,760
Did you get Billy?

912
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,720
He was shaking my head like.

913
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:24,200
Ixnay on the, Billy Bae.

914
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:26,080
What do you mean, what?

915
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:29,640
Don't, no, no, just help her.

916
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:30,560
You went down there.

917
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:33,480
I punched the dog in the side of the arm.

918
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,920
Esther seems to be pretty much in a fugue state

919
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,240
at this moment.

920
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:41,320
And by the time you get everyone back up to the kitchen,

921
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:44,160
there's now enough light that, yeah,

922
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:47,800
you can see that there are things now moving around

923
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,240
underneath her skin.

924
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:53,960
You can also see that this is also very much true

925
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:56,920
of Dr. Rothstein and Freddy.

926
00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:01,480
Oh, no, guys, I don't know what to say.

927
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:04,760
Clearly you've got things moving under your skin,

928
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:06,040
probably those bugs.

929
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,960
What if we try to force up them out of you?

930
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:12,720
Do you consent to that?

931
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,520
The things you can see moving around

932
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:16,920
are much, much smaller than that.

933
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:22,480
In fact, what Thomas thinks of very much

934
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,160
is the thing that he saw crawling out

935
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,880
of the man's eye outside.

936
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:32,360
Doc, do we just shove them down the stairs?

937
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,360
And hope they get digested?

938
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:44,880
I can't, I swore on oath.

939
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:49,880
I don't know, but we can't let that get into the camp.

940
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:53,840
All right, you guys ready to go?

941
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:54,920
One second.

942
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:00,120
I need to get to a hospital.

943
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:01,480
I'm as good as a hospital.

944
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:04,800
You're okay in my hands.

945
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:09,400
But they have with medicine, I'm in pain.

946
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:10,960
And then I point at my foot.

947
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:11,840
Oh.

948
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:17,600
Yeah, like I say, foot is overstating it.

949
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:26,200
What if we quarantine them?

950
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:29,080
We put them in the lab back there.

951
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:30,280
We can keep them in there.

952
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:31,520
I can run some tests.

953
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:32,680
Quarantine who?

954
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:35,920
Hold on.

955
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:37,600
The little girl?

956
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:39,640
Yeah, yeah.

957
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:40,480
Why?

958
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:43,840
She's got some things moving around under her skin.

959
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:46,880
Oh, that doesn't sound good.

960
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:49,280
Right.

961
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:54,040
I truly support quarantine for that.

962
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:57,560
For anybody who's got things moving around under the skin.

963
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:58,960
Oh my God.

964
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,800
This would be no exercise.

965
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,720
Doc, you know what I just noticed?

966
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:05,120
This is crazy.

967
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:06,640
You've got them too.

968
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:07,640
No, I don't.

969
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,400
No, yeah.

970
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,400
Yeah, they're there.

971
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,800
Maybe we'll start with the little girl as a trial

972
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,000
to see how it goes.

973
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:19,200
Why don't you, okay, yeah.

974
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:22,160
Why don't you be the one in there observing her?

975
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,120
There should be exceptions.

976
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:27,920
So with the idea that we got like a few minutes to end this,

977
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:30,800
what is your plan at this stage?

978
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:33,840
Oh God.

979
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:35,880
I mean, I want to kick him down the stairs

980
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:37,080
and let him get digested.

981
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:42,640
All of them.

982
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
It would be so insanely out of character

983
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,040
for Dr. Coombs to be okay with that.

984
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:51,400
Okay, so it's a contested role

985
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:53,360
where I see if I can kick you down too.

986
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:00,760
Now, let me give another idea here

987
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:04,040
because I think we'll probably want to do some wrap up

988
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:06,080
and talk about the scenario and stuff.

989
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:08,760
So are you cool with doing another session?

990
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:10,480
Sure, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

991
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:11,320
Perfect, cool.

992
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:12,440
That does give you a week to see

993
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:13,800
whether there's anything you might be able to do

994
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,160
about this situation.

995
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:18,800
Yes, maybe sleep on this decision.

996
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:23,960
I'm not saying kicking them down the stairs is a bad idea.

997
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:26,080
I mean, it's probably what I'd do.

998
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:27,840
I think from a role-playing perspective,

999
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:29,000
it's a very smart idea.

1000
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:33,920
The only way I'd differ from that personally

1001
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,640
if I were playing this is I wouldn't kick them

1002
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,200
down the stairs when there's a nice handy hole in the floor

1003
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:40,000
that I could just push them through.

1004
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:44,440
My opinion is if I were you, that's what I would do,

1005
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:46,440
but you shouldn't do it.

1006
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:47,520
Don't do it to me.

1007
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:54,400
You've got a week to find out a convincing way

1008
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,160
to save the girl and yourselves.

1009
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:59,200
No, my first thought was to take you down with me.

1010
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:07,600
We're pretty well fucked.

1011
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:11,080
Not if you guys just stay in this house.

1012
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:14,800
I'm not saying that this always ends in the TPK,

1013
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:19,800
but I have had actual play reports from other groups

1014
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:24,120
that have managed to get into some of the situation than you

1015
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:28,280
and actually managed to contrive a positive outcome.

1016
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:31,120
It's never happened when I've run it because I'm a bastard.

1017
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:33,920
Apparently it does happen sometimes.

1018
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:37,680
That's great.

1019
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:47,840
30 seconds of absolute silence.

1020
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:54,200
You're just waiting for us to talk now, aren't you?

1021
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:55,800
Yeah, yeah.

1022
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:58,320
I knew it was gonna be Thomas that broke, but.

1023
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:01,480
I can see the time in audacity, man.

1024
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:05,480
I'm not numbers blind.

1025
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:06,600
Is there a word for that?

1026
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:07,880
Yeah.

1027
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:11,720
Is it neumlexia, neumslex, neumaslexia?

1028
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:14,160
Is it, well, it'll be the lex part that's different

1029
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:17,680
because lex means kind of letters or.

1030
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:19,000
Letter or word, yeah.

1031
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,480
So dyspneumia or something like that, I guess.

1032
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:23,320
Dyspneumia.

1033
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:25,880
It's always good to start out with a fun fact,

1034
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:27,920
regardless of if we know it or not.

1035
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:28,760
Yeah.

1036
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:31,760
Regardless of if it's a fact.

1037
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:34,120
Hey, listener, Google that.

1038
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:36,840
See, you learned something.

1039
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:39,040
Welcome back to the middle of this episode.

1040
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:43,360
Yeah, and it's been a few weeks since we recorded, so.

1041
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:48,000
It's, sorry to interrupt right while we get things going,

1042
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,280
but it's a dyscalculia.

1043
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:50,120
Dyscalculia.

1044
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:54,120
Aha, okay, that does make sense.

1045
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:57,680
Right, well, now that we've got the rehearsal.

1046
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:58,520
Yeah.

1047
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:05,440
Like a Snapple bottle cup.

1048
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:08,120
That's me.

1049
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:11,200
So yeah, last episode, I think we'd left,

1050
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:12,880
or rather, last recording session,

1051
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:17,360
I think we'd left it so that you'd just recovered Esther

1052
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:19,360
from the flooded cellar.

1053
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:21,920
Yes, the boys floated away in bits.

1054
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:23,920
Yeah, yeah, poor Billy.

1055
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:27,120
But Esther, you did manage to get out in one piece.

1056
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:31,760
The problem is that there are perhaps now too many pieces

1057
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:35,800
that she does seem to be crawling with parasites,

1058
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:38,120
as are some of you.

1059
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:40,720
We left it, I think, with you in the kitchen,

1060
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,920
having just made this discovery

1061
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:45,760
that basically everyone who's been down to the cellar

1062
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,920
is now infested.

1063
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:50,600
So, what now?

1064
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:53,320
Yeah, we were discussing being rightly fucked.

1065
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:54,160
Mm.

1066
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:58,920
I believe there is a look in Thomas Dolan's eyes

1067
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:02,320
that said he wanted to push us down the stairs

1068
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,440
or through the hole in the floor.

1069
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:06,000
Oh yes, yes, yes.

1070
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,280
And, you know, maybe he does that.

1071
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:11,960
Why don't you give me one good reason not to do that?

1072
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:15,520
She's a child, we can't just throw her down there.

1073
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:16,960
That's barbaric.

1074
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:19,280
Regardless of the child, okay?

1075
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:20,960
Look at me, look at me.

1076
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,000
We were up in that room and we talked to this fucking house

1077
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,680
and you know what we had?

1078
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:26,520
A connection.

1079
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:29,600
Not what the house wanted.

1080
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:31,080
What did the house want?

1081
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:34,080
It said a name multiple times.

1082
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:36,200
It wanted to talk to...

1083
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:40,480
And I start tapping Luke Gintman on the head.

1084
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:43,080
Your character name's not- Karl Rothstein.

1085
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:44,960
Karl Rothstein, yeah.

1086
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:46,560
I start tapping him on the head.

1087
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:49,720
Okay, then I push the doctor down the stairs.

1088
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:50,920
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1089
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:53,000
As you like going to do that, I'm like, no, no, no.

1090
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,600
He wanted to talk to him.

1091
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:57,760
The house wanted to talk to Karl Rothstein.

1092
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:58,640
It didn't want to eat him.

1093
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:01,040
It was lamenting the fact that it was so hungry,

1094
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:02,240
in one man's opinion.

1095
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:05,280
I will talk to it.

1096
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:06,840
Hello, hello.

1097
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:09,000
That's what I'm talking about.

1098
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,520
I kind of whispered to Karl Rothstein.

1099
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:13,320
I'm like, anything to keep them from pushing us down

1100
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:15,160
into the digestive acid again, you know?

1101
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:18,480
Yes, that was uncomfortable.

1102
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:20,400
Yeah, let's go talk to the tongue.

1103
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:23,000
Oh, take me away.

1104
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,440
Yeah, let's see what the tongue,

1105
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:27,120
the house tongue has to say.

1106
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:29,240
Doc, you don't think we should just push these fuckers

1107
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:30,880
down the stairs and be done with it?

1108
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:33,120
I mean, I'm a doctor.

1109
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:35,200
I would prefer to save people.

1110
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:37,200
Yeah, the house is starving to death.

1111
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:38,880
You're not going to save the house?

1112
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:41,640
The trolley problem here.

1113
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:44,120
Two assholes or one house, you know?

1114
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:45,320
Which lever are you going to pull?

1115
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:47,480
There's a chance that the house knows how

1116
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:49,200
to be not a house.

1117
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:52,400
Maybe Karl knows something about this house being

1118
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:53,840
a person house.

1119
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:55,320
That's right, the psychic might be able

1120
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:56,720
to help him be person again.

1121
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:58,320
All right, well, we got him right by these stairs.

1122
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:00,000
It just seems like a real good opportunity

1123
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,520
to just shove him down there and get the fuck out of here.

1124
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:04,000
The stairs also go up.

1125
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:09,600
All right, well, can you guys just promise

1126
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:12,040
that if this doesn't work out,

1127
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:14,280
you'll be cool about coming back down

1128
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:16,080
and meeting right here where we are now

1129
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:18,280
and then we push you down this test.

1130
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:19,120
Sure.

1131
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:22,080
We'll be really cool about quarantining

1132
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:25,080
in that stone slab where we saw that big fish.

1133
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:26,160
We could go into the lab.

1134
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:29,200
I'm perfectly fine if you want to put me in the lab

1135
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:30,920
after all this is said and done.

1136
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:34,240
But until then, let's at least try to talk to the house

1137
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:36,360
and see if the house and Karl Rothstein can work out

1138
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:38,200
between the two of them,

1139
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:40,640
how we can make this a better situation

1140
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:43,920
for all the little fishies living inside.

1141
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:44,760
Okay.

1142
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:46,360
My body.

1143
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:49,720
Yes, if you head up stairs again,

1144
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:53,800
obviously you can still feel the warm breath of the house

1145
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:56,320
moving through the corridor.

1146
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:02,200
And as you get back up to the top of the stairs,

1147
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:07,920
yeah, there is still that mouth visible in the wall

1148
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:10,600
through the double doors of the master bedroom.

1149
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:12,160
I don't think we have to be near it

1150
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:14,200
in order to talk to it, personally.

1151
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:18,240
I open the double doors up and walk into that room.

1152
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:20,240
You've, you've wanted to see me?

1153
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:25,200
Yeah, there is this long, long breath that just goes,

1154
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:26,040
Rothstein.

1155
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:32,800
Karl's like trembling.

1156
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:33,640
Save me.

1157
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:41,320
Where are you?

1158
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:46,320
I, I don't know.

1159
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:53,480
This is strange and frightening and I am so very hungry.

1160
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:01,240
Come closer, Rothstein, come closer.

1161
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:04,360
Karl gets a little closer.

1162
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:09,360
Okay, you can see the tongue lolling out of the mouth.

1163
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:14,160
It doesn't seem to be lashing out and trying to grab you,

1164
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:16,080
but at the same time,

1165
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:18,880
it is making tentative little explorations

1166
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:22,520
in your direction, like this monstrous worm

1167
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:25,600
just flapping across the ground.

1168
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:26,440
Foreplay.

1169
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:32,160
Yeah, Karl is just like inching a little closer, like,

1170
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:38,040
uh, um, look, you've got to tell me where you are

1171
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:39,960
so I can find you or help you.

1172
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:43,440
I, I don't know.

1173
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:46,320
I don't know where I am.

1174
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:51,320
I don't know who I am anymore.

1175
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:56,480
Rothstein, I don't know what I am.

1176
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:00,680
It has been so very long.

1177
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:03,760
Well, Karl, it seems like you and this house

1178
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:04,920
have a lot of catching up to do.

1179
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:07,320
So I'm, I'm just gonna split.

1180
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:14,640
I think we've got to find the house.

1181
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:15,920
Austin Hawks.

1182
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:16,880
That's what I said.

1183
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:18,280
We've got to find the Hawks.

1184
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:22,920
When Karl and Frederick both say Austin Hawks in the room,

1185
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:25,840
does the room react to that name?

1186
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,320
Not especially.

1187
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:31,720
Can you describe where you, what's around you?

1188
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:34,400
House, man.

1189
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:42,000
Everything is so strange.

1190
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:47,000
I, I am, I am just so hungry.

1191
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:52,320
He says, as his tongue reaches out towards you.

1192
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:54,800
I slap the tongue.

1193
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:59,760
OK, but you're standing your ground.

1194
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:06,240
Yeah, let's, let's do this then as an opposed fighting brawl

1195
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:09,400
roll, just to see whether you can discourage the tongue

1196
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:11,000
from wrapping itself around you.

1197
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:14,400
Because at the moment, this is a little more tentative

1198
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,680
than his previous attack.

1199
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:19,400
But on the other hand, you know, it's still,

1200
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:21,040
I think it still wants to eat you.

1201
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:24,880
Yeah, I crit, failed.

1202
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:27,880
So what, what did you roll?

1203
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:29,280
A 44.

1204
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:30,200
Oh, that's fine.

1205
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:32,240
Oh, that's not, that's Delta Green.

1206
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:33,160
That's just a failure.

1207
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:34,440
Oh, that's Delta Green.

1208
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:37,840
Yeah. OK, I just failed regularly then.

1209
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:40,240
Yeah, on the other hand, I rolled a 98.

1210
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:44,120
So yeah, you slap at the tongue.

1211
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:47,120
You're not exactly a powerfully built man

1212
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:49,640
and you're a bit worse for wear.

1213
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:52,840
But on the other hand, as this monstrous, flopping,

1214
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:56,080
muscular tongue comes towards you, you slap at it.

1215
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:58,080
And it just instinctively recoils

1216
00:58:58,120 --> 00:59:00,040
and slithers back into the mouth.

1217
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:01,560
Don't get too close to me.

1218
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:03,240
I'm trying to help you.

1219
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:04,840
Maybe ask its name, Doc.

1220
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:06,480
What is your name?

1221
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:07,320
Thanks.

1222
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:10,360
You know me, Rothstein.

1223
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:12,360
We're all like standing at the doorway.

1224
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:17,240
Greek chorus gathered in the corridor outside.

1225
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:18,880
Three heads on top of each other,

1226
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:20,240
peeking around the corner.

1227
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:26,680
You know me, Rothstein.

1228
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:29,600
You know me.

1229
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:32,880
This is my house, Rothstein.

1230
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:35,760
This is my house.

1231
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:39,360
Hawks. Hawks, is that you?

1232
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,640
Yes. Yes, that is.

1233
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:45,720
That is my name. Yes.

1234
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:48,520
How has this happened?

1235
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:51,240
Was it the portal? Yes.

1236
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:55,040
Yes, it was.

1237
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:57,880
I stepped through and

1238
00:59:57,880 --> 01:00:00,320
I was trapped there.

1239
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:04,360
I was trapped somewhere else

1240
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:08,880
for so very long until

1241
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:11,640
until I found a way back.

1242
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:14,520
Am I back, Rothstein?

1243
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:16,280
Am I back?

1244
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:18,520
Am I home now?

1245
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:20,200
Literally.

1246
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:23,320
I'm so very hungry, Rothstein.

1247
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:26,120
What sounds good?

1248
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:39,720
Oh, Scott almost spit out his tea.

1249
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:47,680
I'm so hungry, Rothstein.

1250
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:50,040
What sounds good?

1251
01:00:53,320 --> 01:01:01,400
Bring me something to eat, Rothstein.

1252
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:04,600
Bring me something to eat and we can talk.

1253
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:09,120
OK, are the rest of the guys like behind me?

1254
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:10,960
Are they in the room or where are you guys?

1255
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:13,680
We're doing the Beatles photo at the door jamb.

1256
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:17,280
Yeah, so you're out on the landing.

1257
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:20,960
Actually, the three of you who aren't involved in the conversation.

1258
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:23,240
Can you give me listen rolls?

1259
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:27,160
Oh, hell yeah, dude, these ears.

1260
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:28,680
33 on a 50.

1261
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:30,480
Oh, fail.

1262
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:32,320
I failed mine.

1263
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:34,720
OK, you're fairly certain

1264
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:39,280
that you can hear a car coming up the driveway.

1265
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:41,920
Everybody hear that?

1266
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:44,160
Yeah, the house is hungry.

1267
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:46,040
Yes, the house is hungry.

1268
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:48,520
But also there's a vroom vroom coming up the bale.

1269
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:52,040
We got a we got we got a car coming up the chute.

1270
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:54,520
Oh, vroom vroom.

1271
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:58,320
Yeah, I didn't look up any slang from this time period,

1272
01:01:58,320 --> 01:02:01,480
so I figured I'd make it up on the fly.

1273
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:04,840
That that that that could be good.

1274
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:08,000
It could be somebody who's in on on all this on all this terribleness.

1275
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:12,440
And or it could be a bad situation who put Austin Hawks in the portal.

1276
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:14,040
So he'd be a good guy to feed to him.

1277
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:15,960
Right. And yeah, maybe we feed him to the house.

1278
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:18,480
Exactly. Yes, we feed him to this giant tongue.

1279
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:20,520
And by the way, around here in these times, they're called

1280
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:21,720
Chitty Chitty Bang Bangs.

1281
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,160
Coombes is going to try and go to the nearest window

1282
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:30,480
that would look out toward the drive and see what he sees.

1283
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:34,840
Yeah. Yeah. Go out to the window and push the the rather moist

1284
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:37,400
and meaty curtains aside and take a look out.

1285
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:41,560
And yeah, there is a car inching up the driveway.

1286
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:45,520
Does it look is it just driving up like it would drive up normally

1287
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:48,040
or is it being sneaky?

1288
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:51,360
I mean, the lights are on, so it's not be that sneaky.

1289
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:54,360
But on the other hand, it is driving fairly slowly.

1290
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:56,760
Yeah, there's definitely a room of room coming up.

1291
01:02:56,760 --> 01:03:00,200
A Chitty Chitty Bang Bang up the up the chute, like it like you said.

1292
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:06,880
The chute. Maybe dinner is delivery tonight.

1293
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:15,040
What should we do? Should we should we meet him?

1294
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:17,280
Should we meet him at the door downstairs?

1295
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:20,160
Maybe the house knows where the guns are in the house.

1296
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:22,560
If there were guns in me, I'd know where they were.

1297
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:24,600
This house barely knew it was a house.

1298
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:28,160
Do you know where guns might be in the house? House?

1299
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:33,240
Hawks? There is just no response to that.

1300
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:37,400
You know what? That's fair.

1301
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:41,240
Does this does this window we're looking at the Chitty Chitty Bang Bang out of?

1302
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:42,880
Does it open up?

1303
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:45,120
Give me a strength roll to see if it does.

1304
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:48,960
I mean, it's not locked, but on the other hand, it is kind of scabbed over.

1305
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:54,480
Right. Nope, 86.

1306
01:03:54,720 --> 01:04:00,760
Yeah, I mean, you try and it almost moves, but there's these fleshy strands

1307
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:04,000
that just push it back down again every time you try.

1308
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:06,440
I'm just going to shout out to come up here in a minute.

1309
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:14,440
So you can see what the car is doing is it's pulling over by

1310
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:22,600
the the laboratory outside and in the light that's coming out from the windows of the

1311
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:26,680
house, you can see that there is a man who's got out.

1312
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:30,840
He's wearing a fairly nice suit.

1313
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:37,400
You can't really make out who he is because he's wearing a mask over his face or at

1314
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:41,560
least some cloth tied around a bandana, tied around his face.

1315
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:51,800
As he gets out, he's got an electric lantern in one hand and you can just make out he's

1316
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:56,040
definitely got a revolver in the other hand and he's looking around.

1317
01:04:57,240 --> 01:05:00,720
I mean, you can't read the expression on his face because all we can see is his eyes,

1318
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:09,400
but from his body language, he's cautious, nervous, just trying to, I guess, make out

1319
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:10,360
what's going on.

1320
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:12,040
He spotted our caddy.

1321
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:17,560
He's going to be disappointed when he finds that that skinless monkey creature in the

1322
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:19,200
tank is all smashed to bits.

1323
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:22,600
Well, you shouldn't just leave those things lying around.

1324
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:26,640
Yeah, I mean, if you carry on watching from the window behind, he goes over to the

1325
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:29,920
laboratory, opens up the door and heads in there.

1326
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:34,920
There's a chance that this person maybe knows more about this stuff.

1327
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:39,920
They might have a solution for the little parasite problem we've got on our hands.

1328
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:42,560
Do you think it's worth trying to talk to him?

1329
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:44,000
As opposed to what?

1330
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:47,880
Kidnapping him and throwing him in a house mouth?

1331
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:51,880
Yeah, just instant hostility like we would treat most NPCs.

1332
01:05:54,920 --> 01:06:00,680
Maybe we should talk to him and then back up plan V feed him to the house.

1333
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:01,880
I like this idea.

1334
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,400
I mean, it's pretty zany.

1335
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:06,040
It's pretty out there talking, you know.

1336
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:09,920
All right, but let's give it a whirl.

1337
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:12,640
We don't have any like weapons or anything.

1338
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:15,480
So they have numbers.

1339
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:17,400
Yeah, four on one.

1340
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:19,520
That's a lot of talking we can do.

1341
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:21,680
He doesn't know that there's four of us.

1342
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:24,440
So maybe one of us could like hide behind the lab.

1343
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:28,640
And if things go south, they'll just sneak up on him from behind.

1344
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:30,840
Yeah, I'm pretty good at sneaking.

1345
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:31,600
Let's try.

1346
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:32,280
Let's try that.

1347
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:33,480
Let's let's do it.

1348
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:35,520
What are you doing with Esther?

1349
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:43,120
Throughout this plan, because you do have a frightened and rather ill 12 year old girl with you as well.

1350
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:45,320
I just assumed she was sitting on my shoulders.

1351
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:49,520
We needed a fourth for the Beatles photo.

1352
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:54,720
We could maybe have Esther wait in the car.

1353
01:06:57,040 --> 01:06:58,160
No other ideas.

1354
01:06:58,160 --> 01:06:59,520
That sounds like the best one.

1355
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:00,440
We could feed it.

1356
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:01,800
We could feed it to the mouth.

1357
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:06,000
Well, you see, that was kind of the whole point of the day.

1358
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:09,680
Yeah, but I mean, now there's this whole mouth thing.

1359
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:15,400
I feel like it would be a total waste of time if we gave her back.

1360
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:27,200
Yeah, we could have just stayed home, slept, drank bad coffee, gone to a different overville that wasn't being taken over by puppets with no faces.

1361
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:30,000
Yeah, but remember when we shot that guy?

1362
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:31,400
Yeah, that was crazy.

1363
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:32,280
What a day.

1364
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:42,760
But with a shotgun call, we threatened to do the same to you.

1365
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:44,840
And it's how we got you to come along on this adventure.

1366
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:47,440
Esther, look at me.

1367
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:53,520
This house is a person and you've been trying to be digested by that person, right?

1368
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:57,240
Right.

1369
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:57,760
Okay.

1370
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:01,440
So what we're going to do is we're going to go down to the front door.

1371
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:02,240
All right.

1372
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:06,760
And we're going to find a spot for you that seems like you'll be fine there.

1373
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:10,920
And you're just going to sit on the floor and you'll be right next to the front door.

1374
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:15,200
So on our way out, as we're leaving, you just come with us.

1375
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:17,680
We're going to get into a very nice car.

1376
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:20,400
When was the last time you were in a nice car, Esther?

1377
01:08:20,440 --> 01:08:21,320
Oh, don't answer that.

1378
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:22,800
It was probably when you were being kidnapped.

1379
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:25,360
When would it'll be comfortable?

1380
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:36,360
Sometimes when I keep talking, I dig a hole for myself, but I think everything will be fine.

1381
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:36,800
Look at me.

1382
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:37,640
Everything will be fine.

1383
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:38,040
Look at me.

1384
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:39,040
Everything will be fine.

1385
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:40,080
Everything will be fine.

1386
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:41,760
And he just pats her on the head.

1387
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:51,320
I think this is a good opportunity for you to make either a charm or a persuade role to see whether you can calm her down enough to sit there and wait patiently while you do this.

1388
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:56,920
Uh, well, this isn't great because looking at my homemade character sheet here.

1389
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,520
I'm going to have to ask somebody else.

1390
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:03,040
What are the baseline for charm or persuade?

1391
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:06,480
Uh, persuade, persuade baseline is 10.

1392
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:09,160
I've got, I've got some charms.

1393
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:10,920
I don't know what the baseline is.

1394
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:11,880
Regardless.

1395
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:13,320
I rolled an 89.

1396
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:15,600
Yeah, it is certainly hard than that.

1397
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:19,720
I think the baseline for charm is 20, but are you sure it's not 90?

1398
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:25,880
Everybody in the world is charming as fuck.

1399
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:29,160
It's a useless skill.

1400
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:31,760
You know, Call of Cthulhu.

1401
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:50,000
So, Esther, she seems to listen to you and she, she certainly goes quiet at this stage, but at the same time, you can see that she's still very jittery and frightened.

1402
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:53,200
You're leading her down to the front door, are you?

1403
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:57,440
Yeah, this is exactly what kids look like when they know exactly what they're doing.

1404
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:16,720
Sure. And yeah, you get down to the front door and at that point, she just looks around, you know, particularly at all the strange fluids dripping down the wall and the squelchy carpet and the strange noises coming from upstairs.

1405
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:21,960
And she bolts out of the front door and starts running off into the darkness.

1406
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:29,440
I think we might have cut out, yeah, the last thing you said there.

1407
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:32,960
Oh, something about into the darkness, which sounds distressing.

1408
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:34,720
Yeah, that was upsetting.

1409
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:35,240
Yeah.

1410
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:39,760
I just said that, you know, she obviously in a bit of a panic as you take it downstairs.

1411
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:41,000
Oh, it's still being weird.

1412
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:41,720
Oh, shit.

1413
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:42,400
Okay.

1414
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:50,600
It's like, it was every single time you were saying the thing that matters the most.

1415
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:54,560
Is it better now?

1416
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:55,520
Looks like it so far.

1417
01:10:55,560 --> 01:10:56,040
Seemingly.

1418
01:10:56,080 --> 01:10:56,400
Right.

1419
01:10:56,840 --> 01:11:04,040
In which case, yeah, the last thing I said was that, you know, she seems to, if I'd just broken up again.

1420
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:07,120
It did.

1421
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:09,440
It broke up right as you were starting again.

1422
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:11,920
Motherfucker.

1423
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:13,680
I can obviously miss this story.

1424
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:15,360
Timing is incredible.

1425
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:16,120
All right.

1426
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:19,720
Hey, everyone, just, uh, stop your recording.

1427
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:25,240
Uh, we're going to fly to, uh, Britain.

1428
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:27,560
Uh, what do you call it?

1429
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:28,400
What's the name?

1430
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:31,400
We'll be there in just a couple of minutes.

1431
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,240
Milton Keynes.

1432
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:34,160
That's the name.

1433
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:36,200
I will be there very shortly.

1434
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:38,320
Record the same person.

1435
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:39,120
I hope you don't mind.

1436
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:40,120
I have a cough.

1437
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:47,480
Been a little fevery lately, but.

1438
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:50,280
Yeah.

1439
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:51,280
Okay.

1440
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:52,720
Well, let's try this one more time.

1441
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:53,520
It seems to be better now.

1442
01:11:54,040 --> 01:11:54,520
Right.

1443
01:11:54,960 --> 01:12:00,440
So yeah, I'm saying that, yeah, she seems to be a bit on nervous, a bit on edge.

1444
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:10,440
And as you take it down to the front door, she takes a look around at all the creepy shit in the house and then just in a panic runs out of the house into the darkness.

1445
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:12,280
I was afraid that's what you had said.

1446
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:14,440
I'm chasing her.

1447
01:12:14,680 --> 01:12:16,320
I'm just going to call after her.

1448
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:16,880
I'm just going to...

1449
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:18,760
Esther, Esther, no.

1450
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:20,840
Stay with us. You're safer with us.

1451
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:29,920
Oh, OK, so you're trying to calm her down as Frederick Mellon I is chasing after her.

1452
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:36,120
I mean, I will allow you again to make either a PERSUADE or a CHARM roll, but this is a PUSHED roll.

1453
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:47,160
I think at this stage, if you fail this roll, she is going to be so panicked by the situation that she is going to run into real danger.

1454
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:50,600
I'm going to...

1455
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:52,840
She starts shaking his dice.

1456
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:56,720
I'm doing a charm roll.

1457
01:12:56,760 --> 01:12:57,880
Fantastic.

1458
01:12:59,000 --> 01:12:59,960
Bedside Manor.

1459
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:00,720
I pass.

1460
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:03,160
It's a 46 on a 50.

1461
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:04,320
Brilliant.

1462
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:14,280
OK, so, yeah, as Frederick catches up with Esther and she's run off, she's got into the undergrowth a little bit.

1463
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:26,200
But now that she's there in the darkness and can't see what's going on and can hear all the strange things moving around in the garden, she just stops.

1464
01:13:26,680 --> 01:13:36,840
And as you come up, she turns around and just throws herself at you and just puts her arms around your waist and starts crying.

1465
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:43,600
Close to the mover time and we always find a time to shine.

1466
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:50,280
This is a song that everybody knows.

1467
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:56,720
And when you get older, you're gonna lose your toes.

1468
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:00,560
She's supposed to sing Lose Your Toes.

1469
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:01,520
That's her line.

1470
01:14:02,160 --> 01:14:04,000
That was me doing Esther.

1471
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,800
That was her voice.

1472
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:07,920
Lose your toes.

1473
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:09,080
It's been a rough day.

1474
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:16,240
That's OK, that's OK.

1475
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:17,520
And I'm just patting her back.

1476
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:21,040
And yeah, she's just crying into your chest.

1477
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:24,520
That like grandpa hug where you just kind of like pat.

1478
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:25,280
Yeah.

1479
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:33,680
And yeah, I mean, every now and then as your parm makes contact with her, you can just feel things squirming around under your hand.

1480
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:39,920
Should have fed her to the house.

1481
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:45,520
OK, that's OK, that's OK, that's OK.

1482
01:14:46,160 --> 01:14:48,920
As I look around my surroundings, where am I at?

1483
01:14:49,440 --> 01:15:02,520
You're only about 10 feet in front of the house, so you're just on the far side of the gravel drive, just as it's going into, I guess, what used to be an ornamental garden or some shrubbery or something.

1484
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:06,440
But, you know, has long since just gone completely wild.

1485
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:11,200
Do I notice any movement from over by the laboratory?

1486
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:13,880
No, the door is ajar.

1487
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:18,520
You can see a bit of light coming out, but you can't see any movement over there.

1488
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:23,000
OK, I'm going to get her to the car and get her in the backseat.

1489
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:29,320
So when you say the car, do you mean the one that the guy drove up in or the one that you guys brought?

1490
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:31,160
Oh, God, no, not his.

1491
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:32,800
It's ours, the one that we brought.

1492
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:34,920
Because it's been so long since we recorded this bit.

1493
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:41,240
Can you remind me, did you park outside the house or did you park on the street outside?

1494
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:56,000
We parked about halfway up the chute, facing out back down the chute, and we took some time to get ourselves dug out from out of the mud.

1495
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:57,720
I remember now, yes.

1496
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:03,320
OK, so, yeah, you can sneak it down to the car and get her in the backseat.

1497
01:16:03,680 --> 01:16:05,720
Esther, just stay here, OK?

1498
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:10,440
We'll be here in two shakes of a chicken's thigh.

1499
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:13,000
Should we turn the child locks on?

1500
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:15,640
Have those been invented yet?

1501
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:17,320
Not for a while.

1502
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:19,240
I turn off my walkie talkie.

1503
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:24,120
Kids are still dying by the millions on the roadside.

1504
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:29,080
They open the door and launch themselves from the car.

1505
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:32,040
It was an epidemic.

1506
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:43,440
OK, but, yeah, Esther crawls inside and she hunkers down in the foot well and just hides there in the darkness.

1507
01:16:43,480 --> 01:16:44,600
Nice, very good.

1508
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:47,440
OK, so then I'm going to sneak back up to the house.

1509
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:48,680
OK.

1510
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:57,280
Being careful, if I see any movement from over by the fella, actually, you know what, I'm going to go hide behind his car.

1511
01:16:57,800 --> 01:16:59,440
That way I can kind of watch his movement.

1512
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:17,160
Yeah, now that you're a bit closer, you can hear, yeah, there's the sound of someone basically clattering around inside and swearing and moving big bits of metal out of the way.

1513
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:24,520
And just shouting, you know, he seems to be shouting, Brink, you idiot, what have you done?

1514
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:28,880
Yeah, fuck yeah, I gained sanity.

1515
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:46,120
Carl, if we're doing this talking to him tactic, there's a chance that, you know, this guy, if Astin up there has turned into a house and knows you, somebody coming here to do something at this house might know you, too.

1516
01:17:46,360 --> 01:17:48,000
That could work for our advantage, right?

1517
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:50,040
How?

1518
01:17:52,320 --> 01:18:01,320
Maybe you could pretend, you know, a little more than you do or in some way, get him to open up a little more, make him think you're on his side or something.

1519
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:01,840
I don't know.

1520
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:04,120
Yes, easy, easy.

1521
01:18:06,720 --> 01:18:07,560
Let's do it.

1522
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:13,240
So when you say it, what are you doing?

1523
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:21,720
Yeah, I mean, should we just get his attention, have him come out of the lab or should we try and corner him in the lab?

1524
01:18:21,720 --> 01:18:24,360
Maybe we can go to the lab.

1525
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:27,080
I mean, what is our ultimate goal?

1526
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:29,840
What if I get a pair of overalls, right?

1527
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:37,720
And I stop by the lab and I'm like, pistol cleaners, can I see a pistol, sir?

1528
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:42,560
And then you guys come and you talk to him.

1529
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:45,600
But I will have disarmed him cleverly with my ruse.

1530
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:52,720
The problem is that I feel the pistol cleaners usually come on Tuesdays.

1531
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:58,560
We can only pray he's too distracted to remember.

1532
01:18:59,560 --> 01:19:02,600
I feel maybe this is a good start.

1533
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:07,000
And then we, how you call it, wing it from there.

1534
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:08,800
You asked what the ultimate goal here is.

1535
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:13,400
It's to find out if there's a way to remove the parasites from the from hosts.

1536
01:19:14,040 --> 01:19:15,640
I think that's our number one.

1537
01:19:15,640 --> 01:19:21,040
And if it's impossible or he doesn't want to or whatever, it may be feeding him to the house.

1538
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:24,000
Yes, works for me.

1539
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:28,240
Are you going to be pistol cleaning or should I talk to him?

1540
01:19:28,280 --> 01:19:29,720
I don't think we should complicate it.

1541
01:19:29,720 --> 01:19:31,240
Why don't you just go try to talk to him?

1542
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:36,040
OK, but I will go in and you guys.

1543
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:43,480
Maybe do you stay outside or do you come with me to beat holes again?

1544
01:19:43,640 --> 01:19:46,760
Oh, I mean, if you guys stay, there will be trouble.

1545
01:19:47,240 --> 01:19:49,320
But if you go, there will be double.

1546
01:19:53,080 --> 01:20:00,520
OK, how about you maybe stay just within earshot outside and I try to get him outside?

1547
01:20:00,520 --> 01:20:04,200
Yeah, and we'll keep Frederick over there behind the behind the car.

1548
01:20:04,360 --> 01:20:07,000
So I'm behind the car, Nathaniel Coombes, Dr.

1549
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:14,760
and Thomas Dolan are inside the like entrance of the house waiting within earshot and Carl

1550
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:17,800
Rothstein is going to be on the stoop of the house to try to draw him out.

1551
01:20:18,040 --> 01:20:25,320
Basically, the car is between the front entrance and the laboratory.

1552
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:28,760
I mean, if you think of the laboratory as being off the side, so you've got the front

1553
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:33,000
entrance, then it goes around the front of the house down to the side.

1554
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,120
That's where the car is parked.

1555
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:36,520
And then a bit beyond there, there's the laboratory.

1556
01:20:36,520 --> 01:20:42,440
I'm cool with the camera, like panning with me as I like sneak like around so he can't

1557
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:44,040
see me as I move.

1558
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:47,560
That's that's really easily done because he's very distracted at the moment.

1559
01:20:48,120 --> 01:20:53,880
But the problem is that Rothstein is going to have to get a lot closer in order to really

1560
01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:54,840
do anything.

1561
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:55,560
I think that's fine.

1562
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:56,120
Let's do that.

1563
01:20:56,120 --> 01:21:01,880
That's just kind of me and Dolan can just form like a henchman line behind you.

1564
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:04,680
So if Dr.

1565
01:21:04,680 --> 01:21:11,400
Rothstein is creeping over to the lab, yeah, as I said, you can hear the sound of this

1566
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:18,440
man clattering around inside and just swearing angrily to himself over and over

1567
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:19,240
again.

1568
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:27,320
Can I, like, peek into the library to see where he's kind of searching through stuff?

1569
01:21:27,320 --> 01:21:31,160
What I'll ask for is a stealth roll not to be detected.

1570
01:21:31,160 --> 01:21:35,480
I will give you a bonus die on this because you've got some cover and he's distracted.

1571
01:21:40,280 --> 01:21:41,400
No, 93.

1572
01:21:42,120 --> 01:21:44,200
OK, and with a bonus die.

1573
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:47,720
So if you roll the tens again and take the better of the two results.

1574
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:51,320
83.

1575
01:21:55,560 --> 01:21:59,880
So, yeah, you creep up, but...

1576
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:01,800
Knock, knock, knock, knock.

1577
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:12,520
I think it's more that in order to get into position to see this, the light from inside

1578
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:13,400
is hitting you.

1579
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:16,680
You switch the lights back on inside, it's all fully lit.

1580
01:22:17,240 --> 01:22:25,080
And yeah, you are just framed there in the doorway and you watch for a moment as he's

1581
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:29,720
just rustling around in the wreckage looking for anything he can salvage.

1582
01:22:30,280 --> 01:22:37,240
And then he notices you out of the corner of his eye, looks over and immediately starts

1583
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:40,360
fumbling around for his gun, just shouting, who the hell are you?

1584
01:22:40,360 --> 01:22:41,080
Oh, don't.

1585
01:22:41,640 --> 01:22:43,320
No, come on.

1586
01:22:43,320 --> 01:22:43,800
Calm down.

1587
01:22:45,240 --> 01:22:46,520
I am the...

1588
01:22:48,520 --> 01:22:49,880
Tell him you're the pistol cleaner.

1589
01:22:49,880 --> 01:22:57,080
I'm the pistol cleaner for the estate.

1590
01:23:00,440 --> 01:23:07,960
At this stage, he's got his revolver in his hand and he just indicates, come in here where

1591
01:23:07,960 --> 01:23:08,840
I can see you.

1592
01:23:08,840 --> 01:23:09,480
Oh, good.

1593
01:23:09,480 --> 01:23:14,200
It's lit up in here and I can clean your gun very easily in here.

1594
01:23:14,200 --> 01:23:20,040
Kind of look behind me to signal to the other guys, like I'm in trouble.

1595
01:23:20,680 --> 01:23:21,720
And then I walk in.

1596
01:23:24,360 --> 01:23:25,320
Are you alone here?

1597
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:26,700
Yes.

1598
01:23:28,360 --> 01:23:29,000
At the moment.

1599
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:32,360
He shoots you instantly.

1600
01:23:32,360 --> 01:23:37,720
I'm going to take that incredible bit of unconvincing acting there as being in character,

1601
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:39,480
if you don't mind.

1602
01:23:42,920 --> 01:23:45,400
So yeah, he's not buying that for a moment.

1603
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:47,640
He says, right, who else is here with you?

1604
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:52,600
The house is my friend and it's alive.

1605
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:59,480
He just looks at you.

1606
01:23:59,480 --> 01:24:01,320
I mean, you can only see his eyes.

1607
01:24:01,320 --> 01:24:07,560
I mean, he's got this white silk kerchief tied around his face and he's looking at you

1608
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:08,520
over the rims of that.

1609
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:15,160
But I mean, even just seeing his eyes, you can see just the undeniable, unmistakable

1610
01:24:15,160 --> 01:24:17,240
expression of what the fuck in them.

1611
01:24:17,240 --> 01:24:19,720
If you want to see something cool, I can show you.

1612
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:23,480
Who are you and what are you doing here?

1613
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:28,040
My name, don't worry about my name.

1614
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,320
And I'm here to show you secrets.

1615
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:32,540
Come.

1616
01:24:36,120 --> 01:24:42,200
Would you come if this terrible Henry Kissinger, like, surprised you and was like, I have secrets.

1617
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:45,080
Got some surprises for you.

1618
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:46,280
I'll clean your gun.

1619
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:49,320
My name is not important.

1620
01:24:49,320 --> 01:24:50,520
Come look at the surprise.

1621
01:24:51,480 --> 01:24:53,640
He says one more time.

1622
01:24:53,640 --> 01:24:55,400
Who are you and what are you doing here?

1623
01:24:55,400 --> 01:24:58,360
And if I don't like the answer, I'm going to shoot you.

1624
01:24:58,360 --> 01:25:00,280
I start backing.

1625
01:25:00,280 --> 01:25:02,360
How far into the laboratory am I?

1626
01:25:03,080 --> 01:25:05,800
How far in did you come when he told you to come in?

1627
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:07,080
I'm going to say not very.

1628
01:25:08,760 --> 01:25:10,920
I love it when Luke asks those questions.

1629
01:25:10,920 --> 01:25:11,640
Super far.

1630
01:25:11,640 --> 01:25:20,920
I start backing out and I just kind of like wave, like beckon him towards me.

1631
01:25:21,880 --> 01:25:22,920
This is the way.

1632
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:27,560
And then I sprint out of the laboratory as to not be shot.

1633
01:25:28,440 --> 01:25:31,560
I'm going to give you a chance.

1634
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:36,600
I'm going to give you a chance then to dodge and get some cover between you and the gunfire

1635
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:37,720
that's coming your way.

1636
01:25:37,720 --> 01:25:41,480
Yeah, they'll just push us down the stairs and then this episode will be over.

1637
01:25:41,480 --> 01:25:45,080
I got a 16 on a 25.

1638
01:25:45,080 --> 01:25:47,000
Okay, so that's a success.

1639
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,640
So you are getting out of the way.

1640
01:25:49,640 --> 01:25:52,360
He is going to get one chance to shoot you.

1641
01:25:52,360 --> 01:25:58,920
But on the other hand, yeah, I mean, he is close enough that it's point blank range.

1642
01:26:00,280 --> 01:26:05,320
But because you've dodged, it's just going to be a straight roll and he's not really

1643
01:26:05,320 --> 01:26:06,280
a gunman.

1644
01:26:06,280 --> 01:26:08,120
So I do fancy your odds here.

1645
01:26:08,120 --> 01:26:12,120
That's why I didn't recognize the pistol cleaners.

1646
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:18,760
On the other hand, 25 is a success, even with the basic skill.

1647
01:26:18,760 --> 01:26:27,560
So that is one point of damage, minimum damage.

1648
01:26:28,680 --> 01:26:31,160
Yeah, I mean, clearly that dodge did help.

1649
01:26:31,160 --> 01:26:32,440
You've dived out of the way.

1650
01:26:32,440 --> 01:26:34,520
The bullet just wings you.

1651
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:40,040
It clips your left arm just as you're diving around the side of the metal door and there

1652
01:26:40,040 --> 01:26:41,160
is searing pain.

1653
01:26:41,160 --> 01:26:46,040
But on the other hand, yeah, it doesn't seem to have hit anything vital.

1654
01:26:46,040 --> 01:26:52,200
You can hear the sound of this man cluttering through the debris that you left in the lab

1655
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:54,760
and chasing towards the door after you.

1656
01:26:54,760 --> 01:26:58,280
Can we see this happening if we're hiding behind the door?

1657
01:26:58,280 --> 01:27:03,960
You can certainly see in the light that's coming out of the doorway that, yeah, Rothstein

1658
01:27:03,960 --> 01:27:08,040
darts out, dives out of the way, there's gunfire, and then he staggers.

1659
01:27:08,040 --> 01:27:12,840
Nathaniel, if he comes through that fucking door, let's just clothesline the bastard.

1660
01:27:12,840 --> 01:27:15,000
Yeah, yeah, that, yeah, yeah.

1661
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:16,840
And so, yeah, we're like preparing a move.

1662
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:20,120
I don't know how that works, but if he comes through the door, we would...

1663
01:27:20,760 --> 01:27:23,720
Yeah, we just want to juke our arms out and surprise him.

1664
01:27:23,720 --> 01:27:26,120
So you're running towards the door.

1665
01:27:26,120 --> 01:27:30,360
I pictured us just on the other side of the door at the start, but maybe not.

1666
01:27:30,360 --> 01:27:32,840
Yeah, I thought you were over by the car, but...

1667
01:27:32,840 --> 01:27:34,920
Remember, we are the hench line.

1668
01:27:34,920 --> 01:27:35,720
We accompanied him.

1669
01:27:35,720 --> 01:27:37,080
We were walking up with him.

1670
01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:38,200
Oh shit, that's right.

1671
01:27:38,200 --> 01:27:40,440
You probably were on either side of the door outside.

1672
01:27:40,440 --> 01:27:43,560
Yeah, we hid back when he was like, yeah, I'm alone.

1673
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:47,640
Well, let's see then how well the two of you are hiding.

1674
01:27:48,440 --> 01:27:55,480
So whichever one of you has got the worst stealth roll, make a stealth roll just to

1675
01:27:55,480 --> 01:27:57,800
see whether you're going to get the jump on him.

1676
01:27:57,800 --> 01:27:58,920
I've got 20.

1677
01:27:58,920 --> 01:28:00,200
Is that the default?

1678
01:28:00,200 --> 01:28:00,840
Yeah.

1679
01:28:00,840 --> 01:28:01,560
Yeah.

1680
01:28:01,560 --> 01:28:02,520
Yeah, I've got the same.

1681
01:28:03,160 --> 01:28:05,480
So which one of you wants to roll for this?

1682
01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:06,760
Hit it up, Thomas.

1683
01:28:06,760 --> 01:28:10,120
Which one of you makes a yelp when the gunshot goes off?

1684
01:28:11,400 --> 01:28:11,900
Right.

1685
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:15,160
38.

1686
01:28:16,280 --> 01:28:16,680
Okay.

1687
01:28:17,240 --> 01:28:18,200
On a 20.

1688
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:23,880
I mean, it's not catastrophic, but on the other hand, yeah, to get close enough to do

1689
01:28:23,880 --> 01:28:28,040
this, you're there within the light that's coming out of the doorway.

1690
01:28:28,760 --> 01:28:36,280
And yeah, as you're getting into position, he is going to get a chance to react to this.

1691
01:28:36,840 --> 01:28:43,000
And the bad news is because he's got a prepared gun, he is almost certainly going to act

1692
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:44,120
before either of you.

1693
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:50,680
So were the two of you both lunging into clothesline him or was just one person doing

1694
01:28:50,680 --> 01:28:51,080
it?

1695
01:28:51,080 --> 01:28:52,440
I pictured us both.

1696
01:28:52,440 --> 01:28:53,080
Yeah.

1697
01:28:53,080 --> 01:28:53,580
Okay.

1698
01:28:54,280 --> 01:28:58,520
So it's going to be a question of whichever one of you he considers to be the bigger threat.

1699
01:28:58,520 --> 01:29:02,520
And I think Thomas Dolan is the larger of the two men.

1700
01:29:03,560 --> 01:29:05,720
So yeah, I'm pretty certain he's going to shoot you.

1701
01:29:05,720 --> 01:29:08,520
This is going to be point blank range, so we'll get a bonus die.

1702
01:29:10,120 --> 01:29:11,240
Oh, that's good for him.

1703
01:29:14,680 --> 01:29:18,280
I just love it when people succeed on their rolls, regardless.

1704
01:29:18,280 --> 01:29:23,320
Zach, the correct word is irregardless.

1705
01:29:25,320 --> 01:29:27,000
It's fucking 8 AM.

1706
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,800
How did you get Andy's frozen custard this early in the morning?

1707
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:36,920
I bought it yesterday, put it in the freezer, and I ate it before I got on mic.

1708
01:29:37,480 --> 01:29:39,480
Breakfast of champions.

1709
01:29:39,480 --> 01:29:41,560
I had ice cream for breakfast yesterday.

1710
01:29:41,560 --> 01:29:43,720
Jesus Christ, guys.

1711
01:29:44,680 --> 01:29:49,160
I had a brownie caramel pecan concrete.

1712
01:29:50,280 --> 01:29:51,560
You guys look great.

1713
01:29:51,560 --> 01:29:56,360
I ordered it small, but they said, well, there's a lot of ingredients in there, so we put it

1714
01:29:56,360 --> 01:29:57,000
in a medium.

1715
01:29:58,120 --> 01:29:59,400
Hey, thank you.

1716
01:30:01,240 --> 01:30:02,840
That's the care Andy's takes.

1717
01:30:04,600 --> 01:30:06,520
All right, shoot me, Scott.

1718
01:30:07,480 --> 01:30:13,080
So yeah, even with the bonus die at point blank range, the shot goes wild.

1719
01:30:13,080 --> 01:30:18,680
He is clearly not expecting two of you to jump out at him, even though you've been pretty

1720
01:30:18,680 --> 01:30:20,040
obvious about it.

1721
01:30:20,040 --> 01:30:27,320
The shot just goes clanging into the metal door beside you and ricochets back into the

1722
01:30:27,320 --> 01:30:27,640
lab.

1723
01:30:28,360 --> 01:30:34,680
And he's standing there with the gun now, just pointing around wildly.

1724
01:30:34,680 --> 01:30:38,040
Now, are the two of you just trying to deck him at this stage then?

1725
01:30:38,040 --> 01:30:42,760
Yeah, Thomas Dolan says, should have got that pistol cleaned.

1726
01:30:43,240 --> 01:30:50,280
Then he takes a big 1930s action swing.

1727
01:30:50,280 --> 01:30:50,600
Pow!

1728
01:30:51,240 --> 01:30:52,840
Give me a fighting brawl roll.

1729
01:30:52,840 --> 01:30:55,960
He is going to try to fight back by pistol whipping you.

1730
01:30:58,040 --> 01:30:59,960
Oh, that's a better myth.

1731
01:31:03,560 --> 01:31:06,040
So what did you get on your fighting brawl roll?

1732
01:31:06,040 --> 01:31:07,640
Because I got an extreme success.

1733
01:31:08,520 --> 01:31:09,640
I rolled a zero four.

1734
01:31:09,640 --> 01:31:10,920
Oh, no.

1735
01:31:11,640 --> 01:31:12,440
13.

1736
01:31:12,440 --> 01:31:14,360
Very good, but not good enough.

1737
01:31:15,080 --> 01:31:19,960
If you have enough points to buy that down to an extreme success, I really recommend

1738
01:31:19,960 --> 01:31:22,760
doing so because extreme successes do maximum damage.

1739
01:31:24,280 --> 01:31:25,640
Do I spend luck points on that?

1740
01:31:26,520 --> 01:31:28,520
Yes, yes, if you have enough.

1741
01:31:28,520 --> 01:31:31,560
I don't think Thomas Dolan does.

1742
01:31:31,560 --> 01:31:32,280
I think he lost.

1743
01:31:32,280 --> 01:31:33,560
I don't think you have any.

1744
01:31:33,560 --> 01:31:36,360
Yeah, I think I lost all my luck.

1745
01:31:36,360 --> 01:31:38,680
Because I think he may be about to kill you here.

1746
01:31:40,280 --> 01:31:47,880
Because with maximum damage on this, he does have a damage bonus.

1747
01:31:47,880 --> 01:31:50,520
So this is going to be 10 points of damage coming your way.

1748
01:31:50,520 --> 01:31:51,720
Holy shit.

1749
01:31:53,720 --> 01:31:55,400
Yeah, so I'm at two hit points.

1750
01:31:55,400 --> 01:31:58,920
Okay, can you give me a constitution roll to see whether you can stay standing?

1751
01:31:58,920 --> 01:32:05,560
So basically, as you come in to try to deck him, he ducks underneath, brings his gun up,

1752
01:32:05,560 --> 01:32:07,800
just backhands you across the face.

1753
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:12,520
And there is this almighty crunching noise as he breaks your nose and blood goes flying.

1754
01:32:14,200 --> 01:32:16,120
No, I rolled a 91.

1755
01:32:17,080 --> 01:32:18,120
Lights out.

1756
01:32:18,120 --> 01:32:21,400
Yeah, Thomas just goes down with a thump lying on the ground.

1757
01:32:21,400 --> 01:32:25,960
K.O. Finish him.

1758
01:32:25,960 --> 01:32:27,320
What was Dr. Coombes doing?

1759
01:32:30,360 --> 01:32:34,440
Now that he's seen Thomas go down, he's freaked out.

1760
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,400
No, no, no, no, no.

1761
01:32:37,400 --> 01:32:38,920
Fucking fight him, you son of a bitch.

1762
01:32:38,920 --> 01:32:40,920
Yeah, you were attacking him too.

1763
01:32:40,920 --> 01:32:43,960
And now he's taking all his time killing me.

1764
01:32:43,960 --> 01:32:46,200
So you've got to fight up a shot.

1765
01:32:46,200 --> 01:32:47,000
Go for it.

1766
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:48,120
He's open, baby.

1767
01:32:48,120 --> 01:32:49,400
He just took a shot.

1768
01:32:49,400 --> 01:32:50,520
Fucking chomp that.

1769
01:32:51,880 --> 01:32:55,160
Okay, the guys want me to hit him with my 25% chance.

1770
01:32:56,760 --> 01:33:00,200
Because you are ganging up on him at this stage, there are two of you attacking him.

1771
01:33:00,200 --> 01:33:01,640
You do get a bonus die on this.

1772
01:33:02,520 --> 01:33:03,020
Perfect.

1773
01:33:04,600 --> 01:33:05,720
I'm going for a swing.

1774
01:33:09,640 --> 01:33:10,680
I pass.

1775
01:33:10,680 --> 01:33:11,400
It's a 22.

1776
01:33:14,600 --> 01:33:15,880
Okay, doctor.

1777
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:19,320
So, yeah, give me a damage roll.

1778
01:33:19,320 --> 01:33:20,920
You're not using your weapon at this stage.

1779
01:33:20,920 --> 01:33:24,040
So it's just going to be a d3 plus any damage bonus you've got.

1780
01:33:25,320 --> 01:33:26,360
It's a three.

1781
01:33:26,360 --> 01:33:26,860
Okay.

1782
01:33:27,400 --> 01:33:27,900
Total.

1783
01:33:28,780 --> 01:33:34,700
So, yeah, you managed to hit him a fairly solid blow in the jaw.

1784
01:33:35,500 --> 01:33:39,420
And you split the bottom of his lip.

1785
01:33:39,420 --> 01:33:42,780
There's a bit of blood running out and he staggers back for a moment.

1786
01:33:43,660 --> 01:33:45,820
And he looks really pissed off about this.

1787
01:33:47,580 --> 01:33:49,100
He's now going to try to shoot you.

1788
01:33:50,060 --> 01:33:50,560
What's...

1789
01:33:52,620 --> 01:33:58,620
When I heard the initial gunshot go off and I saw the two get ready for the hang line,

1790
01:33:58,620 --> 01:34:06,620
I think Frederick Mellon the foist began his waddle, his quick waddle,

1791
01:34:06,620 --> 01:34:10,700
right toward the door, getting ready to join in on the action.

1792
01:34:10,700 --> 01:34:15,340
Yeah, and then I'm going to try to disarm this man.

1793
01:34:15,340 --> 01:34:18,540
Okay, because again, he does have a gun readied.

1794
01:34:19,180 --> 01:34:21,660
He is going to act first, I think.

1795
01:34:22,220 --> 01:34:24,700
Yeah, he is because that's plus 50 on his decks.

1796
01:34:24,700 --> 01:34:28,860
And unless anyone's got a decks of higher than 115, he's going first.

1797
01:34:29,500 --> 01:34:30,540
Ah, 110.

1798
01:34:33,340 --> 01:34:38,300
So I think because Dr. Coombs just punched him, he is going to shoot Dr. Coombs.

1799
01:34:39,260 --> 01:34:42,380
Let's see how this goes for Dr. Coombs.

1800
01:34:42,380 --> 01:34:45,820
Okay.

1801
01:34:45,820 --> 01:34:46,620
Oh, hang on.

1802
01:34:46,620 --> 01:34:47,260
It's point blank.

1803
01:34:47,260 --> 01:34:48,300
He gets a bonus die.

1804
01:34:53,020 --> 01:34:54,460
Oh, no, no, that's...

1805
01:34:55,100 --> 01:34:57,260
So both my rolls were 84s.

1806
01:34:57,260 --> 01:34:58,060
So that's good.

1807
01:34:58,700 --> 01:35:01,340
So yeah, obviously you've discombobulated him a bit.

1808
01:35:01,340 --> 01:35:04,060
He's staggering back and he's firing wild.

1809
01:35:04,060 --> 01:35:11,100
The bullet just goes between you and Frederick and you hear it smack into the car behind you.

1810
01:35:11,740 --> 01:35:13,020
And the little girl is dead.

1811
01:35:13,980 --> 01:35:14,540
Different car.

1812
01:35:15,980 --> 01:35:19,500
This guy is backing into the lab again, halting the gun.

1813
01:35:20,300 --> 01:35:26,620
One thing you can see as well, actually, yeah, because Dr. Coombs got a solid blow on his face,

1814
01:35:26,620 --> 01:35:28,700
his cachif is coming loose.

1815
01:35:29,580 --> 01:35:36,780
As he steps back into the light that's coming out of the laboratory, it comes down and you

1816
01:35:36,780 --> 01:35:41,020
can see that his face, there's something wrong with his face.

1817
01:35:42,140 --> 01:35:47,900
You can see his mouth there, but the problem is all the other mouths, all these little

1818
01:35:47,900 --> 01:35:53,180
mouths with teeth that have just opened up all over his face and seem to be screaming

1819
01:35:53,180 --> 01:35:55,100
in pain from the blow.

1820
01:35:55,740 --> 01:35:56,860
Oh, my God.

1821
01:35:56,860 --> 01:36:01,740
I would like everyone who's conscious and not running away, so that's Dr. Coombs and

1822
01:36:01,740 --> 01:36:04,780
Frederick, to make sand rolls.

1823
01:36:07,260 --> 01:36:09,180
72 on a 63.

1824
01:36:09,180 --> 01:36:09,680
OK.

1825
01:36:09,980 --> 01:36:10,480
Fail.

1826
01:36:11,100 --> 01:36:13,180
I fail a 29 on a 20.

1827
01:36:13,980 --> 01:36:19,500
OK, so you don't lose much sand for this.

1828
01:36:19,500 --> 01:36:21,260
I mean, you see much worse things today.

1829
01:36:23,500 --> 01:36:25,420
Frederick only loses two points.

1830
01:36:25,980 --> 01:36:28,300
Dr. Coombs loses three points.

1831
01:36:29,100 --> 01:36:34,460
But Dr. Coombs, on the other hand, was already indefinitely insane, I think.

1832
01:36:34,460 --> 01:36:38,780
So this pushes him over into another bout of madness anyway.

1833
01:36:38,780 --> 01:36:39,420
Oh, OK.

1834
01:36:39,420 --> 01:36:42,940
I think at this stage it's just going to be pure self-preservation.

1835
01:36:42,940 --> 01:36:45,260
I mean, there's gunfire going off.

1836
01:36:45,260 --> 01:36:48,940
You're not someone who is used to combat.

1837
01:36:49,740 --> 01:36:51,420
You've seen Thomas go down.

1838
01:36:52,780 --> 01:36:54,780
You've nearly been shot to yourself.

1839
01:36:55,980 --> 01:36:59,180
I think you're just running away blindly into the darkness.

1840
01:36:59,820 --> 01:37:00,780
I'd agree.

1841
01:37:00,780 --> 01:37:03,180
That sounds like what Coombs would do.

1842
01:37:03,180 --> 01:37:05,980
Yeah, I'm sure you won't get into any trouble out there.

1843
01:37:07,500 --> 01:37:08,000
No.

1844
01:37:08,460 --> 01:37:13,260
So that now leaves Frederick on his own dealing with the gunman.

1845
01:37:16,940 --> 01:37:17,740
Good luck, Freddie.

1846
01:37:18,620 --> 01:37:20,780
Was I just like running?

1847
01:37:21,900 --> 01:37:22,940
Well, it's up to you.

1848
01:37:22,940 --> 01:37:26,300
Yeah, I mean, if you want to double back and help Fred, by all means, you can.

1849
01:37:26,300 --> 01:37:26,940
Yeah, I think...

1850
01:37:27,740 --> 01:37:30,540
Well, I'm unconscious, guys, so it's up to you.

1851
01:37:31,260 --> 01:37:34,220
I'm flinging myself into the woods, so...

1852
01:37:34,220 --> 01:37:42,300
Yeah, so as I'm running away and get clipped in the arm, I'm like, oh,

1853
01:37:43,500 --> 01:37:50,780
I feel like I'm down to three hit points and I start running away.

1854
01:37:50,780 --> 01:37:58,220
But then when I hear the other gunshots and stuff go off, I turn around and I see between

1855
01:37:58,220 --> 01:38:05,100
Nathaniel and Thomas what is going down and I look to see what Frederick Mellon is doing.

1856
01:38:05,100 --> 01:38:07,020
And he's going for the disarm.

1857
01:38:08,300 --> 01:38:16,940
So you're following this man with the many mouths into the lab as he's backing off

1858
01:38:16,940 --> 01:38:18,780
and you're going to try to get the gun off him?

1859
01:38:18,780 --> 01:38:20,460
I'm going to try to sneak it away from him.

1860
01:38:20,460 --> 01:38:25,020
I'm a very stealthy man and I've been known to steal things off of people a lot by misdirection.

1861
01:38:25,020 --> 01:38:32,940
So I'm going to try to flick a coin in the air and then while he's looking at my hand

1862
01:38:32,940 --> 01:38:36,140
that's up in the air, just grab the gun out of his hand, maybe.

1863
01:38:37,260 --> 01:38:42,300
Okay, then what I'll allow then is for you to use sleight of hand

1864
01:38:42,300 --> 01:38:44,300
instead of fighting brawl for the maneuver.

1865
01:38:44,940 --> 01:38:47,420
Crazy that I have 10% more in that.

1866
01:38:49,580 --> 01:38:53,980
On the other hand, he is still going to try to pistol whip the fuck out of you.

1867
01:38:53,980 --> 01:38:56,220
Dude, I rolled a fucking 10.

1868
01:38:57,100 --> 01:39:00,380
Oh, that's an extreme success.

1869
01:39:01,100 --> 01:39:05,420
That's good because he's rolled a 73 on his fighting brawl.

1870
01:39:05,420 --> 01:39:06,860
So that is a complete failure.

1871
01:39:07,500 --> 01:39:11,660
So yeah, you have his gun now.

1872
01:39:12,300 --> 01:39:19,740
He's trying his hardest just to ignore the very obvious distraction that you're doing.

1873
01:39:19,740 --> 01:39:23,260
But there's just something so compelling about the way you flick that coin.

1874
01:39:23,980 --> 01:39:28,620
That he's just bringing the gun back to smack you in the face with it

1875
01:39:28,620 --> 01:39:32,460
and he's just looking up at the coin and then he's looking down at his empty hand

1876
01:39:33,020 --> 01:39:38,860
and just muttering, oh fuck, not again, to himself.

1877
01:39:42,620 --> 01:39:43,100
Every time.

1878
01:39:43,100 --> 01:39:44,220
Decades of practice.

1879
01:39:46,460 --> 01:39:50,540
And with that, I think on the extreme success, by the time he realizes what's going on,

1880
01:39:50,540 --> 01:39:51,980
I'm backed out the door.

1881
01:39:52,060 --> 01:39:55,820
Gun still pointed at him and hollering back to my comrades.

1882
01:39:56,540 --> 01:39:57,420
I got the gun.

1883
01:39:58,540 --> 01:39:59,580
He's got my coin.

1884
01:40:02,460 --> 01:40:06,300
Yeah, he's hesitantly putting his hands up and saying,

1885
01:40:06,300 --> 01:40:11,260
look buddy, don't shoot, you know, I'm sure we can talk this out, right?

1886
01:40:11,260 --> 01:40:12,780
Are all the mouth saying that?

1887
01:40:12,780 --> 01:40:13,500
Just the one mouth.

1888
01:40:13,500 --> 01:40:17,420
The other ones are just opening, closing all over his face, but it's just the one that's talking.

1889
01:40:18,380 --> 01:40:20,460
And he's saying, you want money?

1890
01:40:20,460 --> 01:40:21,260
I can get you money.

1891
01:40:21,260 --> 01:40:23,100
I can get you all the money you want.

1892
01:40:23,100 --> 01:40:23,980
I don't want money.

1893
01:40:24,620 --> 01:40:28,060
I want answers and money too.

1894
01:40:30,700 --> 01:40:31,340
Oh, right.

1895
01:40:31,340 --> 01:40:36,940
I forgot about my chief concern in life, which is also stealing money from rich fucks like you.

1896
01:40:36,940 --> 01:40:37,500
Yes.

1897
01:40:37,500 --> 01:40:42,060
I also want money, but mostly right now I would like answers.

1898
01:40:42,620 --> 01:40:44,220
Do you look at my skin?

1899
01:40:44,220 --> 01:40:45,580
Look at my face.

1900
01:40:45,580 --> 01:40:49,260
I see that your face is equally fucked up in a different measure,

1901
01:40:49,260 --> 01:40:52,860
but if you can see my skin, you can see what I've seen.

1902
01:40:52,860 --> 01:40:54,220
I want it to be different.

1903
01:40:55,420 --> 01:40:57,180
I want to be fine again.

1904
01:40:57,900 --> 01:40:59,260
Oh, yeah.

1905
01:40:59,260 --> 01:40:59,980
What do you got?

1906
01:41:01,260 --> 01:41:03,660
You got some of the entities inside you now?

1907
01:41:04,300 --> 01:41:07,100
Yeah, I don't know what you do about that.

1908
01:41:07,100 --> 01:41:11,820
I mean, those aren't like species 17.

1909
01:41:11,820 --> 01:41:14,860
I mean, those things, when they go inside you,

1910
01:41:14,860 --> 01:41:18,060
we can just fish them out and yeah, that's good.

1911
01:41:18,060 --> 01:41:20,220
But what do you got inside of you?

1912
01:41:20,220 --> 01:41:25,500
No, we've seen those before and yeah.

1913
01:41:26,380 --> 01:41:30,620
Look, between you and me, buddy, I was coming in here to clean this place out,

1914
01:41:30,620 --> 01:41:36,700
take what I could and just abandon it because last night these things got out.

1915
01:41:36,700 --> 01:41:41,420
Everything got out and this place is ruined now.

1916
01:41:42,140 --> 01:41:45,740
You know, things like what's crawling around inside you, they're everywhere now.

1917
01:41:45,740 --> 01:41:47,420
It's too dangerous here now.

1918
01:41:47,420 --> 01:41:49,500
You'd have to be an idiot to hang around here.

1919
01:41:49,500 --> 01:41:52,220
Any ideas if your life depended on it?

1920
01:41:54,220 --> 01:41:54,720
Shit.

1921
01:41:56,540 --> 01:42:06,380
I mean, I guess they're not from the same dimension as the rest of us.

1922
01:42:07,420 --> 01:42:08,060
I don't know.

1923
01:42:08,060 --> 01:42:13,580
You might be able to do something with the Hawke's device and I don't know,

1924
01:42:13,580 --> 01:42:17,420
just face certain types of matter.

1925
01:42:19,900 --> 01:42:21,660
It's not something I've ever tried doing.

1926
01:42:22,300 --> 01:42:23,020
Keep talking.

1927
01:42:23,660 --> 01:42:29,020
I know Hawke speculated about stuff like that, but I mean, he's gone.

1928
01:42:29,020 --> 01:42:32,700
Look, this story is currently open, OK?

1929
01:42:33,580 --> 01:42:35,740
But you're Sedgwick, right?

1930
01:42:36,380 --> 01:42:37,580
Yeah.

1931
01:42:38,460 --> 01:42:39,580
You're the closer.

1932
01:42:40,700 --> 01:42:44,540
I need you to close my story and give me back.

1933
01:42:45,900 --> 01:42:46,620
Me too.

1934
01:42:46,620 --> 01:42:48,460
Kira Sedgwick is the closer.

1935
01:42:49,740 --> 01:42:50,780
Every Tuesday night.

1936
01:42:50,780 --> 01:42:56,140
Wow, that was, I was so wondering where that was going.

1937
01:42:58,860 --> 01:43:03,820
I mean, it's lost on me, I'm afraid, but I'm not appreciatively.

1938
01:43:06,460 --> 01:43:07,980
It might as well be lost on me.

1939
01:43:08,620 --> 01:43:10,940
No one listening will get that reference.

1940
01:43:14,220 --> 01:43:16,540
Someone's mom will get that reference.

1941
01:43:20,620 --> 01:43:27,260
Yeah, I mean, we can try something, but, you know, this place is half trashed now.

1942
01:43:27,260 --> 01:43:29,500
I don't know that we're even going to get it working.

1943
01:43:29,500 --> 01:43:32,060
I mean, some idiot pulled the tank over.

1944
01:43:32,060 --> 01:43:33,820
There's water everywhere.

1945
01:43:33,820 --> 01:43:37,500
I'm sure it shorted out half the electrical circuits in here.

1946
01:43:37,500 --> 01:43:39,740
I don't know if we'd even get this working again.

1947
01:43:39,740 --> 01:43:45,020
Yes, the house is strange and things break.

1948
01:43:46,540 --> 01:43:48,220
That's not my shoulder talking.

1949
01:43:49,420 --> 01:43:50,540
That's the man behind me.

1950
01:43:51,500 --> 01:43:53,500
Yeah, I step out from behind, Frederick.

1951
01:43:53,500 --> 01:43:55,020
I'm back that you shot me.

1952
01:43:55,980 --> 01:43:56,460
Fuck you.

1953
01:43:59,980 --> 01:44:03,420
While you're having this conversation, let's just deal with Dr. Coons.

1954
01:44:04,540 --> 01:44:12,300
So Dr. Coons is running through the undergrowth, running through the darkness.

1955
01:44:12,300 --> 01:44:16,780
There's thorns and branches whipping past you, cutting your skin.

1956
01:44:17,740 --> 01:44:22,940
You can hear things moving in the darkness all around you.

1957
01:44:23,660 --> 01:44:27,740
You can feel the wet traces of things that you're brushing against.

1958
01:44:27,740 --> 01:44:31,020
And you don't know where you're going now.

1959
01:44:31,020 --> 01:44:33,180
You're just running blindly in a panic.

1960
01:44:33,820 --> 01:44:36,460
So I think what I'd like is a luck roll.

1961
01:44:38,300 --> 01:44:38,800
Okay.

1962
01:44:39,900 --> 01:44:40,400
Nope.

1963
01:44:41,260 --> 01:44:42,300
I've got zero of it.

1964
01:44:43,900 --> 01:44:45,820
You crashed the four-wheeler into a tree.

1965
01:44:49,340 --> 01:44:49,840
Okay.

1966
01:44:50,540 --> 01:44:54,540
So yeah, in all the undergrowth that you've been running through,

1967
01:44:55,180 --> 01:44:58,700
all of a sudden, your feet go out from under you.

1968
01:44:58,700 --> 01:45:02,060
And you realize that you've run into,

1969
01:45:02,060 --> 01:45:07,980
fallen into the remains of what was probably an ornamental pond out here,

1970
01:45:07,980 --> 01:45:12,460
and just gone splash into this filthy stagnant water.

1971
01:45:13,260 --> 01:45:18,140
I mean, the good news is that this suddenly brings you out of the panic you're in.

1972
01:45:18,140 --> 01:45:22,380
There's just this cold, this almost freezing splash of water in the face

1973
01:45:22,380 --> 01:45:27,900
just shocks you back to some kind of semi-coherent state of mind.

1974
01:45:28,540 --> 01:45:32,540
The bad news is that you're not sure that you're alone in here.

1975
01:45:36,780 --> 01:45:40,860
There is something big that you can't see just moving.

1976
01:45:40,860 --> 01:45:43,420
You can hear the water moving around you.

1977
01:45:43,420 --> 01:45:50,380
You can feel the currents of water from something a large moving in the darkness with you.

1978
01:45:50,380 --> 01:45:52,540
Can my feet touch the ground here?

1979
01:45:52,540 --> 01:45:53,740
Is it that shallow?

1980
01:45:53,740 --> 01:45:57,580
Yeah, it's not like a little ornamental pond.

1981
01:45:57,580 --> 01:46:05,420
I mean, this is one that they've obviously dug in the garden because it looks pretty.

1982
01:46:05,420 --> 01:46:09,580
But let's put this again down to a luck roll.

1983
01:46:09,580 --> 01:46:14,060
Are you somewhere in this pond that is shallow enough for you to stand up?

1984
01:46:14,940 --> 01:46:15,440
Nope.

1985
01:46:16,060 --> 01:46:16,560
Okay.

1986
01:46:18,220 --> 01:46:19,020
I got the zero.

1987
01:46:22,060 --> 01:46:23,260
Oh, oh dear.

1988
01:46:23,340 --> 01:46:24,620
Yes, of course you've got zero.

1989
01:46:25,420 --> 01:46:31,820
Well, your feet, they try to scrape for purchase.

1990
01:46:31,820 --> 01:46:36,140
And as you drop down, your head dips down below the surface.

1991
01:46:36,140 --> 01:46:41,500
You can feel the bottom, the muddy bottom of it down there, but it's just too far.

1992
01:46:41,500 --> 01:46:45,420
If you stand at the bottom, the water is just inches above your head.

1993
01:46:45,420 --> 01:46:48,380
Coombes is still in, even though he's kind of snapped out of it,

1994
01:46:48,380 --> 01:46:49,980
he's still in self-preservation mode.

1995
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:53,180
And so he's just going to try and swim to the nearest bank.

1996
01:46:53,180 --> 01:46:54,780
Try to get out of the water.

1997
01:46:54,780 --> 01:46:55,820
Maybe a little frenzied.

1998
01:46:55,820 --> 01:47:01,980
Then I think, yeah, you have one chance then to escape this presence in the pond

1999
01:47:01,980 --> 01:47:04,060
before it takes a lively interest in you.

2000
01:47:04,620 --> 01:47:06,220
And that will be a swim role.

2001
01:47:09,660 --> 01:47:12,220
I fail a 30 on a 10.

2002
01:47:12,860 --> 01:47:15,180
You don't get many opportunities these days to swim.

2003
01:47:15,180 --> 01:47:18,460
So you're probably a bit out of practice and you're splashing around in the water

2004
01:47:18,460 --> 01:47:19,740
and you're fully dressed as well.

2005
01:47:20,700 --> 01:47:24,860
They're pulling you down and just in the darkness, you don't have your bearings

2006
01:47:24,860 --> 01:47:26,380
and you're splashing around in the cold.

2007
01:47:26,380 --> 01:47:28,860
There's just the shock of being in this cold water.

2008
01:47:28,860 --> 01:47:34,700
But yeah, somehow, I mean, you splash around and you just get to the muddy edge of the pond.

2009
01:47:35,340 --> 01:47:37,020
But it is muddy, it's slippery.

2010
01:47:37,020 --> 01:47:41,980
You put your hand on it and you haven't managed to get close enough

2011
01:47:41,980 --> 01:47:47,740
for you to really get a grip on it before something starts wrapping itself around your neck.

2012
01:47:48,620 --> 01:47:55,580
It reaches up around your body, reaches up around your neck and it feels soft at first.

2013
01:47:56,620 --> 01:48:01,820
But then there are all these sharp bits that start digging in.

2014
01:48:07,020 --> 01:48:12,140
So I think let's give you one chance to break away from this

2015
01:48:13,180 --> 01:48:16,940
and put it down to an opposed strength roll between you and this creature

2016
01:48:17,500 --> 01:48:20,780
before it dines on you.

2017
01:48:22,460 --> 01:48:24,540
This opportunity comes once in a life.

2018
01:48:24,540 --> 01:48:27,660
I'm imagining this is like an evil cashmere scarf.

2019
01:48:30,620 --> 01:48:33,900
I pass a 38 on a 50.

2020
01:48:33,900 --> 01:48:37,500
Okay, yeah, I got an 18 on the 60.

2021
01:48:37,500 --> 01:48:40,540
So that's a hard success versus your ordinary one.

2022
01:48:41,260 --> 01:48:41,500
Yep.

2023
01:48:42,220 --> 01:48:47,980
Looking at this in cinematic terms, we just sort of see this last glimpse of Dr. Coombes

2024
01:48:47,980 --> 01:48:51,340
as he reaches for the banks, his fingers digging into the mud.

2025
01:48:52,220 --> 01:48:57,420
And then suddenly there is this violent motion and he disappears below the surface.

2026
01:48:57,980 --> 01:49:00,300
There is a brief disturbance.

2027
01:49:00,300 --> 01:49:06,700
There's bubbles that come up and a little froth of something that's not water.

2028
01:49:06,700 --> 01:49:10,780
But then the water goes very still again and stays that way.

2029
01:49:12,140 --> 01:49:14,300
So, meanwhile, with the rest of you.

2030
01:49:18,700 --> 01:49:20,300
Oh my God, dude.

2031
01:49:21,340 --> 01:49:21,740
Yes.

2032
01:49:23,340 --> 01:49:23,660
Rip.

2033
01:49:27,100 --> 01:49:28,140
So, yeah.

2034
01:49:28,140 --> 01:49:29,340
Thomas, can you play Taps?

2035
01:49:34,780 --> 01:49:36,140
Is that what you do when people die?

2036
01:49:36,140 --> 01:49:42,380
That's what they do at the end of the day at the army party.

2037
01:49:43,260 --> 01:49:44,540
Well, that's every day, baby.

2038
01:49:47,580 --> 01:49:50,380
Back at the lab, you have Sedgwick at gunpoint.

2039
01:49:50,380 --> 01:49:52,860
You were discussing what to do.

2040
01:49:54,060 --> 01:49:56,380
Rosslyn had made his presence known.

2041
01:49:57,340 --> 01:50:00,700
Dolan at this stage, I think, is beginning to come around.

2042
01:50:00,700 --> 01:50:04,940
I mean, you've been half awake for a few moments, but you're beginning to get your senses back.

2043
01:50:05,820 --> 01:50:08,540
That your head hurts like a motherfucker.

2044
01:50:09,260 --> 01:50:13,820
But your thoughts are beginning to come back together into something coherent.

2045
01:50:14,940 --> 01:50:15,900
Ow!

2046
01:50:15,900 --> 01:50:17,580
Fucking role playing, dude.

2047
01:50:17,580 --> 01:50:21,180
That's Thomas Dolan's main overwhelming thought.

2048
01:50:21,180 --> 01:50:23,900
Yeah, I mean, this is serious.

2049
01:50:23,900 --> 01:50:30,140
I mean, whatever he's done to you, I mean, as you're feeling the wound and it's not just a cut,

2050
01:50:30,140 --> 01:50:35,420
but you're certain that there's bits of your skull moving under your fingers that aren't

2051
01:50:36,300 --> 01:50:37,180
supposed to move.

2052
01:50:39,020 --> 01:50:41,180
But on the bright side, you do know a doctor.

2053
01:50:41,180 --> 01:50:43,980
As long as you can get to him and you should be fine.

2054
01:50:47,340 --> 01:50:48,940
We are so lucky.

2055
01:50:48,940 --> 01:50:51,180
We're so lucky we brought Nathan Coombes along.

2056
01:50:51,180 --> 01:50:53,020
He's just as good as a hospital.

2057
01:50:53,340 --> 01:51:00,700
I look down at him in Carl's head, he thinks he looks bad.

2058
01:51:00,700 --> 01:51:01,820
I'm a doctor.

2059
01:51:05,180 --> 01:51:06,700
Trust me, I'm a physicist.

2060
01:51:11,020 --> 01:51:16,620
OK, yeah, give me a first aid roll to see whether you can at least keep a skull in one piece.

2061
01:51:17,500 --> 01:51:20,300
Yeah, I'm not that kind of doctor.

2062
01:51:23,900 --> 01:51:26,700
Yeah, I think this is...

2063
01:51:26,700 --> 01:51:28,460
69 on a 40.

2064
01:51:28,460 --> 01:51:29,020
Oh, that's a criticism.

2065
01:51:29,020 --> 01:51:29,740
Wait, what?

2066
01:51:29,740 --> 01:51:31,340
Are we doing that?

2067
01:51:31,340 --> 01:51:31,980
Oh, yeah.

2068
01:51:31,980 --> 01:51:33,420
Did he fucking roll a 69?

2069
01:51:33,420 --> 01:51:34,380
Success, then.

2070
01:51:39,020 --> 01:51:40,700
You are that kind of doctor, baby.

2071
01:51:40,700 --> 01:51:42,140
I am that kind of doctor.

2072
01:51:43,180 --> 01:51:44,380
You're that kind of doctor.

2073
01:51:44,380 --> 01:51:47,180
So you're 69ing Thomas Dolan back to health, then?

2074
01:51:49,900 --> 01:51:50,300
Yes.

2075
01:51:53,660 --> 01:51:56,620
Yeah, he's reinflating.

2076
01:51:56,620 --> 01:51:58,940
He bends over and reinflates me from the other end.

2077
01:52:03,020 --> 01:52:03,820
OK, yeah, yeah.

2078
01:52:04,700 --> 01:52:06,060
Going with your house rule, then.

2079
01:52:06,060 --> 01:52:06,780
Yeah, we need to...

2080
01:52:07,420 --> 01:52:08,860
This house does not rule.

2081
01:52:11,660 --> 01:52:15,660
Well, you can rip up a bit of clothing and just create a bandage to at least

2082
01:52:16,620 --> 01:52:18,620
stop his head getting any worse.

2083
01:52:18,620 --> 01:52:22,220
I mean, he is going to need proper medical attention at some stage.

2084
01:52:22,940 --> 01:52:27,260
But at least you can get him to the stage where he can move around without it being

2085
01:52:27,260 --> 01:52:28,060
life threatening.

2086
01:52:28,060 --> 01:52:33,420
I'll pull my lighter out and cauterize his wound and then wrap it up with my sleeve.

2087
01:52:36,460 --> 01:52:43,420
I'll pick a lighter can cauterize wounds, but you definitely set my hair on fire.

2088
01:52:46,300 --> 01:52:48,300
It smells glorious.

2089
01:52:48,300 --> 01:52:49,340
No, it's all right.

2090
01:52:49,340 --> 01:52:50,540
It doesn't set your hair on fire.

2091
01:52:50,540 --> 01:52:52,620
There's too much blood in your hair for it to catch.

2092
01:52:53,660 --> 01:52:54,860
Just kind of singes it.

2093
01:53:01,340 --> 01:53:05,420
And you do get one hit point back as well for the first aid.

2094
01:53:05,420 --> 01:53:05,820
Four.

2095
01:53:08,220 --> 01:53:08,940
No, three.

2096
01:53:10,220 --> 01:53:11,500
I'm at three, baby.

2097
01:53:11,500 --> 01:53:12,860
Heck yeah, me too.

2098
01:53:12,860 --> 01:53:16,780
Now, meanwhile, Freddy has got Sedgwick at gunpoint.

2099
01:53:16,780 --> 01:53:19,820
You've been talking to him about the situation.

2100
01:53:20,460 --> 01:53:27,020
Look, OK, if you give me a hand getting all this stuff working again, I don't know.

2101
01:53:27,820 --> 01:53:32,460
I mean, with all the damage Brink did here, I don't know whether we're going to get it

2102
01:53:32,460 --> 01:53:33,260
working again.

2103
01:53:33,260 --> 01:53:36,300
But if we can, I don't know.

2104
01:53:36,300 --> 01:53:40,380
I mean, maybe we can get these parasites out of you.

2105
01:53:40,380 --> 01:53:48,460
But there's a good chance that it's all going to go horribly wrong.

2106
01:53:48,460 --> 01:53:51,660
And you're just going to get lost there.

2107
01:53:52,620 --> 01:53:53,900
You willing to take that risk?

2108
01:53:54,540 --> 01:53:55,040
Yeah.

2109
01:53:55,340 --> 01:53:56,940
Did you go to university?

2110
01:53:56,940 --> 01:53:57,440
Yeah.

2111
01:53:58,860 --> 01:54:00,380
Let's give it the old college try.

2112
01:54:00,380 --> 01:54:01,420
Carl, get in here.

2113
01:54:02,060 --> 01:54:04,860
I got a psychic back here.

2114
01:54:04,860 --> 01:54:07,020
He says I helped build all this.

2115
01:54:07,020 --> 01:54:09,660
I was Hawks' lab assistant.

2116
01:54:09,660 --> 01:54:11,420
Well, now you got two extra hands.

2117
01:54:11,420 --> 01:54:12,940
You asked for a hand with it.

2118
01:54:12,940 --> 01:54:14,540
I've got a gun pointed at you.

2119
01:54:14,540 --> 01:54:16,220
That's all I'm doing this whole time.

2120
01:54:17,100 --> 01:54:19,100
What is the plan?

2121
01:54:19,100 --> 01:54:22,460
You are helping this gentleman fix me.

2122
01:54:22,460 --> 01:54:23,420
I need fixed, too.

2123
01:54:24,540 --> 01:54:28,380
Look, and I hold up my arm and it's crawling around.

2124
01:54:29,020 --> 01:54:31,500
He says, yeah, I've seen those before.

2125
01:54:31,500 --> 01:54:34,700
They'll suck the life out of you within a day or two.

2126
01:54:34,700 --> 01:54:37,660
Well, good thing that we're not taking any breaks.

2127
01:54:37,660 --> 01:54:44,540
Look, OK, if you can help me fix the damage here, work around any short circuits,

2128
01:54:45,020 --> 01:54:48,060
you know, rewire anything that needs to be rewired.

2129
01:54:50,620 --> 01:54:55,740
We can try, but look, I understand how to make this thing work.

2130
01:54:55,740 --> 01:54:57,980
I understand the basics of it.

2131
01:54:58,940 --> 01:55:02,220
I don't know if I can adapt it to do what you're talking about.

2132
01:55:05,500 --> 01:55:06,620
I mean, do it or die.

2133
01:55:08,300 --> 01:55:12,860
OK, well, does anyone know anything about wiring?

2134
01:55:12,860 --> 01:55:13,980
We both do.

2135
01:55:13,980 --> 01:55:16,940
Yes, I've been I've turned the portal on before.

2136
01:55:17,580 --> 01:55:27,260
So, yes, I know about, you know, I read about 25 percent of an electrical repair handbook

2137
01:55:27,260 --> 01:55:29,820
one time, but I internalized all of that.

2138
01:55:30,460 --> 01:55:37,340
I would say I have exactly 25 percent of a master's skill in electrical repair.

2139
01:55:37,660 --> 01:55:45,420
Well, I think then one of you can take the lead in this rewiring job, and I guess it's

2140
01:55:45,420 --> 01:55:46,620
probably going to be Dr.

2141
01:55:46,620 --> 01:55:49,740
Rothstein unless you want to play on hard mode.

2142
01:55:52,220 --> 01:55:57,260
So then let's have an electrical repair roll off Dr.

2143
01:55:57,260 --> 01:56:00,460
Rothstein just to see whether you can repair the electrics.

2144
01:56:02,140 --> 01:56:04,060
OK, I got it pretty good.

2145
01:56:04,860 --> 01:56:05,340
Damn it.

2146
01:56:06,220 --> 01:56:07,820
92 on a 60.

2147
01:56:07,820 --> 01:56:09,260
God damn it.

2148
01:56:09,260 --> 01:56:16,380
Yeah, the problem with it is that, yeah, I mean, when he pulled this tank over and emptied

2149
01:56:16,380 --> 01:56:20,300
all this water across here, that it has fried a lot of the circuits.

2150
01:56:21,100 --> 01:56:26,300
And now that it's been here for a while, it's seeped in, you might be able to take some

2151
01:56:26,300 --> 01:56:26,940
shortcuts.

2152
01:56:26,940 --> 01:56:30,140
You might be able to just bypass entire sections of it.

2153
01:56:30,140 --> 01:56:33,020
But, you know, this is an unfamiliar device.

2154
01:56:33,420 --> 01:56:35,580
You don't know what effects that might have.

2155
01:56:36,300 --> 01:56:38,780
You could push the roll if you want and try doing that.

2156
01:56:38,780 --> 01:56:40,220
I'm going to push the roll.

2157
01:56:41,020 --> 01:56:46,620
I find two exposed wires and look at them and push them together.

2158
01:56:46,620 --> 01:56:51,420
And, uh, 90.

2159
01:56:51,420 --> 01:56:53,420
What, really?

2160
01:56:56,700 --> 01:56:57,340
OK.

2161
01:56:57,660 --> 01:57:10,220
OK, so let's have it play out like this, that you don't realize how spectacularly you

2162
01:57:10,220 --> 01:57:15,100
fucked this all up until Sedgwick switches the machine back on.

2163
01:57:17,660 --> 01:57:19,100
Sedgwick, don't talk like that.

2164
01:57:19,100 --> 01:57:22,220
I have the utmost confidence in this man right here.

2165
01:57:22,220 --> 01:57:22,620
Dr.

2166
01:57:22,620 --> 01:57:26,700
Rothstein's the smartest, most capable doctor.

2167
01:57:27,020 --> 01:57:28,540
I mean, he can see the future.

2168
01:57:28,540 --> 01:57:29,660
He's a psychic.

2169
01:57:29,660 --> 01:57:31,580
So I don't want to hear any of this.

2170
01:57:31,580 --> 01:57:32,860
Oh, can he do it?

2171
01:57:32,860 --> 01:57:34,060
Can he do it?

2172
01:57:34,060 --> 01:57:35,340
Obviously, he got it right.

2173
01:57:36,060 --> 01:57:40,700
I mean, Sedgwick's really impressed when he hears Rothstein saying, what, you're Dr.

2174
01:57:40,700 --> 01:57:41,980
Rothstein of the Miskatonic.

2175
01:57:42,540 --> 01:57:43,500
I've read your papers.

2176
01:57:43,500 --> 01:57:44,700
I'm sorry.

2177
01:57:44,700 --> 01:57:46,140
You should have said who you were.

2178
01:57:48,300 --> 01:57:51,020
Oh, well, you know, I, I, uh,

2179
01:57:51,020 --> 01:58:01,020
I, you know, I know my name carries a lot of weight, but I try not to throw it around.

2180
01:58:01,820 --> 01:58:04,540
You know, I want people to like me for me.

2181
01:58:11,580 --> 01:58:12,700
Well, all right.

2182
01:58:12,700 --> 01:58:16,060
I mean, obviously, yes, I mean, I'll take your word for it.

2183
01:58:16,460 --> 01:58:21,340
If you think this is all going to work now, then yeah, let's power it up.

2184
01:58:21,340 --> 01:58:26,940
Well, as you know, I'm a fucking genius, so there's nothing can go wrong here.

2185
01:58:28,060 --> 01:58:28,620
Good.

2186
01:58:28,620 --> 01:58:29,420
Good, good, good.

2187
01:58:29,420 --> 01:58:31,580
Oh, I feel better about this already then.

2188
01:58:32,220 --> 01:58:37,900
All right, gentlemen, stay outside the circle for safety, but we should be all right to

2189
01:58:37,900 --> 01:58:38,940
turn it on now.

2190
01:58:38,940 --> 01:58:40,220
I give a big thumbs up.

2191
01:58:42,620 --> 01:58:45,820
And with that, Sedgwick throws the knife lever.

2192
01:58:46,300 --> 01:58:48,220
And it all sparks into life.

2193
01:58:49,020 --> 01:58:54,060
Unfortunately, one of the things that you seem to have shorted or at least worked

2194
01:58:54,060 --> 01:58:56,860
around is this containment ring.

2195
01:58:59,660 --> 01:59:00,460
Yes.

2196
01:59:00,460 --> 01:59:07,260
You see this rip in reality form within the ring and spread out to the extent of the

2197
01:59:07,260 --> 01:59:08,780
ring as it did before.

2198
01:59:09,980 --> 01:59:11,820
But this time it doesn't stop.

2199
01:59:12,380 --> 01:59:16,140
And more than that, it is accelerating.

2200
01:59:16,140 --> 01:59:21,980
I mean, even before you have a chance to turn and start running and leaving the lab, it

2201
01:59:21,980 --> 01:59:23,340
is just spreading out.

2202
01:59:23,340 --> 01:59:30,300
Sedgwick is screaming in terror as he just sees the world around him changing and being

2203
01:59:30,300 --> 01:59:33,660
consumed by these alien dimensions crashing in.

2204
01:59:34,380 --> 01:59:41,100
You can see the ground around you changing into something that's not quite a marsh, but

2205
01:59:41,100 --> 01:59:44,220
maybe a marsh is the closest thing that your brain can make of it.

2206
01:59:44,940 --> 01:59:46,540
And there are things in it.

2207
01:59:46,540 --> 01:59:48,380
There are things all over the place.

2208
01:59:48,380 --> 01:59:53,100
You look around for the door, for the laboratory and the walls, but they're not anywhere

2209
01:59:53,100 --> 01:59:53,340
now.

2210
01:59:53,340 --> 01:59:58,220
There's just this marsh that's spreading out and these strange clouds and these things

2211
01:59:58,220 --> 02:00:01,180
moving through the air and moving through the liquid around you.

2212
02:00:02,220 --> 02:00:08,860
And there are the large things, the large things that you're one of which you saw coming

2213
02:00:08,860 --> 02:00:10,940
before and you managed to switch the machine off.

2214
02:00:11,100 --> 02:00:18,060
But now you realize that's just one of a herd and they have you surrounded.

2215
02:00:18,620 --> 02:00:24,540
Sedgwick is looking around in panic, trying to switch the device off, but the device isn't

2216
02:00:24,540 --> 02:00:25,340
there anymore.

2217
02:00:25,340 --> 02:00:26,940
The switch isn't there anymore.

2218
02:00:27,900 --> 02:00:29,260
There is nothing to turn off.

2219
02:00:30,300 --> 02:00:38,860
And just with a look of absolute defeat, he just collapses down into the muck and starts

2220
02:00:38,860 --> 02:00:39,340
crying.

2221
02:00:40,220 --> 02:00:41,340
What do the rest of you do?

2222
02:00:41,340 --> 02:00:43,500
I want to start running out of the room.

2223
02:00:44,620 --> 02:00:45,900
There isn't a room anymore.

2224
02:00:47,180 --> 02:00:47,820
What room?

2225
02:00:51,660 --> 02:00:51,900
Yeah.

2226
02:00:53,100 --> 02:00:54,300
How do you want to go out?

2227
02:00:55,740 --> 02:00:56,700
That's pretty much it.

2228
02:00:57,660 --> 02:00:57,980
Yeah.

2229
02:00:58,700 --> 02:01:02,220
I turn to Freddy and how many bullets are left?

2230
02:01:02,780 --> 02:01:03,900
I got two.

2231
02:01:03,900 --> 02:01:06,140
I hear that and I grab the gun and say,

2232
02:01:06,940 --> 02:01:09,180
nobody puts Carl in a portal.

2233
02:01:09,180 --> 02:01:10,460
And I shoot myself.

2234
02:01:14,620 --> 02:01:17,340
Rock, paper, scissors, Thomas Dolan for the last bullet.

2235
02:01:17,900 --> 02:01:18,300
Yeah.

2236
02:01:18,300 --> 02:01:22,700
I was definitely going to say we let Carl die, but he took that away from us.

2237
02:01:22,700 --> 02:01:26,060
So he was never a good person.

2238
02:01:28,300 --> 02:01:28,940
Three, two, one.

2239
02:01:28,940 --> 02:01:29,740
Shoot.

2240
02:01:29,740 --> 02:01:30,220
Okay.

2241
02:01:30,220 --> 02:01:31,180
This is a paper.

2242
02:01:31,980 --> 02:01:32,460
You win.

2243
02:01:33,020 --> 02:01:33,420
Yep.

2244
02:01:33,420 --> 02:01:34,620
Oh, I threw paper.

2245
02:01:34,620 --> 02:01:35,500
He threw rock.

2246
02:01:36,380 --> 02:01:42,060
And, uh, Frederick Millen the first takes the gun in his hands and holds it up to the

2247
02:01:42,060 --> 02:01:45,820
skull of Thomas Dolan and is like, you're welcome and fires.

2248
02:01:50,140 --> 02:01:56,220
The last thing that comes across Thomas Dolan's face is just a look of pure gratitude and

2249
02:01:56,220 --> 02:01:56,620
relief.

2250
02:01:59,020 --> 02:02:00,060
He was a good man.

2251
02:02:00,060 --> 02:02:11,180
And with that, the herd closes in and when they feed upon you, it isn't like, it isn't

2252
02:02:11,180 --> 02:02:15,740
like they just tear you apart and, and digest you or anything like that.

2253
02:02:15,740 --> 02:02:21,340
There's, there's a part of you that is now forever within them, just they're still

2254
02:02:21,340 --> 02:02:21,900
conscious.

2255
02:02:22,700 --> 02:02:29,900
And you can see, you get this realization that, you know, when

2256
02:02:30,140 --> 02:02:34,140
hawks broke free, that it wasn't just hawks that came back.

2257
02:02:34,140 --> 02:02:39,980
It was one of these things as well that had basically assumed the identity of hawks or

2258
02:02:39,980 --> 02:02:44,060
assumed his memories the way that they're now assuming yours.

2259
02:02:44,700 --> 02:02:46,540
And, and of course, Edgwick's.

2260
02:02:47,420 --> 02:02:48,940
And who knows?

2261
02:02:48,940 --> 02:02:54,460
I mean, maybe, maybe if someone ever repairs the device and fires it up again, you can

2262
02:02:54,460 --> 02:02:55,980
find a house of your own one day.

2263
02:02:59,900 --> 02:03:03,340
Oh my God.

2264
02:03:03,340 --> 02:03:09,420
That was his house would be hungry, but my house would be full of regret.

2265
02:03:12,060 --> 02:03:13,740
I should have killed myself.

2266
02:03:13,740 --> 02:03:15,020
Should have killed myself.

2267
02:03:16,460 --> 02:03:18,460
You threw paper, you dumb idiot.

2268
02:03:18,460 --> 02:03:20,300
Of course you should have killed yourself.

2269
02:03:26,140 --> 02:03:27,580
Dude, what the fuck?

2270
02:03:28,380 --> 02:03:29,420
That was dope.

2271
02:03:30,780 --> 02:03:31,340
Hell yeah.

2272
02:03:34,780 --> 02:03:35,900
Oh, thank you.

2273
02:03:35,900 --> 02:03:36,620
I'm glad you like it.

2274
02:03:36,620 --> 02:03:37,180
Thank you, Scott.

2275
02:03:37,980 --> 02:03:38,700
Thank you so much.

2276
02:03:38,700 --> 02:03:41,100
That was incredible.

2277
02:03:41,100 --> 02:03:41,900
Holy shit.

2278
02:03:42,940 --> 02:03:44,540
Jesus Christ.

2279
02:03:44,540 --> 02:03:46,940
I really thought we were going to get out of there, Scott-free.

2280
02:03:53,740 --> 02:03:58,540
I don't think I've ever seen an entire party wiped out by a failed push attempt on electrical

2281
02:03:58,540 --> 02:03:59,580
repair before.

2282
02:03:59,580 --> 02:04:10,220
That's so good.

2283
02:04:10,220 --> 02:04:11,340
Oh my God.

2284
02:04:14,300 --> 02:04:21,260
That was, I can't, I can't, I can't say enough how much fun that was and how, how horrible

2285
02:04:21,260 --> 02:04:21,740
that was.

2286
02:04:22,620 --> 02:04:25,740
Good, as I said, I'm really glad you liked it.

2287
02:04:25,740 --> 02:04:27,900
I had an absolute blast running it for you.

2288
02:04:27,900 --> 02:04:29,180
It was a blast to play it.

2289
02:04:29,900 --> 02:04:30,460
Super fun.

2290
02:04:33,020 --> 02:04:40,380
Now, I mean, I could tell you all my favorite parts, but I am very curious about the behind

2291
02:04:40,380 --> 02:04:41,980
the scenes on this scenario.

2292
02:04:41,980 --> 02:04:48,620
I guess I could just fucking read it, but can you give us a rundown of what the fuck

2293
02:04:48,620 --> 02:04:49,260
was going on?

2294
02:04:49,260 --> 02:04:51,020
I'm very curious about two things.

2295
02:04:51,900 --> 02:04:57,420
One, the faceless man, part of it, me thinks that, you know, having a kerchief covering

2296
02:04:57,420 --> 02:05:02,540
all the mouths might, might be a faceless being, but the puppets.

2297
02:05:02,540 --> 02:05:04,460
The puppet is what I was wondering about too.

2298
02:05:04,460 --> 02:05:05,420
Yeah, okay.

2299
02:05:05,420 --> 02:05:09,740
The puppet was that skinned monkey thing you found floating in the tank.

2300
02:05:09,740 --> 02:05:10,540
Fucking shit.

2301
02:05:10,540 --> 02:05:10,860
Okay.

2302
02:05:10,860 --> 02:05:13,580
I wondered if it might be that, but I didn't know its purpose still.

2303
02:05:13,580 --> 02:05:15,180
Did they bring it into the camp?

2304
02:05:15,180 --> 02:05:16,460
Camp with them for some reason?

2305
02:05:16,460 --> 02:05:20,460
So it's one of these creatures that they pulled out from the other dimension.

2306
02:05:20,460 --> 02:05:26,940
And what the way it works is when they come into the camp, they wear earplugs of wax and

2307
02:05:27,020 --> 02:05:30,700
they have this thing that they, one of them just carries on his arm.

2308
02:05:30,700 --> 02:05:37,500
And when they want to basically knock people out, they just stick a pin in it and make

2309
02:05:37,500 --> 02:05:38,220
it scream.

2310
02:05:38,220 --> 02:05:43,740
And it's scream just sort of drives people temporarily into madness and unconsciousness.

2311
02:05:43,740 --> 02:05:44,380
Nice.

2312
02:05:46,060 --> 02:05:47,820
Oh, that's so dope.

2313
02:05:47,820 --> 02:05:49,100
How many of them are there?

2314
02:05:49,100 --> 02:05:49,820
Them.

2315
02:05:49,820 --> 02:05:50,620
Capital T.

2316
02:05:50,620 --> 02:05:51,500
There were four.

2317
02:05:51,820 --> 02:05:57,900
So I mean, there's a whole other strand if you go into the town and start trying to dig

2318
02:05:57,900 --> 02:06:01,580
around there and get some information about what might have happened.

2319
02:06:02,300 --> 02:06:03,660
That basically-

2320
02:06:03,660 --> 02:06:04,460
Why would we do that?

2321
02:06:06,460 --> 02:06:09,260
It depends which characters you have, but yes.

2322
02:06:09,980 --> 02:06:14,540
But yeah, I mean, it doesn't happen very often, but it's definitely an option.

2323
02:06:15,180 --> 02:06:20,620
There are these four guys, I mean three initially, so it's Sedgwick who started it all off.

2324
02:06:21,260 --> 02:06:26,620
So when Aston Hawks disappeared, Sedgwick took over possession of the device, the Hawks

2325
02:06:26,620 --> 02:06:27,100
device.

2326
02:06:27,740 --> 02:06:33,020
And he realized that some of these creatures they were pulling back, this species 17,

2327
02:06:33,020 --> 02:06:37,980
would basically siphon, in Call of Cthulhu terms, luck off people.

2328
02:06:37,980 --> 02:06:42,940
So it would siphon some power and certainly luck and allow you to transfer it from one

2329
02:06:42,940 --> 02:06:43,740
person to another.

2330
02:06:44,540 --> 02:06:51,340
So basically, he and a few friends were using this in a predatory manner going into initially

2331
02:06:51,340 --> 02:06:55,340
targeting people they just didn't like, business rivals or people who were snooping into their

2332
02:06:55,340 --> 02:06:56,540
affairs and stuff like that.

2333
02:06:57,580 --> 02:07:03,660
This was why so many people in the camp, their lives had basically collapsed because Sedgwick

2334
02:07:03,660 --> 02:07:06,940
and his friends had basically been sucking all the luck out of their lives.

2335
02:07:06,940 --> 02:07:07,440
Damn.

2336
02:07:08,160 --> 02:07:14,160
They just carried on doing that and, you know, using the luck to play the stock market and

2337
02:07:14,160 --> 02:07:17,040
make themselves wealthy even during the Great Depression.

2338
02:07:17,040 --> 02:07:22,880
And so basically, yeah, I mean, every one of the camp is basically their cattle.

2339
02:07:24,640 --> 02:07:30,240
The previous night, they'd taken these two kids back to, you know, they'd taken Billy

2340
02:07:30,240 --> 02:07:36,480
and Esther back to the Hawks mansion to try to siphon some luck out of them.

2341
02:07:37,520 --> 02:07:41,840
And that was the point at which they'd lost containment on the ring, which had already

2342
02:07:41,840 --> 02:07:43,120
been playing up a bit.

2343
02:07:43,120 --> 02:07:47,200
And basically, Hawks got out and possessed the house and other things happened.

2344
02:07:47,200 --> 02:07:51,600
And they ran away and left the kids in prison downstairs and just thought, fuck this for

2345
02:07:51,600 --> 02:07:56,960
a game of soldiers, ran off and were making plans basically to leave town and abandon

2346
02:07:56,960 --> 02:07:58,400
all this before it got any worse.

2347
02:07:59,040 --> 02:07:59,600
That's great.

2348
02:08:01,600 --> 02:08:06,160
How widespread is the radius of the breach?

2349
02:08:07,120 --> 02:08:11,120
It had been breaching for a while, which is why some of the things have been creeping

2350
02:08:11,120 --> 02:08:13,040
out and infesting the house and so on.

2351
02:08:13,040 --> 02:08:20,720
But the big breach that let Hawks out was just the previous day and it was just big

2352
02:08:20,720 --> 02:08:22,080
enough to reach the house.

2353
02:08:22,080 --> 02:08:24,960
What about when we did it?

2354
02:08:24,960 --> 02:08:29,760
Yeah, I was like, you don't have to tell us if Esther's okay or not.

2355
02:08:29,760 --> 02:08:30,560
We can leave that.

2356
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,320
I think, yeah, let's leave that as a question mark.

2357
02:08:34,400 --> 02:08:39,040
But I don't fancy your odds.

2358
02:08:40,400 --> 02:08:46,160
Is there in your mind a success scenario once we've been infected by the new species?

2359
02:08:46,160 --> 02:08:52,480
Yeah, if someone does have the wherewithal to start making modifications to the Hawks

2360
02:08:52,480 --> 02:08:58,480
device, you can do what Sedgwick suggested and basically use it to sort of phase extraterrestrial

2361
02:08:58,480 --> 02:09:00,960
matter out of your own body and remove the parasites that way.

2362
02:09:01,920 --> 02:09:05,360
Yeah, there may be other methods that I haven't thought of.

2363
02:09:05,360 --> 02:09:08,640
I'm always open to creative solutions, but that's the one that occurred to me.

2364
02:09:09,680 --> 02:09:15,200
It was just really unfortunate that that result in a failed push-draw.

2365
02:09:15,760 --> 02:09:19,600
Because otherwise it might have saved you all, but instead, no.

2366
02:09:20,800 --> 02:09:21,920
That would have been boring.

2367
02:09:21,920 --> 02:09:23,920
Yeah, it's so much better when it turns out this way.

2368
02:09:25,760 --> 02:09:27,760
It's a much cleaner finish.

2369
02:09:27,760 --> 02:09:36,880
I guess technically another way to get rid of the wombs, just get eaten by the house

2370
02:09:36,880 --> 02:09:38,560
and then you don't have to worry about it.

2371
02:09:39,760 --> 02:09:44,880
So what was your reasoning on the house?

2372
02:09:45,440 --> 02:09:49,920
So basically, the way that these parasites have been coming out and infesting people

2373
02:09:49,920 --> 02:09:54,160
and so on, he basically did the same thing but as this monstrous entity.

2374
02:09:54,880 --> 02:10:00,800
He'd been fused with one of these giant things that you saw lumbering around and that

2375
02:10:00,800 --> 02:10:02,000
basically did the same thing.

2376
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:05,520
It became a parasitic infection in the house and fused with it.

2377
02:10:05,520 --> 02:10:06,400
That's so cool.

2378
02:10:07,360 --> 02:10:14,880
So it could be like any inanimate object could be fused with a person?

2379
02:10:14,880 --> 02:10:16,240
Or animate ones, yeah.

2380
02:10:16,880 --> 02:10:18,320
Yeah, shit dude.

2381
02:10:19,280 --> 02:10:20,080
Oh, okay.

2382
02:10:21,040 --> 02:10:28,000
So the marsh essentially that was once the garden where Thomas Dolan found that guy,

2383
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,080
that was from the breach the night before?

2384
02:10:30,080 --> 02:10:37,280
Yeah, so the guy that you found in the garden was basically a drifter who'd come into the

2385
02:10:37,280 --> 02:10:43,200
house, was basically looking for something to loot and had been attacked by the parasites

2386
02:10:43,200 --> 02:10:43,760
in the garden.

2387
02:10:43,760 --> 02:10:45,840
They basically just drained him.

2388
02:10:45,920 --> 02:10:51,280
So that was like a some foreshadowing of what was going to happen to you if you didn't

2389
02:10:51,280 --> 02:10:52,880
manage to get the parasites out?

2390
02:10:52,880 --> 02:10:56,000
Yeah, and it was well done.

2391
02:10:56,000 --> 02:11:01,680
And while over the past, I mean, you mentioned earlier, we had three weeks in between knowing

2392
02:11:01,680 --> 02:11:06,080
that we had parasites under our skin and dealing with today.

2393
02:11:06,720 --> 02:11:14,320
And I just kept thinking about that guy the whole time and being like, I think we're

2394
02:11:14,320 --> 02:11:14,820
fucked.

2395
02:11:17,280 --> 02:11:21,680
Was the the creature in the pond then was also from that first breach, right?

2396
02:11:21,680 --> 02:11:22,800
Yeah, yeah.

2397
02:11:22,800 --> 02:11:27,520
Yeah, I mean, I mean, a lot of the smaller things had kind of crawled out there.

2398
02:11:27,520 --> 02:11:32,880
But yeah, the big breach offered a chance for some larger nasties to get out.

2399
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:39,200
If you got to, if you could go on a date with one of our characters, which one?

2400
02:11:39,200 --> 02:11:44,560
Asking the real questions.

2401
02:11:45,440 --> 02:11:46,720
I'm a very generous lover.

2402
02:11:46,720 --> 02:11:47,520
I'll take you all.

2403
02:11:53,520 --> 02:12:00,640
Oh, man, nothing said after what I'm saying now will be on the episodes because we just

2404
02:12:00,640 --> 02:12:04,800
finished the recorded episodes of this collaboration.

2405
02:12:05,520 --> 02:12:06,320
On a high note.

2406
02:12:06,320 --> 02:12:15,440
If you were going to take our characters to your favorite date spot in New Bradwell or

2407
02:12:15,440 --> 02:12:17,040
Milton Keynes, where would we go?

2408
02:12:17,840 --> 02:12:18,720
Oh, gosh.

2409
02:12:19,920 --> 02:12:21,440
Remember, this is a party of five.

2410
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:22,500
Yeah.

2411
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:33,280
If you wanted some excitement, we have an indoor skydiving place in Milton Keynes.

2412
02:12:33,280 --> 02:12:34,320
There we go.

2413
02:12:34,320 --> 02:12:34,880
Hell yeah.

2414
02:12:35,600 --> 02:12:38,240
Nothing gets my blood to the edge like...

2415
02:12:39,600 --> 02:12:45,280
Okay, so bachelor number one, if I was a salad, what kind of dressing would you put on me?

2416
02:12:46,560 --> 02:12:48,000
That's a bit personal, isn't it?

2417
02:12:54,400 --> 02:12:55,120
Oh my God.

2418
02:12:55,120 --> 02:12:58,320
I would say ranch because it's not legal and I'm a bad boy.

2419
02:13:05,280 --> 02:13:09,200
Scott, thank you so much for running this game.

2420
02:13:09,200 --> 02:13:10,160
This was so much fun.

2421
02:13:10,160 --> 02:13:11,680
Oh, my absolute pleasure.

2422
02:13:11,680 --> 02:13:12,800
Yeah, thank you very much.

2423
02:13:12,800 --> 02:13:16,400
I don't think it's too forward to say that we're going to miss you.

2424
02:13:16,400 --> 02:13:16,720
I know.

2425
02:13:16,720 --> 02:13:20,480
Well, I mean, if you ever want to do something like this again, I'm definitely up for it.

2426
02:13:20,480 --> 02:13:24,720
Oh, I mean, your words and eyes, we'll see you soon.

2427
02:13:24,720 --> 02:13:25,840
We'll see you tomorrow morning.

2428
02:13:28,080 --> 02:13:30,880
But for real, that was fucking awesome.

2429
02:13:31,760 --> 02:13:33,760
Actually, oh, I'm really glad you enjoyed it.

2430
02:13:33,840 --> 02:13:39,520
Life surreal in retrospect, a dream.

2431
02:13:40,480 --> 02:13:46,400
Easy times feel less than serene.

2432
02:13:46,400 --> 02:13:53,760
In the moment it's hard to count your blessings.

2433
02:13:53,760 --> 02:14:13,760
So we long for days gone past us, grief and strife, but that's real life.
