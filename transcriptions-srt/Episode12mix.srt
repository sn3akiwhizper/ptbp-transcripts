1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,320
Howdy my cowpups, it's your radio sheriff, Wolf the dog, and I'm wrangling up all of

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:12,880
contention's juicy news from 694.2 PTBP.

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,640
First up, a word with some friends on howlin' with Wolf.

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,640
Your wolf brother Lord Morty wants to give a shoutout to all his dogs over at the discord

5
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:24,840
server for the good friends of Jackson Elias.

6
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:30,020
If you pups aren't part of the pack already, it's a place where you can yip, yap, wolf,

7
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:36,320
or whimper about Call of Cthulhu, horror films, or horror gaming in general.

8
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:42,140
Just dig out your doggy device, download the discord app, and search for the good friends

9
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:44,320
of Jackson Elias.

10
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:50,100
Keep those claws sharp and those canines sharper, see you wolf pups around.

11
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:54,860
Now while this is a note from the producer, the good friends of Jackson Elias have been

12
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:59,720
an integral part of this keeper's horror and roleplay education, if you're willing

13
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,740
to lose some sanity along the way.

14
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:07,860
And Scott Dorward, one of the good friends, was even kind enough to reply to this producer's

15
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:15,220
reddit post regarding running his outstanding scenario, Hell in Texas, found in Stygian

16
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:20,300
Fox's reality-breaking book, The Things We Leave Behind.

17
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:24,860
If y'all want your best friend Wolf to read something you got to say, leave us a sweet

18
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:31,060
five star review or tag us in a social media thing, y'all know the drill.

19
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:34,380
And now we got a little news on the wire.

20
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:39,140
Last I heard, Officer Vigna and the two other idiots busted into the deceased child's

21
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:45,100
room at Hotel Motel, guns drawn, and sans warrant.

22
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:50,660
There they found a woman dressed similarly to her favorite TV character, the Fonz.

23
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:55,620
But let me tell y'all, these were not happy days as she whipped a knife out at Officer

24
00:01:55,620 --> 00:02:00,140
Vigna after these so-called peacekeepers pulled the guns out.

25
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:03,060
Guns are scary, y'all.

26
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:07,900
The party had Greece and Professor Trelawney pinned down until the brilliant Keith Vigna

27
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:13,900
engaged her in hand-to-hand combat, resulting in a hostage situation for the copper.

28
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:19,220
Vigna, an officer of the law, proceeded to brag about killing a coworker.

29
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:24,420
But I heard the sweet-talkin' officer bishop managed to keep her from killin' him there

30
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,980
on the spot.

31
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:30,180
And now when that old wired lady made a run for it over the railin' and ran into the

32
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:36,260
parking lot, all three of those officers unloaded their weapons from the second floor corridor,

33
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:39,820
bringin' her down before she could get into her vehicle.

34
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:45,860
The officers patched her up and sent her to the city hospital with Lauren, the only

35
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:49,100
decent officer left in contention.

36
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:54,660
The scene was so dramatic for everyone stayin' at Hotel Motel, owners say they will likely

37
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:59,380
have to shut down soon due to the negative reviews on Yelp.

38
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:04,660
The officers are plannin' a sting operation to catch Billy Harrison, the stranger runnin'

39
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:07,780
about contention in an official police uniform.

40
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:09,780
What?

41
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:10,780
Wait a minute.

42
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:16,460
Well, if we only get to listen to one song before some bald dude dressed as a cock comes

43
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:23,260
and we all get got, let it be kudzu with no backbone.

44
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:39,780
Hey Drew!

45
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:52,300
Okay, so after about 15 minutes, a black SUV rolls up and parks a block away from the donut

46
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,300
hole.

47
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:58,900
A very short, young woman and a very tall, old man get out and they are both wearing

48
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:04,700
a black suit, white shirt, black tie, black sunglasses, and an ill-fitting windbreaker

49
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:08,620
that says FBI in big letters across the back.

50
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:14,220
Clark, as you sip on your coffee, you hear the door behind you swing open.

51
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:18,340
The door chimes jingle and jangle and you hear footsteps.

52
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:24,020
Out of the corner of your eye, you see a short, young woman walk across the shop to the counter.

53
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:26,740
The other footsteps approach you from behind.

54
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,940
Wait, uh, John has his radio on him, but do you?

55
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:30,940
No.

56
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,620
You're all in plainclothes and I think at this point you were texting information.

57
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:39,220
Okay, so I'm gonna text both of them, hey, it's not Billy, but it's two, what looked

58
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,860
like two FBI agents just walked in.

59
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:42,860
Send.

60
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,220
Could you sext me that instead?

61
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,060
Hey baby.

62
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,500
Some female body inspectors just walked in.

63
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,780
Clark, do you want to make any moves?

64
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:54,980
One was approaching me.

65
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:57,340
There are footsteps that approach you from behind.

66
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,300
Someone is clearly like standing behind you.

67
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,700
I think you had your newspaper up.

68
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,700
Yeah, are they like standing behind me?

69
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:03,780
Yep.

70
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:04,780
Okay.

71
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:05,780
I turn around and look up at them.

72
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,940
It's this, uh, older dude.

73
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:14,780
He's quite tall and he's pretty gruff looking and he just stares back down at you and his

74
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,780
eyes are empty.

75
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:20,260
Can I, can I help you?

76
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,460
He stares.

77
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:26,500
I slowly turn back around and refocus on the newspaper.

78
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:32,260
As you're focused on the newspaper, you still hear this guy breathing behind you and the

79
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:37,580
woman at the counter, she orders something from the guy behind the counter there.

80
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,580
What's his name?

81
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,580
Right?

82
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:40,580
The donut hole.

83
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:41,580
Yeah.

84
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:42,580
His name is Duncan.

85
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,580
Duncan Hole.

86
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:46,580
Mr. Mr. Hole, Mr. Duncan Hole.

87
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,580
Yo, Mr. H.

88
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:56,740
He, uh, pours her a coffee and she walks and sits at the booth with Clark Bishop across

89
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:57,940
from you.

90
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:04,460
And she says, okay, John, where's the bag?

91
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,460
Are you talking to me?

92
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,460
Yeah.

93
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:10,420
I'm not, I'm not John.

94
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:11,580
Are you looking for John?

95
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,580
Are you not John?

96
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,580
I'm not John.

97
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:18,700
Uh, well, you're wearing a hoodie and uh, you know, we just thought that you were John.

98
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,100
No, I'm not John.

99
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,100
Do you know John?

100
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,100
Uh, John what?

101
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,100
John Peters.

102
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,100
Hmm.

103
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,100
I've heard that name before.

104
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,100
Huh.

105
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:30,340
The man behind you, he puts a hand on your shoulder.

106
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:34,740
I pet it.

107
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,980
She says, we need you to direct us to John Peters.

108
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:41,380
I don't, I don't know where John Peters is.

109
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:42,380
Who are you?

110
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,740
Uh, my name's Clark.

111
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:44,740
Clark what?

112
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:45,740
Clark Bishop.

113
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:46,740
Clark Bishop.

114
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,740
What do you do?

115
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,300
Uh, I actually happen to be a officer here in this town.

116
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,300
Oh, of course.

117
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,300
Yes.

118
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,300
Of course.

119
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,300
You're officer Bishop.

120
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,300
Oh, that's right.

121
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,580
Um, where's John Peters then?

122
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,580
You should know.

123
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:02,660
No, uh, man, we don't know.

124
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:07,460
Do you have anything for us?

125
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:11,620
I mean, if you hadn't walked in here, we might have had something.

126
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:17,540
Me and my, uh, my fellow officers, this is kind of a, we're curious about John too.

127
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,540
We're working on it though.

128
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:23,300
I'll tell you what, more specifically than John Peters, we're looking for a bag.

129
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,300
What kind of bag?

130
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,900
It's a black Nike bag.

131
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:29,340
It was in a storage unit here in contention and we're looking for it.

132
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,340
Huh.

133
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,700
Uh, what would be in the bag?

134
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,700
Nothing.

135
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,340
Well, we'll keep an eye out for it.

136
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,340
That's for dang sure.

137
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:39,420
Okay, well.

138
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:46,260
Hey, off character, off conversation, did we find that in the storage locker?

139
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,260
Yeah.

140
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,260
What was in it?

141
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,580
The cocaine or is it literally a bag of nothing?

142
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,380
There's literally a Nike bag.

143
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,740
Oh shit.

144
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:53,740
Is that in the-

145
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,020
Is there something horrifying in it?

146
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,020
Did we open it?

147
00:07:56,020 --> 00:08:00,100
I think Clark opened it and he's asked what was inside and I told him there's nothing

148
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,060
in there.

149
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,780
I want to look in the Nike bag.

150
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,100
There's nothing in there.

151
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,780
Is there anything in the leather backpack?

152
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:08,780
Is it at the prison?

153
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,780
At the jail?

154
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:13,860
Yeah, it's, it's like in the police department, locked up in one of the cells with all the

155
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,580
other stuff.

156
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,540
Is there a reason you're looking for an empty bag?

157
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:19,820
You know, I think that's above your pay grade.

158
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:20,820
Oh, is it?

159
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:21,820
Oh, definitely.

160
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,260
I mean, he's just a missing person at this point, right?

161
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:28,580
We're not looking for him necessarily, but we thought that he could take us to the bag.

162
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:31,940
John Peters had the keys for those storage units.

163
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:34,340
We went by those storage units.

164
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,340
They're empty.

165
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,340
Hmm.

166
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,340
How about that?

167
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,940
Can I, can I hear this on the, in the bathroom?

168
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:40,940
Yeee, roll.

169
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:41,940
Yes, roll.

170
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:42,940
Uh, alertness.

171
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:43,940
Uh, 87.

172
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:48,060
I forgot to take my headphones out.

173
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,140
What are you listening to?

174
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,980
Like a conspiracy theory podcast?

175
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:51,980
Yeah.

176
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:52,980
Natch.

177
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:53,980
Niberia.

178
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:58,460
I'm just failing to understand how a guy from my town missing an empty bag is above

179
00:08:58,460 --> 00:08:59,460
my pay grade.

180
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,460
Yeah.

181
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:01,460
I'm trying to help.

182
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:02,460
Okay.

183
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:05,780
Well, if you don't know any more information, then you can't be of any help, can you?

184
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,700
I guess, I guess not.

185
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,680
How about if I find that bag, I'll give you guys a call.

186
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,420
We would certainly appreciate it.

187
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:16,420
But since we're here talking to an officer of the law, I think you might be able to help

188
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:19,980
us out with some information about some things that are happening in this town.

189
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:25,180
You see, we know about the body in the junkyard and we know about the chopped up body in the

190
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:28,660
plastic trunk with the woman's head that was split open.

191
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:33,260
We're also pretty sure that you killed a man named Charles earlier this evening.

192
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:37,260
And I believe you also shot a woman at hotel motel earlier tonight.

193
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:43,980
So I think maybe officer Bishop, you're not in much of a place to say what should be done

194
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:44,980
next.

195
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:45,980
Oh boy.

196
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:46,980
In character.

197
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:47,980
No, for real.

198
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:48,980
For real.

199
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:49,980
Just like, uh-uh.

200
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:50,980
No, no you.

201
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,980
You didn't, how'd you hear about that?

202
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:57,980
That head in a bucket thing, what's that about?

203
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:03,860
Well, you sent off some stuff to county, didn't you?

204
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:06,560
We talked to them and they won't be talking anymore.

205
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,560
County won't be talking?

206
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,560
We didn't kill them.

207
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,980
No, we just, there are certain things that need to be kept away from the knowledge of

208
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:12,980
the people.

209
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:13,980
That's one of them.

210
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:17,940
Clark, Bishop, they told you about the difference between the age of the inside and the age

211
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:20,300
of the outside of the corpse from the junkyard, did they not?

212
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,580
Yeah, about that lab fuckup?

213
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,980
Yeah, they told me about that.

214
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,340
That's a big oopsie on their part.

215
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:27,460
Yeah, they're clearly not very good at their jobs.

216
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,460
Now I'll ask you one more time, officer Bishop.

217
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:34,020
Do you know anything about this black Nike bag that we look for?

218
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:36,460
Because we're not leaving this town until we find it?

219
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:37,460
Agent, uh...

220
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:41,100
Kennedy, this is my partner, Agent McKinley.

221
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:45,220
And you kind of look over and he nods at you, he looks down, he nods.

222
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,820
He's still holding your shoulder.

223
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:47,820
What does this guy look like?

224
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:48,820
I'm imagining like a-

225
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:53,700
Old dude with empty eyes and like a tanned leather skin.

226
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,540
Oh, I seem like a John Malkovich, but...

227
00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:02,600
Well, the woman that's talking is really young and really short and she's just kind of like

228
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,820
bright eyed, bushy tail, weird voice.

229
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:05,820
Like a squirrel.

230
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,660
Yeah, she's very similar to a squirrel.

231
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:12,180
Like a Scottish squirrel or Canadian, whatever she, whatever accent she's got.

232
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,180
A Scottish Canadian girl?

233
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:14,180
Where the fuck is she from?

234
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,180
Ireland?

235
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:19,180
Shit, you haven't talked about that yet.

236
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:24,060
Yeah, Agent Kennedy, Agent McKinley.

237
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:28,380
I do know some stuff that's been going on around here that's honestly, it's just real

238
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:29,380
weird.

239
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:33,140
The reason I wasn't totally forthcoming with you is I don't know exactly what the hell's

240
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:34,140
going on.

241
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:40,060
And we've been playing it tight to the chest so far because boy, we might be in a little

242
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,520
over our heads at this point.

243
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,780
At this point I am texting, what are they asking?

244
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:47,380
What do they know?

245
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,460
You get that text.

246
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:51,020
And she says, are we keeping you from something more important?

247
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:53,740
I mean, we had a sting set up for tonight.

248
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:54,940
That's kind of what this all was.

249
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,660
That's why I'm not wearing my uniform right now.

250
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:59,180
Oh, this was a sting operation you say?

251
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,180
Yeah.

252
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:03,180
You walked in with the FBI thing on your jacket, which kind of fucked all that up.

253
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:09,500
Well, we were also looking for John Peters and we were also listening, so I guess we've

254
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,500
been stung.

255
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,020
I guess we stung you on that one, didn't we?

256
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,260
I guess the plan kind of worked.

257
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,260
I suppose in a way.

258
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,440
Who are you looking for?

259
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,620
What bee were you hoping to grab the end of?

260
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:25,140
Earlier this evening, one of my associates was injured in a little incident at the hospital

261
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:31,580
up there and a guy we had in custody kind of got the better of him, took his uniform.

262
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,540
And so we were trying to catch him.

263
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,300
We were trying to get him back here.

264
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:43,660
So there is a civilian running about in a contention police officer's clothes.

265
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:46,060
Listen, I told you we were in over our heads.

266
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,860
I'm not proud of everything that's happened tonight.

267
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:51,460
You guys really seem to have the top on this whole situation, don't you?

268
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,700
I mean, we had a sting set up.

269
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:54,700
We were on it.

270
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,700
Well, sorry.

271
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,700
That's okay.

272
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:02,700
Ding.

273
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,700
Oh boy.

274
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,700
Give me a hit of that vape while we're at it.

275
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,700
You guys want to hear that annoying sound?

276
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,700
Yeah.

277
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,700
It's hard to talk and not cough with this in your mouth.

278
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,700
I had a dollar every time your mom said that.

279
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:26,180
How many dollars would you have?

280
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:30,180
So Joe is a little bit at a loss, but I think it's because Clark would be at a little bit

281
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,180
of a loss.

282
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:35,020
I don't know where I stand with these guys at fucking all because I think we're past

283
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,580
the point of like lying to them.

284
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:40,900
Well, we're past the point of like our characters being like trying to be good policemen.

285
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:45,700
You have committed, we've all committed like super felonies, but I think that also is why

286
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:50,100
Clark is in like a, Oh, cause he's like wants to help out, but he's like, uh, I will go

287
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,100
to jail for sure.

288
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:55,100
He was a good cop 24 hours ago, whatever it was.

289
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,500
It should have been me cause I would have had no problem lying to him.

290
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:01,620
I would just have a problem lying to him.

291
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:05,420
It's like 1am on December 4th, the morning of December 4th now.

292
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:09,580
And this all started the evening of December 1st so it really hasn't been very much time

293
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:10,580
at all.

294
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,580
Yeah.

295
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:12,580
What do they expect from us?

296
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,580
What are we, the FBI?

297
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,820
Are you, uh, you folks, uh, you guys in town for a while?

298
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:19,100
Officer Bishop, we're in town for as long as we need to be good.

299
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:23,380
How about we all go home, get a good night's sleep and I'll share with you all we've got

300
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,540
so far tomorrow at the station.

301
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:33,500
Don't persuade because they would rather go to the station right now.

302
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,380
What the fuck dude?

303
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,380
Yes.

304
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:39,580
I don't know what to do.

305
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:42,140
That's that's that's a set that I don't ever use.

306
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:45,820
That's the third set that you've rolled a not one with in this game.

307
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:46,820
Stop apologizing.

308
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:47,820
Your hands are touched by God.

309
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,220
I just feel bad narratively.

310
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,580
Like I'm winning every time.

311
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:55,500
Just tell them that we're all losing willpower right now and we need to take it.

312
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,800
Mechanically it would be better for all of us if we met in the morning.

313
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:05,540
She looks at agent McKinley and looks back at you and she says, fair enough.

314
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,020
What time shall we meet in the morning?

315
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,540
How about a 10 o'clock?

316
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:14,620
We'll see you bright and early at 10 o'clock and agent McKinley and agent Kennedy walk

317
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,220
out of the donut hole.

318
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,500
Which one was Kennedy?

319
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:23,980
Kennedy was the female woman from agent Kennedy was the short one, the young woman from the

320
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:27,140
agent McKinley was the, uh, the tall old man.

321
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,140
Oh, sure.

322
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,140
Where do you think she was born?

323
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:30,140
What abouts?

324
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:31,140
God.

325
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:32,140
Who knows?

326
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,140
Guys?

327
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:37,580
I got, I thought of this one, you know, all the, like the black goo we've been seeing.

328
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:42,660
It's CPD oil, like contention, police department.

329
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,860
That's not a very good one.

330
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:49,500
There's not a whole lot there.

331
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:53,820
And edit point and cut.

332
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:54,820
I think.

333
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:55,820
Yeah.

334
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:56,820
That's let's in an episode right there.

335
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:03,740
CPD oil, and then we'll end it before the punchline and pick up next week with oil real

336
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:14,140
quick and then it'll be 10 am, but not that, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no snacks.

337
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:19,880
As soon as those two leave, I'm furiously texting those guys or you guys furiously.

338
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,880
What do you say?

339
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,880
Oh shit.

340
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,800
The FBI is here.

341
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,800
They talked to me.

342
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,800
We got to get together.

343
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,800
Come to the car.

344
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,800
I send back.

345
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,800
And I do.

346
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,280
And so I walk out of the bathroom and nobody's left in the restaurant and I mean, I'm coming

347
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:37,020
to the car, but I'm still a little like, wow, I could have waited for him.

348
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,040
You guys hop in the car.

349
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:44,320
So the FBI is here and they seem to know a lot, in fact, maybe more than we do about

350
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,080
all this crazy shit that's been happening.

351
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,080
What do they know?

352
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:50,120
They know about the storage units and a lot of the crazy shit.

353
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,240
Do they know that we have the stuff in the storage units?

354
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,860
I wasn't forthright with that, but by the end of it, it seems like they pretty much

355
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:56,860
know that we do.

356
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:57,860
Okay.

357
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:58,860
Wow.

358
00:16:58,860 --> 00:16:59,860
Okay.

359
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:00,860
So we should get back to the PD and...

360
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:03,840
So they're going to come by tomorrow morning at 10 and I told them we cooperate.

361
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:07,160
We need to stash that stuff, yeah, but we're keeping that cool shit, right?

362
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,600
Or do we cooperate with them?

363
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,600
No.

364
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,780
We cooperate, but they don't know we did it.

365
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:19,940
We took cocaine and didn't report it to anybody and tons of illegal weapons, but they knew

366
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,700
that we killed Charles.

367
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:22,700
They knew...

368
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:28,900
Yeah, but all the murders, I mean, all the things we had to do, we had to do on official

369
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:29,900
police business.

370
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:30,900
Of course.

371
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:31,900
And we would explain that to them.

372
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,900
I'm just saying that they're aware of us potentially being off the deep end.

373
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:39,340
Yeah, well, maybe we send them off the deep end and get the whole FBI after.

374
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:40,340
Wow.

375
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:43,340
I think we got your head in the wrong place about this whole murder thing.

376
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:47,800
So how do you think they know that we have all the...

377
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,540
They mentioned that head in the tub.

378
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:50,900
Did they know what else was in the unit?

379
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:51,900
Did they mention that?

380
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,900
Yeah.

381
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,020
They're looking for a black Nike bag.

382
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:58,860
So they didn't mention cocaine or machine guns or sniper rifles?

383
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:03,500
So they know that the storage units were cleared out and they knew that John was supposed to

384
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,500
have the keys to them.

385
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,140
Okay, we found the Nike bag in the hotel room.

386
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,460
Yeah, let's give them the Nike bag.

387
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:12,640
And we didn't think, you know, until you knew who they were, we weren't going to just give

388
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,640
it over.

389
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,640
You know what I mean?

390
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,740
We can say, I've got the Nike bag and then let's stash all the rest of the stuff somewhere

391
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:18,740
else.

392
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,180
Cause I'm not looking to go to jail for...

393
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,180
Or at John...

394
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,500
We found it somewhere.

395
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,660
Maybe we went and poked around John Peter's house again and there it was.

396
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:26,660
Who knows?

397
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:27,660
I'm just saying...

398
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:28,660
Let's lie.

399
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:29,660
I'm saying let's lie.

400
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:30,660
Cause I don't want to go to jail.

401
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:31,940
Give up all that cocaine.

402
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:32,940
Yeah.

403
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:33,940
But where can we put it?

404
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:37,580
Back in the storage units?

405
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,780
The last place they'll look.

406
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,200
Real fuck with them.

407
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,980
Do you think we should cooperate with them on the bag?

408
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:45,100
Cause that's of no use to us right now.

409
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,100
It's just an empty bag.

410
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,300
I want to look at that bag now.

411
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:51,100
Let's go back to the PD and figure out what we're going to do from there.

412
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,580
Also, have they left yet?

413
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:53,580
Yes.

414
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,220
Okay, let's all go back to the police department and...

415
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,220
It's right across the street.

416
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,220
We can see it.

417
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,220
Okay, let's go.

418
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,220
We're back.

419
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:08,740
An odd thing awaits you when you walk into the police department.

420
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:09,740
Not Drew.

421
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:12,740
Drew is not at the police department.

422
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:16,340
Well, we need to change that because somebody's going to have to move all this stuff.

423
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,340
It's late.

424
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,340
It's not going to be us.

425
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:21,980
When's the last time you didn't see Drew when you were here?

426
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,500
What do we see?

427
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:30,500
There is just a note on Drew's desk and it says, went to the chief's house, we'll be

428
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,500
back.

429
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,500
Is it Drew's handwriting?

430
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,500
Yep.

431
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,500
Is there time or anything on it?

432
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,500
Nope.

433
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,500
Okay.

434
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,540
And as you guys walk in, Dr. Marie Jacobs stirs from her cell in the back and she's

435
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:46,740
like, hey Marie, doctor, shouldn't you be asleep right now?

436
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:49,180
Shouldn't you be officer-ing?

437
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,180
We are.

438
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,180
We happen to be officer-ing.

439
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:53,460
This is our office to officer at.

440
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,080
Shh, you'll wake him.

441
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:59,160
And Salem is like asleep on her, on her lap.

442
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,140
It's your shrill ass who's going to wake him.

443
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:03,340
He doesn't wake up to my voice.

444
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,940
It's just stranger's voices.

445
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:09,500
The way the police department is set up, can you see into the cells and stuff as soon as

446
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,500
you walk in?

447
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:15,560
No, but you could hear voices echoing in such a way that like you can definitely tell it's

448
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:21,480
hitting bags of cocaine and weapons and they would just have to take a quick look around

449
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,480
to find all that shit.

450
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,480
Right.

451
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,480
Oh yeah.

452
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,480
Yeah.

453
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,560
It would be five steps into the back room and you'd be like, Oh, there's a lot of stuff

454
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,560
back here.

455
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,560
Yeah.

456
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,560
Okay.

457
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,560
We don't want that to happen.

458
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:35,780
I'm imagining that each cell is individually barred from the front.

459
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:41,060
However, they are separated in an opaque fashion from cell to cell.

460
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:46,020
How long would it take us to put up some, uh, like a false wall, dry wall, just thinking

461
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,020
some dry wall around.

462
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:50,260
We move it all into the last cell and put up a fake wall.

463
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,260
Fuck this guys.

464
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:52,260
Let's just text Drew.

465
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,260
Let's call Drew.

466
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,260
Okay.

467
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,260
Yeah.

468
00:20:55,260 --> 00:21:04,780
Hey, this is a Drew Andrews.

469
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,260
Give a message after the beep.

470
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,260
Thank you.

471
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,260
Bye.

472
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,260
Click.

473
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,260
I don't leave fucking voicemails.

474
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,260
It's a text message in world.

475
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,260
Uh, he wasn't around.

476
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,260
Okay.

477
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,260
What do you think?

478
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,900
I think priority number one is get our goodies somewhere else.

479
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,460
Where do we put them all?

480
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,460
At your house.

481
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,460
Oh shit.

482
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:20,460
Yeah.

483
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,460
Yeah.

484
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:22,460
Yeah.

485
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:25,060
Uh, you live the farthest out of town, don't you?

486
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,060
Okay.

487
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:27,060
Let's put them at your house.

488
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,060
We could do that.

489
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,060
We could nimby it up.

490
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:30,060
I'll just take a little bit of home.

491
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:32,340
I live at a motel right now.

492
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:36,420
And there's a scene of the crime a few doors down for me.

493
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,420
Maybe not.

494
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,420
Maybe not in my room.

495
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:39,420
You guys could split it up.

496
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:41,860
Like maybe John Lee Pettymore could take all the guns.

497
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:46,420
Clark could take all the cocaine or just switch those, swap those right around.

498
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:47,420
Yeah.

499
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:48,420
That sounds good to me.

500
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:49,420
That all does sound good to me.

501
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:52,300
It's just that realistically that's a, we have, there's so much shit in those storage

502
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,300
lockers.

503
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,580
Like we just kind of montage this.

504
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:55,860
I've already got the cocaine.

505
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:56,860
I'll see you later.

506
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:59,460
We probably still have the U-Haul, right?

507
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:00,460
Yeah.

508
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:02,420
The police U-Haul.

509
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:04,540
You've got some sort of police U-Haul.

510
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:05,540
Box trucks.

511
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:07,260
Can we just montage that real quick?

512
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:10,940
It is 1am when this started.

513
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:14,140
So it's at least 1.30 now.

514
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,140
Maybe two.

515
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:20,380
So I'm going to have you guys all lose another willpower point if you're going to keep going.

516
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,380
What's everybody at?

517
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,380
Seven.

518
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,380
Nine.

519
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,380
I'm at nine.

520
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,660
So how long is this going to take us to do?

521
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:26,660
Two hours.

522
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,900
So it's 3.30 once we get back to the police department.

523
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:31,460
Yeah, you'll lose two more willpower points.

524
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:33,620
I'm definitely, I may not.

525
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,300
We can regain them by sleeping and stuff, right?

526
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,140
Yeah, I'm not heading back to the police department.

527
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:40,020
A full night's sleep gives you 1D6 willpower.

528
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:43,220
Okay, so let's, we'll take it to the respective places and meet back up.

529
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:46,500
How about we meet back up at like an hour before they get here?

530
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,060
I mean, yeah, eight o'clock, whatever.

531
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,460
Yeah, let's get here at eight.

532
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:52,420
That way we have a couple hours to talk about what the hell we're going to do.

533
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:54,820
Okay guys, we're going to get to work on time and then...

534
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:55,820
Plan.

535
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:56,820
Plot.

536
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:58,340
I think we're plotting.

537
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:59,340
This is fine.

538
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,340
Yeah.

539
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:05,900
Okay, so real quick, if we're going to montage through these, let's go ahead and get a quick

540
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:08,700
rundown of where everything is going.

541
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:13,540
Oh shit, wait, at some point in the two hours, we would definitely realize that we should

542
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:17,180
check up on Drew at the chief's house, especially since he doesn't call us back.

543
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:20,460
If you guys are taking this stuff to your house, I can go to the chief's house.

544
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:23,660
I think it would be a really good idea for Keith to split off by himself.

545
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:32,700
I mean, especially, okay, yeah, I call him one more time.

546
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:33,700
Same thing.

547
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:37,420
Okay, I guess I'm going to go to the chief's house while you guys get all this back to

548
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:38,420
your houses.

549
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,420
Good night, Keith.

550
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,420
Good luck, man.

551
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,420
Oh, I don't need it.

552
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:47,500
I mean, you haven't used any luck so far, so real quick, Clark and John, who is taking

553
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,460
what to your respective homes?

554
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:51,500
I mean, there is a shitload of shit in there.

555
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:57,380
I want to take all of the important documents we found and I'll take some of the guns or

556
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:58,620
all the guns either way.

557
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:02,620
You take some of the guns, I'll take some of the guns.

558
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:06,180
We wouldn't want a man like you wanted up, caught with all that cocaine.

559
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:09,820
You know, the Pennymores, I can just say it was left on the property, you know what I

560
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:10,820
mean?

561
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:11,820
Yeah.

562
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:12,820
Yeah.

563
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:13,820
Thanks for doing that for me, John.

564
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:14,820
No worries, man.

565
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:15,820
I got your back, brother.

566
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:16,820
I don't want to get penalized for forgetting what all-

567
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:17,820
Absolutely.

568
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:18,820
You won't be.

569
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:19,820
We'll take everything, yeah.

570
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:20,820
How about that?

571
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:24,340
We'll take everything unless there's something that you would think that we should talk about

572
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,340
who gets.

573
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,340
Yeah.

574
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,340
What are the other important things?

575
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,340
How about this?

576
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,340
John takes half the guns and all the cocaine.

577
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,220
You take the other half of guns and everything else.

578
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,380
The question is what's in everything else?

579
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:36,620
Is the cursed turtle we found going to explode or something that we forgot about?

580
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:42,940
The cursed turtle will explode, which will be an issue for you specifically as a character.

581
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:47,460
Also how about I take the empty bag, throw it in the trunk of my cruiser.

582
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:50,740
That way I can be like, you can act like you had no idea about it.

583
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,100
That's a really good idea.

584
00:24:53,100 --> 00:25:00,660
You know what, relying on your incompetence as an alibi is the least incompetent idea

585
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:01,660
you've ever had.

586
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,140
Thank you so much, guys.

587
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:06,340
But real fast, I want to take a look at it here right now.

588
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,340
Yeah, let's look at the bag.

589
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:10,460
You guys go in the back and you find a black Nike bag.

590
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:13,380
It's a drawstring bag like you would take to the gym.

591
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:17,060
It has a Nike swish on it and it says Nike on it.

592
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:18,060
Nothing inside.

593
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,060
Nick.

594
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,060
There's nothing inside.

595
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:21,380
Is there anything in the office that I can run over?

596
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,380
I'm sure we do.

597
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:24,020
I'm sure we have a wand of some kind.

598
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,020
Yeah.

599
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,020
There's so much metal.

600
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,780
I pointed Breathalyzer at it.

601
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:28,780
In the bag.

602
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:29,860
There's a metal in the bag.

603
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:33,100
If you swipe it over the top of it, there's a lot of metal in the bag.

604
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,580
What does that mean to us though?

605
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,980
So when I look into it though, it's empty?

606
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:36,980
Yeah, it's black.

607
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:37,980
It's empty.

608
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:40,780
And it feels just like a regular empty drawstring bag.

609
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:41,780
Spitball in here.

610
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:43,180
Maybe you can catch the goo with it.

611
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,180
Maybe.

612
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:45,180
We can talk about it more in the morning.

613
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:47,180
I cast ritual detect magic.

614
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:53,180
Go ahead and roll a d20 and add your spellcasting modifier.

615
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,180
Alrighty.

616
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,180
Nat 20.

617
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,180
Whoa.

618
00:25:56,180 --> 00:26:02,580
You needed a 40.

619
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:05,340
We all watch Clark do that.

620
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:10,300
Just, hey buddy, I think you need to get, I think you should get some sleep.

621
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:17,140
Go ahead and roll a sanity test for me as you pass the wand over the top of the bag.

622
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:19,100
That's a 94 on a 42.

623
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:23,260
Okay, you just lose one and you know something's up.

624
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:24,580
Something's up with this bag.

625
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:25,900
What's up with that?

626
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:26,900
Yo, so should we?

627
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,420
Yeah, what's up with that?

628
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,460
Should we keep it or should we hand it over?

629
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:33,660
That's kind of what I'm getting at is that maybe if we hand it over, they'll tell us

630
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:34,660
what it is.

631
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:35,980
I like that idea.

632
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:38,740
We haven't really gotten any help from anybody else yet.

633
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:40,380
Yeah, they seem like they know.

634
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:42,460
Also maybe they'll leave us alone if.

635
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:44,500
Or just take this off our plates.

636
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,820
Like maybe they're right.

637
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:46,900
Maybe this is above our pay grade.

638
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:50,300
And then we can move to the city and ban silk cocaine.

639
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,300
That's a dumb idea.

640
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,300
Nobody would do that.

641
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:57,740
I mean, that's, yeah, that's kind of what I'm getting at is, I mean, if they are a helpful

642
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:00,620
source and maybe, yeah, that they solve some shit for us.

643
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:01,620
Yeah.

644
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,620
Well, I mean, let's do it.

645
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,340
We've made awful decisions up to this point.

646
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:05,340
So.

647
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,340
Oh, I have made awful decisions.

648
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:07,340
Keith, you're right.

649
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:12,260
We've all made pretty awful choices and yeah, if we can like present this as a token of

650
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:15,780
our good will to these people, throw them a bone.

651
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:18,300
Maybe they take this whole fucking mess off our shoulders.

652
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,300
I like it.

653
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:23,500
Well, I'll put it in the trunk tomorrow when they're here, I'll, I'll come in and be like,

654
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,740
Hey, did, do you know who's this is?

655
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:27,460
Somebody left it or how should I present it?

656
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:28,860
You could say you found it at John's house.

657
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:29,860
Yeah.

658
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:30,860
Okay.

659
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:31,860
Oh yeah.

660
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:32,860
I found this at John's house.

661
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:33,860
I just, it's just been in my cruiser.

662
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:36,580
It's been in the back of my trunk for a couple of days.

663
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:39,340
So I'm going to head off to Maggie's house.

664
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,340
Sounds good.

665
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:44,020
And the other two of you are going and taking the stuff to your respective homes.

666
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:44,960
All right.

667
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,460
If I could have the two of you leave this room now.

668
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:59,900
Keith Vigna, you pull up to the chief's house.

669
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:03,380
I'm trying to think of when I had you lose another, go ahead and lose another willpower

670
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,380
point for me.

671
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:05,380
Okay.

672
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:06,380
So you're at six.

673
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:07,380
Yeah.

674
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:08,380
You pull up.

675
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:11,220
It is a nice old brick house in the style of ranch.

676
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,400
There's one door in the front.

677
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:16,640
There's like a big window in front of the patio that is out front.

678
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,720
It's one story.

679
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,720
Pretty nice place.

680
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:24,460
But the chief's cruiser is actually parked in the driveway, which as you know, it hasn't

681
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:27,640
been since she left on the night of December 1st.

682
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,960
You also see Drew's car there.

683
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,960
Oh yeah.

684
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,960
I was going to ask, what does Drew drive?

685
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:31,960
Just a car?

686
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:32,960
Yeah.

687
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:33,960
What does Drew drive?

688
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:37,720
Since he works all the time, he probably has quite a bit of money, so probably a mini Cooper.

689
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,720
Yes.

690
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,720
Yes.

691
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,880
That is precisely correct.

692
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:46,680
He drives a very clean mini Cooper and it is red with a black stripe.

693
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,680
Yep.

694
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,680
Dope.

695
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,680
So that is out front as well.

696
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,680
What would you like to do?

697
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,680
I don't want to pull into the driveway.

698
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:56,960
I want to pull like off to the side of the road in front of the house and go up and knock

699
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,960
on the door.

700
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:01,880
As you knock on the door, the door swings open.

701
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,520
It wasn't closed completely.

702
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:08,100
And as it opens, it stops short.

703
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:12,600
Like it can't open fully with you just pushing at it.

704
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:19,680
You kind of look around the corner and you see there are two unconscious men on the ground.

705
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,680
Are the lights on?

706
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:27,020
The lights are not on, but these two unconscious men, one of them is Drew Andrews and it smells

707
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:28,220
like poop.

708
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:30,120
If I flip the switch, do the lights come on?

709
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,120
Yes.

710
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:35,280
When you do flip the switch, you see that in the living room, which is just adjacent

711
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:41,040
to the foyer, Chief Maggie Cook's body in full uniform leans slumped against the wall

712
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,520
on the other side of the room.

713
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:46,240
A large chef's knife rests in her left hand.

714
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:51,760
Her face has been stabbed repeatedly and her left foot is missing.

715
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,840
Blood was clearly flowing rapidly from there.

716
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:59,360
And as you push your way further into the room, it smells like gasoline and natural

717
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,360
gas in here.

718
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:03,240
Go ahead and roll sanity for me.

719
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,040
Forty on a forty.

720
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,800
Ooh, congratulations.

721
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,800
Sweet.

722
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:11,600
You only lose one upon seeing this because of your success?

723
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,600
What do you want to do?

724
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:16,600
If I look at that other body, is it Maggie Cook's dad or can I identify the other male

725
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,600
body?

726
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:24,900
The other male body is an odd looking little man with round glasses on a fat face with

727
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,760
no hair and no chin.

728
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,040
Is he alive or dead?

729
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,040
They're both alive.

730
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,040
Okay.

731
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,200
Two pockets for an ID.

732
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:38,320
Yeah, you rifle through his pants and you find a wallet with an ID for a Harold Dorsey.

733
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:42,160
Okay, I immediately go to the kitchen and shut the burners off.

734
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:48,080
As you walk into the kitchen, you see an unkempt man at the table hunched over with a fork

735
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,240
in one hand and a pistol in the other.

736
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:56,820
A bullet hole in his head has left him face down in a plate of meat.

737
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:59,600
His left foot is also missing.

738
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:04,160
It smells like natural gas, like crazy in here, as well as gasoline, which makes sense

739
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:09,080
because there are gas cans sitting all over the place and gas has clearly been poured

740
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,620
on everything.

741
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:16,080
The range has a skillet on it with the leftovers of two feet that have had the meat pulled

742
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,560
from them.

743
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:22,300
All four burners are turned all the way up and as you go to turn the burners off, I need

744
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,840
you to roll sanity for what you just saw.

745
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:27,060
87 on a 39.

746
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:32,940
So go ahead and roll a, we're gonna do a D6 plus two.

747
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:34,580
That's four plus two is six.

748
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:39,540
Nice, so you lose six sanity, which puts you down at 33.

749
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:41,500
Puts you down at 33.

750
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:45,500
The breaking point of 30, correct, rapidly approaching.

751
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,740
And as you do that- Do I successfully turn the burners off?

752
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:54,380
So you're trying, but because of what you just saw, maybe you have a different reaction?

753
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:58,060
So in the course of walking in here, I've lost seven sanity.

754
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:59,060
Is that right?

755
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,060
Yep.

756
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:01,060
So you're losing your fucking mind.

757
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,060
Yeah.

758
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:05,660
I'm going to say like, I probably am going to throw up and then I'm, what do you think?

759
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:11,540
You throw up all over the kitchen floor and as you do, you fall to your hands and knees

760
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:18,200
and your left hand, your left hand hits a wire and you know immediately what you've

761
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:24,140
done because you hear a click off to the side of the room at the front door, the entrance.

762
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:31,580
You see a trap has clearly been set and you just fell right into it.

763
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:37,980
A fire starts right at the front door and there's clearly a gasoline lead path that

764
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:44,180
is leading, going to lead the fire back to this back room filled with natural gas.

765
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:45,180
What do you do?

766
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,180
I'm on my hands and knees.

767
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,180
Yep.

768
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:48,500
I look up, I'm looking at the stove.

769
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,500
Yep.

770
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,060
There's a fire extinguisher there, right?

771
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:52,060
Yeah.

772
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:58,000
And then I grab it, stand up and start fire extinguishing at the flames while I'm running

773
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
out the door.

774
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Okay.

775
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,660
So the flames are leading from the door into the kitchen with all the gas and stuff.

776
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:08,580
I'm going to take the fire extinguisher, run out of the kitchen, aim it at the closest

777
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:15,900
part of the fire to me and try to do that all along and then get out of there cause

778
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:18,140
I don't want to fucking blow up.

779
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:19,140
Yeah.

780
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:20,140
That sounds good.

781
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:21,940
So you're interested in role firefighting for me.

782
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:22,940
I'm just kidding.

783
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:25,860
Uh, do you have a skill that would help you in this endeavor?

784
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:30,140
Do you think I've got a 60 decks, 50 athletics.

785
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:32,900
Let's do an average of your dexterity and intelligence.

786
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,860
Quick little average of those 55.

787
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:35,860
Yeah.

788
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:37,740
So roll against that 55 71.

789
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:38,740
Okay.

790
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:39,740
Awesome.

791
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:44,020
And he's a different, I grabbed some new dice.

792
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,020
Try Joe's.

793
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,420
His seemed to be working really well.

794
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:47,900
Well, I already rolled that.

795
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,560
Yeah, no, you fucked that up.

796
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:56,960
So you grab the fire extinguisher and slip on your own vomit as you, as you get up and

797
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:02,720
are trying to wildly spray this, this fire extinguisher at the fire and then get out

798
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,720
of there.

799
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:09,880
So as you are running out, you have to jump over the two unconscious men.

800
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:15,120
So as you are jumping over them to leave this house that is going to explode, what do you

801
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,120
do?

802
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,160
I grabbed Drew and try to pull him out with me.

803
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,680
Full strength for me.

804
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,680
That's a 34 on a 55.

805
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,240
That is a success.

806
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,240
Yay.

807
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,240
Finally.

808
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:29,800
Uh, do you want to narrate it?

809
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,320
I slip on my vomit.

810
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:34,320
So now I'm covered in my vomit and probably some blood from that guy's foot.

811
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:39,560
I get up, I'm spraying the fire extinguisher all over in that room and on the trail of

812
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,560
gasoline.

813
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:44,480
I jump over and I'm spraying the fire and I realized who I just jumped over.

814
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:48,400
I look at both the unconscious guys on the ground, realize I don't know who that other

815
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:53,400
guy is, but I know that this is Drew and as much shit as we give Drew, we need him.

816
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:59,160
And I put my arms underneath his armpits and just pull as hard as I can until I get out

817
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:04,580
of the front door and I trip back over myself off the front porch and kind of fling Drew

818
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:06,160
and fall on my back.

819
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:14,800
As the house turns into dust, just fucking explodes, bad boys 2 mansion style.

820
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:21,240
You guys go flying into the yard and smoke immediately starts billowing and you can hear

821
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:28,240
the ringing of your ears underscored by the wood that was once the chief's house.

822
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:32,280
As I look at that, after the explosion it kind of knocked me back and knocked me out

823
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:35,040
and I've just, I'm out for a little while.

824
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,040
Yeah, probably, yeah.

825
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:39,600
I want to like come to in, you know, half an hour.

826
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,600
Okay.

827
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:43,440
Sounds good for the sake of the story.

828
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:53,040
As Keith closes his eyes, laying back on the front lawn, you're suddenly standing in your

829
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,660
childhood home.

830
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:59,160
It's your birthday and your friends are standing around this table waiting for you to blow

831
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,220
out the candles on your cake.

832
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:05,620
You look up and you see your parents in the corner talking to your little brother.

833
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:10,860
You squeeze your eyes tightly as you blow out your candles and as you do, you see that

834
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:14,300
black shiny viscous sludge.

835
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:17,080
Inside this muck are two thrashing bodies.

836
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:21,660
Their hands reach out trying to escape this thing that has trapped them, but the struggle

837
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,860
does not last long.

838
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:29,780
Their limbs seem to fold into this ooze, becoming one with the sentient mass of goop that is

839
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:33,600
now sliding across the ground toward you, opening your eyes.

840
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:38,740
You see all of your peers around your childhood kitchen table laughing at you.

841
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:40,660
The candles are still lit.

842
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:46,140
You look up and your parents are poorly attempting to hold back laughter.

843
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:48,940
You look at the cake and it is gone.

844
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:53,860
You have a plate that is clean and you look around and see everyone else is eating a piece

845
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:54,860
of cake.

846
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:59,180
They are all laughing and begin to chant while pointing at you.

847
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:03,900
Beans, beans, Keith, beans, his only friends are figurines.

848
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:11,440
Beans, beans, Keith, beans, we'll blow your friends to smithereens.

849
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,460
And maybe I'll edit that so that there's multiple voices.

850
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:15,460
Yeah, you should.

851
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:19,640
Your parents look at you disgusted and turn and walk out of the room.

852
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:24,740
You run to follow them, but looking ahead, you only see that woman dressed in old-timey

853
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:26,420
clothing.

854
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:30,740
Sitting down, you fall into a black hole in the ground and you're standing in a cold,

855
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:32,300
dark room.

856
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:38,840
The lights begin to flicker on and you see massive tanks the size of grain silos standing

857
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:42,260
right before you is yourself.

858
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,140
You walk up to you.

859
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:50,760
The face of the other you begins to age rapidly and then just as rapidly ages in reverse.

860
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:55,640
You walk up to one of the massive tanks in this massive, dank, dimly lit room.

861
00:37:55,640 --> 00:38:02,320
You press your face against it to see its contents and something creeps toward you.

862
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:10,120
And as it is about to come into focus, you wake up to the sound of sirens, their firefighters

863
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:25,240
running all around and it is a scene in the front yard of Chief Maggie Cook's home.

864
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,440
Did you pass a roll with those dice?

865
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:30,980
I passed a roll with those dice and all my other ones were with those and I did not pass

866
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:31,980
the rolls with those.

867
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:34,720
So I decided that these are going to be the ones I use for now.

868
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:43,380
Okay, so Clark and John, you are a fair amount into unloading the stuff into your homes.

869
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:46,420
I need you to both lose a willpower point for me.

870
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:48,800
God damn it, Luke.

871
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:56,080
As you are just about finished unloading, you still not finished either one of you,

872
00:38:56,080 --> 00:39:05,780
you both receive word that the Chief's home has exploded and is on fire.

873
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:09,920
Your presence has been requested at the location.

874
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,480
Clark is just too sleepy and he goes to bed.

875
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,600
I'm kidding, I go.

876
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:24,520
Well, that was good, that was like, John was just going to ignore it.

877
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,520
John is going to...

878
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:29,400
You are welcome to do whatever you would like to do.

879
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:33,640
He's going to take a little pinky of that nose candy.

880
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,640
Get a little boost.

881
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:37,640
And then go to sleep.

882
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:38,640
And then go out.

883
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,320
Gotta tuck the baby in.

884
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,280
So I understand that improves my willpower?

885
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,720
Yes, you get a plus one to willpower.

886
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,380
That worth it.

887
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:49,600
You took a baby, you took a baby rip.

888
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,360
Okay, he takes a bigger one.

889
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,600
Okay, you get two willpower points back.

890
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,880
On top of the one I already had?

891
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,880
No.

892
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,880
Okay, then he does another one.

893
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:00,480
Okay, you've got three willpower points back.

894
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,680
All right, I'm feeling good.

895
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,800
You're at 11 out of 12 willpower.

896
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,480
I feel almost perfect.

897
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,800
You are riding high.

898
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:13,040
Does anybody just want to get on the radio and just chat, just talk?

899
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,040
Just rap.

900
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:18,400
Just rap.

901
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:28,240
As you arrive at the scene of the situation, the home of Chief Maggie Cook is mostly embers

902
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:36,140
and there are multiple fire trucks and ambulances out in front of the home.

903
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:43,800
The chief's cruiser is parked in the driveway of the home, as is Drew Andrews' red with

904
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:51,920
a black stripe Mini Cooper is in front of the home, as is Keith's cruiser.

905
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:56,300
When you walk up to the scene, you see Keith is sitting in the back of one of the ambulances

906
00:40:56,300 --> 00:41:08,160
with a blanket around him and Drew is in a different ambulance in the back of it with

907
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,960
a blanket wrapped around him.

908
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,520
He's got a little cup of hot cocoa.

909
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,800
Guys, what's going on?

910
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,800
What happened here?

911
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:17,680
Yeah, I go walk on up to Keith.

912
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:21,680
Their feet were missing.

913
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:28,640
Their feet and the burners, they ate the feet.

914
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:32,000
They ate their feet and Maggie.

915
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,720
Did you see Maggie?

916
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:39,740
They stabbed her and cut her foot off.

917
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:43,340
They stabbed her in the face and cut her foot off and they ate it.

918
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:44,340
Who did that, Keith?

919
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:45,340
I don't know.

920
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:46,340
Is she alive?

921
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:47,340
No.

922
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:48,340
Her and the other two died.

923
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:51,260
Who are the other two?

924
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:55,340
The guy with the fork and the guy I have.

925
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:57,420
I slap Keith a couple times.

926
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:01,820
I pull an ID out of my pocket and I hand it to John.

927
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:05,440
That was the unconscious guy and then I don't know who the other two.

928
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,280
The ID is for a Harold Dorsey.

929
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:14,600
He's an odd looking little man with round glasses on a fat face with no hair and no

930
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,600
chin.

931
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:19,860
Hey, can we reload a quick save and instead of doing any of that sting shit, go check

932
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:22,880
on the chief's house?

933
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,960
Say about like 1 a.m.

934
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,280
Go talk to Drew.

935
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,000
I need to sit, lay down.

936
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Okay.

937
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,000
I go walk on over to Drew.

938
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Hey, Drew.

939
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Hey, Clark.

940
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Can you tell me what happened here tonight?

941
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,960
Um, chief is dead.

942
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:44,240
Chief is, chief is dead.

943
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:47,320
Keith saved my life.

944
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:51,760
And he just breaks down and starts crying in a pretty funny whimper.

945
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:55,760
I put a hand on his shoulder.

946
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,120
All right, Drew.

947
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,120
All right.

948
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,120
That's okay.

949
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:02,200
Sounds like you had a rough night.

950
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:04,760
Can you tell me how Maggie died?

951
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:06,400
Her face was stabbed.

952
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:15,040
There was blood all over her face and her foot was gone and I just threw up and passed

953
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:17,480
out immediately.

954
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:20,600
I couldn't do anything to stop that.

955
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,680
Drew, it's not your fault, man.

956
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:25,680
How'd you know to come out here?

957
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:35,640
Harold Dorsey came and said that he needed to go see her, that she said to be there.

958
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:40,360
So I wanted to go with him because you told me to look for her.

959
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,880
Hey man, you did a great job.

960
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,640
I found her, but she's dead.

961
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:46,640
Sure.

962
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,040
Sometimes that happens in life.

963
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:50,840
The thing you're looking for is just dead when you find it.

964
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:52,320
Who's Harold Dorsey?

965
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:53,320
Is he okay?

966
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:57,200
Did he make it out?

967
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:01,440
You know, I haven't, I'm going to go check on him for you real quick, but, but who, can

968
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:02,920
you tell us who he is first of all?

969
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:03,920
How do you know him?

970
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:07,600
He works for the newspaper in the city.

971
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:08,600
He's a reporter?

972
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:11,600
He's a reporter.

973
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:25,720
I know you're real emotional, but you're sounding more bratty than sad.

974
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:32,640
She came to the department and he said that I was supposed to let him borrow the keys

975
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:36,280
to her house, but I didn't think that was very safe.

976
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:42,800
And I didn't want him to see the Jacob's cat man thing.

977
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,800
So I just went with him.

978
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,360
Did he see any of the stuff we took out of that storage locker?

979
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:48,360
No.

980
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:49,360
Storage lockers?

981
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:50,360
No.

982
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:51,360
Okay.

983
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:52,360
Did you see who stabbed her in the face?

984
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:58,480
No, she was dead when we got there and we both just, neither one of us could take it.

985
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:05,000
We both passed out and what, what room of the house was she in?

986
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,520
She was in the living room that was right there in the front.

987
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:13,160
We, we must've gone unconscious as soon as we saw the blood and it smelled like gas.

988
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:14,920
I can't believe we didn't die.

989
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:15,920
Yeah.

990
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:16,920
How did you get out of there?

991
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:17,920
You said Keith saved you.

992
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:18,920
What, what happened?

993
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:21,000
They said Keith pulled when they got here.

994
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,560
I was on top of Keith in the front yard.

995
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:27,440
I think he pulled me out as the house exploded.

996
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,680
Was the house on fire when you got here?

997
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:32,320
No, but it smelled like gas.

998
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:35,040
Someone started the fire with you two inside.

999
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,040
Yeah.

1000
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:39,800
Did you see any other vehicles or tracks on your way up here?

1001
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:40,800
No.

1002
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:41,800
Okay.

1003
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:45,720
At this point I, I'm kind of coming to and I look over and I see that Drew has some hot

1004
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:46,720
cocoa.

1005
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,960
So I look at my EMT guys.

1006
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,640
I'm like, Hey guys, can I have some hot cocoa please?

1007
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:52,640
Oh yeah, sir.

1008
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,400
I can get you some hot cocoa.

1009
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:55,400
Thanks.

1010
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:00,200
And then he unzips his pants.

1011
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:02,640
That's a, it's like a soft server.

1012
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:09,000
I thought you were a surfer from your voice, but oh, it all stays in now.

1013
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Okay.

1014
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,960
I don't know about dicks.

1015
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:21,400
I don't know what porn I look at based on the dick and the porn.

1016
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:22,400
I don't.

1017
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,920
I categorize it by the drapes.

1018
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:30,440
No drapes or drapes.

1019
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:31,440
Okay.

1020
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:32,440
What kind of porn do you have?

1021
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:34,440
Oh, I've got no drape porn and drape porn.

1022
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:56,920
I do.

1023
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:06,920
How can you have enough drowning out all the notes?

1024
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:12,920
Cause nobody knows.

1025
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:20,920
Nobody knows.

1026
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:23,920
Yeah.
