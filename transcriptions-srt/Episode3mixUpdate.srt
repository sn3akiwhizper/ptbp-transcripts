1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,820
Good morning my babies, it's everybody's favorite radio DJing contention wolf the dog and we

2
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:16,020
are hitting you live from 694.2 PTBP today with a little news for y'all.

3
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,700
Councilwoman Carrie Page's dog is missing and let me tell y'all she is pissed about

4
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,960
it she is not happy at all.

5
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:32,080
Jimmy sanders saw an oil spill while tripping on those sweet sweet good mushrooms.

6
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:37,280
And Mildred Mitchell that old cookie pot head saw a bright flash of light from across the

7
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,020
street in John Peters house and now speaking of that old boy wouldn't you know it John

8
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:46,680
Peters is missing heard he had a long stay in the hospital a couple years ago poor guy

9
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,840
can't catch a break.

10
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,880
And two people came to John Peters house packed a drunken to their white Toyota and took off

11
00:00:53,880 --> 00:01:00,200
coming in hot off the presses we got a new song for y'all it's No Backbone by Kudzu.

12
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:35,440
Remember when my knee was up this morning and you kept saying that it was my boner?

13
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,440
That was funny.

14
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:41,260
Luke was on the couch like prone right and his knee was just like right in the middle

15
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:45,880
of his body sticking straight up and it looked like his dick was like a uh.

16
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:52,280
As big as it is if not smaller.

17
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,680
What happened last time Zach?

18
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:59,680
Last time you guys were standing at John Peters house and uh you just reviewed Keith Vigna's

19
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,680
excellent policing.

20
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,680
Yeah you're welcome for that.

21
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,440
If I remember it seemed like a really anticlimactic place to end an episode.

22
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,440
Yeah yeah yeah.

23
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,480
Because I didn't do any I didn't have a climax.

24
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:16,860
You had figured out that Mildred Mitchell drives a white car.

25
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,960
Is this a goddamn logic problem?

26
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:24,000
Mildred Mitchell drives a white car but John Peters will never eat ham.

27
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,240
John Peters drives a maroon car.

28
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:31,400
We decided it was something like a Cutlass Supreme or a La Sabre or it could be a Honda

29
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,400
Civic.

30
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,240
And the car that came picked up the trunk and also drove off with John Peters car were

31
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,480
two men in a white Toyota.

32
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,480
Fucking exotic dude.

33
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,600
You ever been to Japan?

34
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,080
It might it might be exotic for contention.

35
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,320
What did the trunk say?

36
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,640
Do not open if you want to live.

37
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,640
Correct?

38
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,640
Yes.

39
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:55,840
Or conversely it said open if you want to die.

40
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,280
That was just implied.

41
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,720
It's about 2pm on December 2nd.

42
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,580
Today's actually January 1st.

43
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,580
But um chuh dude.

44
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,580
Happy New Year.

45
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:06,280
I had a great time last night.

46
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,280
Me too.

47
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:13,120
I repeatedly told you that I loved you a lot and it still rings true today.

48
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,680
We'll see about tomorrow but.

49
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,680
I wish you'd been there.

50
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,680
Me too.

51
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,040
I was sleepy.

52
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,040
Hahaha.

53
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,040
Dude wait here.

54
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,040
Can you do this?

55
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:27,840
For the listeners, Thomas and Luke are drying up their top lip and the gums above their

56
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,840
front teeth.

57
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,400
Joe just like moved his lip a little bit and was doing it.

58
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,400
Pretty much there.

59
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,720
It's kind of my face.

60
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,440
He had that dry vape mouth.

61
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,640
You got a real wet mouth so I got to dry mine off.

62
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,640
I got weird teeth.

63
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:43,800
The best way to do it is like to not have to move your muscles in your lip and just

64
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,040
have it hang on there because of how dry it is.

65
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,680
Do we really know that it's a white Toyota that went blazing by?

66
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,680
Yeah we found that out.

67
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,680
That the men came in.

68
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,680
Not for sure.

69
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,680
That's what Mildred told you.

70
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,040
I don't think we can put out an APB for a white Toyota.

71
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:59,000
Yeah also we didn't.

72
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,040
Wait were they in a white Toyota?

73
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,920
Cause she drives a white car right?

74
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,920
Yep.

75
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,920
And they were in a white Toyota.

76
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,920
Yep.

77
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,920
I think this is a dead end guys.

78
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,920
Wait hold on.

79
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,340
Is this a cool like knocking on the door sound?

80
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,340
Hold on.

81
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,340
No.

82
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:16,220
It's like a really weird hollow metal door.

83
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,220
Yeah it is.

84
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,220
Okay let's go.

85
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,220
Set the scene.

86
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:25,020
The three of you are standing in the midst of Keith Vigna's excellent police work and

87
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:31,780
Mildred Mitchell is headed back across the street to her home which has her white car

88
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:32,780
in the driveway.

89
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:38,300
There's a black car in her driveway as well since we're just talking colors of cars.

90
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,260
I drive a silver car.

91
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,020
That's a police work that I do.

92
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:44,860
What color is your car?

93
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:48,740
Got it.

94
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:52,280
Radical new direction for the podcast.

95
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,280
What color is your car?

96
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,280
What color is your car?

97
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,020
Are we in the house or out of the house right now?

98
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:58,500
I think you are standing in the house of John.

99
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,460
Can I roll a search roll just to do.

100
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,380
I think you already crit succeeded right?

101
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:07,200
Well I yeah I crit succeeded but I also want to do just one more just because I feel so

102
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:11,760
bad about how shitty I did this first that first time around where.

103
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,080
You're like seeing their faces.

104
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,680
I think that's a really good direction for your character to go.

105
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:21,100
I really want to redeem myself on this like shoddy police work that I've done and I want

106
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:25,480
to like try to find something now and be like oh yeah I remember that.

107
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:29,720
You like see the faces of your fellow police officers and want to work even harder.

108
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,040
Tell me if it's good or not, 21?

109
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:36,840
You look around the house you see that the trunk is no longer there and the picture frames

110
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:44,000
that you saw earlier are cleaned up, the bedding stubs are still there, bottles are still around.

111
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,800
The people who were clearly here did not drop anything.

112
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,000
I want to look at the pictures real fast are they anything interesting?

113
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,120
Picture the family right?

114
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:57,840
Yeah basically it's just pictures of him and like maybe some friends from college.

115
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:04,160
He obviously doesn't have like a nuclear family he has like cousins and friends.

116
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,400
But they were broken before and now they're all cleaned up?

117
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,640
They would probably want to move them in order to have a clear path.

118
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,320
So obviously he did not come back to the house.

119
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:17,200
So we got to figure out who was in that white Toyota.

120
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,280
Who do we know who drives a white Toyota?

121
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:26,000
You guys would also be dealing with the fact that there was a dead body out in the junkyard

122
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
last night?

123
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
That's true.

124
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,160
I think this is not a huge concern for us right now honestly.

125
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,840
Frankly all that seems secondary to the city councilor stuff.

126
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:41,800
I just wonder if we were real police officers we wouldn't just be like oh well.

127
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,880
Like how would we wrap this up as far as a case goes?

128
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:48,080
I don't know I feel like if there's three of us on the force and a murder just happened

129
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,340
this is not gonna be in our mind.

130
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:55,720
This is only important because we're playing a mystery podcast.

131
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:01,480
You guys literally went to a like drunk fueled site that didn't exist and you went to talk

132
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,860
to a council person about their dog.

133
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:08,100
The hardest lead we have right now towards the big mystery is the dogs.

134
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:14,100
What I'm really concerned about now is I made the chief cry with a gift that I didn't actually

135
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,760
get her that I said was mine.

136
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,500
And I'm really concerned about finding out where she is.

137
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,820
You wanna go hit up that chief?

138
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,820
That is probably the most pressing mystery.

139
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:24,900
We all drive all three of our cop cars back to the station.

140
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:28,300
Did I lay out too many mysteries right off the top?

141
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:32,300
No we're just bad.

142
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,620
I think it's good leads to more.

143
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,980
You just gotta focus our energy on...

144
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:42,420
Okay let me get an intelligence check from whoever has the highest intelligence.

145
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,420
I got 50.

146
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,420
75?

147
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,420
55.

148
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,420
Yes.

149
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:50,860
You do have the dead body and you basically have one lead from that.

150
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:54,100
Which is the woman who called and then crashed your car.

151
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,260
Have we heard back from the coroner on...

152
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,260
Yes.

153
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,260
She had the brand on her back that said this is a fool.

154
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,260
Oh that's right.

155
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:01,260
Would I know this?

156
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:09,060
The brand that she had on her back was that in like the same size or font that the do

157
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:12,740
not open if you want to live was branded into the trunk.

158
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,660
You haven't seen a picture of the back.

159
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:19,820
Hey do you guys have a picture of the back that I could see?

160
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,980
He says to the wind.

161
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:24,260
Hey uh...

162
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:28,580
We all look at Keith.

163
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,580
What?

164
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,180
She was...

165
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:35,140
This just popped up in my mind because I'm a good detective.

166
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,140
He says confidently.

167
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,900
I'm a good detective.

168
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:43,220
So what I just thought that neither of you did, which proves how good of a detective

169
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:45,480
I am.

170
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:52,520
So the do not open if you want to live was branded into the trunk and that lady had that

171
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,980
brand in her back.

172
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:58,860
Yeah so I'd like to see a picture of the text on her back.

173
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,100
We can just have the coroner send that over.

174
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,460
Yeah what do you guys want to do next?

175
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:06,200
I think we maybe are interested in what's going on with the chief.

176
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,300
So I would call her real quick first.

177
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:11,160
Okay so you left John Peters house in what state?

178
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,160
I closed.

179
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,820
It seems like Keith did his due diligence so.

180
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,420
We closed the door this time.

181
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,420
And then just bailed.

182
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,420
And we leave.

183
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,420
Alright cool.

184
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:22,320
So you guys are back at the police station.

185
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,260
You let Drew know that you want to get a hold of county and get a picture of the back of

186
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,660
the body that was found out in the junkyard.

187
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:32,420
Honestly I'd like to have all the pictures that the coroner took just for posterity.

188
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:33,420
Sure.

189
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,420
Perfect absolutely.

190
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:39,100
So none of this in the box that we gave her made any sense to you?

191
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,260
I didn't recognize any of it.

192
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:46,140
It seemed like it might be symbolic of some sort of stratification in the city or perhaps

193
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,140
amongst the cult.

194
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:51,780
I panicked when that box was there and I said yeah I gave that to you.

195
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:54,340
Didn't know that it would make her react that way so.

196
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:57,620
I asked Drew so you didn't see anybody drop off that box?

197
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:58,620
No.

198
00:09:58,620 --> 00:09:59,980
I called the chief.

199
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:01,620
Okay on her cell phone.

200
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,140
It goes straight to voicemail.

201
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:05,220
In my seventeen years with her.

202
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,220
This has never happened.

203
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,220
Not even remotely?

204
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,220
Not even close.

205
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,380
Okay so I'm a little maybe worried.

206
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,380
I would be.

207
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:14,140
Guys I think I'm going to go head over to the chiefs house just check on her.

208
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,900
She's never missed a day of work like this before.

209
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:19,780
Can I ride along with you I just I feel really really really bad.

210
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:20,780
Yeah sure.

211
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,420
I just want to apologize when we see her.

212
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:24,100
John Lee what are you thinking?

213
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,220
A man of few words.

214
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:27,500
Which ones do you want to use to describe your actions?

215
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,500
Tag.

216
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,500
Tag along.

217
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,500
Are you going to come with?

218
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,500
Yeah.

219
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,500
Might as well.

220
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,500
Shotgun.

221
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,500
We do that.

222
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,500
Okay you guys head over to the chiefs house.

223
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:39,940
The chief lives in the old neighborhood right by beans pond.

224
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,020
She has.

225
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,020
A nice old house.

226
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,020
Is that the northwest?

227
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,020
Is that beans pond?

228
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:46,020
No this is just southwest of downtown.

229
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:51,680
Where is the chiefs house in relation to John Peters and also Kerry pages?

230
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:59,620
The chief lives a few blocks northeast of John Peters and Mildred Mitchell and just

231
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:02,720
east of pages Kerry pages.

232
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,080
So they're all like within blocks of each other?

233
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,080
Oh yeah.

234
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,080
Cool.

235
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,080
Yep yep yep yep yep.

236
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:12,160
So you go to the chiefs house and her cruiser is not out front.

237
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:17,380
Does she drive her cruiser as her personal vehicle or does she have a personal vehicle?

238
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:20,000
I think she probably has a truck.

239
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Like a F-150.

240
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,760
Can I do a search roll for the chief?

241
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:28,480
Yeah go for it.

242
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,520
He doesn't do a search roll for the chief.

243
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,920
Eighty four on a fitty.

244
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:33,920
You don't find her.

245
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,920
Oh darn.

246
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:35,920
Hey guys.

247
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,920
Guys I've really tried my best here.

248
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,020
Is her truck in the driveway?

249
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,560
You would know.

250
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,920
I think you've known her for a long time.

251
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,520
Her truck is in the garage typically.

252
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,720
I'm going to go and knock on the door.

253
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,120
Okay there's no response.

254
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,680
I look in the windows.

255
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:53,200
There is probably just like one window up front that you can see through the curtains

256
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,800
a little bit and you can't see it.

257
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,640
Could you describe her house to me?

258
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,640
It's nice.

259
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,960
Like are we?

260
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,960
Thank you for that.

261
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,760
This is a range style house.

262
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:07,120
It's got a nice little front patio area with a bench on it.

263
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,120
Nice.

264
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,120
Nice.

265
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,120
Made a note.

266
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,120
Cool.

267
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,120
Rick?

268
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,120
Uh yeah.

269
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,120
Of course.

270
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,120
What did it, what was my looking in the windows?

271
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,120
What did that?

272
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,560
See it's dark in there.

273
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,560
There's no movement.

274
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,560
I tried the handle.

275
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,560
See if it's open.

276
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,560
It's not.

277
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,560
It's locked.

278
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,880
I'm going to swing around back guys and see if the back door is open because I feel so

279
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:32,640
bad about making her storm off and I just, I need to apologize and this seems a little

280
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,640
fishy.

281
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,640
I don't know.

282
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,640
Go check it.

283
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,640
So I'm going to, yeah.

284
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,740
She's got a gate on her privacy fence that doesn't have a lock on it so you just go into

285
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:44,780
her backyard and as you're walking through her backyard you can see in her back windows

286
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:45,920
and the lights are off.

287
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,920
Nobody's home.

288
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,920
I'm going to check the back door.

289
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,720
Absolutely.

290
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,720
Yeah.

291
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,720
Hold on just a second.

292
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,480
I'm going to do a roll for her real quick.

293
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,800
That's a spoiler that she is alive.

294
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,800
Oh yeah.

295
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,800
No, no, no.

296
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,800
Everything's locked up nice and tight.

297
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,800
Everything's locked up.

298
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,800
Okay.

299
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,800
Yep.

300
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,800
Well I swing back around front and uh.

301
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,780
Uh you guys think we should uh go and check on uh at Klinker's?

302
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:07,280
Does she hang out at Klinker's?

303
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,440
That's where she does her drinking.

304
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,280
I didn't, well the more you know.

305
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,860
I didn't see her there last night.

306
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:14,420
Let's go check and just see if, was it Harry Klinker?

307
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,420
Who's the guy that runs that place?

308
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,420
You know Harry.

309
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,420
I don't know Harry.

310
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:18,920
I don't know anybody in this town.

311
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,920
It's a few boys.

312
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,420
Let's go to Klinker's and check out and see if anybody saw her.

313
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:27,740
If not, you know, I think between the three of us we can handle this murder mystery.

314
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:31,460
We don't need the chief, but I'd love to apologize to her.

315
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,700
Her steady guidance would be appreciated.

316
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,900
So yeah, we head over to Klinker's.

317
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,300
Okay, you walk into Klinker's.

318
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:40,620
Klinker's is like a small shitty dive bar.

319
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,760
When you walk in, there's cigarette smoke hanging in the air.

320
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,000
There's three tables.

321
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,340
There's a pool table and a bar.

322
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:51,500
There's a couple of regulars in there and Harry, the owner and bartender is back behind

323
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,500
the bar.

324
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:57,340
He is a tall older man with turkey neck and bad teeth.

325
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,540
Yo turkey neck.

326
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:03,860
You stand under your breath as you walk in.

327
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,820
What did Harry do to you?

328
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:06,820
Dick?

329
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:11,100
I bet, like honestly, I bet Harry would be pretty anxious to see all three cops in town

330
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,620
walk into his establishment.

331
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,560
Absolutely he would be.

332
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,560
Can we establish this?

333
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,280
Do you know this guy?

334
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,280
Probably.

335
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,280
Yeah.

336
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,280
I think we all do.

337
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,280
I don't.

338
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,280
I'm playing the new kid in town.

339
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,280
I know, but you've been here for a few months.

340
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,280
You probably at least.

341
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,480
Wait, you are from here, right?

342
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:29,160
I'm from here, like elementary school, moved to the city.

343
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,240
Harry Klinker babysat every child.

344
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,240
Yeah.

345
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,240
He was my babysitter.

346
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,760
Did your mama never drop you off at Klinker's?

347
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,800
Oh, I forgot to mention there is a-

348
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,800
There's a baby seat.

349
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:43,280
You see, there's a doorway in the back right of the bar and it's got one of those baby

350
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:48,640
gates on it and there are three toddlers standing over the edge trying to crawl over.

351
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,640
No one's watching.

352
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,640
Harry?

353
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,640
We have some questions for you.

354
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,640
Hey, Harry.

355
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,640
Well, hey, question.

356
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,640
Have you seen the chief?

357
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,640
Not in a couple of days.

358
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,640
All right.

359
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,640
Thanks.

360
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,640
And we head out.

361
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,640
Bye, Harry.

362
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,640
Bye, Harry.

363
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,640
See you tonight.

364
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,980
That was Harry.

365
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:08,880
As we walk out, I'm a little bit shaken.

366
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,520
Did a bunch of memories from your childhood just come rushing back?

367
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:15,040
I pull out my pack of cigarettes that you guys have never seen me smoke.

368
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,760
Is this how you're going to vape on?

369
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,760
No, no, no, no.

370
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:23,640
I go, I just had some weird thoughts from my childhood come in.

371
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:27,960
I spent more time at Klinker's when I was a kid than I have since I've lived here.

372
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,800
Harry's like a second father to us all.

373
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,800
Yeah.

374
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,800
Oh, hey.

375
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,800
You came outside, Harry?

376
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,800
Yeah.

377
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,120
He's been following you.

378
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:39,280
He steps outside for a smoke.

379
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,100
Nice fresh air.

380
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:44,100
Harry, was Keith a picky eater?

381
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:47,280
I like hot dog sandwiches.

382
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,580
The city has changed you.

383
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:54,180
You cut up those hot dogs that boy eat them up real quick on some white bread.

384
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,300
Well, that doesn't really answer the question.

385
00:15:56,300 --> 00:16:01,220
Can't really say we offered him much else.

386
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:03,220
So in your experience, no.

387
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:06,060
He's the pickiest eater I've ever seen.

388
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:09,500
He would only eat hot dogs cut up on white bread.

389
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,500
What are you guys doing?

390
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,300
Uh, where are we going?

391
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,300
Great question.

392
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,300
Okay.

393
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,080
What's, what's the hottest lead we got?

394
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,900
So I ran the body's prints and hair.

395
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:19,900
Got nothing back.

396
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:20,900
Yeah.

397
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:21,900
Took the body to the corner.

398
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:22,900
I guess we could run.

399
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:25,380
Have I, have I seen, have I seen those pictures from Ju yet?

400
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,380
Oh, uh, yeah.

401
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,820
Drew will send them on over.

402
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,260
Oh, go ahead and roll a sanity check for me.

403
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,260
No.

404
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,260
93.

405
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,260
Okay.

406
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,260
Yeah.

407
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:37,740
You're going to lose one sanity as you see this brutal act shown out on this, uh, this

408
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,300
woman's back.

409
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,940
The skin is blistered and boiled around each letter.

410
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:46,620
And instead of looking at the picture, I take his word for it.

411
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,740
Smart.

412
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:53,380
Did the corner and doing the autopsy of the body do anything more to identify it than

413
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,380
we did?

414
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,380
Would they have done anything like that?

415
00:16:55,380 --> 00:17:00,300
The report came back with a bunch of odd results, so they're going to run them again to double

416
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,300
check some stuff.

417
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,300
They're not sure what's going on.

418
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,300
Okay.

419
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:06,260
And then also the Julie gal who crashed her car.

420
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,260
Yeah.

421
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,260
Julie Maxwell.

422
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,260
Rest in peace.

423
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,220
Yeah.

424
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:12,700
They called and said that she was pronounced dead last night.

425
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,740
We should maybe do some investigation on her.

426
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:19,380
We should probably get, uh, have the coroner look at her and give us some information.

427
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,380
Some kind of inquest.

428
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:24,220
Cause this is a, this is my main person of interest.

429
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:27,620
John, when you searched her car, did you get identification?

430
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:28,620
Yes.

431
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:29,620
Let's look into that.

432
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:30,620
Let's see if she's, let's run her name.

433
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:31,620
See if she's on casenet.

434
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:32,620
Yeah.

435
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:33,620
Right.

436
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:37,380
You want to just run her info in the database and maybe even Facebook or just like see if

437
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:38,740
you get any background on her.

438
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:39,740
Okay.

439
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:40,740
Sounds good.

440
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:45,420
You are going to find that she has an Etsy page for her taxidermy.

441
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:46,700
She's a taxidermist.

442
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:50,100
What's her last name, Julie Maxwell.

443
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:55,580
Maybe like a few, uh, disorderly conduct charges from a couple of years ago.

444
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:56,580
Here in town.

445
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,580
Here in town.

446
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:58,580
Was it alcohol related?

447
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:59,580
Yeah.

448
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:07,260
And then also she was given a restraining order 15 years ago and it was against a Leo

449
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,260
piston.

450
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:12,260
So she got it awarded to her against Leo or Leo put it out on her.

451
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:15,740
Leo put it out on her and Leo is the junkyard man.

452
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:16,740
Right?

453
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:17,740
Yeah.

454
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,020
Is Leo the one we met or did we meet his man?

455
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:23,180
Maybe we shouldn't have let him just go home last night.

456
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,240
I hope they're still there.

457
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,820
What's what's Leo's brother's name, George.

458
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:28,820
And we talked to Leo.

459
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:29,820
Right.

460
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:30,820
I think we talked to Leo.

461
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:31,820
Yep.

462
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:32,820
All right.

463
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,820
Well let's take off toot sweet to the piston boys.

464
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:36,100
We at least got to inform him what happened on his property.

465
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:38,820
That can be the auspices in which we visit them.

466
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:39,820
Yeah.

467
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:40,820
Okay.

468
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:45,860
And just to stay on the same thread, you guys wanted to talk to the hospital about Julie

469
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,100
Maxwell's body.

470
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:51,900
So you have Drew send over a message to them saying that you want a full report on the

471
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,220
autopsy of Julie Maxwell's body.

472
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,220
Okay.

473
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:59,080
And then the three of you head out to the piston farm.

474
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,820
It's kind of by the junkyard in the far Southeast corner.

475
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,860
So they like live right next to it.

476
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:04,860
Gotcha.

477
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:13,980
Googled it and I did not use auspices close camera close.

478
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:17,380
Well too hungover for some of these words.

479
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,380
Happy new year.

480
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,380
Okay.

481
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,580
So the three of you drive out to the piston farm.

482
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:23,160
It's a pig farm.

483
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:28,900
And when you arrive, it's on the old country road and there is a gate that is locked at

484
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,780
the insurance farm gate.

485
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:31,780
Yeah.

486
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:32,780
Call Leo.

487
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:33,780
You got his number, right?

488
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:34,820
Hey Leo.

489
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:35,820
Oh, the farm.

490
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:41,860
You can see the farm and it is probably 150 yards off the road.

491
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:44,300
I started hollering, but I also call him on myself.

492
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,300
I call him on myself.

493
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,300
Click.

494
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,300
Hey.

495
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,300
Oh, I thought, I thought he hung up.

496
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,300
Hello?

497
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,300
Hey Leo.

498
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,300
Hey buddy.

499
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,300
We're we're outside.

500
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:58,660
We need to, uh, yeah, this is, uh, this is John Lee Pettymore, the fourth of a deputy.

501
00:19:58,660 --> 00:19:59,660
You know me, Leo.

502
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:00,660
You're the deputy?

503
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:01,660
I'm a deputy.

504
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:02,660
All right.

505
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:05,960
Just four, one we rarely see.

506
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,960
Can you let us in buddy?

507
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,960
To what?

508
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,960
You guys got my key?

509
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,960
Your pig farm?

510
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:13,340
Your very ominous pig farm.

511
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:16,300
We do also have his key to return to him.

512
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,860
We told him that we would do this.

513
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:18,860
Yeah.

514
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:19,860
Hey Leo, that's why we're here.

515
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,060
We're bringing you your key back.

516
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:23,100
I'll be right out.

517
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:29,320
So you wait a second after the phone call ends and his beat up old truck comes driving

518
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:33,440
down the road and goes up to the other side of the gate and he gets out of the truck

519
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,400
and walks up, kind of leans over the gate and he's still, he's wearing those overalls

520
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:41,160
and they're covered in shit and he's got no shirt on underneath it.

521
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:48,240
He's got one of the overalls, unstrapped, all sexy like, and uh, he leans over and he's

522
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,240
like, all right.

523
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,240
It's like piggy couture.

524
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:54,320
You got my key?

525
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,320
Oh boy.

526
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,160
Can't nail this voice down.

527
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,160
What's happening?

528
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,220
And cut and you got my key?

529
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:06,220
And one more.

530
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:08,000
You got my key?

531
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Let's try it.

532
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Let's try a funny one.

533
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I'm so angry.

534
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
You got my key.

535
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Sad.

536
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
One more time.

537
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I think you nailed this.

538
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I've got my key.

539
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
No, Leo.

540
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Actually we do.

541
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
That's why we're here.

542
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,600
Oh, I like that back now.

543
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,600
Can we come in?

544
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,160
Could you put on some tea for us Leo?

545
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,160
We'd like to talk.

546
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:31,840
If you want to give me my key and then we could say bye, that'd be best case scenario

547
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,840
for me.

548
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,680
Well, Leo, that makes me want to talk to you even more.

549
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:39,800
Well, I'm a fun boy to talk to, but I just like my key.

550
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,800
Yeah.

551
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,200
Let's, uh, let us in here.

552
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:50,300
We'll, we'll get you your key once we settle down and, and, and y'all stay right there

553
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:53,720
and I'll reach my hand over this fence here, which I'm doing now.

554
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,720
Put your hands up.

555
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,720
Oh geez.

556
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,720
Okay.

557
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:02,320
So now he's horrified and he puts his hands straight in the air and he's like, what?

558
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,320
We're all good here.

559
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,120
Let's just go back to your house.

560
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,120
Let's sit down.

561
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,120
Let's have a drink.

562
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,600
And we gotta have, we have a few questions.

563
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,600
I'll be right back.

564
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,600
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

565
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,600
Okay.

566
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,600
Well we hop over the gate.

567
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,600
Yeah.

568
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,600
We come in.

569
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,400
Oh, he comes back on his cell phone and he's like, George, George, the police are here

570
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:23,320
and they hopped over the fence, but I don't think you should, they should be here.

571
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:27,640
They just came to return my key and now they're on the property.

572
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,680
So yeah, that actually, that we probably fucked up there.

573
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:35,400
If you could, if you could come down here and then he listens for a second and he's

574
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:41,920
like, Oh, warrant, warrant, warrant and or probable cause warrant.

575
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,920
Yeah.

576
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:47,520
Our probable cause is a dead body and you having a pig farm and it was on the dead body

577
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,120
was on your property.

578
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,320
There's a dead body on my property.

579
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,320
You knew this.

580
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,400
We told you this last night.

581
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,260
I'm angry at this guy right now.

582
00:22:56,260 --> 00:23:02,040
I don't know him very well and he's not following my city cop orders and I'm kind of mad at

583
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,040
him.

584
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:06,160
So I'm going to step in the middle and try and diffuse the situation.

585
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,600
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

586
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,320
Hey, hey, uh, Keith, hang on, hang on a second.

587
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,600
Hey, I've got my hand on my gun and I'm looking at it.

588
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,600
Leo.

589
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,600
Uh, I'm sorry.

590
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,200
We, we kind of bum rush you right here like this.

591
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,760
Uh, it's just, we've got a, we're all pretty hungover.

592
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,200
We got a pretty strong case going here.

593
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:26,560
That's uh, it's real messed up, but uh, there's a chance that Julie Maxwell's caught up in

594
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,560
something here.

595
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,880
We found out that you had a restraining order against her.

596
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,800
We just wanted to know what that was about.

597
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,800
Yeah.

598
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,800
What's up with Julie Maxwell?

599
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,800
What an elegant way to put it.

600
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:42,080
I just don't, you know, that was the past and it's over and I, and she's, she's fine

601
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,320
now and everything, I did everything fine.

602
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,320
I'm fine.

603
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,320
No, no.

604
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,520
We know you got the restraining order against her.

605
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,520
We know that.

606
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,520
Yeah.

607
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,640
We just wondered what was the cause of all that?

608
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,800
It was because she thought I'd done killed her sister.

609
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,120
Why did she think that you killed her sister?

610
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:01,200
I accidentally, huh.

611
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,620
Wait, would we know about this case?

612
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:09,120
Go ahead and roll, uh, not you Keith, but the other two who are in town.

613
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,440
If you want to roll law.

614
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,440
Yeah.

615
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,440
54 and a 50.

616
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,440
Oh, bummer.

617
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,440
Uh, 29 on a 60.

618
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,440
Oh, awesome.

619
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:24,400
Uh, Clark Bishop, you would remember roughly 15 and a half years ago or so Leo piston,

620
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:32,200
uh, was involved in a manslaughter case for the death of Julie Maxwell's younger sister.

621
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,200
He did a year in juvie.

622
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,480
Wait, how old was he at the time?

623
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,640
He was 16.

624
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,920
How old is he right now?

625
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:41,120
Well, that was about, yeah, he's like 32.

626
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,160
Were you just testing his math?

627
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:50,040
I was thinking of Leo is like a 60 year old man.

628
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:54,040
So that no, I definitely did not think this Leo.

629
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:58,480
You look a little worse for where I think this Julie business has been, it's been way

630
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,480
in on you.

631
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:03,320
I've been, I'm been good and I've been good and everything's been fine.

632
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,080
Does Clark remember the sister's name?

633
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:12,400
Uh, her sister's name was, uh, it was, uh, well, Ashley boom.

634
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:16,480
Does Clark connect the dots?

635
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,640
As soon as he hears Leo say that, would I have been like, Oh yeah, the Maxwell girls,

636
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,640
like, did I know them?

637
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:25,480
You wouldn't, it was kind of a big deal, but that was 15 years ago and a lot, you know,

638
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,480
a lot of stuff happened.

639
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,440
A lot of clinkers between then and now.

640
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,940
A lot of TV dinners.

641
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:33,680
They were going for a second degree, which is a cop.

642
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:36,680
I of course know means.

643
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:47,480
Well, obviously as a cop manslaughter law and order has taught us is when some somebody's

644
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:50,320
dead, but you didn't mean nothing.

645
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:56,580
Second degree murder is any intentional murder with malice, a forethought, but is not premeditated

646
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:57,580
or planned.

647
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:58,580
Hmm.

648
00:25:58,580 --> 00:25:59,580
A crime of passion.

649
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:03,280
We're in a pretty heated moment in world right now.

650
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,280
Definitely.

651
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:07,000
All these memories are flooding into your brain.

652
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:14,140
Clark Leo immediately just throws his hands into his overalls like kind of childlike hands

653
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:15,140
in his shirt.

654
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:18,400
Luke, I think you said Keith Vigna has his hand on his gun.

655
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:23,980
Yeah, I have my hand on my gun, but also I can sense the little relationship that Clark

656
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,360
and him have going on.

657
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:29,000
So I moved my hand from my gun to my taser.

658
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,520
Keith, Keith, there's no need for that.

659
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,680
I looked, I'm looking straight at Leo.

660
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,080
Leo's a good boy.

661
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,760
I'm a good, I'm a good, I'm a good, I'm a good boy.

662
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,760
He's a good boy to talk to.

663
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,760
I'm a good boy.

664
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,800
Let's go back to your house and let's talk about this.

665
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,800
No, it's fine.

666
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,800
It's fine.

667
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,800
No, we can talk.

668
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,800
We can talk right here.

669
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,800
We can talk right here at this gate.

670
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,800
I turned to Keith.

671
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,800
Hey, Keith.

672
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:56,960
I forgot that I knew all about this restraining order that Ashley girl, that happened right

673
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,080
around when I joined up with the force.

674
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,680
It was, it was a bad time.

675
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:05,000
I ease my grip up on my taser, but I'm still kind of hovering.

676
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
I turn back to Leo.

677
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Leo.

678
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
I'm sorry we brought all that up.

679
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,520
It's just, we've got a, we've got a real sticky case here.

680
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,520
Sticky?

681
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,520
Hairy.

682
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:16,080
Hey Leo though, have you had any contact with Julie in the past few weeks?

683
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,080
No, no.

684
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,080
She stayed away.

685
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,080
She stayed away.

686
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,760
She hasn't, she hasn't reached out to you recently?

687
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:21,760
No.

688
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,800
I think with that information that you had before, you would know that the, her sister

689
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,760
died on December 1st, 15 years ago.

690
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,000
So wait, this is the anniversary or the day after?

691
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,560
Yesterday was the anniversary.

692
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,560
Wow.

693
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,560
Bad day for her parents.

694
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:40,840
I look, I look right at Leo and I go, do you know anyone that drives a white Honda Toyota?

695
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:41,840
A white Honda Toyota?

696
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,920
A white Toyota Honda Accord Civic.

697
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:47,000
Leo, you know anybody in town who has a white Toyota?

698
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,160
Leo, do you know anybody that drives a, is it a Toyota?

699
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,160
Yeah.

700
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,160
Do you know anybody?

701
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,160
Sorry.

702
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,160
No, it's really funny.

703
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,480
No, this is definitely the guy you should ask about this.

704
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,480
Do you know anybody in town?

705
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,480
Leo, where's the chief?

706
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:07,480
Hey, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a good detective.

707
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:11,480
Leo, do you know anybody in town that drives a white Toyota?

708
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,480
What?

709
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,480
Don't.

710
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,480
Why are you changing that?

711
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:19,280
My hand goes back to my taser.

712
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,760
Tell me if you know anybody that drives a white Toyota.

713
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,000
I don't know anybody that drives a white Toyota.

714
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,920
How can I believe you?

715
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,920
Roll human.

716
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,120
That's exactly how I get it.

717
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,120
Yeah.

718
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,120
There's mechanics for that.

719
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,120
I got a 74.

720
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,120
On a what?

721
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,120
On an 80.

722
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,120
Oh, for real?

723
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,120
For real.

724
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,120
Okay.

725
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,120
Damn.

726
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,120
He, he is scared.

727
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,720
He is very, very scared.

728
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,400
Is there an intimidate roll that I can do?

729
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,480
Leo, I'm really sorry.

730
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,120
We are not our best today.

731
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,120
We're a little unfocused.

732
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,560
Can I have my key back?

733
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:54,480
We frankly don't know why we're here.

734
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,480
I just want my key.

735
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,480
It just seemed like the right thing to do.

736
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,840
I just want my key back.

737
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,600
We're going to need that for a couple more days probably.

738
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,600
What happened?

739
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,000
Well, we were hoping you could fill in some blanks earlier.

740
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,440
I just came out last night and brought y'all the key and then I left and y'all said something

741
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,440
bad happened.

742
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,440
What happened?

743
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:14,040
Hey, I know it didn't have a face and all, but did you recognize that body laying in

744
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,040
your garbage yard?

745
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,040
There was a what?

746
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,960
And he immediately gets back on the phone.

747
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:18,960
Did he?

748
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,120
Did we not?

749
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:24,600
My taser is unholstered.

750
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,720
He turns around and he's like walking back towards his truck.

751
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,920
George, George, there was a body found at the junkyard.

752
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,180
Yeah, I don't know.

753
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:34,180
I don't know.

754
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:35,180
I come up behind Leo.

755
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:38,120
Hey Leo, is that George on the phone there?

756
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,120
Yeah.

757
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,120
Would you mind if I talked to him?

758
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:48,120
Okay, George, I'm going to give the phone to Clark Bishop, the chief man, the cop police.

759
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,640
And he hands you the phone.

760
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,160
Hey, George.

761
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,160
It's Clark.

762
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,160
Hey.

763
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,160
Hi.

764
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,160
Yeah, this is me.

765
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,160
I'm George.

766
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,160
We're up here.

767
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,160
We're returning your brother's key to the lot.

768
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,160
Yeah.

769
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,160
Will you stop giving him so much trouble and give him the key?

770
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,160
Yeah.

771
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:06,360
I got to tell you though, George, we found a body last night out there at the yard.

772
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:09,960
Yeah, that's what Leo just said.

773
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:10,960
What kind of body?

774
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,000
Are you talking a weirdly coyote?

775
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Talking coyotes?

776
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,400
No, it's a human body.

777
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,200
We found a dead woman on your property.

778
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,760
The fuck you did?

779
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,760
What?

780
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:26,240
Yeah, so we've got some questions for you and your brother.

781
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,240
Is there a time you guys can meet us down at the station?

782
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,680
Yeah, I suppose we can make that happen.

783
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:33,640
Gosh, does it have to be today?

784
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,640
Preferably, yeah.

785
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,400
As he's talking, I'm poking him on the arm like, I want to talk.

786
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:41,120
We'll meet you there around five.

787
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,120
Does that work?

788
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,120
Yeah, that sounds good.

789
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,120
All right.

790
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,120
Now will you give my brother his key back?

791
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,120
Of course.

792
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,120
Get off our property please.

793
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,120
We're heading out of here right now.

794
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,120
What does he say?

795
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,040
What does he say?

796
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,040
I want to talk to him.

797
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,040
Let me talk to him.

798
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,040
I put him back on with Leo.

799
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,040
What does he say?

800
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,040
Yeah, he's going to come in and talk to us.

801
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:58,360
Don't need to give him any time to talk to each other and plan something out.

802
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,360
I want to talk to him right now.

803
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:04,440
A smart thing to do as RPG players, but probably a bad thing to do as cops would be to have

804
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,280
made a copy of that key.

805
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:12,880
Well, you know, hindsight is a crit success.

806
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:17,220
Hindsight screwed the pitch, bro.

807
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:19,340
It's like three o'clock or so, right?

808
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:20,340
Yeah, it's like three o'clock.

809
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:22,620
So it's only a couple hours.

810
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:24,420
If you're concerned about it, we could watch the house.

811
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:26,460
Keith Vigna is very suspicious.

812
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:27,460
I'm going to stay here.

813
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:30,660
I'm going to stay here and make sure they don't leave before they go to the PD.

814
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:31,660
Okay, for sure.

815
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:33,180
Do you give Leo his key back?

816
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,180
Okay, cool.

817
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:36,460
As soon as he gets it, he gets it back on the key ring.

818
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:38,580
As I'm handing it over, I'm like, so I'm sorry about this, Leo.

819
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:41,900
I know it was real, real frightening, but we just had to figure some stuff out.

820
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:42,900
We're all good though now.

821
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:43,900
We're good?

822
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:44,900
Yeah.

823
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:45,900
You and your brother are going to come down and talk.

824
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:46,900
You'll have him there.

825
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:51,300
And hopefully over the course of the day, we all get a lot more focused and disciplined.

826
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,300
I believe in you.

827
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,300
I bet y'all can do it.

828
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:56,700
Really get our heads straight on what we're trying to do here.

829
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:01,260
I really bet y'all have direction and purpose in all of your decisions.

830
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:04,120
Leo, you are nothing short of an angel.

831
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,980
And you, sir, are my wings.

832
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:09,380
All right, I'll see you at clinkers, buddy.

833
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:14,420
While I stay here, I want to find somewhere that I can hide out, that I can see the entrance,

834
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:16,860
but I don't want them to know that I stayed behind.

835
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:17,860
Okay.

836
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,940
Is there like a tree line close or like-

837
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:22,360
Are you doing this to hide to see if they talk to each other?

838
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,360
They live together?

839
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,360
No.

840
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,360
Which we also knew.

841
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,940
In my mind, I knew that they lived together all the time.

842
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:34,820
I just, I wanted to see the comings and goings and kind of like try to be a little spy.

843
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:36,460
Can I roll something besides stealth?

844
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:38,500
You can roll law.

845
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:39,980
That's a 30 on a 40.

846
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:40,980
Oh, nice.

847
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:43,860
So yeah, you can find a nice spot where you would be able to keep an eye on their comings

848
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:45,980
and goings.

849
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:47,940
Tell me how much I can get away with here.

850
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:55,740
I get into my car and I pull it into a little clearing in the woods and my car is hidden,

851
00:32:55,740 --> 00:33:00,860
but I'm standing outside of my car, eyes scanning for now, because I think what I'm going to

852
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:02,480
do is do a little walk around.

853
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,480
For sure.

854
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,480
Sounds good.

855
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,480
Cool.

856
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,480
Thomas and Joe, what do you guys want to do?

857
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,700
Probably I'm heading back to the station to get ready for the interview.

858
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:09,700
Okay, cool.

859
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:13,820
When I get to the station, I'm probably looking at any updates as far as maybe the information

860
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:18,180
from the hospital about Julie, maybe checking in with Drew about the chief, all that kind

861
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:19,180
of stuff.

862
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,860
Okay, so when you get back to the police station-

863
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:22,860
I want to read the chief's journals.

864
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,220
Okay, sounds good.

865
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:29,260
You would know from working with Chief Maggie Cook that she always carried a blue notebook

866
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,660
with her everywhere she went.

867
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:33,460
What was the color of the notebook that Drew gave her?

868
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:35,980
Yellow was the color of the notebook that was gifted.

869
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:38,200
The blue one is on her desk.

870
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,380
The yellow one is not in her office.

871
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:43,020
A red leather notebook and a yellow leather notebook?

872
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:46,460
I was thinking more of like, Zach, what's your favorite Bourne Ruffins album?

873
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:51,220
And why is it red, yellow, and blue?

874
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:53,640
There are three colors that these notebooks come in.

875
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:57,980
The third is red and there is not a red notebook in this office.

876
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:01,020
The blue notebook is a day-by-day journal of sorts.

877
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:04,580
It has to-do lists, grocery lists, and random thoughts.

878
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:09,140
It's basically her notepad app for a phone, but it's physical copies she carries around

879
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:10,140
everywhere she goes.

880
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:11,460
Oh my God, Zach.

881
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:16,940
It's basically her notepad app for her phone, but she carries it around physically.

882
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:17,940
It's her notepad.

883
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,940
Yeah, that's what I said.

884
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:20,940
Dog.

885
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:21,940
Cat.

886
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:27,100
What are we doing?

887
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:32,180
Millennial trash.

888
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:37,460
It is dated on the front and then a dash and no end date on it, but the first date is like

889
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,940
November 3rd or something like that.

890
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:44,460
So this is since November 3rd to December 1st are her notes.

891
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:46,820
And it fills up like three quarters of this notebook.

892
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:47,820
Chief is thorough.

893
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:48,820
She's very thorough.

894
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:49,820
She's very good at her job.

895
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:52,620
But most of what's in there is notes about her job.

896
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:55,540
Clark Bishop, as you sit down, what were you looking into?

897
00:34:55,540 --> 00:35:01,140
Seeing if we got anything back about Julie in the hospital about her death and all that

898
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,140
stuff.

899
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:03,140
Oh yeah.

900
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:08,660
The hospital actually called and this is the craziest thing, but they heard screaming coming

901
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:13,820
from the morgue and it turns out that Julie Maxwell pronounced dead.

902
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,060
Not actually dead.

903
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:16,060
Yeah.

904
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:22,040
They, somebody did it wrong and how can you live without a face?

905
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:29,260
So you say to yourself as you're in the office reading a notebook runs down my spot.

906
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:31,980
This face stuff is really getting to John Lee.

907
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:33,860
Pettymore values his face.

908
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:35,000
Is it drew?

909
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
She in the city.

910
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,220
This is the hospital in the city.

911
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:38,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

912
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:39,780
I'll head that way.

913
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:40,780
You guys want to talk to my mom?

914
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:41,780
Yes.

915
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:42,780
Put her on air.

916
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:43,780
Hey mom.

917
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:44,780
Hello.

918
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:45,780
Are you going to have time for dinner or not?

919
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:46,780
If you don't, that's fine.

920
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:47,780
No.

921
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:53,740
Uh, so right now you're on speakerphone with Zach, Thomas and Joe and millions of listeners

922
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:54,740
across the nation.

923
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:55,740
Hi guys.

924
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:56,740
Hello.

925
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:57,740
Hi.

926
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:58,740
How are ya?

927
00:35:58,740 --> 00:35:59,740
Good.

928
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:00,740
What did you make for dinner?

929
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,740
Um, Texas Roadhouse was going to make us a stay.

930
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:03,740
Hell yeah.

931
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:07,220
And I would, I would love to come, but I am.

932
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:12,420
I bet I'm playing the game with them and we're recording it for a podcast right now.

933
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:15,780
So am I going to get to be in the podcast?

934
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:16,780
Yeah.

935
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:18,460
Here, let's find a good level for you.

936
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:19,840
Say something spooky.

937
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,840
Say something spooky.

938
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,840
Dragons are scary.

939
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,840
Dragons are scary.

940
00:36:51,840 --> 00:37:01,840
I'm the only one trying to fool.

941
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:11,840
How can you have enough drowning out of the noise?

942
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:25,840
I'm the only one trying to fool.
