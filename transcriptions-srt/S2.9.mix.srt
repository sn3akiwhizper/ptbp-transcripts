1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,800
Due to a very special guest, we may have us some first-time listeners.

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:12,480
And those first-time listeners might be worried that this is the ninth episode of the second

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,480
season.

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:18,960
But I assure you, first-time listener, you are in the right place.

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,980
You do not need any prior knowledge to listen to this episode.

6
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:28,240
This is the first of a four-episode prequel story.

7
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:34,440
It was actually recorded before anything else for season two, and season two is not

8
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,000
a continuation of season one.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,600
So no need to worry about those 115 episodes for now.

10
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:50,080
Just sit back, relax, and enjoy how nervous Zach is, while Beth May from Dungeons & Daddies

11
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:53,000
gets on our audio show.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,600
Let's go to the intro.

13
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,520
Welcome, listeners, new and old, bashful and bold.

14
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,320
All are welcome in Mother Wolf's warm and damp embrace.

15
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:16,120
For I am Wolf the Dog, and I am cherishing you all live from 694.2 PTBP, the only radio

16
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:24,880
station that exists here in August 20th, 1694, the Golden Age of Piracy.

17
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:30,440
You know we got it locked down here in the greater Antilles.

18
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:34,480
Sometimes we get fan mail, and sometimes I read it.

19
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:39,120
And by sometimes, I mean, like, every episode.

20
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:42,280
It's time for a new Howlin' with Wolf, baby.

21
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:48,540
This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Eula in Bochum, Germany, who tagged that pretending

22
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:54,480
pod in an Instagram story, an Uber guile thing to do.

23
00:01:54,480 --> 00:02:02,060
Eula writes, please give this message to Klara and Robin, who hate things like this.

24
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:07,720
Without you, the world turns black and white, because your eyes take the color with them

25
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,280
when you leave.

26
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,280
Happy birthday.

27
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:17,140
Look at me keeping a secret, and give a kiss to Luisa, who is responsible for all three

28
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:19,160
of us listening to this show.

29
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,460
I hope I'm making tea for you right now.

30
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:26,180
As we say in Germany, brÃ¼der muss los.

31
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,100
Thank you, Eula.

32
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:33,400
This writing you wrote makes me feel happy, for the people in your life.

33
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,400
It's great.

34
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:41,380
But, um, can't help but notice you didn't really say anything about me, Wolf, the dog,

35
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:46,520
in this wonderful letter, but I'm definitely okay with the fact that I wasn't mentioned

36
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,880
a single time during this entire letter.

37
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,860
It doesn't bother me one bit.

38
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:57,800
I definitely am not going to cry into my pillow tonight when thinking about this wonderful

39
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:02,700
fan mail where my name is not uttered in a singular instance.

40
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:07,140
If you want to write up something for your mother, Wolf the Hal, tag at PretendingPod

41
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:13,220
on Twitter or Instagram, tag PretendingToBePeople on Facebook, or write up a five-star review

42
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:17,720
on your podcast app of choice, and send us that receipt.

43
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:21,800
If you tell your friends about the show, I'll say pretty much whatever you want me

44
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,800
to say.

45
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,520
That's how this works, my babies.

46
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:32,540
If you want to shoot the shit with other listeners of this fine show, join our Discord and subreddit.

47
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:38,320
If you want to see pictures of our faces and sick fan art, follow us at PretendingPod.

48
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:44,660
If you want to give us money, we'll give you bonus episodes and or merchandise.

49
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:51,220
If you want to find links to all that slop and more, the links are in the show notes.

50
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:55,220
Click them, you goblin, and get your peepers perusing.

51
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,940
Got a pirate problem?

52
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:00,180
I be the modern solution.

53
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,180
Time to gyrate.

54
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,620
It's R.I.

55
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,620
P.E.T.E.R.

56
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,620
with Cruisin'!

57
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:49,220
Welcome, everyone.

58
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:53,700
We are doing another short story here with PretendingToBePeople.

59
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,700
I'm really excited.

60
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,700
Joe, are you excited?

61
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,700
I am so excited.

62
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,820
Thomas, how do you feel right now?

63
00:04:58,820 --> 00:04:59,820
I'm pretty stoked.

64
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:03,620
We've got one of our favorite role-playing podcasters.

65
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,100
She's a playwright.

66
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,140
She's a screenwriter.

67
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,400
She's a poet.

68
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,820
She's a comedian.

69
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:15,340
She's Ron Stampler and Scary Marlowe on my personal favorite actual play podcast, Dungeons

70
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,340
and Daddies.

71
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,340
It's Beth May!

72
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,340
It's Beth May.

73
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:22,340
Beth May's at the house.

74
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:25,340
Oh my gosh, what an intro.

75
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,340
Wow.

76
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,060
Welcome to PretendingToBePeople.

77
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:33,480
It came off of 30 seconds of deeply serious room noise where you guys are like, we need

78
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:38,660
30 seconds of silence for, and I thought you were about to say the name of a departed friend

79
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:45,060
or loved one, and I was getting ready for it, but no, to come from the energy of silence

80
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,860
into that lovely intro was so wonderful and welcoming.

81
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,260
Thank you for having me here.

82
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,780
Thank you so much for being here.

83
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,180
Why are you on our show?

84
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,180
Yeah.

85
00:05:54,500 --> 00:06:00,260
Do you actually want to know something like really funny that is funny?

86
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,940
Are you laughing with us or at us?

87
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:02,940
Kind of like both.

88
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:05,260
I'm so sorry, but I did.

89
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:09,620
I did agree to come on the show because I thought that you were a friend of my friend

90
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:17,740
and then I found out that you weren't, but then you seemed chill, so it was all okay.

91
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,660
Beth, our podcast is actually good.

92
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:20,660
You're so lucky.

93
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,660
I know.

94
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:22,660
I feel lucky.

95
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:26,980
Yeah, I feel like I really lucked out.

96
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,580
That's kind of rare in the role playing podcast world.

97
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:32,580
Should we shout out that podcast that you thought you were coming on?

98
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:37,780
No, I just literally thought that one of my friends knew you for some reason, and then

99
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:42,820
I was like, Travis, I'm going on your friend's podcast, and he's like, what, I've never heard

100
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:43,820
of that.

101
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,820
He's like, who the fuck is that?

102
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:47,060
Zach has a good friend named Travis.

103
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,060
I do.

104
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,060
There's more overlap.

105
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,060
They must pretend.

106
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:51,060
Yeah.

107
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,060
That's exactly what we do.

108
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,460
That's the whole point of the show.

109
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,180
Zach, you never asked Luke how he felt.

110
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,180
Luke, are your socks wet?

111
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,180
Are my socks wet?

112
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,780
How do you feel about having Beth on the show?

113
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,780
Neutral plus, I would say.

114
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:03,780
Okay.

115
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,540
He just started listening to the day, Beth.

116
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:06,540
I'm sorry.

117
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,540
He doesn't really know.

118
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,540
No, I totally understand.

119
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:11,980
No, I'm stoked because I know a lot of people listen to you, so that's good for me.

120
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:12,980
Yeah.

121
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:15,940
He thought that it was a friend of his that was coming on the show.

122
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:16,940
I love Beth.

123
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:19,300
She's great.

124
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,300
And then you showed up.

125
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,300
I was like, wait.

126
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,540
Oh, damn.

127
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:25,540
Luke, she's really good.

128
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,540
It's chill.

129
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:27,540
I don't know why you're saying really good.

130
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:31,620
I'm like notoriously the worst D&D role player actually ever.

131
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,540
I can't believe you guys wanted me on here.

132
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:34,540
No, no, no.

133
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,540
We don't.

134
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,540
That works out really well.

135
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,540
We don't play D&D.

136
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,540
We don't play D&D at all.

137
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:39,540
We also don't play the game we play either.

138
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,540
Okay.

139
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,540
That's fabulous.

140
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,220
It's like Whose Line, Delta Green.

141
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:48,540
It's exactly like Whose Line, literally in that we're going to play some improv games.

142
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,780
A very tall man named Colin Mockery.

143
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:51,780
Ryan Stiles.

144
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:52,780
Oh, right.

145
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:56,780
You're making a Colin Mockery of us by not knowing Ryan Stiles' name right now, Tom.

146
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:00,780
I feel like Colin is tall for some people.

147
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,780
He is tall for some people.

148
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:02,780
Well, for some people.

149
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:03,780
That's true.

150
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,780
He's tall for me, but not for Ryan Stiles.

151
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:06,780
That's great.

152
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:07,780
Wow.

153
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:08,780
Zach, what do we do today?

154
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,780
Thanks, Joe.

155
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,780
I appreciate you asking that.

156
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:11,780
Well, I'm going to just go ahead.

157
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:12,780
Wait, wait, Zach.

158
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:13,780
What are we doing today?

159
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:14,780
Oh, yeah.

160
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:15,780
That was good.

161
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:16,780
I'm excited.

162
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:20,020
Thank you, legendary podcaster Beth May.

163
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,020
She hasn't left the Zoom call yet.

164
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:29,820
I sent you guys a message that said that your ship's crew has been invited to interview

165
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,740
for a mysterious job.

166
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:32,740
Our ship's crew?

167
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:33,740
Your ship's crew.

168
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:34,740
Because?

169
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,740
Because you four are?

170
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:37,740
Are?

171
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:38,740
Pirates.

172
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:39,740
Seamen.

173
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:40,740
Salesfolk?

174
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:43,980
You're on the high waters on the seas.

175
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:44,980
Your salesman.

176
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:45,980
Salesman, yeah.

177
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,180
Is that the name of the boat?

178
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,180
The Death of a Salesman?

179
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:49,180
The Death of a Salesman.

180
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:50,180
I love it.

181
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,180
Salesman.

182
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,180
That's way funnier than what you pitched in this part.

183
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,180
Oh, my God.

184
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,180
Sales.

185
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,180
Like, sale.

186
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,180
Oh, my God.

187
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,180
Oh, my God.

188
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,180
Sale.

189
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:04,620
First, you must sail to an unnamed island northeast of the Antaeus Maoris in the North

190
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,340
Atlantic Ocean.

191
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:12,660
You will then compete with five other seafaring crews in a bizarre interview of sorts for

192
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:18,540
the chance to win a job that claims to pay enough gold to comfortably live off for the

193
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,540
rest of your lives.

194
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:23,740
Hi, my name is Jorgen Stick.

195
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,660
Thank you for coming on the boat today.

196
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:30,640
Welcome to my crib.

197
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:35,520
We are here on the what's currently known as the Silent Doom, but oh, no, it actually

198
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,520
just changed.

199
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:39,820
At the last meeting, it's called the Death of a Salesman.

200
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:40,820
We all voted.

201
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:50,400
We have a democracy here aboard the Death of a Salesman and welcome to Caribs, the Caribbean

202
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,980
version of Caribs, and welcome to PTBP, Caribs.

203
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,560
This is the Death of a Salesman.

204
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,660
We're going to show you around who would be on the main deck right off the bat.

205
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,180
Wavy Adler.

206
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,540
It's Waverly Adler.

207
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,480
He goes by Wavy.

208
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,880
Is the camera crew now pointed at me?

209
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,200
The camera crew is directly pointed at you and Jorgen is just kind of like showing you

210
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,640
off like Vanna White.

211
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,740
He has a spyglass ad and he's looking out to the horizon and he notices that he's now

212
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,480
the center of some attention.

213
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,120
Oh, hey.

214
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,200
Oh, hey, didn't notice you there.

215
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,200
Didn't see you there.

216
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,320
Oh, hey there, Jorgen.

217
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,320
Can I help you with something?

218
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,320
Oh, yes.

219
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,040
No, I was just showing people around the ship.

220
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,200
Oh, we got a bit of a change here.

221
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:37,320
Yeah, I was just showing people around the Death of a Salesman and I was hoping that

222
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,040
you could just tell them what you do around here.

223
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,040
Oh, here.

224
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,040
Sure, of course.

225
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,660
And he kind of straightens out his jacket that's kind of tattered.

226
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:48,800
It was nice at one time, but it's old now and rumpled and licks his hand and puts it

227
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,040
through his hair real quick.

228
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,940
Well, here is the main deck.

229
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:55,640
That's the steering wheel over there and I kind of stand here and look out the edge there

230
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,600
and make sure we don't hit anything.

231
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,840
And then people come up to me and they ask me questions about things and I try and set

232
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,840
them on the right direction.

233
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,280
It's usually the direction the wind blows.

234
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,280
That's the secret.

235
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:11,240
I on a sailing ship it often is creeping right from behind a mass that's like right behind

236
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,240
you comes.

237
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,500
Oh, and me Christian name is Edward Spitz, but if you're on me ship and you know what's

238
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,640
good for you, you call me Mr. Spitz.

239
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,640
Mr. Spitz.

240
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,640
That's Mr. Spitz there.

241
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,640
Hello, wifey.

242
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,640
Jurgen's showing somebody around the boat.

243
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,440
Jurgen's got a camera crew.

244
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,640
Mr. Spitz, I was just hoping that, oh, I'm leaning right into it.

245
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,640
Oh, Mr. Spitz.

246
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I was hoping that you could show the dear people around.

247
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Oh, yes.

248
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I've always been Irish ever since the beginning.

249
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,480
Oh, from the top of the bottom to the bottom of the top, I've been Irish and I'm hoping

250
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,200
that you'll tell people what you do on the ship.

251
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:48,240
I thought he was vaguely Scandinavian, but what I do on the ship, I do everything on

252
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,240
his ship.

253
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:52,720
I'll make sure this gross tub has an Irish civility.

254
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,920
You see, I sort of the food.

255
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,120
There we go.

256
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,320
We got to the final answer there.

257
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,960
Oh, but I don't do it like no typical pirate scowl, you know, I bring some class to it.

258
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,800
No, he does it up real nice, doesn't he?

259
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,880
Plus I can read, which is more than I can say for any of you.

260
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,400
The tines on our forks, sometimes there's three of them.

261
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:18,840
Yeah, often there is three tines instead of two.

262
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:22,040
And Geneva had that before Edward Spitz was on board.

263
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,040
Never.

264
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,040
That's right.

265
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,320
Things really started looking up around here when you joined us.

266
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,000
Mr. Spitz brought you three tines.

267
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:36,720
And then we, uh, we hear, uh, the wood slapping wood and a stumble emotion as Beth knows what

268
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,120
she, what she must do now.

269
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,800
Hey, what's going on up here?

270
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:50,080
Dr. Shark, uh, just showing everyone around the ship and, and, and what it's me, Dr. Shark.

271
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,800
Hello, Dr. Shark.

272
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,800
Hey there, doc.

273
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,800
Hi, doctor.

274
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,760
Anybody, uh, sick or anything?

275
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:05,200
I mean, just the typical worms and malaria, but as she asked, or as he asked the, a door

276
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:12,840
flies open and alabaster, Chernabog projectile vomits, and you see this pale skinned, like

277
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:17,560
long greasy, dark hair, open sores all over his face.

278
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:21,680
Um, his shirt is white and it's just blood and pus.

279
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,680
Just soaked.

280
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:31,960
And the camera freezes on you and then whip pans back around to Beth May, our guest.

281
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:36,400
And uh, and we get a good description of what her character looks like.

282
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:42,120
Well, he says, I'm sick as soon as she says, he says that,

283
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:45,560
Oh, Dr. Shark looks like Tony Soprano.

284
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:53,120
Um, and um, but like in like more twenties garb, I know that we're supposed to be in

285
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,760
like the 1800s or whatever.

286
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,120
I said a year earlier.

287
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,760
I don't remember what it was.

288
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:03,400
You said like in a mobster suit or whatever, and I pictured you in a huge oversized zoot

289
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,400
suit.

290
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:12,440
Yes, that, but like physically Tony Soprano inside the suit, but, uh, Dr. Shark only has

291
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,440
peg legs.

292
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:16,640
No, no, no biological legs there.

293
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,640
What sound does that make on the deck?

294
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:22,840
It makes a real like sexy sound, which you wouldn't think, right?

295
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:26,560
But it makes like, that makes me horny.

296
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:34,200
Just one clunk clunk clunk clunk clunk clunk clunk clunk clunk clunk clunk clunk clunk.

297
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,200
It's a real jazzy clunk.

298
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,640
I know what the four of us are doing after this recording.

299
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,240
Yeah, jerking it to the clunk clunk.

300
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,440
No, you don't know how this podcast is run.

301
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:51,040
He's going to make us stay in this room and make wood noises until we tap on wood in the

302
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,040
perfect way.

303
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,640
Until I finally get poley erect based on your wood.

304
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,640
Yeah.

305
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,640
He's like, that's not quite my speed.

306
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:04,440
Um, and that's how Zach gets wood racking.

307
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,120
I was clunking, I don't know.

308
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:13,240
And then, uh, Dr. Shark is accompanied always, uh, his permanent, his permanent companion,

309
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:18,320
a parrot on his shoulder, Mrs. Knife and Mrs. Knife just squawks.

310
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,320
Mrs. Knife.

311
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,040
Oh damn, that was good.

312
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:26,800
I'm going to use that exact audio for all birds in season two.

313
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,800
There you go.

314
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,000
This will be a bird-centric season.

315
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,880
There's going to be so many birds.

316
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,840
We actually haven't started recording season two, but I just put a bunch of birds into

317
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,520
it in my head.

318
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,520
So what is it?

319
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,040
What is Dr. Shark's face?

320
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,040
Like what do we learn from his face?

321
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:51,320
What does his face betray exactly when, when, uh, when Al, when Al busts through the door

322
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:55,160
with a, with a heave and a, in a wet, wet mouth.

323
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:58,280
Oh, well, I think he's seen this all before.

324
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:03,840
I think he says something like, Al, I said, if it is anybody's sick, that is anybody,

325
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:12,360
you know, Al, like, you know, Al sadly, sadly looks up understanding having heard this

326
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,680
many times before.

327
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,760
I mean, I could pop up the hood and give it a look.

328
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,760
You know what I mean?

329
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:23,740
Al has heard this before and vehemently shakes his head no.

330
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:29,280
In the age of sale that meant like opening up your rib cage and peeking inside.

331
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,640
We get a real good face shot of Jurgen's stick here.

332
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,640
He's got brown.

333
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,640
Does he do a gym take?

334
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,160
Uh, yo total gym.

335
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,160
Oh my gosh.

336
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:43,920
As, as the, uh, as the whole classic interaction between Dr. Shark and alabaster Al, uh, is

337
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,120
going down like it does every Tuesday.

338
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:52,320
You're going to stick Jim's the fuck out of the camera with his brown chin length hair

339
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:59,720
parted in the middle, short goatee, early thirties with his early thirties brought to

340
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:04,560
us by patron modern cannabis from grand junction, Colorado.

341
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,560
Thank you.

342
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,620
Modern cannabis for Jurgen stick.

343
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:11,700
He's whimsically joyous when he shouldn't be.

344
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:18,320
So he, uh, he does a quick little jig in the, in the yak that, uh, the alabaster Alice

345
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,040
sicked up onto deck.

346
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:23,440
I think that, uh, that, that about does it for the shift, doesn't it?

347
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:27,960
Uh, did we meet everyone and you see an entire like massive crew of pirates?

348
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,960
Yeah.

349
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,200
We probably met everyone.

350
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,200
Right.

351
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,200
He met everybody who matters.

352
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,200
That's certain.

353
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,200
What was that?

354
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,200
Patron's name?

355
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,200
Modern cannabis.

356
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,200
Modern cannabis.

357
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,320
Uh, my mom lives in Western Colorado, so next time I'm out in junction, if you want to smoke

358
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,800
me up, that would be rad.

359
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,680
There's one last person that we need to meet.

360
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,680
Oh yeah.

361
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,680
That makes sense.

362
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:55,200
And that is the emperor Tamarind monkey that is currently eating alabaster's puke, which

363
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:00,280
is the only reason Mr. Spitz is not like screaming at you because he knows it's going to get

364
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,280
cleaned up.

365
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,280
Yeah.

366
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:09,240
I know your monkey will eat your mess.

367
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:14,760
And yeah, up to this point, alabaster was only just given like sad nods and he wants

368
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:19,320
more sad nods at you while he watches his monkey clean his mess up.

369
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,320
The name of the monkey?

370
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,640
If we don't know yet, because I don't know yet.

371
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,360
And uh, does anyone have an extra writing utensil?

372
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,360
Oh yeah.

373
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,360
Oh yeah.

374
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,400
That's what I needed right there.

375
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,000
I needed to write down your character names.

376
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,440
It's super handy for a GM.

377
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,440
That's a little pro tip.

378
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,440
A pen?

379
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,000
A pen is a great tool for anyone in your life.

380
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
And really anyone.

381
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Yeah.

382
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Wait.

383
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Thomas, what's your name?

384
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Edward Spitz or Mr. Spitz?

385
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Mr. Spitz.

386
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I love that.

387
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Thank you, Beth May.

388
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Yeah, that's good.

389
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,280
Joe, what's your character name?

390
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,280
Wavy Adler.

391
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,280
Duh.

392
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:58,080
I'm so sorry that I had to ask after you spent the time to create that.

393
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,920
Wait, Luke, what was your name?

394
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,880
My name is Alabaster.

395
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:08,760
You can call me Al Chernabog and my monkey that will get named later.

396
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,240
I love the promise of a premise.

397
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:15,320
Like fucking that monkey is going to get named later.

398
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:19,400
Alabaster has told him multiple times, when you prove yourself, you get a name.

399
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:23,040
Yeah, that monkey has to kill.

400
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:27,440
And then it takes the name of the first man it kills.

401
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:32,820
You guys head out past the islands that make up the Antis Maerus.

402
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,440
You can just say Greater Antilles.

403
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,440
What is it?

404
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,440
Greater Antilles.

405
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,440
Greater Antilles.

406
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,440
Mm-hmm.

407
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,440
Philly.

408
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,440
All right, my bad.

409
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:43,640
You can just say Labia Majora.

410
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:48,880
If you sail past the Labia Majora and into the Labia Minora, which basically all I was

411
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:57,200
getting to during this is, we're going to fast forward into a dark night.

412
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,000
Most nights are pretty dark, Zach.

413
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,720
There is no moonlight on this night.

414
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:04,000
You can't see the hand in front of your face.

415
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,680
Well, can't do surgery tonight.

416
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:09,240
Can't see the hand in front of my face, so.

417
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:12,240
Oh, darker shock is our commission tonight.

418
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:18,440
Will you please, please, I need my leg taken off right now or I'll lose my everything.

419
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Could you stop bleeding on my dicks?

420
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I can't, I don't know where.

421
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I can't see the blood.

422
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,440
Darker shock can operate in the morning.

423
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,240
Yeah, sorry, matey.

424
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,240
I'm going to wait for the morning.

425
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,240
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

426
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,240
I'll bring up some candles.

427
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,240
Oh, that'd be great.

428
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,240
Oh, okay.

429
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,240
All right, yeah.

430
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,240
Oh, okay.

431
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,960
Oh, official law.

432
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:36,960
And as some light-

433
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,960
Modern wonders.

434
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:42,440
As some light gets in there, you see Jurgen's stick is just up against the wall of this

435
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:47,960
small cabin and he's just bleeding profusely from his kneecap.

436
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,480
I just tripped down the stairs.

437
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:56,120
There's a bone sticking up out of his knee as the candle finally makes its way up above

438
00:20:56,120 --> 00:21:02,480
and he looks right into the eyes of Dr. Shark and he's like, I just need, I just need.

439
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,360
Well, let me, let me console my nurse here.

440
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,120
What do you think we should do, Mrs. Knife?

441
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,520
Cut it off.

442
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:15,520
I think we got to cut it off, so.

443
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,080
Mrs. Knife never lies.

444
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,080
Mrs. Knife never lies.

445
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,080
Mrs. Knife never lies.

446
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:26,080
And Dr. Shark takes a big, what do they use?

447
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,080
Like, saws?

448
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,080
No, saws are pretty slow.

449
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,080
Well, they're like big surgical saws.

450
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:37,080
We just watched Master and Commander to get in the mood for this.

451
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,080
Yeah, and you have a little cork to chew on.

452
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,080
I'll give you a little cork to chew on.

453
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,080
They're literally called bone saws.

454
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:48,640
And then yes, I get out the bone saw and should I go for it?

455
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,640
Hi.

456
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,640
Can you roll a surgery?

457
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,640
Yeah, I'll roll first aid.

458
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,640
Yeah, whatever the roll is.

459
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,640
Are you not familiar with Call of Cthulhu?

460
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,640
I'm not.

461
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,640
I'm not, I'm not really.

462
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,640
I played it once.

463
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,640
Oh, nice.

464
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,640
Did you have fun?

465
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,640
I had a ton of fun the ones I played it.

466
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,640
Oh, shit.

467
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,200
I have not because I never subscribed to your Patreon.

468
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,200
That's fine. You don't have to.

469
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,200
I didn't.

470
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,200
You can just subscribe for a month and download it all.

471
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,200
No, I don't have a lot of money, Zach.

472
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,200
Subscriptions start with as low as $5.

473
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

474
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,200
Us too, I've heard it all.

475
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,200
I was going to say, you're a shit salesman.

476
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,200
Like, you don't have to.

477
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,200
When people are like, sorry, I don't subscribe to the Patreon,

478
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,200
I'm like, well, I'm not going to talk to you until you do.

479
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,200
Oh, yeah.

480
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,200
Luke goes for the total ice out.

481
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:46,760
Okay, so do you roll like D20s in this or what?

482
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,760
Oh, D100s, 2D10s.

483
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,760
Oh, that's such a good question.

484
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,760
Yeah, so are you using a mechanical dice roller?

485
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,760
I'm on Google.

486
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,760
Just roll dice.

487
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,760
Yeah, I just said mechanical dice roller.

488
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,760
I don't know what that is, but it sounds cool.

489
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,760
I want one of those, man.

490
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,760
That's a status symbol for role playing podcasters

491
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,760
is they get a really nice clacky mechanical dice roller.

492
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,320
Okay, so I'm rolling a D100.

493
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,320
A D100 is what we're looking for.

494
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,320
What's your skill in first aid?

495
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,320
My skill in first aid is 90.

496
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,320
Oh.

497
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,320
Then you're probably going to roll under it,

498
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,320
which is what we're looking for.

499
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,320
Now, wait, also Call of Cthulhu, if you just have a...

500
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,320
We're not playing Call of Cthulhu.

501
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,320
We're doing our standard role play game.

502
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,320
Oh, it's just madness.

503
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,320
We're out of left field here.

504
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,320
We're just rolling under to succeed.

505
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,320
If your dice match, it's a crit.

506
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,880
That is a success.

507
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,880
Crunch as a bone just snaps

508
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,880
and literally one of the

509
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,880
nerves is like hanging out

510
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,880
on the end and it's just

511
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,880
wiggling back and forth and

512
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,880
Jurgen is like, I don't think I can take it anymore.

513
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,880
I earlier forgot I had this accent

514
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,880
when I was bad. My leg cut off

515
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,880
and now it's just...

516
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,880
And then he's just gone.

517
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,880
His eyes roll back into the back of his head

518
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,880
and you look down at a bloody stump

519
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,880
that you've created and you know

520
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,440
exactly what to do next, which is...

521
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,440
Yeah, I say

522
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,440
good work, Mrs.

523
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,440
I mean, good work, Mrs. Knife

524
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,440
let's tie a tourniquet on you.

525
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,440
And then I tie a tourniquet on the leg.

526
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,440
And then I'm like, you're gonna

527
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,440
be fitted for a wooden leg.

528
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,440
He's gonna be just like me.

529
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,440
As he just lays back, tongue hanging out

530
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,440
eyes rolled in the back of his head

531
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,440
you can sense

532
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,440
just sort of a pride

533
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
of Dr. Shark and of the ship in general

534
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
from everyone in the room

535
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
including Jurgen Stick who's passed out

536
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
which is fun for everyone.

537
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
It's just like a really positive atmosphere right now.

538
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I love that. Because somebody's leg got chopped off.

539
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
But also Dr. Shark has like

540
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
crazy mobster clothes

541
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
in the 1700s.

542
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
I used my tie to tie

543
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
the tourniquet. It was really nice.

544
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Yeah, I really hate the one.

545
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Everyone on this ship thinks Dr. Shark

546
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
is the coolest person in the world.

547
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
And desperately wants two peg legs.

548
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
How many peg legs have you added to the crew

549
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
like voluntarily?

550
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
I'll see. Let's check the chart.

551
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Right next to the map

552
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
looks like 72 peg legs.

553
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Weird because we only got

554
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
like 14 crew members.

555
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
He did me hand

556
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
as well.

557
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
And I hold up my very shitty

558
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
metal prosthetic hand.

559
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
And some people get addicted

560
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
and they just saw their peg legs off.

561
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,560
Shorter and shorter.

562
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,560
We got the shortest crew around.

563
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,560
Oh my god, then you could fit in all the little

564
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,560
you wouldn't have to have a nice boat

565
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,560
because you could fit in all the small cabins

566
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,560
if your peg legs were shorter.

567
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,560
True, we got the smallest cabins too.

568
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,560
We're going to have to think about that one

569
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,560
visually, but also

570
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,560
really, you're not thinking of the possibility

571
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,560
of just intimidating enemy crews

572
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,560
by having everybody river dance.

573
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,120
Just pounding pegs

574
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,120
on the fucking

575
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,120
speaking of enemy crews

576
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,120
speaking of pounding pegs

577
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,120
you guys

578
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,120
everyone wakes up

579
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,120
the next morning to

580
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,120
the sound of

581
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,120
someone having a lovely time

582
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,120
pleasurable experience

583
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,120
on deck

584
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,120
doing a peg jig?

585
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,120
total morning after peg jig

586
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,120
just doing pegging

587
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,680
just hanging on the deck

588
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,680
which is what we call our little dances.

589
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,680
Alright, let's leave.

590
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,680
As you guys awake in the morning

591
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,680
to this lovely exclamation of joy

592
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,680
you realize that it is

593
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,680
probably

594
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,680
Wavy Adler who has

595
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,680
noticed that in the distance

596
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,680
is a beautiful

597
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,680
beautiful island

598
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,680
Land ho!

599
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,680
With smoke rising out from the middle of it

600
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,680
there are four other ships

601
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,240
that are parked

602
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,240
what do ships do? They park

603
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,240
dock

604
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,240
or dock

605
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,240
off the coast a bit

606
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,240
they all have backup cameras

607
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,240
what did we do before these things?

608
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,240
Dude, I don't know

609
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,240
I live in a residential ass neighborhood

610
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,240
and I'm like how did I not run over

611
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,240
children repeatedly

612
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,240
before a backup camera

613
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,240
you didn't know, you didn't see them

614
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,800
I just maimed and moved on

615
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,800
so there are four other ships

616
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,800
their flags flying high in the air

617
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,800
as well as their little friend boats

618
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,800
hanging out on the shore

619
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,800
tenders

620
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,800
their chicken tendies are hanging out on the shore

621
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,800
there's four of those

622
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,800
little man boats

623
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,800
what are they called? tendies?

624
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,800
so the tendies are already

625
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,800
hanging out

626
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,800
so you guys are the fifth to arrive

627
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,800
what else we got?

628
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,360
that's pretty much all you can see right now

629
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,360
unless you want to give me the old spot

630
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,360
Hayden or

631
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,360
I'd like to give you a spot, yeah

632
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,360
yeah

633
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,360
it's a 41

634
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,360
it's 41

635
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,360
so my talent is that I can roll a bonus dice

636
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,360
can I just do that in case I get a

637
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,360
yeah, in case you match your dice and get a crit

638
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,360
I got a 19 on a 25

639
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,360
that sounds like such a fake talent, I believe you

640
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,360
but my talent is

641
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,360
I can roll a bonus dice

642
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,920
it's a really great talent

643
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,920
it says I get to keep doing it as long as I want

644
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,320
let me know when you crit and then we'll move on

645
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,320
basically if I'm not happy

646
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,320
I just get to decide

647
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,320
I also succeeded on the spot, Hayden

648
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,320
yeah, I got a 20

649
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,320
I succeed

650
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,320
with every single person succeeding

651
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,320
I'm going to give you a full run down

652
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,320
so what we've got here is

653
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,320
we've got four other ships

654
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,320
I'll describe their flags to give you an idea

655
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,320
of who these pirates are

656
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,320
one of the flags has a

657
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,320
cannon that is wearing

658
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,320
a powdered wig

659
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,320
one of the ships has

660
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,320
the exact military flag

661
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,320
from Great Britain

662
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,320
the ol' chestnut, what do they call it?

663
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,320
the Union Jack

664
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,320
that guy

665
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,320
he's got a

666
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,320
bottle over the middle of it

667
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,320
they've embroidered a big bottle of rum

668
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,320
over the middle of the Union Jack

669
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,320
the next one is

670
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,320
a skeleton

671
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,320
with horns

672
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,320
and then a beard

673
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,320
that is not on the face

674
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,320
so much, it's just around the neck

675
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,320
area of the

676
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,320
skeleton

677
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,320
argh, there be neckbeard

678
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,320
it's the dread pirate neckbeard

679
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,320
of course you've heard of him

680
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,320
and then the last one

681
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,320
is two music notes

682
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,320
not sure when those were invented

683
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,320
quite a while

684
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,320
but

685
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,320
those two music notes are

686
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,320
like swinging

687
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,320
off of one ship

688
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,320
the notes are flinging themselves

689
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,320
away from the ship that is on the flag

690
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,320
as well, on the shore

691
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,320
you see a massive

692
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,320
statue, you're not sure yet

693
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,320
until you get there what the statue is

694
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,320
of, but as islands

695
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,320
ought to have, there's a

696
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,320
large humanoid statue

697
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,320
right on the shore

698
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,320
as well as some other just like

699
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,320
piles of seemingly ash

700
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,320
that's pretty much all you can see from here

701
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,320
and we're gonna get you guys on one of those

702
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,320
tendies and head into the shore

703
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,320
I would assume

704
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,320
Jurgen is getting over having

705
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,320
a quarter of the legs

706
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,320
that he had before

707
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,320
knee down on one side, I believe he is

708
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,320
about a quarter down

709
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,320
yeah I guess, yeah

710
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,320
court low

711
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,320
Dr. Shark as they make their way

712
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,320
onto the deck

713
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,320
I'm a doctor, sorry I was gonna say

714
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,320
I'm a doctor not a fraction

715
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,320
doctor

716
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,320
I don't care which number

717
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,320
is above another or

718
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,320
what have you, but I'm alive today

719
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,320
and that's likely I made it through the night

720
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,320
because of you, oh yeah no problem

721
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,320
just don't mention this to anybody

722
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:14,320
laughter

723
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,320
he quickly unrolls his pant leg

724
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,320
to cover the peg

725
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,320
who would take

726
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,320
charge in this situation of

727
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,320
getting the crew ready to

728
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,320
go ashore, I can get you there

729
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,320
yeah I mean you're good at like navigation

730
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,320
and stuff so you would probably be

731
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,320
commanding the tender

732
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,320
I rolled

733
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,320
a 3 for my navigation skill

734
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,320
which means we get there so

735
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,320
slick and smooth

736
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,320
no issues whatsoever

737
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,320
in the boat on the way there

738
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,320
Alvester looks at Dr. Shark

739
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,320
and he's like

740
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,320
I found another one

741
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,320
and he pulls his shirt up and there's just like

742
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,320
another sore on his body but there's also

743
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,320
like hundreds of sores

744
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,320
oh wow that's quite the sore

745
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,320
hey Mrs. Knife check out this sore

746
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,320
what a looker

747
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,320
laughter

748
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,320
and Al feels like

749
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,320
happy, he feels like

750
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,320
yeah it is a good one and then he just puts his

751
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,320
shirt back down and like stares off

752
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,320
into the distance, yeah it's an impressive sore

753
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,320
laughter

754
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,320
oh now I'm doing mob

755
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,320
about halfway there Al

756
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,320
wants to swim because the salt water

757
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,320
really helps his

758
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,320
stings real bad in the sores

759
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,320
I knew a guy that we used to

760
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,320
drag behind the boat to get him to talk

761
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,320
so I mean as long as you don't say anything

762
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,320
we could drag you behind the boat

763
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,320
see how your sores like it or whatever

764
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,320
laughter

765
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,320
Al takes the doctor's advice

766
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,320
to heart and he uses

767
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,320
what is it, rope use

768
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,320
skill to tie himself

769
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,320
behind the boat, very well done, I don't think

770
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,320
you need to roll but I appreciate you going for it

771
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,320
he succeeded, yeah nice

772
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,320
I love Pope Cthulhu, yeah he succeeded

773
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,320
carry on

774
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,320
he ties himself behind the boat

775
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,320
he's having a decent

776
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,320
time back there, like an inner

777
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,320
he's inventing wakeboarding

778
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,320
laughter

779
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,320
he is the wakeboard

780
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,320
he is the wakeboard, what's Mr. Smiths doing

781
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,320
on the way in, Mr. Smiths is

782
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,320
Spitz, Spitz, Smiths

783
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,320
Jimmy Smiths is

784
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,320
Mr. Spitz is

785
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,320
eyeing the island with incredible

786
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,320
suspicion, but he also has a moment

787
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,320
to praise the navigation of

788
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,320
Wavy Adler

789
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,320
is I always thought being on a

790
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,320
sheer glass when you had

791
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,320
a window with Mr. Adler

792
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,320
it's just a matter of making sure that your

793
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,320
oars are in sync with the natural

794
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,320
motion of the waves, he's not

795
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,320
listening, he like

796
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,320
one eye is so

797
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,320
incredibly squinted at the island and

798
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,320
the other eye is so big

799
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,320
at you?

800
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,320
both dead on at the island

801
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,320
but he is just assessing

802
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,320
Mrs. Smiths don't trust no Spitz

803
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,320
change your name

804
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,320
Mrs. Spitz

805
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,320
Mrs. Smiths don't trust nobody

806
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,320
not even in Ireland

807
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,320
as you come upon the island

808
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,320
also I've got a monkey on my chest, I forgot about my monkey

809
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,320
also I have a monkey on my chest

810
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,320
also we're all playing I have a monkey on my chest

811
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,320
wait, wait, let's talk about it

812
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,320
let's not

813
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,320
what's eating you son?

814
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,320
this monkey is giving you sores

815
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,320
10 feet behind is

816
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,320
the boat

817
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,320
you're in the salt water

818
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,320
with your open sores and your screams

819
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,320
are haunting us all

820
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,320
but my monkey is there to give me comfort

821
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,320
Jesus

822
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,320
which is my monkeys name

823
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,320
now, Jesus the monkey

824
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,320
give me comfort?

825
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,320
give me comfort

826
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,320
give me comfort

827
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,320
that's blaspheming son

828
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,320
that's a cult leader name, hello my name is

829
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,320
Jesus give me comfort

830
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,320
yeah, love that

831
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,320
when you guys see this statue as you approach the island

832
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,320
you notice that the statue actually

833
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,320
has a lot of alligator facial

834
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,320
features that are alligator-ish

835
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,320
it's got a alligator face

836
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,320
it's a human body with an alligator head

837
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,320
it's an anthropomorphized gator

838
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,320
man

839
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,320
I'm not the only owl here

840
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,320
does it have a gator tail?

841
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,320
oh you're not sure, the gator tail might be

842
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,320
buried, however the long

843
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,320
snoot of the gator seems to make

844
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,320
a bit of a platform that you could

845
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,320
walk out on and as you

846
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,320
oh it's massive, and as you get there

847
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,320
you see that there's actually a ladder

848
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,320
up the back that

849
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,320
is kind of like scales, but it's a ladder

850
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,320
that you can climb up about

851
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,320
13, 5 meters, I don't know

852
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,320
15 feet up to the

853
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,320
13, 5 meters? 13.5

854
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,320
I'm a doctor, not an expert on the metric system

855
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,320
she already said

856
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,320
now I'm doing her

857
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,320
you guys hit the

858
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,320
hit the beach, and as you

859
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,320
just slow-mo

860
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,320
scene of us hitting the beach

861
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,320
oh my god, cowabunga

862
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,320
splashylvania towels

863
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,320
flowing in the wind

864
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,320
oh yeah, the

865
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,320
PTPB shop is now up, you can buy

866
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,320
a splashylvania towel from season 1

867
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,320

868

bath towel from us for $40

00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,320
are those real?

873
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,320
oh my god, I'm going to buy one

874
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,320

875
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,320
you'll want to soak your buds

876
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,320
wait, soaker splash

877
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,320
soak, you'll want to soak your buds

878
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,320
I want to soak your buds

879
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,320
it's a vampire themed

880
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,320
abandoned water park from season 1

881
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,320
I start climbing down

882
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,320
the ladder

883
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,320
are all these other pirate crews that we've now joined, are they all being

884
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,320
cordial to each other, or is there a fighting breaking out already

885
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,320
as these tendies hit the beach

886
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,320
you see that the other four

887
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,320
wait, the tendies hit the beach

888
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,320
the other four tendies

889
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,320
are empty

890
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,320
mad empty, and there's

891
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,320
no one on this beach that you

892
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,320
can see currently

893
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,320
but as you all are there

894
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,320
you notice that there seems to be

895
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,320
like a ditch or a channel

896
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,320
dug into the sand

897
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,320
along the coastline

898
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,320
parallel to the water for as far

899
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,320
as you can see, and it's got a red

900
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,320
liquid in it

901
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,320
let me see if I can tell if this is blood

902
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,320
not that I would do anything

903
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,320
I don't see a person here to fix

904
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,320
or whatever

905
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,320
should I roll to see if it's blood

906
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,320
I mean that seems a bit absurd

907
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,320
you get down, you stick your whole head in it

908
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,320
no, so it's definitely blood

909
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,320
you can smell the

910
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,320
iron as you approach the

911
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,320
long channel, it's about six inches

912
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,320
wide, but it is

913
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,320
blood, I can smell the iron in it

914
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,320
it's about six inches wide

915
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,320
it's wet, but not water

916
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,320
it's ironic

917
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,320
isn't it?

918
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,320
she liked him

919
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,320
yeah, as everybody's announcing it

920
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,320
Spitz is taking just a huge

921
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,320
fingerful and tasting it

922
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,320
a full

923
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,320
thirty seconds after it's been announced

924
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,320
it's a swig bit coagulated

925
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,320
it's blood

926
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,320
it's kind of a filmy layer on top

927
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,320
when you dig your finger in

928
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,320
you would have a film on your finger

929
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,320
as you lift up

930
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,320
it's coagulated

931
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,320
what movie?

932
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,320
that was a little joke about the film part

933
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,320
sorry

934
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,320
moving on

935
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,320
Mrs. Knife is such an asset

936
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,320
Jesus Christ, go look for

937
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,320
the other pirates

938
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,320
I want to send my monkey out to scout

939
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,320
oh, yeah

940
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,320
awesome

941
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,320
alright, send Jesus

942
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,320
I was about to be like, I'll put you in charge

943
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,320
how does your

944
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,320
monkey work, dude?

945
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,320
animal handling, I guess

946
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,320
a pass

947
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,320
what does your monkey sound like?

948
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,320
ok, sick, I'll see what I can do

949
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,320
alright, so

950
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,320
oh, better than I did

951
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,320
you sound just like Jesus Christ

952
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,320
sand

953
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,320
sand is like flying up behind

954
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,320
the monkey's paws and feet

955
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,320
as it clambers about

956
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,320
toward the tree line that is

957
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,320
on the opposite side from the water

958
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,320
on this beach it has hands, by the way

959
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,320
it's a monkey and then it stops really quick

960
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,320
on its hands, because it's a monkey

961
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,320
and it turns around

962
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,320
it turns around by putting its head

963
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,320
in between its legs and looking back at you

964
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,320
oh, it's a funny monkey

965
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,320
oh, it's a hilarious monkey

966
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,320
which you know to mean

967
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,320
there's somebody watching

968
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,320
boys, what do you say?

969
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,320
there's somebody watching us

970
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,320
holy shit

971
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,320
let's check it out

972
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,320
oh, so we watch them back

973
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,320
Wavy flings out his

974
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,320
spyglass in a really

975
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,320
efficient flourish

976
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,320
pulls it up to his eye and he wants to spot

977
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,320
hidden right where the monkey was indicating

978
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,320
awesome, yeah, go ahead and roll with

979
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,320
your

980
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,320
it's a 16

981
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,320
you want to roll again?

982
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,320
or a 56

983
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,320
alright, so with the

984
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,320
success there, you notice that

985
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,320
there is a tall, bald

986
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,320
overweight man who is not

987
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,320
paying attention to you

988
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,320
but he is just kind of like standing and

989
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,320
surveying the beach, he seems

990
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,320
to think that he is being sneaky

991
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,320
but he is not?

992
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,320
we got a guy over there

993
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,320
he looks like he's trying to hide from us

994
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,320
he ain't hiding too well

995
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,320
hey you, you look like you're

996
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,320
being sneaky, but you're not

997
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,320
being very sneaky

998
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,320
ya bastard

999
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,320
I start running at him

1000
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,320
we've been playing the forest

1001
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,320
yeah, yeah, yeah, okay

1002
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,320
so as you run, you'd have to jump

1003
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,320
over this little channel of blood, yeah?

1004
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,320
I step right in it

1005
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,320
step right in it

1006
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,320
oh, that's not what you want to do in a Delta Green game

1007
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,320
no, but I have open sores all over

1008
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:04,320
my body, so, you know

1009
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,320
oh god

1010
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,320
it just gets right in there

1011
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,320
so yeah, it like helps

1012
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,320
it's blood

1013
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,320
if you could expect these consequences in 12 to 32 hours

1014
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,320
maybe like 6 now

1015
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,320
also it's old times, but before germs

1016
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,320
leg

1017
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,320
right into the blood, running towards

1018
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,320
the bald guy

1019
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,320
he doesn't even notice that you're running at him

1020
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,320
I yell, I see that he isn't noticing me

1021
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,320
and I yell at him because I don't want to like

1022
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,320
tackle him, but I'm, that's what I'm

1023
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,320
about to do unless he tells me not to

1024
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,320
his eyes get really big and he just

1025
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,320
kind of stares at you with these big

1026
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,320
eyes

1027
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,320
is he a pirate?

1028
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:44,320
no, he doesn't seem to be dressed like a pirate

1029
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,320
he's just kind of a guy dressed like a dude

1030
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,320
he's just wearing normal clothes

1031
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,320
for like a person of this time

1032
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,320
period

1033
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,320
I give it a second thought and I stop

1034
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,320
inches away from him

1035
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,320
oh, hey

1036
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,320
hey

1037
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,320
I'm Mitch

1038
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:04,320
Al, did you step in my channel?

1039
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:06,320
I just look down at my leg

1040
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,320
like duh

1041
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:10,320
can we go check and make sure it's okay?

1042
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,320
what's okay?

1043
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,320
you heard something?

1044
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,320
no, it's just my trench

1045
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,320
and he just starts walking kind of

1046
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,320
back towards the beach to check out

1047
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,320
this moat and he's like, yeah, these are

1048
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,320
my moats, so they can't be

1049
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,320
broken

1050
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,320
hey doc, in your professional opinion

1051
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,320
is there any reason a man might have a blood trough?

1052
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,320
in my many years

1053
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,320
I've seen like a few blood troughs

1054
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,320
but never any that people

1055
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,320
willingly and a lively captive

1056
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:40,320
you know what I mean?

1057
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,320
not for no good reason, Al

1058
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,320
no, we've got good reasons, but that's not

1059
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:46,320
you're not here for reasons, you're here to

1060
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:48,320
do the ship race that you guys

1061
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:50,320
are in

1062
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,320
if you want to come with me this way, let's get going

1063
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,320
yeah, let's do it

1064
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,320
I'm kind of like messing with the sand

1065
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,320
to fix where Alabaster Al

1066
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,320
had stepped on this blood trough

1067
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,320
and he's just kind of making it the exact same width

1068
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:04,320
as everything else

1069
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,320
I'm Mitch, hey

1070
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,320
Mitch, is this the blood of the other crews

1071
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:10,320
who compete in this competition?

1072
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:12,320
no, they're waiting

1073
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:14,320
we're all waiting for you guys and one other crew

1074
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:16,320
we gotta get going

1075
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,320
it's obviously some sort of blood curse

1076
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,320
and I dip my knife into the blood

1077
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:22,320
so that I have the blood curse knife

1078
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:24,320
that's fine, you can have the blood

1079
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:26,320
you can have a blood curse knife, that's okay

1080
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:28,320
I don't think that'll help

1081
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:30,320
at least make somebody sick if I stab them

1082
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:32,320
yeah, that's gross

1083
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:34,320
well anyway

1084
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,320
so yeah, these are all my canals

1085
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:38,320
just kind of like

1086
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:40,320
water courses, whatever

1087
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:42,320
just going through

1088
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:44,320
shout out to Nate Abbott from St. Louis

1089
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:46,320
for Mitch Diggory

1090
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:48,320
by the way, Diggory's my last name

1091
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:50,320
I'm Mitch Diggory, it's nice to meet you guys

1092
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:52,320
I love being useful

1093
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:54,320
so I'd just really like to help

1094
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:56,320
direct you to the way to go

1095
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:58,320
okay, see you never

1096
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:00,320
is his character description that he's helpful?

1097
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,320
he loves being useful, I mean I love being useful

1098
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:04,320
that's great

1099
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:06,320
Zach's like, I wrote this scenario and I had a lot

1100
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,320
of canals of blood to dig

1101
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,320
so

1102
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:12,320
it kind of worked out perfect

1103
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,320
and a huge backlog of NPC names

1104
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:16,320
that we need to get rid of

1105
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,320
are you going to name everybody in these pirate crews?

1106
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,320
no, it's just I'm Mitch

1107
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:22,320
so let's keep going

1108
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:24,320
and so he starts walking away from his

1109
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,320
ditch and his gutter and his trench

1110
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:28,320
I say we follow him

1111
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:30,320
like this is the way, the money, right?

1112
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,320
yeah, yeah, yeah, you guys wanted to

1113
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:34,320
win the opportunity

1114
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,320
to make a bunch of money so you never

1115
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:38,320
have to pirate again or whatever

1116
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:40,320
yeah, the pirate games

1117
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:42,320
oh, is that where you guys have been calling him?

1118
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:44,320
that's where we've been calling him

1119
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:46,320
yeah, that's where I've been calling him, I've been trying to get

1120
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:48,320
cash on, I think Wavy

1121
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:50,320
is with me but I don't know if most of the crew

1122
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,320
wants to see it, I like the Olympics

1123
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:54,320
the Olympics

1124
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:56,320
has a significant supporter

1125
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,320
a lot of people

1126
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,320
are just calling it the Crucible

1127
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:02,320
yeah, I never read it

1128
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:04,320
I've been calling

1129
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:06,320
it the big thing, like we

1130
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:08,320
getting ready for the big thing

1131
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:10,320
I

1132
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:12,320
always got to appreciate your funny way of

1133
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:14,320
talking, Dottoshock, you sound like

1134
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:16,320
you're from another time entirely

1135
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:18,320
you sound like you're from another country

1136
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:20,320
entirely

1137
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:22,320
pretty wild stuff

1138
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:24,320
Dr. Shark has had to go to

1139
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,320
multiple HR meetings about

1140
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:28,320
the other international people on board

1141
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:30,320
yeah

1142
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:32,320
obviously a mobster from the 20s

1143
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:34,320
would have to go to a shitload of

1144
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:36,320
fucking HR meetings

1145
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:38,320
weird, I'm the only one who came back

1146
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:40,320
from them

1147
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:46,320
oh fuck

1148
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:48,320
as you guys head off

1149
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:50,320
Beth, I need you to choose between those flags

1150
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:52,320
that we saw earlier

1151
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,320
do you remember any of the

1152
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:56,320
I want the neckbeard boy

1153
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,320
yeah, well of course

1154
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:00,320
perfect

1155
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:02,320
so as you guys are heading

1156
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:04,320
further into the jungle

1157
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:06,320
of this island you're going through

1158
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:08,320
there's a path that's already kind of been created

1159
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:10,320
that Mitch is sort of leading you

1160
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:12,320
down and as you guys are going

1161
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:14,320
you really can't see too far ahead of you

1162
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:16,320
because the thick is

1163
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:18,320
he's kind of moving you through

1164
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:20,320
this sort of channel

1165
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:22,320
of a pathway as the jungle

1166
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:24,320
kind of creeps around your head

1167
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:26,320
almost and creates a cave

1168
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:28,320
that you're kind of walking

1169
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:30,320
through almost

1170
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:32,320
and then all of a sudden you hear

1171
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:34,320
a

1172
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:36,320
oh no

1173
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:38,320
fucking shit

1174
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:40,320
no, this is somebody

1175
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:42,320
else's fault

1176
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:44,320
oh no

1177
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:46,320
and

1178
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:48,320
this is somebody

1179
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:50,320
else's fault

1180
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:52,320
from Mitch or a voice ahead on the trail

1181
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:54,320
no, it's a voice ahead and off to the side

1182
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:56,320
and you guys hit a clearing

1183
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:58,320
and you see ahead of you

1184
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:00,320
there is a slight fork in the road

1185
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:02,320
and this other pirate crew has clearly

1186
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,320
gone the wrong way

1187
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:06,320
and the captain

1188
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:08,320
he's wearing the hat and everything

1189
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:10,320
and boy does this guy have a beard

1190
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:12,320
but it is not on his jawline at all

1191
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:14,320
or above his lip

1192
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:16,320
it is just pure jaw down

1193
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:18,320
and it connects into his

1194
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:20,320
hamburger meat which is reaching

1195
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:22,320
up

1196
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:24,320
oh I hate that term

1197
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:26,320
his hamburger meat?

1198
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:28,320
we've covered this before

1199
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:30,320
it's chest hair

1200
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:32,320
apparently in one of the fast and furious movies

1201
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:34,320
ludicrous calls his chest hair hamburger meat

1202
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:36,320
and Zach threw that out casually one night

1203
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:38,320
and everybody says

1204
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:40,320
yeah that's wild lore to just be a part of a conversation

1205
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:42,320
I respect it

1206
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:44,320
though, so there

1207
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,320
and so like I said his hamburger meat is just climbing up

1208
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:48,320
to meet

1209
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:50,320
the surly, surly

1210
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,320
hairs that have made their way down

1211
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:54,320
from the chin toward the nape

1212
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:56,320
the nape and neck

1213
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:58,320
the nape and nape

1214
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:00,320
the lips, the teeth

1215
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:02,320
and he is

1216
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:04,320
drowning in some

1217
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:06,320
sort of quicksand

1218
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:08,320
and he is

1219
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:10,320
I'm gonna go ahead and roll real quick

1220
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:12,320
he is

1221
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:14,320
he is up to his thighs

1222
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:16,320
already and he is

1223
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:18,320
waggling so hard

1224
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:20,320
he is not being calm

1225
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:22,320
he is just like

1226
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:24,320
oh no, no everyone

1227
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:26,320
hey, hey, Waverly

1228
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,320
fuck, that's me, hey

1229
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:30,320
do you remember me?

1230
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:32,320
oh my god Neckbeard what are you doing here?

1231
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:34,320
it's a great guy, I'm Neckbeard

1232
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:36,320
and look at my crew

1233
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:38,320
and the crew is all like standing around

1234
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:40,320
and pointing at him

1235
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:42,320
and talking amongst themselves

1236
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:44,320
how far from like the edge is he?

1237
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:46,320
oh he's right in the middle yeah

1238
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:48,320
you'd have to get something long

1239
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:50,320
like how long? to kind of reach out

1240
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:52,320
maybe like five, six feet long

1241
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:54,320
to be able to pull him out

1242
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:56,320
that's longer than a monkey

1243
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:00,320
I know one way to handle this

1244
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:02,320
Mrs. Knife

1245
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:04,320
cut the legs

1246
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:10,320
no, no, no, no, no, no

1247
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:11,320
there's got to be another way

1248
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:12,320
trust him Captain Neckbeard

1249
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:13,320
he's a doctor

1250
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:14,320
I'm already up to my thighs

1251
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:15,320
what are you gonna take me out the hip?

1252
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:17,320
yeah, we might as well

1253
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:19,320
Captain Neckbeard up and see a lot of years

1254
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:21,320
and I never met a doctor

1255
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:22,320
as shrewd as Dr. Shark

1256
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:24,320
if he says your legs gotta go

1257
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:25,320
they gotta go

1258
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:27,320
boy let's find some wood planks

1259
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:29,320
to sit down so we can get over there

1260
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:31,320
to sew his legs up

1261
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:34,320
you're like Australian now

1262
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:37,320
that's what I'm gonna stick with

1263
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:40,320
happy birthday

1264
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:41,320
happy birthday

1265
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:43,320
my joy, joy, joy

1266
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:44,320
oh my god

1267
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:46,320
say yoyce

1268
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:48,320
noice, noice, no

1269
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:50,320
no I won't do it

1270
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,320
he, as you guys are

1271
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:54,320
literally having this conversation

1272
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:56,320
he has sunk

1273
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:58,320
he's sunk hip to nip at this point

1274
00:49:58,320 --> 00:49:59,320
damn

1275
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:00,320
I'm sorry Nepo

1276
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:01,320
you're so hip to nip

1277
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:02,320
there's no hope for you

1278
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:04,320
and his arms are just like

1279
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:05,320
flailing about

1280
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:06,320
and he's like

1281
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:07,320
seriously

1282
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:08,320
no one

1283
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:09,320
throw me a rope

1284
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:10,320
fuck

1285
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:11,320
I can't cut the torso

1286
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:13,320
so I'm out of ideas

1287
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:16,320
okay you just save the head doctor

1288
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:17,320
mmm

1289
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:18,320
maybe, maybe

1290
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:19,320
what about the neck

1291
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:21,320
he needs his neck

1292
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:22,320
well

1293
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:24,320
I mean it's not his best feature

1294
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:25,320
does he need it though

1295
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:26,320
I mean we should ask the doctor

1296
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:27,320
does he need his neck

1297
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:28,320
for his bed

1298
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:31,320
most people think you need your neck to live

1299
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:32,320
umm

1300
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:33,320
there

1301
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:35,320
there

1302
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:36,320
there yeah

1303
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:37,320
I mean

1304
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:38,320
most people but

1305
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:39,320
there's a chance of a miracle

1306
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:40,320
ain't that right Nepo

1307
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:43,320
well always good to give it a shot I guess

1308
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:45,320
why don't you just pray

1309
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:47,320
hips to nips was a four

1310
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:48,320
he rolled a one this time

1311
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:49,320
so now he's nips to pits

1312
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:50,320
damn

1313
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:51,320
wait

1314
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:52,320
hips to nips, nips to pits

1315
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:53,320
what's

1316
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:54,320
he went from his hips to his nips

1317
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:56,320
now he's gone from his nips to his

1318
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:57,320
pits

1319
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:58,320
he's about to sink

1320
00:50:58,320 --> 00:50:59,320
I get you

1321
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:00,320
a one is a nip to pits

1322
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:02,320
you're about to run out of rhyming biology

1323
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:04,320
so you're getting really dire

1324
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:07,320
you are fucked as a GM Zach

1325
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:08,320
well next is his dimps

1326
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:09,320
that's my secret

1327
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:10,320
oh

1328
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:11,320
the dimps yes

1329
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:12,320
the dimps and then the temps

1330
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:14,320
and then the temps and then your kaput

1331
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:15,320
okay then he's fine

1332
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:16,320
yeah he's fine

1333
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:17,320
he's got plenty of time

1334
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:18,320
yeah

1335
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:19,320
then he's limps

1336
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:24,320
can I like look on his crew to see if any of them happen to be wearing a rope as a belt

1337
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:25,320
yeah go ahead and roll

1338
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:27,320
on what?

1339
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:28,320
rope use

1340
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:29,320
rope use

1341
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:30,320
fuck still no

1342
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:31,320
I failed

1343
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:32,320
none of them are wearing belts

1344
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:37,320
they're all using both hands to hold their pants up

1345
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:38,320
which is why they're not helping

1346
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:42,320
no he failed his rope use roll so he can't identify the belts

1347
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:45,320
they're all clearly ropes

1348
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:47,320
as he starts to go under

1349
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:48,320
yeah

1350
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:49,320
because it's what's happening

1351
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:52,320
it was good seeing you again captain

1352
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:56,320
hey I know how to I know how to handle this situation

1353
00:51:56,320 --> 00:52:00,320
mrs knife off with his head

1354
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:02,320
all right gotta chop the head

1355
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:07,320
yeah I mean the neck you need sometimes but uh not tonight

1356
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:09,320
not tonight

1357
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:11,320
you gotta trust him captain he's a certified doctor

1358
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:13,320
certified somewhere

1359
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:15,320
always helps me

1360
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:19,320
blood is just like pouring out of my face

1361
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:24,320
so I'm gonna try to crawl across the quicksand essentially

1362
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:30,320
to see if I can like chop off his head and get back before I start to sink

1363
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:32,320
yeah that seems really good

1364
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:37,320
so Beth I have here in order to crawl across this all you have to do is stay calm right

1365
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:40,320
so you just have to pass a marbles check

1366
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:43,320
so I want you to roll your marbles and see if you can hold on to your marbles

1367
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:47,320
okay and what what am I rolling for marbles 100?

1368
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:48,320
100

1369
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:53,320
and you're gonna roll against your marble score which is equal to your power

1370
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:58,320
okay where is my because I'm not sure I passed

1371
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:00,320
P.O.W. at the top of the sheet

1372
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:02,320
power power power

1373
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:04,320
under sizzler

1374
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:06,320
it's also under sanity

1375
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:11,320
okay I rolled yeah I rolled an 88 and I have an 80

1376
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:12,320
oh no

1377
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:13,320
watch your marbles

1378
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:15,320
watch your marbles

1379
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:16,320
it was 80

1380
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:17,320
okay well

1381
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:20,320
that'd be a critical failure

1382
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:21,320
oh no

1383
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:22,320
you're not calm

1384
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:23,320
we'll say that

1385
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:24,320
you lost your marbles

1386
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:28,320
as Dr. Shark begins to crawl out

1387
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:33,320
your left hand hits this quicksand and immediately you are shocked

1388
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:37,320
by how quickly your hand disappears into this quicksand

1389
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:45,320
and honestly your gut reaction is to hold still but there's nothing inside Dr. Shark that can hold still right now

1390
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:47,320
as you lose your marbles

1391
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:52,320
I think he's just like oh my god oh my god stop no what oh my god ew

1392
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:54,320
ew

1393
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:58,320
and ew is the last word that comes out as your second hand goes in

1394
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:02,320
and then the weight of your just moving forward pushes your face directly

1395
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:04,320
as you're like ew oh my god ew

1396
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:07,320
it's just ew

1397
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:11,320
as your mouth fills up with this quicksand and you start going head first in

1398
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:13,320
and now we just see

1399
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:15,320
let me roll a d4

1400
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:17,320
that's a four

1401
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:20,320
yeah so you are head shoulders

1402
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:22,320
it looks like she's doing a handstand in there

1403
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:24,320
he's showing off

1404
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:32,320
Dr. Shark is fully handstanded and your bottom half is sticking up out

1405
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:36,320
so we've got no biological limbs

1406
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:39,320
yeah we've just got two sticks in the air

1407
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:42,320
do you have like really cool mobster shoes on?

1408
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:45,320
probably yeah

1409
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:47,320
okay uh Mr. Spitz steals those

1410
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:49,320
no

1411
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:55,320
Mrs. Knife is like every man for himself and like completely disappears

1412
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:57,320
oh no

1413
00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:59,320
I can see a shoe still on your shoulder

1414
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:01,320
I thought that part would be more on me about my shoes but

1415
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:04,320
Jesus Christ go go check his pockets

1416
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:07,320
I send my monkey and a pill for the rest

1417
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:09,320
oh you're gonna drown your monkey

1418
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:11,320
yeah now the monkey jumps out onto the legs

1419
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:13,320
onto the peg leg like a zoo

1420
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:15,320
oh I forgot it's a peg leg

1421
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:19,320
like a zoo enclosure fake like limb on a tree

1422
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:21,320
it jumps out and drabs onto this

1423
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:23,320
they were peg legs

1424
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:26,320
so you had awesome like gangster shoes

1425
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:28,320
onto your peg leg

1426
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:31,320
and then the monkey reaches in

1427
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:33,320
what do you got in those pockets Dr. Shark?

1428
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:35,320
oh I think there's like

1429
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:38,320
like a bunch of like rings from people he's definitely killed

1430
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:40,320
and like a cool like

1431
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:42,320

a cool like $300

1433
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:46,320
no I think this is like

1434
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:48,320
from straight the streets of New York

1435
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:50,320
like mobster shit

1436
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:52,320
$300 in like 1933 bills

1437
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:54,320

1438
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:00,320
