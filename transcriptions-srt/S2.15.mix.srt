1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,760
Hello, all of my sweet little ones.

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:08,240
It's your caretaker from another dimension, Wolf the Dog.

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,880
And I'm here to nuzzle you until you grow big and strong

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,120
and become capable of great and grand things.

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,880
Then you can repay me bit by bit

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:26,320
with just a little teeny tiny bit of your life force.

7
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,680
Just a little bit.

8
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,400
You won't even notice it, I promise, until you do.

9
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:38,800
And I am sapping y'all live from 694.2 PTBP,

10
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,560
the radio station that you listen to,

11
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,440
the only one that makes sounds at night

12
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,240
to drive away the old ones.

13
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,680
Sometimes y'all write me things, and this time,

14
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,360
I guess I'll read it.

15
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,560
This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Jaron

16
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,960
in Springfield, Oregon,

17
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,720
the real Springfield the Simpsons was based on,

18
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:07,040
who wrote up a lovingly sopping five-star review

19
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,920
on their podcast app of choice,

20
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,600
which is a nice way to support this podcast that you like

21
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,760
and are currently listening to.

22
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,440
Well done, Jaron.

23
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,600
Never heard of any Simpsons,

24
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,320
so not sure what you're on about.

25
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,160
Jaron writes,

26
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,360
Well, we've been talking about this entire time.

27
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,200
The password to get in will be fuck the zuck.

28
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,480
See you there.

29
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:04,080
P.S. Keep up the good work, my guys.

30
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,440
My favorite RPG podcast by far.

31
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,360
Just became the proud owner

32
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,040
of a Splashylvania Fastpass myself.

33
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,480
Well, thanks, Jaron from Oregon,

34
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,840
but I'll be declining your invitation

35
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:26,640
because I am far too busy taking care of Wolf the dog,

36
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,640
my dog, Wolf the dog.

37
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,560
I also finally figured out what the internet is.

38
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,360
It's an interdimensional net

39
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,240
used for catching the plasma carp from the galactic streams.

40
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,720
Yeah, I know things.

41
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,920
I guess you could say

42
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,920
I'm a little bit of an internet expert myself.

43
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,520
If you want to ride up something

44
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,840
for your big, bad Wolfie to hell,

45
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,520
tag at pretending pod on Twitter or Instagram.

46
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,240
Tag pretending to be people on Facebook

47
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,320
or write up a five star review

48
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,960
on the podcast app of your choice.

49
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:06,080
Screenshot that absolute gift

50
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:11,040
and send it on for Wolfie to see and smell and taste.

51
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,600
And if you want to support this show

52
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,880
and unlock 37 bonus episodes,

53
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:22,320
all while getting us closer and closer to our goal

54
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,920
of getting back to the weekly releases that you crave,

55
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,480
head on over to patreon.com slash pretending pod.

56
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,120
Now, in fact, you can find us

57
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,360
on a few different places on the internet for merch

58
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,520
or to listen to the soundtrack

59
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:43,440
or to engage with this nasty community.

60
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,320
You're gonna want to go to the show notes.

61
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:49,120
How many times have you heard me say that?

62
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,800
A bunch, I bet.

63
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,960
And have you ever clicked in

64
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,520
and actually looked at those little links

65
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,080
or the little episode blurb that my producer writes up

66
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,320
for every single one of these episodes?

67
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:07,360
It takes him so long to type up.

68
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,040
You should cherish it.

69
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,320
Admire it.

70
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,600
I know I do.

71
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,440
Well, either way, it's time for the news.

72
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,360
Last time, our intrepid heroes used each other's strength

73
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:25,680
and the limp body of Vernon Covington, the landlord,

74
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,320
to escape from the It Pit.

75
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,800
And when they finally got out,

76
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,880
Beck Wilder couldn't move on until Cal Colorado

77
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,720
and Julia Summers removed their jackets?

78
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,320
Hmm, weird.

79
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,520
The can crew then crept quickly through the woods

80
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,560
on the far east side of Grover's Gorge,

81
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,400
heading south until they met the enormous plant wall.

82
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:55,200
Lush, verdant, and apparently quite easy to maneuver within

83
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,520
without starting a commotion.

84
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,840
There was, however, a commotion in Grover's Gorge

85
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,920
due to the sloshingly soaked current mayor,

86
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:10,480
Chuck Bidwell, walking confidently south through the town.

87
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,120
The team from City Action News

88
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,360
slinked out the metal hatch door

89
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,360
and backed toward Godel's Gate to Grover's Gorge,

90
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,720
the single, simple, steel-trained car

91
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,200
that crosses the foggy crevasse

92
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:29,920
with the unnaturally smooth cliff face on either side

93
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,800
and a church stuck upside down

94
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,760
where it fell into this chasm so many years ago.

95
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,960
You know what?

96
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,560
Y'all deserve a brand new theme song,

97
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,680
a fresh jam, if you will.

98
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,440
Let's unwrap this tasty snack together.

99
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,720
It's Alter Girl with My Life is Great

100
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,040
and it's all my fault.

101
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,640
It's all my fault

102
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:03,680
Cause my life is great

103
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,680
And it's all mine

104
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,080
Cause my life is great

105
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,960
And it's all my fault

106
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:31,120
What about my hair?

107
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,280
Oh. Oh, yeah, it caught on fire.

108
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,320
Joe lit his face on fire.

109
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,160
It's cool. We'll post it on social media.

110
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:40,720
It's dope.

111
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,560
Yeah, go to our social media right now

112
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,040
if you don't follow us or if you do

113
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:50,480
and check out a fun video of Joe's face catching a blaze.

114
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,520
It's just a party trick I do sometimes,

115
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,720
specifically on camera.

116
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,320
Yeah, it's important.

117
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,040
It really went up, didn't it?

118
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,720
Do you put anything in your beard?

119
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,040
Nope.

120
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,320
Yeah, gasoline.

121
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,800
It went up very quickly.

122
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,320
It looked like it had an accelerant in it,

123
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:08,960
but it doesn't.

124
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,240
It's just dry and brittle.

125
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,240
I hadn't smelled burnt hair in a long time

126
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,360
and that was crazy.

127
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,320
Yeah, then we smelt it for a while.

128
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,600
I think I just got used to it

129
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,520
because I'm like, oh, it's gone

130
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,040
and then go outside and come back in.

131
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,040
I'm like, oh, it definitely smells like burnt hair.

132
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,800
I was smelling it the next day.

133
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,720
That's because there was still burnt hair on your face.

134
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,200
Yep.

135
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,080
How does it feel?

136
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,520
It's fine.

137
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,400
It's 100% fine, except that I did singe my eyelashes

138
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,920
and they feel weird still, but they're going to be fine.

139
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,560
Like crusty?

140
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,480
I've done that smoke in a bowl before.

141
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,840
Hey, same.

142
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,640
The whole front of my hair went up on New Year's Eve one year

143
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,000
when I was standing outside.

144
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,960
It was real windy.

145
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,600
I've only curled my eyelashes, but that's impressive.

146
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,120
Oh, I got the whole thing.

147
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,120
And the first thought that I had,

148
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,200
cause I didn't even smell it,

149
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,160
but I looked at myself in a mirror later and always

150
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,120
and I was like, did I get like Cheeto puff in my hair?

151
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:05,760
Like dust?

152
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,160
It was orange?

153
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,440
It was like a little, I guess cause I have like brownish hair.

154
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,600
I had like brownish hair.

155
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,520
I know I actually can picture the...

156
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,800
The curly Q crusties.

157
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,640
New Year's 01 was crazy.

158
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,960
Everybody thought, you know, Y2K was going to end it all

159
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,120
the year before.

160
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,520
He was still talking about it though.

161
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,600
Oh, so you guys just pass through the door?

162
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,440
The door?

163
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,560
The SpongeBob portal.

164
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,080
The SpongeBob portal door.

165
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,280
Well, I did some research on what those doors are called.

166
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,000
Nice.

167
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,560
Yeah.

168
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,920
And apparently...

169
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,360
And now you're voting Republican.

170
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,880
You would believe the insane restrictions

171
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:57,280
that the fucking libs have put on the big ass door industry.

172
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,120
What did you learn?

173
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,200
The entrances are called doors.

174
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,360
Wait, wait, wait.

175
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,160
Like the, the watertight things that come together are called dogs.

176
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,680
Dows.

177
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:10,800
Dogs.

178
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,280
Where?

179
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,040
The watertight things that come together.

180
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:13,440
So like the seal.

181
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,800
You mean like the helical like...

182
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,120
The cams is what I'm reading on the internet.

183
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:22,400
This is a former US Submariner typing on Reddit.

184
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,040
What was that?

185
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,400
Submariner.

186
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,200
Whatever.

187
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,120
And they said dog the door.

188
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,680
Yeah, that just means, I think that means secure it, right?

189
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,120
Spin the wheel to engage the cams in the closed position.

190
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,640
Like the pins.

191
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,520
The pins.

192
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,880
So it's not called the dog.

193
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,320
Yeah, that's clearly a verb.

194
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:44,960
Okay.

195
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,800
So the pins that like lock it into place?

196
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,160
But not the door itself, which is what you just said earlier.

197
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,520
It's called a door, I think.

198
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,200
And then the parts around are dogs.

199
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,400
So dog the doors.

200
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,160
I adore with my dogs.

201
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,200
I adore my dogs.

202
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:58,880
Nice.

203
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,200
Y'all.

204
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,600
A dog door.

205
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,400
See, that just opens up more confusion now.

206
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,360
Cause when you say dog door, we're going to all start crawling.

207
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:07,860
Yeah.

208
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,440
I'm crawling right now.

209
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,440
On the train?

210
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:12,560
Very good.

211
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,200
Let's go there.

212
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:20,160
Cal Colorado, Beck Wilder, Julius Summers, and Stevie are all standing in a simple steel

213
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:26,240
single train car sized train station on an unnecessarily massive bridge, 20 meters tall

214
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,320
and 100 meters long.

215
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:34,560
This bridge that crosses this enormous massive ravine is a minimalist construction showcasing

216
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:42,080
the steel that seems to be your only way back over this deep, wide, and foggy ravine.

217
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:47,040
The fog seems to be growing thicker and taller with every second.

218
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:53,120
And soon it will be a wall that this simple steel single train car will need to penetrate

219
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,800
to get to the other side.

220
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,560
The creaking hatch-like submarine looking door that leads back.

221
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,880
Zach, we were going to just let penetrate fly.

222
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,640
Did you want us to, uh, where did you have a beat written in there?

223
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,280
No, no.

224
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,640
It says and standing.

225
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,720
So there's a, there's a hatch.

226
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,760
Pause for the boys.

227
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,040
Pause for the dirty boys.

228
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,720
Pause for the dirty boys.

229
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,160
And a sopping wet.

230
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,600
Is this the kind of hat you can dog?

231
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:32,960
Chug Bidwell in his snug, now snugger green, now darker green polo steps confidently through

232
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,880
the door, just dripping.

233
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:39,360
Suddenly Stevie, their eyes get huge with realization.

234
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,720
Holy fucking shit.

235
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,520
There's no backup for the backup mayor.

236
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:52,480
And she begins like she's going to sprint out of the train car toward the soggy current

237
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,400
mayor of Grover's gorge.

238
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,480
We're going to move in dexterity order.

239
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,760
They were in the car with us and now they are sprinting out of the car.

240
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,960
They are about to start sprinting, but we're going to go into decks order.

241
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:06,000
So if one of you has higher decks than Stevie.

242
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,840
But their intention is to leave the car?

243
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,920
Their intention is to leave the car.

244
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,480
Yep.

245
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,760
As they holler out, holy fucking shit.

246
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,640
There's no backup for the backup mayor.

247
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,200
What happens if there's no mayor?

248
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,880
God gets loose, I guess.

249
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,640
And we got to go dexterity.

250
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,200
Who's got what?

251
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,080
75.

252
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,520
Oh, you're definitely going first.

253
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,080
50.

254
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:28,960
50 and?

255
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,600
45.

256
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,160
45.

257
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:35,360
So it's going to go Julia Summers, Stevie, and then down the line, we got Beck, Beck

258
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,520
Wilder, Cal Colorado, Julia Summers.

259
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,000
What do you do?

260
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,600
He grasps at them.

261
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:39,840
Okay.

262
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,640
What do you want me to roll?

263
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,960
I'd like you to roll on armed combat.

264
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,760
Yeah, I don't win.

265
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,480
Stevie rolled a success.

266
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,320
I rolled an 83 on a 60.

267
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,120
That's not going to do it.

268
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:06,080
So as you reach out and grasp for Stevie, they dip out and take off running off out of this

269
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:14,400
single steel, simple train car sized simple train station and toward the sopping wet current

270
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,160
mayor of Grover's Gorge.

271
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,600
It is Beck Wilder's turn.

272
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:24,160
Beck, we've all resigned ourselves to trying to get the fuck out of here.

273
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,480
I don't think that he's on the train.

274
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,960
He's just going to go to the door and yell out to them.

275
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,320
Stevie, dude, we got to go.

276
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,160
We can maybe install a new mayor when we get back or something.

277
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,360
Would that be helpful?

278
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,160
We need to leave.

279
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,640
No, it's got to happen now.

280
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:46,880
Cal kind of brushes past Beck and he can't run very fast, but he's, you know, bad left

281
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,120
knee.

282
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:55,440
But yeah, he's starting to chase after Stevie and he's shouting, Stevie, I don't think this

283
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,320
is very prudent.

284
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,040
Have you really considered if this is the best course of action?

285
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,720
Why don't you just wait up a minute there?

286
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,760
Hold on, Stevie.

287
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,280
I'm really serious, guys.

288
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,880
This is very serious.

289
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:11,280
You can roll persuade both of you combined and you can combine your role against her.

290
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,760
Can I have said no, don't go and also roll?

291
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,920
I fail mine a 65 on a 50.

292
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,080
I also rolled a 65 on a 80.

293
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,100
Nice.

294
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,600
Very good.

295
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:31,440
So you are giving it your all, but I gave her a plus 20 because you had a predetermined

296
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,080
outcome in mind.

297
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:38,160
I gave her a plus 20 because the thing that she knows is very stout.

298
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,040
And I gave her a 50.

299
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:41,520
What did she roll?

300
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,080
For a human.

301
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,680
Luke, what did she roll?

302
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,000
A critical fail.

303
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,440
77 on a 70.

304
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,640
So she stops dead in her tracks.

305
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,920
I think you're getting through to it, man.

306
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,600
They turn around, they look at Cal.

307
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,080
Well, now I'm not sure if stopping them was even a good idea.

308
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,720
Wait, why did you want to, what were you going to do?

309
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:09,940
Okay.

310
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:18,160
Sopping wet, Chuck Bidwell is just walking confidently, carefully, and slowly toward

311
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,240
the edge of the cliff with one eye kind of looking over.

312
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:28,320
He's kind of glancing over Stevie, giving her a very dirty eyes.

313
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,360
Where's the other eye looking?

314
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,680
Now, both of them, both of them together, one of them and the other one.

315
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,240
Two eyes.

316
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,600
He's got two eyes on Stevie.

317
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:42,480
And he's just walking away and walking toward the edge of the cliff while you guys, they've

318
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,480
turned around and they look at you.

319
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,400
Well, Julius, you're right there too, right?

320
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:46,800
Yeah.

321
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,640
Now I feel like I've made a mistake.

322
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,000
Should you run after him, Stevie?

323
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:57,520
Um, cut that part out.

324
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,840
Chuck Bidwell continues to walk.

325
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,360
She still hasn't answered my question.

326
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:07,040
If we don't stop him from jumping off this cliff and hitting himself, he will be unleashed.

327
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,480
He's been trying to do this the whole time.

328
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,600
That's why he's the mayor.

329
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:15,040
It's this weird, some sort of fucking spell or some shit that's actually real where he's

330
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:19,760
the mayor and he stays the mayor and it stays the mayor as long as there's a mayor.

331
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:23,280
But if he dies, there's no mayor and it's loose on everyone.

332
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,880
They put it in the turtle.

333
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,840
Turtles are slow.

334
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,520
And they live for a long time.

335
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,080
Yeah.

336
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,920
And they typically don't kill themselves.

337
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,320
Yeah.

338
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:30,960
Yeah.

339
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,760
God turtle.

340
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,080
God.

341
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,120
God turtle.

342
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:33,920
Stevie should go.

343
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,880
Stevie, go get him.

344
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,720
Whatever you say.

345
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,880
And she, and she turns around.

346
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,560
She turns around.

347
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,440
You got it, boss.

348
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,600
Stevie plants their heels into the ground.

349
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,520
She takes off.

350
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,960
Oh, by the way, Stevie uses just like she, they pronouns.

351
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,600
So either one that you decide to use is fine.

352
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,000
Word.

353
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,480
Oh, cool.

354
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:06,880
Tight.

355
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:13,520
And when Stevie collides with the wet polo clad Chuck Bidwell, Stevie is trying to hold

356
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,040
on and restrain Chuck Bidwell from walking any further.

357
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:23,440
However, Chuck Bidwell continues his gate as Stevie continues to plant her heels into

358
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,760
the ground and they're just trying to hold on.

359
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:31,440
So at this point, because of the dilly dallying, you've got one roll.

360
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,720
You've only got one roll.

361
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,080
Do not let it pass you by.

362
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,520
The classic crap.

363
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:45,040
Julius is gonna realize what they said and sprint and try to knock him backwards away

364
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,080
from the gorge.

365
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,440
Okay, go ahead and roll.

366
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,040
Roll what?

367
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,040
Because he's just walking slowly.

368
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,240
You can just roll strength if that's higher than unarmed combat.

369
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,320
I'll do an unarmed combat.

370
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,360
Cause you're trying to push.

371
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,200
I got a 31 on a 60.

372
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,280
Got a 52 on a 70.

373
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,420
Damn.

374
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:11,040
So you go to push onto the front and these thighs, man, what's going on with them?

375
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,400
They're tired from squeezing the life out of Vernon.

376
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:24,720
These thighs of mine, they're tired of squashing.

377
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,880
Tired from pushing Vernon.

378
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:32,720
Julius is just a little worn out from, you know, he basically maxed out at the gym today.

379
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,640
On Vernon's head.

380
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:41,920
And now you are just trying to hold on, but Chuck Bidwell continues.

381
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,320
Darth Vader like walk toward this edge.

382
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,360
Darth Vader win.

383
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,280
Oh, um, 92.

384
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:51,680
Oh yeah.

385
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,320
The Olympics.

386
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,360
Atlanta?

387
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,080
Come on.

388
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:56,800
96.

389
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,600
Whatever.

390
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:03,520
And Colorado, uh, Beck Wilder has.

391
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,320
Zach's referencing when he saw him walking in a parade one time in 1992.

392
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,880
That was the Darth Vader walk.

393
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,280
Uh huh.

394
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:11,600
Yeah.

395
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,040
Thanksgiving, the year I was born.

396
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,560
He wasn't allowed in the parade.

397
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,000
So people were trying to hold him back.

398
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:20,640
That Darth Vader walked with such strength and vigor.

399
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,360
Beck Wilder.

400
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,640
I'm doing the same thing.

401
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,880
Stevie has convinced me that I've already seen this crazy shit happen.

402
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,800
And I don't want more of that.

403
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,280
And it sounds like it's going to be real bad if I do.

404
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:36,480
So he wants to, uh, I want to go over there and try and help block like a, is it a frontline

405
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:36,800
man?

406
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:36,960
Yeah.

407
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,800
Like an offensive lineman offensive lineman.

408
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,400
I want to, I want to kind of get into stance.

409
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:40,560
Okay.

410
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,800
Now are you doing pass blocking or brush blocking?

411
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:46,000
So pass blocking is going to be kind of on your heels, trying to keep them in front of

412
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,960
you and rush blocking is going to be driving the group forward.

413
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,320
Rush, rush blocking, rush blocking, trying to maybe even get them to the ground.

414
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,560
Once I, once I center mass him.

415
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:54,960
Yeah.

416
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,000
Like one of the greatest offensive linemen of all time.

417
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,120
Orlando pace.

418
00:19:59,120 --> 00:19:59,920
That's what I was thinking.

419
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,320
Yeah.

420
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:00,720
Yeah.

421
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,120
Yeah.

422
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,640
And you just lumber over there.

423
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:08,000
He was like 300 pounds and quicker in 15 yards than Marshall folk.

424
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,560
No shit.

425
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,360
2000.

426
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,240
Yeah dude.

427
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:10,800
That's cool.

428
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,840
Wildly fast.

429
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,960
Explosive.

430
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,400
Explosive.

431
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,440
A lot, a lot like Beck.

432
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,160
300 pounds.

433
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,360
I don't know what I was rolling on.

434
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,080
Was it good?

435
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:20,720
But it's good.

436
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,480
Well, what are you trying to use?

437
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:29,200
I mean, it's either strength or I don't know, like athletics.

438
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,400
Let's go strength.

439
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,840
21 on a 55.

440
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,160
Okay.

441
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,280
Chuck, but it all failed.

442
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,160
Oh shit.

443
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:34,560
Yeah.

444
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,000
78 over 70.

445
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,440
Then yeah, I'm driving him back.

446
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,120
I don't know if it's strong enough to knock him down, but I'm at least digging in my heels

447
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,320
and he, he was not moving forward.

448
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:47,760
You have stopped the progress of Chuck Bidwell and it is Cal Colorado's turn.

449
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,480
Dope, dope, dope.

450
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,440
When he comes, he comes panting up like a little out of breath.

451
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:58,160
And I think he just like grabs on to Julius's shoulders and yanks back and brings like the

452
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,120
whole group with them.

453
00:20:59,120 --> 00:20:59,440
Love it.

454
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,000
Go ahead and roll.

455
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,400
Hopefully you bring the whole group with you in a good way.

456
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,520
What would you like me to roll?

457
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,640
The same thing as them, either a strength or an unarmed combat.

458
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,200
Pass a strength roll with 21.

459
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,280
I've got you beat with a 26.

460
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,280
Ooh, a close one.

461
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,320
Very close.

462
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:20,000
Well, now I'm embarrassed that I said the, the thing.

463
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,880
The thing about pulling them back.

464
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:27,600
Cal Colorado runs up and grabs Julius by the shoulders and attempts to pull the whole group

465
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:27,920
back.

466
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,920
But, uh, he, he merely.

467
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,480
What?

468
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,840
Julius is in the front.

469
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:38,320
So that makes sense that, but he, I wasn't a little confused about the pulling backwards

470
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,040
part.

471
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:39,360
Okay.

472
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,040
So in my mind, Stevie is on the back holding back.

473
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,520
Julius was in the front, trying to push him forward.

474
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:50,400
And then Beck came up behind Julius and was pile driving the two of them.

475
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,280
Yeah, he was.

476
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,160
Well then no one to me grabbing Julius's shoulders.

477
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:54,960
Exactly.

478
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,680
It didn't help.

479
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,240
It didn't help.

480
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,720
But thankfully you got the momentum on your side.

481
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,320
And so I think we're all feeling pretty good about the outcome of this.

482
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,760
I'm grabbing Stevie's shoulders then.

483
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,960
Me and Julius are, we're between Chuck Bidwell and the chasm is at our back.

484
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,000
Yes, that is correct.

485
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,360
Yes, absolutely.

486
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:15,120
And it is going to continue with Julius Summers.

487
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,400
This is a good old fashioned tug of war.

488
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,440
It's a good old fashioned tug.

489
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,520
We got a good old fashioned tug of war.

490
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,800
He's only one.

491
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,640
Oh, like that old show Squid Game.

492
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,040
Away.

493
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,480
Still haven't seen it.

494
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:34,400
Julius is going to continue pushing back and try to give a little tickle to maybe distract.

495
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,360
Now we're talking.

496
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,320
Distract him a little bit.

497
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,000
Armpit, prostate, where are you talking?

498
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,200
A 70 on a 60.

499
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,680
You only put 60 in tickle?

500
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:42,480
Yeah.

501
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,680
Yeah, that's not going to do it.

502
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:48,800
As you go to tickle him, you feel the wettest.

503
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,080
Where are you getting in?

504
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,760
Well, it doesn't matter.

505
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,560
It's going to be wet.

506
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,760
It's going to be nasty.

507
00:22:53,760 --> 00:23:00,640
I had my arms on his shoulders, like pushing back and I took one hand off to tickle him

508
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,160
and I put it up into his armpit.

509
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:08,160
But like the polo is like sopping wet and the tickle.

510
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,760
Well, it's like squeezing a ShamWow.

511
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,160
Right.

512
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:15,040
It's just there's too much pressure to tickle.

513
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,120
It just feels like I'm poking his armpit.

514
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:17,680
Gross.

515
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,800
Yeah, absolutely.

516
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:20,880
He's like, ouch.

517
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,560
Stevie attempts the same.

518
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,400
Will it tickle?

519
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,520
Everybody, tickle him.

520
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,760
Tickle fight.

521
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,040
To the same result.

522
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:36,000
Finger in armpit, wiggling around, but just poking and sopping wet you.

523
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,600
Beck, we need more tickles.

524
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,200
Oh dude, I'm really good at tickling.

525
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:41,700
Hang on.

526
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,000
I'm 31 good at tickling.

527
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,680
He's going to spend luck to make that a 42, which is a success.

528
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,960
How does Dougal look?

529
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,320
What cool thing did he do?

530
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:00,320
Chuck Bidwell continues with one foot over the edge like he you're holding on now.

531
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:05,040
You've had to move out of the way in order to not get pushed off the back yourselves

532
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,760
and it is all up to Cal Colorado.

533
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,720
Cal Colorado says, hey, look over there and I want to roll persuade.

534
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,000
Success.

535
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,960
I rolled a hundred.

536
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,000
Holy shit.

537
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:20,240
Right?

538
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,120
That's what that is?

539
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:21,840
All zeros.

540
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:23,280
Oops.

541
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:29,920
So my plan was to shout, hey, look over there and then slap lasagna in his eyes with my

542
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,480
other hand.

543
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:35,440
But instead I slip trying to get lasagna out of my pockets.

544
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,280
Where you're pointing is just down.

545
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,440
Hey, look down there.

546
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:41,840
Gladly.

547
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,920
He looks down there.

548
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,560
Sorry guys.

549
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,680
This is one of those let go or don't situations.

550
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:52,000
Raise your hand if you're audio medium.

551
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:58,800
Say a holler at if you're letting go of Chuck of Chuck as he is strongly moving over the

552
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,200
edge.

553
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,360
Basically you're choosing whether or not you're going over.

554
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,520
He's not making an attempt to grab at any of you.

555
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:08,640
However, you do see that he's making an attempt to grab for Stevie.

556
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,920
Can I try and intercept that?

557
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,960
Would I have a chance?

558
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,760
Yeah, let's do it.

559
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,800
This is your moment.

560
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:17,680
You're not going to stop him from going over because that ship is sailed, but you can stop

561
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,640
him from grabbing.

562
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,320
Just want to slap his hand away.

563
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:25,120
Because he is going for a very firm grasp based on the rules that I rolled.

564
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,000
It's an 18.

565
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,240
I don't know what you wanted to have that on.

566
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:28,480
Okay.

567
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,000
He succeeded with a 43.

568
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,480
Can I go for a slap too?

569
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,880
Uh, yeah, absolutely.

570
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,440
Go ahead and roll.

571
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,640
Actually, I want to make this one last tickle.

572
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,720
One last push for a tickle.

573
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,480
A 50 on a 60.

574
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:52,720
Oh, that is a good enough to tickle the grass leaves.

575
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,680
As he reaches out, you tickle like the inside of his wrist.

576
00:25:55,680 --> 00:26:01,040
Well, yeah, as he's falling, the pressure of the tickle decreases enough just to get

577
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,560
to the perfect tickle pressure.

578
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:11,120
So with your hand inside his, it goes, it goes from poke to tickle.

579
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,240
The gradient of tickle.

580
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:14,740
Yeah.

581
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:20,080
It's turned all the way up to tickle and I get that one good tickle in before there's

582
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,800
before I'm not touching his armpit at all.

583
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:26,320
And like an involuntary laugh escapes as he lets go of Stevie.

584
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,240
Like this is like weird noise comes out of his throat.

585
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:38,480
And like releases Stevie as he just falls backwards and looks at you with these like

586
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,680
dead eyes.

587
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:41,680
Connor Ratliff.

588
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,120
Yeah.

589
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:43,920
Great podcast.

590
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,520
Have us on.

591
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,240
We'd cast you.

592
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,640
Oh, he would be a great Chuck Bidwell.

593
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,080
He would be a great Chuck Bidwell.

594
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,120
You listening Connor?

595
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:52,960
Dead eyed motherfucker.

596
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,000
As Chuck falls backwards in the classic fall backwards pose.

597
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:06,640
With kind of a blurry image behind him of the smooth cavernous crevasse.

598
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:12,080
And eventually he looking up the sound of body mix when he's ashes on a canyon floor.

599
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,520
I've seen a lot of wily coyote.

600
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,160
I think it's just a.

601
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:23,040
And when he lands each of you see something incomprehensible.

602
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,480
Your brain does cloud.

603
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:29,280
Your brain simply won't comprehend it.

604
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,120
Skull and crossbones.

605
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,080
The dust cloud with skull and crossbones.

606
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:40,240
The crossbones fills your stomachs with dread.

607
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,400
Your hands get clammy.

608
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,720
Your sight seems compromised.

609
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:51,680
And you feel an air blasting boom so loud that you wonder for a split moment.

610
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,000
If you'll ever hear again.

611
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,960
And I need you each to roll con times five.

612
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,680
To stay conscious.

613
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,320
I pass.

614
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,880
I critically fail.

615
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,040
It's a 77.

616
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,880
You're not going to believe this, but I also critically failed with an 88.

617
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,000
Jesus Christ.

618
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,280
I got a four.

619
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,200
Okay shit.

620
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,520
Thomas and Joe take our headphones off.

621
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,880
Take your pants off.

622
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,280
Take your pants or plans.

623
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,080
Strip Delta.

624
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:38,960
Boom.

625
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:39,360
Boom.

626
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:50,640
Luke, you feel this reverberation in your chest that shakes your entire skeleton inside your body

627
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,040
and just vibrates your entire being.

628
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,720
Your vision goes completely.

629
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:58,640
Wackity wackity wack.

630
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,960
And suddenly it's extremely dark.

631
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,160
It was a perfectly bright day here in this gorge.

632
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,960
And now it is extremely dark.

633
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,000
I need you to roll grip.

634
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:19,600
In this darkness, you see that the rest of the can crew, Cal Colorado, Beck Wilder, and Stevie

635
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:24,080
have all fallen to the ground, seemingly unconscious.

636
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,640
I pass with a 39 on a 44.

637
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,400
You only lose one grip.

638
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:33,840
Julius kind of like shakes it off and clears his vision a little bit and then is going

639
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:38,960
to try to rush over to his coworkers on the ground and see what's up to kind of try to

640
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:39,840
slap him away.

641
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,080
Okay.

642
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,440
You're kind of slapping at him.

643
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:45,600
You see the camera has fallen to the side of Beck Wilder.

644
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,240
You see, you know, Cal's an older guy.

645
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,920
He seems to have fallen okay.

646
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:53,520
He doesn't seem to like have broken anything in the fall.

647
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,680
Stevie's just completely out.

648
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,960
None of them are getting back up.

649
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:01,760
And you hear this rumble coming from the bottom of the chasm.

650
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:07,280
Julius reaches to his phone thinking about making a TikTok, but then sees that the camera

651
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:12,080
is on the ground and Beck is incapacitated and real footage is better than TikTok footage.

652
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:17,040
So he's going to grab the camera and he's going to point it at the sound.

653
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:17,440
Okay.

654
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:22,640
He's going to walk to walk with camera on his shoulder, you know, looking at the display,

655
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,640
a wall of fog ahead of you.

656
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:31,360
And the fog is rising up like a push pop being just lifted from something coming up as the

657
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:34,800
rumbling is growing louder and louder from below.

658
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,040
Yeah.

659
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:39,840
He's going to kind of, he's going to walk to the, to the ledge, but then kind of use

660
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:45,200
the camera so he doesn't have to, you know, completely look over it, but aim the camera,

661
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,160
see if he can see anything through the fog as the fog lifts.

662
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:53,520
Julia Summers through the viewfinder of this camera sees, what does that smell?

663
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,200
What does that smell?

664
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,640
I got weed from work today.

665
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,200
Yeah.

666
00:30:59,200 --> 00:30:59,840
It's dank.

667
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,920
It's like, it's musty, but it's also.

668
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:08,000
He kind of like smacks his lips a little bit and it's like, he just sucking on salt.

669
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,280
That's exactly right.

670
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:12,320
I need you to witness this thing.

671
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:19,360
And in order to witness it, I need you to either ask me one question or three yes, no

672
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,320
questions.

673
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:20,640
Okay.

674
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,920
I already know that I get a salty taste in my mouth.

675
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,480
Yep.

676
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,960
I know that it sounds like disembodied voices that aren't really saying anything.

677
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:29,280
Yep.

678
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:34,960
And I know that as you remember that you begin hearing it and I know that it's a liquidy

679
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,680
human formed this thing.

680
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,160
Yep.

681
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,040
Sorry, give me a second.

682
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,040
I'll just, I'll do yes or no.

683
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,160
Make it quick.

684
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:42,560
Okay.

685
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,200
That's three.

686
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,160
Do I see it now?

687
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:44,560
Yes.

688
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,680
Is it coming at me?

689
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,240
Yes.

690
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,720
Does it give off any light since it's so dark in here?

691
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:51,760
Yes.

692
00:31:51,760 --> 00:32:01,120
This incomprehensible humanoid wet energy structure erupts out of this chasm, lifting

693
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:08,400
the fog above its head as it rises its shoulders next, you see an enormous torso and you're

694
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,960
staring between the legs of this.

695
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,160
What?

696
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:20,640
Julius takes a knee to brace himself with the camera and aims the camera up at it.

697
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,160
And as you aim the camera up.

698
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:25,760
Fluid monster god turtle thing.

699
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:31,680
You hear all of these voices coming out of the hand that is reaching out toward you.

700
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:34,560
It's the size of a suburban.

701
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,400
It's coming to scoop you up.

702
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,200
Suburban.

703
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:42,960
Julius is going to take the camera off his shoulder and set it down on the ground toward

704
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,720
the camera is still kind of facing it.

705
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,800
He's going to run.

706
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,300
Okay.

707
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:49,280
Okay.

708
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,600
Roll a roll for athletics.

709
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,680
I succeed with a 43.

710
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,680
It was a 69.

711
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,240
No.

712
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,040
I promise.

713
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,400
Are you fucking kidding me?

714
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:07,600
Holy shit.

715
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,320
Where do you run?

716
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,080
How do you, how do you get away?

717
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:11,760
I'm going to run.

718
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,560
That's what you want.

719
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,880
I'm going to run back out into Grover's gorge.

720
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,200
Holy fucking shit, dude.

721
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,320
Holy fucking.

722
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,560
You turn the wheel.

723
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,240
Let's go doggies.

724
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,120
Doggies.

725
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,640
You dog the door.

726
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:30,080
While he's dogging the door, he looks back at his friends and he just goes, Oh, I'll

727
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:30,720
try to save you.

728
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:30,960
Okay.

729
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,840
I'd have you roll again, but you rolled the 69.

730
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,000
So you've dogged the door.

731
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:36,640
Yeah.

732
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,920
He just like flips it and it just spins on its own.

733
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:40,420
Yes.

734
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:45,520
And it immediately opens and you grab it on the other side.

735
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,560
Slam it shut.

736
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:49,120
Dog those doors from the other side.

737
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,880
You are now inside.

738
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:56,080
Luke just mouthed what the fuck to no one in this room right now.

739
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,080
Just looked at, I don't know what.

740
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,200
Holy fucking shit, dude.

741
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,280
I panicked as you would.

742
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:04,960
No game plan.

743
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,680
No game plan.

744
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,640
This is what you would call out of the frying pan and into the fire.

745
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,200
Yeah.

746
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:18,960
Julius like closes the door and locks it, seals it back up again, turns around and looks

747
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,720
at Grover's Gorge and just.

748
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:20,960
Okay.

749
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:25,600
You're still like in this big plant space and I'm going to roll the 69 over and say

750
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:30,080
that you did this all quite stealthily and are able to just kind of blend back into this

751
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:30,400
wall.

752
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:35,600
So you're looking out at honestly a pretty normal situation in Grover's Gorge from what

753
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,480
you've seen.

754
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,360
And by that, I mean when you first arrived, not later.

755
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:45,040
Julius knows that he can't go back into the main part of town and the only person he knows

756
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:50,400
here that might have any chance of giving a shit about what is going on specifically

757
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,920
with Stevie is Fox God.

758
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:52,720
Oh my God.

759
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,880
We're going to the GIZ?

760
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,760
Going to the GIZ.

761
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,240
Holy shit.

762
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:56,480
Okay.

763
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,440
How are you going to get there?

764
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:03,600
Basically your options are you can, I mean, cross over the track, this bouncy synthetic

765
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:09,840
colorful material, or you can kind of go around to a sidewalk situation over near the GIZs,

766
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:14,640
or you can cut all the way through the wall and then go around the backside of the GIZs.

767
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:19,760
I mean, I would, I'm thinking he's probably the stealthiest option would be to cut around

768
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:25,280
and go back, but there's not, I don't, I feel he thinks this is pretty fucking urgent.

769
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:25,600
Okay.

770
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,800
You might get caught.

771
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:32,320
So I'll give you a straight up stealth against the

772
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,680
perception of the town.

773
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:37,280
If you go straight there, if you, if you kind of cut around and use the sidewalk, if you

774
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,320
go around back, I'll give you a plus 40 to your stealth.

775
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:40,560
Okay.

776
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:40,720
Yeah.

777
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:47,040
He's going to cut around back and, and just be like, try to be stealthy, but he's booking

778
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:47,600
it.

779
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,440
Roll that stealth with a plus 40.

780
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:53,600
They, what did you get?

781
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,440
I got a 47 on an 80.

782
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,320
What do you think the town perception should be on the way in?

783
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:58,960
It was 80.

784
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,640
What did I roll?

785
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,880
Shit.

786
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,920
He could succeeded with 77.

787
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:10,560
Okay.

788
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,840
You're creeping through the brush and flowers.

789
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,120
No, I'm not creeping.

790
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:15,760
I'm running.

791
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:21,120
You're sprinting through this wall, sprinting, sprinting, sprinting, running, running, running.

792
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:28,480
And as you head around the corner behind these GIZs, you see there's a privacy fence in the

793
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,680
backyard, right?

794
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,280
So you keep going around the back of the privacy fence and you run down.

795
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:36,800
Now you're running kind of North South based on when you first arrived.

796
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,040
Right.

797
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,360
And you're running toward the far side away.

798
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:44,080
You're trying to remember where the GIZ was that Fox went into.

799
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:49,920
And as you're trying to remember, you trip on something in the ground and you look down

800
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,840
and you see a fucking Jackalope.

801
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,300
Nope.

802
00:36:54,560 --> 00:37:00,880
No, there's like a metal cage that is halfway coming out of the ground just a little bit.

803
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:06,560
And at the head of this body length metal cage is a tombstone.

804
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:11,440
And as I fall on the ground, right in front of the tombstone, what do I read?

805
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,480
It says, oh.

806
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,360
Julius Sommers.

807
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:19,200
Julius Sommers Sommers Sommers Sommers Sommers Sommers Sommers Sommers Sommers Sommers.

808
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,160
Wait, fuck.

809
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,360
What is the name?

810
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,160
What's the name?

811
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,600
Is it too late to do something?

812
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,320
Yeah, of course it is.

813
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,080
What's the name on this tombstone?

814
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,240
Just give me a good last name.

815
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,200
Cream pie.

816
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:29,700
Nope.

817
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:31,680
Crump.

818
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,320
Crumpy.

819
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:32,880
Crumpy.

820
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,360
Thank you.

821
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:33,680
Okay.

822
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:39,520
So it's Jeremiah Crumpy, former mayor of Grover's Gorge.

823
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,240
And as you trip, you hear a voice call out.

824
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:43,840
Hi there.

825
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,520
Julius looks around to see where hi there's coming from.

826
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,000
Hello?

827
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:49,280
Hello?

828
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:56,320
Looking over the privacy fence, you see that there is a man standing on his back porch

829
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:59,520
in one of the GIZs that you were running past.

830
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:06,640
He's in a very like fine robe that's monochromatic with green accents.

831
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:10,000
And he holds up a cup of coffee to you.

832
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:15,200
Um, aren't you one of them fellas that was about to be on trial?

833
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,360
Aren't you supposed to be over there in the it bit?

834
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,360
Um, I'm not sure about that.

835
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:22,560
I actually just got into town from the train station.

836
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:26,960
I have a very important delivery for Fox Gotel and I've got to get to him.

837
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:27,460
Oh!

838
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,440
Uh, go ahead and roll.

839
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:32,640
Uh, either disguise or persuade.

840
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:34,980
Dude.

841
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,720
I got an ought one.

842
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,280
Oh my god!

843
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,560
I'm not gonna move it.

844
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,040
Okay.

845
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,560
But you can look if you want.

846
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:48,400
Oh!

847
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,200
That's really handy because look what I fucking rolled.

848
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,960
A 22 crit success.

849
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,840
Yes, but an ought one is the best crit success.

850
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,640
It's 669 but you already rolled.

851
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,840
Holy fuck.

852
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,560
Okay, so with an ought one, he's like,

853
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,120
No way!

854
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,960
Yeah, uh, I just was pointed in this direction.

855
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,400
Could you show me where he is?

856
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,320
Where his GIZ is?

857
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,280
Oh yeah, for sure.

858
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,640
He's actually next door.

859
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,200
Fantastic.

860
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:17,040
I was in such a hurry I seemed to trip over this mayor.

861
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,960
Oh yeah, Jeremiah Ripp!

862
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,480
Yes.

863
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,040
Yes, sir.

864
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:24,580
Crampy.

865
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,920
Here's a good one, but not long for this world, you know?

866
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,600
Do you mind if I hop your fence?

867
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,600
Oh no, I mean, look at the gate.

868
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,600
Julius looks at the gate and he's like,

869
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,560
Oh yeah, yeah, sorry.

870
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:37,600
You know, in a rush, not thinking straight.

871
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,200
It's okay, have a good one.

872
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,400
And he heads back into his GIZ.

873
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:42,880
Well done.

874
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:47,360
Holy fuck, uh, Julius fucking uses that gate.

875
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:52,240
All right, you head into the backyard of Fox Gottles GIZ.

876
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:59,040
It is absolute mayhem of cool, like, dumb toys and shit.

877
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:03,280
He's got like a basketball hoop with a trampoline next to it.

878
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,240
He's got a pool.

879
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,440
He's got a hot tub.

880
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:09,440
He's got one of those, like, you sit in it and it looks like a monster truck and you

881
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,040
drive it and it flips all around.

882
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,040
You know, he's got one of those.

883
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,080
Two of those.

884
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,240
That's crazy.

885
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,440
I can't believe he has three of those.

886
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,680
And there's an actual monster truck there too.

887
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:26,320
Damn, Julius almost trips over a hoverboard, but doesn't.

888
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,120
Can you describe the GIZ?

889
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:34,720
Oh yeah, from the back, it's got a nice upper deck and then a nice lower porch underneath

890
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:35,440
that's covered.

891
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:43,200
And there is like a huge bar with a built-in grill and a tabletop kind of situation.

892
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,440
Lots of windows in this bad boy?

893
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:48,880
Fair amount of windows, you know, want to get that natural light in there.

894
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,280
Can I see any movement or anybody in the house?

895
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,120
Yeah, Fox is dancing.

896
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,160
What music do I hear?

897
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:59,600
In one of the rooms, it's like, you just hear a boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,

898
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:02,320
boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

899
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:05,200
Just kind of on repeat and he's just kind of getting it.

900
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,200
Under his breath, Julius mutters,

901
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,240
Everybody.

902
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:15,760
And Julius is going to take his shot and go, he's going to close his door.

903
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,720
Just no knock or anything.

904
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,080
I'm going straight in.

905
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,560
No fucking way, dude.

906
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,360
Oh shit.

907
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,960
Hey, what's up, my guy?

908
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,880
You came in through the back?

909
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,960
That is really something else.

910
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,440
I, uh, wait, did he talk more like this?

911
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:31,920
I think.

912
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:32,640
I think so.

913
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,680
Oh wow.

914
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:34,400
No way.

915
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,920
Oh my goodness.

916
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,320
It is fairly wonderful to see you.

917
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:38,960
Good, sir.

918
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,400
Where are your compatriots?

919
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,920
And you came in through the back.

920
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:42,720
Wowzers.

921
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:47,280
Julius goes to give him like the clap, clap, bro hug.

922
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,760
Yeah, clap, bro.

923
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,720
Yes, of course.

924
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,240
We are friends now.

925
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,720
Fox, we need your help.

926
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:55,680
Whoa, whoa.

927
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,280
Slow down there, buddy.

928
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,480
What's going on?

929
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,880
Do you know about the mayor?

930
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,000
Lovely turtle.

931
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:02,240
Yes.

932
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:02,960
Best turtle.

933
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:03,520
Best mayor.

934
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:09,040
Are you aware of the whole mayor lore?

935
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,160
The mayor lore.

936
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:11,200
The God.

937
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,680
Told, do you want to finish that, sir?

938
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:15,840
It's my last name.

939
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,360
Were you halfway through it?

940
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:20,000
Julius thinks this makes this a whole lot harder.

941
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:27,840
Is there an army in Grover's Gorge?

942
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:28,880
No, no, no.

943
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,040
We have no need for an army.

944
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,720
We have the landlord.

945
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:37,120
Mr. Vernon Covington takes care of all of our aggressive needs.

946
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:42,400
Julius is doing what I'm doing, and he's just kind of like licking his lips and kind of

947
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:45,600
just, what the fuck am I going to do?

948
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:51,680
I had plans for if you failed a bunch of things, but the succeeding is...

949
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,120
It's unusual.

950
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:53,840
It's nuts.

951
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:57,200
Fox, I'm going to be straight with you.

952
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:57,760
Please.

953
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:58,880
We don't have a lot of time.

954
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,360
My coworkers...

955
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:01,860
Sure.

956
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,840
The can people.

957
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:04,480
And Stevie.

958
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:05,360
Yes?

959
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:06,240
Faith.

960
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:11,680
He kind of turns his head to the side like a dog when you say squirrel.

961
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,520
I said faith, not squirrel.

962
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:14,000
Squirrel?

963
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,080
Your faith.

964
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:19,680
Yes, my dearly departed sister Faith.

965
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,320
She's actually alive.

966
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:28,000
Stevie is Faith, but she might be dearly departed soon if you don't help.

967
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,160
Whoa, okay, okay, okay.

968
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:38,800
I've still got a grip on what's going on here, so I'd say that I will help.

969
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:45,120
I don't believe you that my sister is Stevie that didn't even look like her.

970
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:48,720
If something were to happen to Sandro, who would be the mayor?

971
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:49,600
Chuck Bidwell.

972
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:52,560
If something happened to Chuck, who would be the mayor?

973
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:59,680
Well, he kind of scratches his chin, looks around at all of his things.

974
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:01,840
Do you want to play VR?

975
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:03,680
Maybe later.

976
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:08,640
Gee, who, who, who?

977
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:09,600
Oh, right, yes.

978
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:14,400
You were asking about who would be mayor if it weren't Chuck Bidwell.

979
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:20,640
Well, there's got to be a line in case, you know, something, a line of succession in case

980
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,240
something awful happened.

981
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,600
No, I don't think there is.

982
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,280
Would you want to be the mayor?

983
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:29,920
I suppose I could be the mayor.

984
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:30,800
Fantastic.

985
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,320
I, I would vote for you.

986
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:34,080
Let's hold an election right now.

987
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:34,880
Hmm.

988
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,480
Well, this is a wild thought.

989
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,480
I wasn't expecting to become mayor today.

990
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,720
Well, why wouldn't Chuck just be mayor?

991
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,480
This is purely hypothetical.

992
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,440
Hypothetical.

993
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,280
I mean, I didn't even run in the election.

994
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,920
Did anyone else besides Chuck?

995
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,440
No, of course not.

996
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:52,800
Well, I mean, you, you've got a really cool house.

997
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:53,920
I think you should be mayor.

998
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:55,520
Wow.

999
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:58,000
Flattery works on this guy.

1000
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,520
Let's do this, buddy.

1001
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:00,080
Cool.

1002
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:05,440
Come with me to certify you in case you had to be the third in line for mayor.

1003
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:06,240
Okay.

1004
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:07,680
Let's go do that.

1005
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:08,800
How do we do that?

1006
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,800
By talking to your sister.

1007
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:11,360
Okay.

1008
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:12,000
Hmm.

1009
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:12,960
She's in the train station.

1010
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:16,320
She just had come back and she was about to see us off.

1011
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:17,120
Okay.

1012
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:18,240
Let's go now though.

1013
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,160
And let's take these hoverboards.

1014
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,560
I like the hoverboards.

1015
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,480
I like the hoverboard idea.

1016
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,480
I do want to play VR.

1017
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:29,920
I'm sure that you have a high-tech VR.

1018
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,000
What about AR?

1019
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,760
Strap it on augmented reality and you can play as we go.

1020
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:36,080
Okay.

1021
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:38,480
Roll persuade with a plus 40.

1022
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:39,680
Cause that was brilliant.

1023
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:47,360
I got a 97 on a 100.

1024
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:50,720
Oh shit.

1025
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:52,640
That's incredible.

1026
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:53,360
He failed.

1027
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:54,800
Let's go.

1028
00:45:56,080 --> 00:46:02,080
Julius and Fox both strap on like Oculus has like futuristic.

1029
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:05,120
Got all got chilis headsets.

1030
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:07,920
Turn on the AR function.

1031
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:14,160
And it's like looking through your own eyes, but he has programmed it for us to like, we're

1032
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,400
like Pac-Man and we're running.

1033
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,680
No, we're like Sonic.

1034
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:21,760
And we're collecting rings as we run towards the train station.

1035
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,320
Have you played this one before?

1036
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:25,840
It's got a crazy monster.

1037
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:27,600
Once you collect enough rings.

1038
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:28,720
Well, yes, of course.

1039
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:36,800
I always try to get the septum Gordman, the septum Gordman's head to cut them off.

1040
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:37,600
Fantastic.

1041
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:38,400
Get the rings.

1042
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:39,600
Let's go.

1043
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:40,880
Oh my God.

1044
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:41,120
Okay.

1045
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:43,280
So you're running out the front door.

1046
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:46,320
I figured we would just take the same path I took here.

1047
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:47,040
Oh, why?

1048
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,640
Why would we go out the back?

1049
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:49,280
More rings.

1050
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,080
More rings.

1051
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,880
You brilliant son of a bitch.

1052
00:46:54,880 --> 00:47:03,120
And you guys dip out ring collectors on your way through his backyard around the back area

1053
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:06,800
over the corpse with the metal cage around it.

1054
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,800
The corpse, the bear.

1055
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:09,440
It's a corpse.

1056
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:13,760
The corpse, the burial site, the bone skeleton, the plot.

1057
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:14,260
Yeah.

1058
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:23,140
With the metal cage around it, head back around the sides and toward that doggy doggy door

1059
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:25,380
and out out here.

1060
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:27,140
Well, we've got to go in.

1061
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:28,180
We've got to go in.

1062
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:35,300
And Julius gives the door a little spin and opens it up.

1063
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:38,420
Okay.

1064
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:38,820
Perfect.

1065
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:40,980
The boys will come back for the rest.

1066
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:42,340
Fuck yeah, dude.

1067
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:52,980
In the back.

1068
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:59,540
Or maybe just like through the skull directly through the brain, get stabbed in the head,

1069
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:01,700
but not hard enough to go through.

1070
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:02,500
Break your bones.

1071
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:06,100
Well, we've got Thomas and Joe back in the room now.

1072
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:06,740
So what happened?

1073
00:48:06,740 --> 00:48:08,980
I need everyone to roll an alertness check for me.

1074
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:09,480
Oh shit.

1075
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:10,900
Me too.

1076
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:11,400
Yep.

1077
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:17,380
Fail.

1078
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:19,380
I pass a seven on a 40.

1079
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:20,580
53 on a 70.

1080
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:23,220
Thomas, take off your headphones for me real quick.

1081
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:27,300
Beck Wilder, Julius Summers.

1082
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:30,660
Let's start with Beck Wilder.

1083
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:38,020
You come to your stomach still just queasy, your hands wet and cold.

1084
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:45,140
You're feeling completely disoriented, but you hear this rumble and this noise and this

1085
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:51,700
strange kind of like maybe, oh, what do you, what is that?

1086
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:54,180
And Luke, I need you to take off your headphones too.

1087
00:48:56,180 --> 00:49:03,060
You can either ask me one question or three yes, no questions about what it is that you

1088
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:08,980
see down at the bottom of this enormous chasm as you come to and look over the edge.

1089
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:12,340
Can I ask the one question, what do I see at the bottom of this ledge?

1090
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:15,720
Certainly.

1091
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:17,460
I want to ask that.

1092
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:18,100
Okay.

1093
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:21,940
What do you know about this, this thing, this kind of energy that you saw?

1094
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:26,820
I saw that it was super circus, like it was wet and it made Chuck physically wet.

1095
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:30,980
It does the same thing this time where it just kind of like, you see this

1096
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:42,100
like strangely moving wet energy there at the bottom of the chasm and it shoots like a spray,

1097
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:49,220
like a jet stream through the windows of the church, the upside down church,

1098
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:55,060
the upside down church that is at the bottom of this chasm off to your right side.

1099
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:58,020
And I need you to roll grip.

1100
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:05,940
Uh, I fail.

1101
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:06,340
Okay.

1102
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:14,100
You're going to roll a D6 and add one for seeing this extremely unnatural sight

1103
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:20,100
as your brain tries to figure out and kind of make it something that you recognize.

1104
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:23,380
I rolled a five.

1105
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:24,580
Five plus one is six.

1106
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:29,540
So start putting those in order as you lose six grip,

1107
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:35,060
fight, flight, freeze, and take off your headphones, please.

1108
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:38,340
Luke is back.

1109
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:40,420
I'm back, back again.

1110
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:46,580
As you walk in, you see something moving at the bottom of the chasm.

1111
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:49,140
You smell that salty sea spray.

1112
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:53,220
You hear those voices calling out.

1113
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:58,980
And at this point you can once again ask one question or three yes, no questions.

1114
00:50:59,540 --> 00:50:59,860
Okay.

1115
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:01,300
How fast has it gone?

1116
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:03,460
Well, it was enormous before, right?

1117
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:03,700
Right.

1118
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:04,900
It was extremely enormous.

1119
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:11,060
Now it's like still kind of similar looking, but it's down at the bottom and it's making its way.

1120
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:16,580
It's still enormous, bigger than a human making its way through the valley toward the church

1121
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:22,980
off to the right side, the upside down church stuck in this unnaturally smooth chasm.

1122
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:27,620
So how, I guess that was how fast is it moving?

1123
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:33,380
This enormous humanoid was sprinting at almost 143 miles per hour.

1124
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:42,580
And then it dives through the glass and into pouring itself into this upside down church.

1125
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:43,080
Roll grip.

1126
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:47,300
Fail.

1127
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:49,140
Roll a D six and add one, please.

1128
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:51,620
It's incomprehensible.

1129
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:53,540
Your mind cannot handle what you see.

1130
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:54,740
Two plus one is three.

1131
00:51:55,300 --> 00:52:00,980
As you lose three grip, your hold on reality loosens just so.

1132
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:02,580
That puts me at a 40.

1133
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:03,080
Jesus.

1134
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:04,180
That's low.

1135
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:06,100
With a breaking point at 36.

1136
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:08,100
Oh boy, let's bring them all back.

1137
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:14,500
Beck Wilder, I need you to place an order, fight, flight, and freeze.

1138
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:19,220
It's a freeze number one, flight number two, and fight.

1139
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:20,340
Fight is it?

1140
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:21,940
Yeah, fight is number three.

1141
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:23,060
All right, roll that D six.

1142
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:25,140
It's a six.

1143
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:25,700
Okay.

1144
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:27,940
And what was your top freeze?

1145
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:28,740
Freeze.

1146
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:31,780
Cal stands up from tying his shoe and says, what's going on, fellas?

1147
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:33,940
You feel clammy hands.

1148
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:36,580
You feel your stomach is still completely unsettled.

1149
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:41,700
Your vision is kind of off your head, shaking, vibrating almost still.

1150
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:50,020
And you see Beck Wilder staring directly, completely frozen down toward the church.

1151
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:56,340
And when you look in that direction, you see where you had previously seen like this beautiful

1152
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:59,220
stained glass in the front of this church.

1153
00:52:59,220 --> 00:53:05,620
Now you see it has been completely broken and there's a hole in the stained glass that

1154
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:07,220
leads into this church.

1155
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:08,660
Who would do that to a church?

1156
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:09,800
Teens.

1157
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:17,940
You see that Fox Godel is here with Julius Summers and Stevie is coming too.

1158
00:53:20,340 --> 00:53:22,820
It's good to see you again, Fox Godel, obviously.

1159
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:27,460
Also Fox and Julius are both wearing VR headsets.

1160
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:28,020
Oh yeah.

1161
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:36,100
We're collecting rings.

1162
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:37,780
How many do you have so far, Julius?

1163
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:39,540
He's rolling.

1164
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:44,660
I only managed to pick up 11.

1165
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:46,660
Oh, I have 79.

1166
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:49,140
That is considerably more than you, sir.

1167
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:49,860
Yes.

1168
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:53,140
Julius was telling me that we're going to make me mayor.

1169
00:53:53,140 --> 00:53:53,860
I'm sorry.

1170
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:54,100
What?

1171
00:53:55,060 --> 00:53:56,500
When was this discussed?

1172
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:58,260
How long was I tying my shoe?

1173
00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:00,420
Trust me, Fox is the mayor now.

1174
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:04,100
He's the emergency mandated mayor of Grover's Gorge.

1175
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:04,980
Stevie, Stevie.

1176
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:05,540
Hold on.

1177
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:06,040
What?

1178
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:07,460
What's going on here?

1179
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:07,860
I don't know.

1180
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:11,220
I feel fucking bad and weird.

1181
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:12,660
What happened?

1182
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:13,380
That noise.

1183
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:14,980
What was that?

1184
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:16,260
It was God.

1185
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:16,760
God.

1186
00:54:18,340 --> 00:54:21,460
Beck, did you see God while I was gone?

1187
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:25,220
Beck is just staring down into the church still, but he nods.

1188
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:26,500
Beck, what?

1189
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:28,100
Again?

1190
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:29,620
Beck, did you get it on camera?

1191
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:31,300
I got it on camera.

1192
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:32,740
I feel around for my camera.

1193
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:36,580
Well, your camera was placed back down next to you.

1194
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:41,700
And as we have determined in this game, when Beck is conscious, he is filming.

1195
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:43,860
So yes, you shot what you saw.

1196
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:44,420
Dope.

1197
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:44,820
Yeah.

1198
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:45,320
Yeah.

1199
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:46,220
Yeah.

1200
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:47,160
Dudes.

1201
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:47,800
Yeah, I got it.

1202
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:48,840
I think I got it, dudes.

1203
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:50,200
Show me.

1204
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:51,000
Show me God.

1205
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,040
Are we safe?

1206
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:52,680
Should we go?

1207
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:54,120
What?

1208
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:54,600
Fox?

1209
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:56,680
I mean, we're going to make you the mayor.

1210
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:57,800
How would that help?

1211
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:59,880
Stevie, you said that the mayor...

1212
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:01,720
He's already released.

1213
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:04,520
We'd have to do the whole thing to get him back in.

1214
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:05,080
I don't know.

1215
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:05,800
What's the whole thing?

1216
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:07,240
I don't know, but it was a...

1217
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:09,160
I don't know any of it.

1218
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:09,960
I don't know.

1219
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:12,120
Well, does Fox know?

1220
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:13,560
Know what, my good man?

1221
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:14,200
He doesn't.

1222
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:15,880
Where'd you come from, dude?

1223
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:17,480
Yeah, we're...

1224
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:23,240
Oh, I was just hanging out, giving my old record player the spins and just giving my

1225
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:28,360
hips a good loosening when old Julius popped in and suggested we do some AR while making

1226
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:29,960
me the new mayor for some reason.

1227
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:34,440
Or not even the new mayor, but just another backup, was it, behind Chuck Bidwell?

1228
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:36,840
What do you mean Julius showed up?

1229
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:39,160
He's been standing here by us this whole time.

1230
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:40,760
Yeah, I look at Cal.

1231
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:43,000
How long were we out, dude?

1232
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:44,840
Can both of you roll grip, please?

1233
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:47,800
Ooh, I pass.

1234
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:53,480
I'm getting older and sometimes I lose bits of time.

1235
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:56,680
I fail hard, a 97.

1236
00:55:56,680 --> 00:56:00,520
Okay, so you're going to lose zero grip, Cal.

1237
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:04,040
However, Beck Wilder, you're going to roll a D4.

1238
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:06,120
It's a one.

1239
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:07,320
Okay, you only lose one grip.

1240
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:10,360
That brings me down to 51.

1241
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:13,160
Stevie, I panicked.

1242
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:19,160
I just thought that the thing had to be in the mayor and if we made someone the mayor,

1243
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:21,160
it would have to go back in.

1244
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:25,480
Okay, that seems right.

1245
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:26,520
Yeah, okay.

1246
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:28,920
How do we make him the mayor?

1247
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:30,360
That doesn't seem right to me.

1248
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:34,280
Well, this is Godel Gorge.

1249
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:40,120
I feel like you guys have, you know, can call Godel Law and make an emergency mandate.

1250
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:40,920
On God.

1251
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:42,920
On God.

1252
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:43,400
On God.

1253
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:43,960
On God.

1254
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:44,600
On God, dude.

1255
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:45,880
Okay.

1256
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:48,840
I'm not as confident as you, Julius.

1257
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:51,880
I'm not, but it's the only thing I could think of.

1258
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:57,640
I hereby, as the oldest Godel in Grover's Gorge.

1259
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:59,640
And Julius is like pointing at Fox.

1260
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:05,560
Declare Fox Godel as the mayor of Grover's Gorge.

1261
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:06,680
Why not you, Stevie?

1262
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:08,920
And as she finishes saying that.

1263
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:11,480
Stevie's older than Fox?

1264
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:13,240
Now she is.

1265
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:14,680
I don't think I caught that earlier.

1266
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:16,840
I was picturing her being the younger sister.

1267
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:18,360
I think I caught that.

1268
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Luke and Joe, take off your headphones real quick.

1269
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:28,440
Thomas.

1270
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:35,400
A wildly frenetic, wet energy.

1271
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:46,840
Comes flying out of the church, out of the giant canyon and into Fox Godel, throwing

1272
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:50,920
him backwards, back towards the plant wall.

1273
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:59,080
You can either ask me one question or three yes, no questions about what you see, what

1274
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:05,400
you smell, what you hear, what you feel as this thing kind of zips past you and you're

1275
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:09,400
trying to perceive it, but it's really hard.

1276
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:11,320
Almost like it's incomprehensible.

1277
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:13,480
Has everybody else done this?

1278
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:14,860
Yep.

1279
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:17,960
Did they ask good questions?

1280
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:18,460
Nope.

1281
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:20,680
Pressure's off.

1282
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:23,400
No, they did.

1283
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:24,440
What's its name?

1284
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:25,320
What's its name?

1285
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:34,600
Is that something that you could tell from its appearance or sound or feel or taste?

1286
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:36,840
You said I could ask you one question or three.

1287
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:38,600
About how you perceive it.

1288
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:39,160
Okay.

1289
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:40,120
It's a good question.

1290
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:40,840
What's your name?

1291
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:49,080
Three yes, no questions or one question.

1292
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:52,760
Would you tell me if I asked a question that's already been asked?

1293
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:53,000
Okay.

1294
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:53,960
What's it smell like?

1295
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:55,160
Wait, no.

1296
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:55,960
How do I kill it?

1297
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:58,840
That's also not something you can perceive.

1298
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:00,360
Why not?

1299
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:05,080
How do I kill?

1300
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:06,120
I want to kill God.

1301
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:10,760
Zach, what's a smart question to ask?

1302
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:12,600
I don't know, man.

1303
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:15,240
Well, then why'd you think of this game?

1304
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:16,120
I don't know.

1305
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:18,120
Hey, they came up with questions.

1306
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:20,620
Well.

1307
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:26,600
And that's the end of the episode.

1308
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:28,460
What?

1309
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:33,160
Okay, I'm sure they asked what it looked like.

1310
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:34,220
Did they?

1311
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:37,800
I've got intense decision paralysis here.

1312
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:39,560
I can't think of anything.

1313
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:40,680
Just go through the senses.

1314
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:41,160
I don't know.

1315
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:43,400
Well, they asked, look, what does it look like?

1316
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:45,240
I'm not going to tell you what they asked.

1317
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:46,120
I thought you said you would.

1318
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:49,000
If it had already been asked, you'd tell me to ask something.

1319
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:49,320
Okay.

1320
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:51,240
Luke asked me what it looks like, but okay.

1321
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:56,200
All I heard was I'm not going to tell you what they asked.

1322
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:07,800
Boys.

1323
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:11,640
If you can hear me sign to me, I know one of them.

1324
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:14,380
Okay.

1325
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:18,440
How big is it?

1326
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:19,000
Great question.

1327
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:20,060
It is.

1328
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:22,440
Wait, is it bigger than a bread box?

1329
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:23,500
Yes.

1330
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:24,920
How big is it?

1331
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:26,600
Oh my God.

1332
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:32,920
I can't think of three better questions or like two more questions.

1333
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:34,200
Just fucking tell me how big it is.

1334
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:41,480
It is like the amount of wet of an Olympic sized pool.

1335
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:43,160
Thousands of gallons of water?

1336
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:43,660
Yes.

1337
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:46,200
Oh, much bigger than a bread box.

1338
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:54,200
Just pouring into and through Fox Gottel, lifting him off his feet.

1339
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:58,520
Higher and higher and throwing him over toward the plant wall.

1340
01:00:58,520 --> 01:00:59,560
I need you to roll grip.

1341
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:02,680
Uh, pass again.

1342
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:03,480
19.

1343
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:03,880
Okay.

1344
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:05,000
You just lose one grip.

1345
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,280
Oh, well that breaks me.

1346
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:09,260
All right.

1347
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:10,440
Sorry about that.

1348
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:11,240
That was long.

1349
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:12,040
That was a workout.

1350
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:13,560
That was a long time rolling my ears.

1351
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:16,280
What'd you guys ask?

1352
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:30,600
Cause my life is great, and it's all mine.

1353
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:45,080
Cause my life is great, and it's all mine.
