1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,160
My producer just handed me a note, just a content warning up front on this one for my wolf pups.

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:16,000
Caution, these boys have done some fucked up shit on this show, but this is perhaps a bit more intense.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:24,400
If you or anyone you know are dealing with suicidal thoughts, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.

4
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:29,200
1-800-273-8255.

5
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,520
Take care of yourself, y'all.

6
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,880
Bonjour, my beautiful, bountiful, bouncing baby babies.

7
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:44,800
Papa Wolf is here to cradle you to sleep with my soothing grumbles and growls.

8
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:53,440
As always, I am lulling y'all to your dream states live from 694.2 PTBP.

9
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:59,440
I just want to let y'all know, it's December 6th, and it is the night time.

10
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:06,320
The good numbers of 6.9 and 4.2 are here to smear me and smear.

11
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,160
That's that good cream, the sweet cream.

12
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:14,880
When I get all lathered up in cream, y'all know what time it is.

13
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,880
It's Howlin' with Wolf O'Clock, daddios and momios.

14
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,680
This week's Howlin' with Wolf comes from Dustin,

15
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,200
who tagged that pretending pod in a tweet that read,

16
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,200
A stoner, a Jedi, and a surgeon walkin' to a bar.

17
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:33,040
Blunt. Force. Trauma.

18
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,760
Hell yeah. Jesus Christ. Good job, Dustin.

19
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,960
Dustin writes, Salutations, Wolf.

20
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:48,080
Dustin the Wind here, from Toledo, Ohio, aka the armpit of the Midwest.

21
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:53,520
I'm new to the saga of contention, but after my first listen,

22
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,960
I'm made like Muse and plugged in baby.

23
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:01,440
Now I'm all cut up on the backlog and hungry for more.

24
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:05,760
Just like I'm hungry for the taste sensation that's sweeping the nation.

25
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:09,040
Food Witch, now with extra flavor.

26
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,680
What flavor? I'll never tell.

27
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,440
Try one and find out.

28
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,600
Food Witch, it's edible.

29
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,520
Brought to you by Bar Corp.

30
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,800
The only magic we make is the illusion of choice.

31
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,640
Well, hello, Mr. De Wind.

32
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:32,560
The only processed foods I want are the ones that have been processed by the stew of garbage juice.

33
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,480
And by processed, I mean mostly rotted.

34
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,000
Maybe add a little MSG and sugar to it.

35
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,960
But I'd be willing to try some Food Witch,

36
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,800
if you'd be willing to send me a couple of dumpsters full of them.

37
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,400
I just need that fresh from the dumpster flavor.

38
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,280
Dumpster to table cuisine, babies.

39
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,000
What's that?

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,400
You want the opportunity to write up a message for a Wolfie to Hal?

41
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,240
It's so easy.

42
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:06,000
Just write something nice about us on the internet and tag at PretendingPod.

43
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,720
What's that?

44
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,840
You don't follow us on Instagram or Twitter?

45
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,880
What the fuck?

46
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:19,440
We post cool shit on there like maps and fan art and pics of Zach's adorable cats Ramona and RoPo.

47
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,560
What's that?

48
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:27,520
You've listened to over 60 episodes of the show and you still haven't written a five-star review on Apple Podcasts?

49
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,280
That's wild, my babies.

50
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,440
I'm talking to the vast majority of you, but on the real.

51
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,880
Thanks for listening, y'all.

52
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:39,280
I fucking love making this show just for you.

53
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,240
And guess what?

54
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:51,920
All five of those pretending to be people stinkers are going to be on Twitch for a night of goofy buffoonery on Tuesday, February 11th at 7 p.m. Central Time.

55
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,240
That's twitch.tv slash pretending pod streams.

56
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:59,440
Find a link in these here show notes.

57
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:03,760
Tuesday, February 11th at 7 p.m. Central Time.

58
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,160
Who knows what they'll get up to?

59
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,920
Maybe some Jackbox?

60
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,520
There's only five of them.

61
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,480
Leave some room for y'all to hop in on the action.

62
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,040
Oh, that's going to be fun.

63
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,320
OK, y'all, I got good news and bad news.

64
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,200
Just kidding.

65
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,440
I'm all out of good news.

66
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:29,360
Last time, our intrepid assholes made their way across campus to Glass Hall, where the biology lab is located.

67
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:40,080
On the way, they saw unmarked black helicopters in the sky, as well as a couple of goners who were performing some stomach turning acts nasty.

68
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,720
And that ain't wolf the dog nasty.

69
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,360
They made it down to the basement of Glass Hall right outside the lab.

70
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,040
But they're fucking losing it.

71
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,160
And Clark Clark started chanting.

72
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,400
Let's give him something with a little rhythm to spice up that towel.

73
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:22,800
Well, hey there, Joe.

74
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,560
Hey, Zachariah.

75
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,280
Did anything happen at the end of last episode?

76
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,400
No, I don't think so.

77
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,360
No, nothing important?

78
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,080
Nothing I remember.

79
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,520
That makes a lot of sense.

80
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,680
What I remember is that you lost your fucking mind.

81
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:41,680
Zero Sand started chanting and then took a big ass finger bump out of Keith's cocaine finger.

82
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:42,800
Yup.

83
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,920
So what are you expecting for this evening?

84
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:50,320
I brought my Nintendo Switch because I think I'm going to be not in this episode much at all time.

85
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,080
What are you going to play?

86
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,920
I got Stardew Valley over there.

87
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,240
I never played it before and I've heard it's real addicting.

88
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,760
Is it like Star Wars?

89
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,480
I don't know what...

90
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,360
No, you farm.

91
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,720
You're a farmer.

92
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,040
So it's like what Star Wars would have been about if Ben Kenobi would have never shown up.

93
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,440
Exactly.

94
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,720
If Luke had just stayed on the farm.

95
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:16,400
Well, what we're going to do is I'm going to give you your objective for the evening.

96
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,480
And we'll start with that.

97
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:23,360
So first off, you are going to be chanting when we begin.

98
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,160
When everyone comes back in the room all together.

99
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:26,720
Okay.

100
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,480
So go ahead and just give me like a little example of what that might sound like.

101
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,360
Remember it's towel alacle.

102
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,400
Towel alacle.

103
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:34,720
Yeah.

104
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,360
That's what it is.

105
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:35,840
Yeah.

106
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,800
Towel alacle.

107
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,240
Am I doing it right?

108
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,520
Towel alacle.

109
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:39,840
Yeah.

110
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,000
Yeah.

111
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,200
And then you don't have to do that the whole time because that would be annoying.

112
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,400
And I can just do that in post.

113
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,040
You can lay it in.

114
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:49,280
Yeah.

115
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,680
So we'll get a clean take of that.

116
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,200
Actually, let's get a clean take of it now.

117
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,800
Oh, a clean take.

118
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,000
A clean take.

119
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,480
Yeah.

120
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,720
As opposed to what you were wanting to do there.

121
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,160
Towel alacle.

122
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,440
Towel alacle.

123
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,880
Towel alacle.

124
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,920
Towel alacle.

125
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,640
Perfect.

126
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,160
Oh, you make an insane person look good, Joe.

127
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,960
My dad always told me that.

128
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
So next I'm going to have you roll a d4.

129
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,520
Okay.

130
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,560
I got a two.

131
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:22,800
Okay.

132
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:29,360
You are going to start trying desperately to kill yourself in two rounds.

133
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,960
So let's call it the third round.

134
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:36,800
So you have two rounds of just chanting and like maybe moving about and kind of finding

135
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,640
what you're going to use to kill yourself.

136
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:42,400
And then on that third round, you're going to go ahead and really try to make that a

137
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,080
reality by going through with it.

138
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,280
Okay.

139
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,920
But I have to do it.

140
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,720
You have to do it.

141
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,400
But I mean like, what happens if I get to the third round and I haven't like prepared

142
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,640
well enough, is there a penalty or something?

143
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,440
How does that work?

144
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,800
Because theoretically the guys are going to hopefully try to stop me from doing something.

145
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,520
Exactly.

146
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,920
So just do your best.

147
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:06,400
And then if you can't do to them, good on them.

148
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:11,200
However, if you can't not do to them, I'm going to force your hand.

149
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:11,440
Sure.

150
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,680
Or just, you know, I'd prefer that you do it.

151
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,200
Yeah.

152
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,840
Thanks for giving me agency.

153
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,560
Exactly.

154
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:28,560
I'm giving you the full reign of motion, full range of motion, but you have to kill yourself.

155
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:28,960
Yeah.

156
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:29,520
No problem.

157
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,200
I've never said that to anyone before and I don't like the way it feels in my mouth.

158
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,240
No, I don't care for it.

159
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,920
They're going to use this recording in my trial.

160
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,120
I fucking know it.

161
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,320
Oh, God damn it.

162
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:41,680
Okay.

163
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,440
So with that all being said, are you ready?

164
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,680
I assume I need to be cagey with the fellas, right?

165
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,480
I believe so.

166
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,320
Is it possible for Clark to speak other than tell a local at this point?

167
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,040
Not at this point.

168
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:53,840
Okay, cool.

169
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,480
Uh, okay.

170
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,120
We'll see what happens.

171
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:06,320
Here we go.

172
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,560
Oh, Hey Luke.

173
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:15,760
That's me.

174
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,920
That's my sign.

175
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,080
Is there like a, what's it called?

176
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,480
Sign on call something.

177
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:22,640
Yeah.

178
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,840
It's called a sign on call or something or something.

179
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,560
What's up, man?

180
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,600
An image.

181
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,080
You did something at the end of the last episode, didn't you?

182
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,640
I did.

183
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,080
You busted something out.

184
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,880
I busted some lines like a poet.

185
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,440
Yes.

186
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,560
Like a beat.

187
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,800
Like slam poetry.

188
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:46,160
Cocaine in my brain until I'm insane.

189
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:47,680
That's pretty good.

190
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,760
Self opinion.

191
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,080
Okay.

192
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,720
So yes, I did.

193
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:00,480
I've been waiting for a moment to use it and I was like, fuck, this is good as any, I guess.

194
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:08,080
So there's going to be some positives for using that, but the negative is that you lose 10 luck.

195
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:08,400
Right.

196
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,000
So you had how much luck?

197
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:16,160
I had 35 and before you tell me that I have five points, let me say this, because I used

198
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,560
it in succession so quickly, let's call it one.

199
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,040
I agree.

200
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,240
Hell yeah.

201
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,240
So you have 25 luck still.

202
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:24,880
Tight, tight.

203
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,760
Also using it, I remembered when I first got it, there was a reason that I hadn't used

204
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,920
it, but I forgot what the cost was.

205
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,680
So I was just hoping that it wasn't like something terrible.

206
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,600
So the cost is that 10 luck.

207
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,720
And normally the positive that you would get is that it puts your willpower back up to

208
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,360
full.

209
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,240
However, during this arc, we haven't been using the willpower because I'm still at 10

210
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,800
out of 10 because I forgot about it.

211
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,680
Well, you're such a good GM.

212
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,840
I would, I, you haven't forgot about it.

213
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,520
You just are waiting for the right time.

214
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,400
Exactly.

215
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,920
Thank you for understanding.

216
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,920
So basically what we're going to do is with that, like kick of Coke up in the nostrils,

217
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:11,680
I will give you a boon later in this episode for using a bonus.

218
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:12,880
Okay.

219
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,360
Tight.

220
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,760
Same for me and Clark and John.

221
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,480
Absolutely.

222
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,360
Fuck you.

223
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,560
Justin's character.

224
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,920
Donovan West.

225
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,520
Why can't we remember that?

226
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,360
You don't even remember his last name, do you?

227
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:28,480
West view, West Haven, West Haven, something like that.

228
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:28,880
Sorry.

229
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,040
Sorry.

230
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,400
Sorry, Justin.

231
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,200
We'll care about your next character.

232
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:42,400
So just a reminder, before we get into tonight's episode, you have a pile of money in your

233
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,640
pockets and at your feet.

234
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,680
And you're very excited.

235
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,120
I'm so excited.

236
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,240
I'm giving away my drugs.

237
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:48,560
I'm sorry.

238
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,600
Cause I can buy more.

239
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,480
Exactly.

240
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:50,800
All right.

241
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,360
Let's get the other boys in here and kick this thing off.

242
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:11,120
What's the loudest fart you've ever heard?

243
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,000
I don't know.

244
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,120
Nothing really sticks out.

245
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:13,440
It does.

246
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,400
Nothing has to stick out.

247
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,040
It could just be a fart.

248
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:17,600
What about you?

249
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,040
I don't know.

250
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,160
That's a weird thing to remember.

251
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,280
Why would anybody remember that?

252
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,080
That's what I'm thinking.

253
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,440
Has anyone had any weird dreams recently?

254
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:25,920
Thomas?

255
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:27,200
Yeah.

256
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:33,520
As a matter of fact, I was just telling some close friends about this weird dream.

257
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,440
I had in our pre-interview.

258
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,360
Is that what they're called?

259
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:48,960
You really should start treating us like, like, so, uh, you got anything from your life?

260
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,160
Any anecdotes you want to tell?

261
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,480
If not, some of our writers can punch something up for you.

262
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,920
No, but I did have a really weird dream.

263
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:01,920
Probably doesn't mean anything, but I, a doctor told me to cut off my penis.

264
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:03,920
Here's the deal.

265
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,520
I was like, Oh, I had this dream.

266
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:09,280
I went into the doctor because I was having like, I was like, I think there's something

267
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,160
wrong with my penis.

268
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,560
And the doctor's like, yeah, but it's common.

269
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,920
I'm really busy.

270
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,880
Here's some snips.

271
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:23,040
You're going to cut off the end of your penis, the head and some of the shaft.

272
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,880
Good to use all the scientific terms.

273
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,320
He didn't.

274
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,440
He just like, this is, um, he pointed at it.

275
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,120
He actually said ding dong.

276
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,320
He said, ding dong, but he's the Latin.

277
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,200
He's like, yeah, I don't have time.

278
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:42,800
You've got to cut off the tip of your penis, put it in this plastic bag and, uh, carry

279
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,880
it around until your appointment tomorrow.

280
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,840
So he made me do that myself.

281
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:53,440
And as I was logging out the door, he's like, by the way, by the way, don't pee for 24 hours.

282
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,560
And I was like, fuck.

283
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:01,600
So I probably just had to pee because the rest of the dream was me managing, like just

284
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,720
running into people in life.

285
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,960
And they're like, wait, why do you have your penis in a bag?

286
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,480
And then also I just had this like open penis sore.

287
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,480
And then I really had to pee and I was like, he told me not to.

288
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,480
I was like, but I can probably get away with it.

289
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:23,600
So I peed and just like blood and piss came out, but there was no like pee muscles.

290
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,800
It was just an open hole.

291
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,720
So it just kind of sprayed everywhere.

292
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:33,200
I like when you put your thumb over a hose, I thought you were going to say when you put

293
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:38,000
your thumb over the tip of your penis, just to make the stream stronger.

294
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:44,400
Well, when you're rinsing off like some chicken grease or something, you got to really some

295
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,000
chicken grease from where?

296
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,880
You know where.

297
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:51,040
Speaking of taking home stuff from the hospital, Luke, have you seen anything interesting on

298
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,000
Reddit recently?

299
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,360
Well, I saw it on Facebook.

300
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,000
A friend shared it to another friend.

301
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,440
Way to turn your back on me.

302
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,200
What?

303
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,920
Just say you saw it on Reddit because that's what I asked, Luke.

304
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,280
All right, I saw it on Reddit.

305
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,720
A guy in Oklahoma got in a motorcycle crash.

306
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,840
You're a liar, Luke.

307
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:12,400
He crushed his foot and so they had to amputate it.

308
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:18,560
Then he asked if he could keep it and he did and then he fed it to his friends in the form

309
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,200
of tacos.

310
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,680
He didn't feed it to his friends.

311
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,200
He had a dinner party.

312
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,120
He had a dinner party with tacos.

313
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,480
Yeah, feet tacos.

314
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,200
Foot meat.

315
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,560
Inspired by our podcast.

316
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,080
Oh shit, I didn't even make that connection.

317
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,200
Wow.

318
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:42,160
So we want to shout out to our officially number one superfan out there in Oklahoma.

319
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:42,880
You get it.

320
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,320
He gets it.

321
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,600
Hopping around just like Keith.

322
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,200
I also had a dream.

323
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,200
Wait, no, no, no, no.

324
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:53,680
Far more interested in whether or not you would eat your own flesh if you had the opportunity.

325
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,600
Honestly, when else are you going to get that chance?

326
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:56,800
Sure.

327
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,240
I would ask you guys.

328
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,760
I wouldn't be mad if you said no, but I'd be appreciative if you did.

329
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,160
You know what?

330
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,920
I would eat me, but I would not eat you.

331
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,200
I would eat me, but I don't think I'd eat foot.

332
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,400
Like if I lost my leg, I think I'd eat some calf meat.

333
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,600
You can't really be picky.

334
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,360
That's what, no, I think cannibals can't be choosers.

335
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,520
I think I actually can in this instance.

336
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:24,720
I'm going to choose not to eat any part of myself unless it's the right part.

337
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,600
Honestly, you should have, instead of getting your penis tip reattached, just fed it to us.

338
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,120
Well, I woke up before the penis actually got reattached.

339
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:38,240
So there's a possibility that in some alternate reality where Thomas got like 30 more minutes

340
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,680
of sleep, you all got to enjoy my dream penis.

341
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,600
My dream penis, which is what I call my penis in real life.

342
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,320
You don't have to detach it yet for us to enjoy it.

343
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:04,160
Anyway, so you should start with Luke telling his story and completely cut out the part

344
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:09,520
where I talk about the dick cutting off dream and just let them decide what that's all about.

345
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,440
I won't.

346
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,560
So you guys are all in the basement of glass hall.

347
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,240
Your penis?

348
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,440
Dude, it goes on for like three and a half minutes.

349
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,280
It depends on the mode of...

350
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,560
So you guys are all in the basement of glass hall, right outside the lab.

351
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:32,160
And you have recently walked down some stairs that were covered in blood with loose screwdrivers,

352
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:38,960
all strewn about on the stairwell leading down into the hallway that the lab is in.

353
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,520
The lab's just up here on your right, as Donovan might say.

354
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,800
Donovan, what's your last name?

355
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,920
I'll let you guess.

356
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,420
Elizabeth.

357
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,240
View?

358
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:46,800
West Haven.

359
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,560
You had it right earlier.

360
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,920
I said it right earlier.

361
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,280
And then I told him, I don't think that's it.

362
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,720
Have you never written it down?

363
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,480
It's probably written down like eight times somewhere.

364
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,520
Did he make it up?

365
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,240
Yeah, who made the character name?

366
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,880
Did you get to make your name up, Justin, or did he give you your name?

367
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,000
I didn't give him his name.

368
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,480
Okay.

369
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,840
Zach doesn't tell me to do shit.

370
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,440
Hey, that's right.

371
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,440
Zach was like, if you want to spoil all the story stuff, go for it.

372
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,480
That's essentially what I said.

373
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,920
But I can't, because I don't know what's happening.

374
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,800
Zach's told you at length what was going on in the campaign, but it was just too boring.

375
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,720
Didn't pay attention.

376
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,600
Cool story, Zach.

377
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,200
Ouch.

378
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,400
That was Justin saying that in the past when you told him that story.

379
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,760
I was like, good job, Zach.

380
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,640
I love you.

381
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,040
But he said it really sarcastically, so it hurt worse.

382
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,160
Than if you'd said cool story.

383
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,240
Good job, Zach.

384
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,040
I love you.

385
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,600
And he's just holding up his fingers crossed right in front of Zach's face.

386
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,120
Oh my God.

387
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:56,400
Dude, the way you held your hand annoyingly in front of a face just looks like you have

388
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,680
way too much practice.

389
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,160
I love you, mom.

390
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,240
I do love my mom.

391
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,800
I love this mom.

392
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,880
You guys are standing there.

393
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:14,880
Keith Vigna is shoving bloody screwdrivers into his pants pockets.

394
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:22,080
Donovan is just staring in confusion and amazement and horrifying revelation that

395
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:27,600
maybe you're not with the best people as Keith just puts his finger up the nose of Clark

396
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,240
Bishop and then puts his finger up the nose of John Lee Pettymore.

397
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,600
And then...

398
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,000
Joe, is this the first time Clark's done cooking?

399
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,960
Uh, yeah.

400
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,280
Unless I did it for some reason earlier in the podcast.

401
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:39,760
Definitely.

402
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,880
You definitely did not.

403
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,160
Yeah, definitely.

404
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,280
Before he starts chanting.

405
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,080
What's that like for...

406
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,480
So you got to one sanity, right?

407
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,040
Zero.

408
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:47,760
Zero.

409
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,280
So Clark's just gone.

410
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:49,920
Yeah.

411
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:50,240
Okay.

412
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:52,800
That's sad.

413
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,240
Clark still doesn't know what it's like to do cooking.

414
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,000
The vessel formerly known as Clark.

415
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,440
Towel alico.

416
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,720
Towel alico.

417
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,160
Towel alico.

418
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,360
Towel alico.

419
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,800
I guess we got to shoot them to be consistent.

420
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:24,480
The lights in glass hall all go out at the exact same time and you are left with just

421
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,400
the red emergency lights.

422
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:27,600
Do the thing.

423
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,880
The red emergency lights.

424
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,040
The lighting, the hallway that you're in and the lab...

425
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,080
You guys know what happened.

426
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,920
Who told you about this?

427
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,960
I made the room red because Thomas reminded me.

428
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,880
Red room.

429
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,440
Red room.

430
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,720
And you guys see you're standing in front of this lab that is completely just like a

431
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:55,200
wall of glass, like looking into this laboratory and you hear the doors that you just came

432
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:01,120
in the entrance to glass hall bust open and you hear a bunch of chatter from up there.

433
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,080
Go, go, go.

434
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:11,040
And you hear a voice of an older woman say, oh my God, I just got to get you as many

435
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,800
presents as I possibly can get.

436
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,320
Go, go.

437
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,040
We got another.

438
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:17,680
Clear, clear.

439
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,520
And we are in combat round.

440
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,960
Clark Bishop, you're up first.

441
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,680
You're chanting.

442
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,120
What do you do while you're chanting?

443
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:31,120
I think we ended with my hand out asking if I could help carry the screwdrivers.

444
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,120
If he was handing me one, I'm taking it.

445
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,480
Otherwise I'm reaching down to the body that had those screwdrivers hanging out of it and

446
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:36,960
grabbing one.

447
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,240
Yeah, I'm offering him one.

448
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,600
Then I'll grab it out of his hand.

449
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,720
John Lee Pettymore, you're up.

450
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:40,960
Okay.

451
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:47,200
So John Lee Pettymore, he's walking towards Clark, but you can tell that he thinks he's

452
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,560
floating, if that makes any sense.

453
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,920
He's making these little tippy taps.

454
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:59,200
And he's just going to try to like grab Clark and move him into the lab and like hide with

455
00:21:59,200 --> 00:21:59,360
him.

456
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,720
Chris angel style.

457
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,360
Yeah, but our arms, like he's T posing, but doing little T tippy taps as he has his arms

458
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,320
like stretched out.

459
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,680
Clark, my child come, we must get you to safety.

460
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,560
Keith Vigna.

461
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,160
Do I see people coming down the stairs?

462
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:17,280
When you look back up the stairs, you see the small ugly child that you saw before clean.

463
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,840
He's wearing a backpack and cleaning the baseboards.

464
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,880
Ferocity with ferocity.

465
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,960
That's a word I made up last time.

466
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:36,480
It means, uh, with the, uh, the very intensely and good and, and, and he's like eating that.

467
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,400
Now I don't remember this.

468
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,080
I don't remember that word.

469
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,160
You might not have been conscious.

470
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:42,400
Yeah.

471
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,200
I don't remember it either.

472
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,080
So I might not have been.

473
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:44,880
Yeah, that makes sense.

474
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,120
Okay.

475
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,520
Um, why is there a kid at college?

476
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,840
I hear the yelling and stuff.

477
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:55,840
If I only just see that kid and nobody else, I'm going to keep getting screwdrivers, just

478
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,000
stuff in my pockets and Donovan Westhaven.

479
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,800
What are you doing?

480
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:02,480
Is there a, is there a combat move called panic while not moving?

481
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,080
Can I roll?

482
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:10,880
And Leon Simpson just keeps dancing and grinding, just moving and grooving.

483
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:16,160
Hey, Hey, you gotta get down to the flow and he's just grinding up on it.

484
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:23,680
And then you guys hear from upstairs, you hear, you hear a clink, clink, clink, and

485
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:29,520
looking up the stairs, you see a small canister and gas starts emitting out of it.

486
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,040
And it's right next to this kid cleaning the baseboards with that.

487
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:36,960
It's Clark Bishop's turn and you are being moved into the lab currently.

488
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,600
What are you doing?

489
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,800
John's just pushing you.

490
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,640
You guys can simultaneously here.

491
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:45,120
If you're just pushing me, I'm not going with the push and I'm going to the opposite

492
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:50,480
wall from the glass walls to the cinder block wall and trying to rub the screwdrivers

493
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,960
head really hard to kind of sharpen the tip of it.

494
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,360
Okay.

495
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,240
So if you want him to not do that, we're going to roll a strength.

496
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,240
No, I, I, I abandoned.

497
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,880
I like throw my hands up cause I'm not getting anywhere with him.

498
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,080
And I pick up a pile of screwdrivers from the floor and I wave them.

499
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,280
Look, look, look, look, shiny, shiny screwdrivers.

500
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:12,480
And I throw them like in front of the door for the lab.

501
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,240
Make it rain, brother.

502
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,280
Hell yeah.

503
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,000
Make it rain.

504
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:16,720
I like that.

505
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,920
Those were the best ones.

506
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,960
Those were the best ones.

507
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,840
They're all good.

508
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,520
They all worth the same amount.

509
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,360
There was a, there was one that was worth more.

510
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,520
Not what I'm seeing.

511
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,120
It said, it said on there.

512
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,880
Very good screwdriver.

513
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,160
Better than the rest.

514
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,840
I don't know what the hell you're talking about.

515
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,800
But, uh, fuck.

516
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,280
Why are you rubbing that up against the wall?

517
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,840
Double elical, double elical.

518
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,960
Uh, I see that has the, the canister has started emitting.

519
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,760
It's on the stairs.

520
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,000
Yeah.

521
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:42,880
And it's going off.

522
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,480
Smoke hasn't made it down here yet though.

523
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,080
Is the lab open?

524
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,960
The door is closed, but it is just a push.

525
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,240
It's not like a lock.

526
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,680
I see the gas coming out.

527
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:59,200
I take a one last, like handful of screwdrivers, shoving my pockets and I head towards the door,

528
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,040
try to open it up and go in that room.

529
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:01,360
Okay.

530
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:01,840
Sounds good.

531
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,360
You'll be in there at the start of next round.

532
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,200
Donovan West Haven.

533
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:10,080
I am going to follow Keith and just cause like, I'm like, it's better than staying right here.

534
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:10,800
Absolutely.

535
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:17,440
And Leon Simpson is going to continue just moving, grinding, bumping, bopping, duping,

536
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,800
dipin' and dopin'.

537
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:24,880
And at that moment you see legs, just legs, and then torsos.

538
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:34,240
A squad of four men dressed in black tactical gear with flashlights at the tips of their

539
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,600
submachine guns.

540
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:42,080
And they each have a canister in their hands and you hear, oh, we got a bunch down here.

541
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,360
We got a bunch down here.

542
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,880
Get go, get go, get go.

543
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,600
Ting, ting, ting, ting, ting, ting.

544
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,760
And four canisters roll right next to you guys in the hallway outside the lab.

545
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:51,920
And...

546
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,280
Joe, if you could hit that vape real hard and just blow it around here and get some

547
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:02,560
smoke in the room, really make it, really make it real for us.

548
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,600
Fatter, fatter.

549
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,720
Oh, we need those clouds.

550
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,520
Get that rip.

551
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,800
Oh shit.

552
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,000
That was actually really fat.

553
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:16,080
It's like I'm looking into the sky on a beautiful summer's day.

554
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,040
Thomas, what if you got popcorn lung just from that one hit?

555
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,280
I'd haunt you all.

556
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:30,000
We'd all talk like every time you were haunting us, we'd be like...

557
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,760
No, that's what I would do.

558
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,120
Every night while you tried to sleep.

559
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,080
Just behind your head.

560
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:44,320
Clark Bishop, it is the top of the third round and you have a sharp screwdriver in your hand.

561
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:44,820
What do you do?

562
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:49,200
He kind of looks around and gives a smile to everyone around

563
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,200
and jams the pick into his eye and up through the top of his head.

564
00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:03,760
Clark's chanting ceases as he shoves this sharpened screwdriver into the white of his eye

565
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,320
and blood begins dripping down his face.

566
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:14,960
But with one last staccato motion, he shoves the handle of the screwdriver

567
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:23,360
flush with his eye socket and a stream of warm dark red blood sprays into the air as

568
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:33,600
each of his limbs go limp and the body of Clark Bishop crumbles into a pile on the floor.

569
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,640
So it's my turn.

570
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,960
It is your turn?

571
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,960
I'd like to load our autosave.

572
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,720
Wait, could I have done that, Zach?

573
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,480
We turned autosave off and we...

574
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,480
Oh, come on, we're on survival mode?

575
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,560
Are we going for achievements?

576
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:03,680
I think we were fighting the fishmen the last time we actually saved.

577
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,960
Well, listeners.

578
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:14,240
You all walk into a dank, dark room the size of a football field and you see

579
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,320
catwalks going...

580
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,000
No, I quit the podcast.

581
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:18,820
Yeah.

582
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,520
Joe, Clark is dead.

583
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,240
Long live Clark.

584
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,040
Long live Clark.

585
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,080
Get the fuck out of the room.

586
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:30,960
Good luck, fellas.

587
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,120
Your hair looks pretty crazy right now.

588
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:34,560
Wait, wait, wait.

589
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,880
Can Joe just lay down on the ground right now?

590
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,840
Make gurgling sounds.

591
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,720
Joe, be a dead...

592
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,840
Oh, roleplay a dead guy.

593
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,440
Can we eat your foot?

594
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:48,560
I'm at it.

595
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,760
John Lee Pettymore, it's your turn.

596
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:10,320
You just saw Clark Bishop stab himself in the eye with a screwdriver and fall limply

597
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,280
dead to the ground.

598
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:15,920
Yeah, and you see that affect real John just very briefly.

599
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,960
Like a flash in his eyes before he...

600
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,920
Well, that's real handy because I'm going to have you all roll sanity for me.

601
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,560
Oh, I passed 16 on a 19.

602
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,760
Oh my God.

603
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:33,440
The only reason I passed or the only reason I rolled is because it's my friend.

604
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,240
If it was anybody else, I'd be like, I don't give a fuck.

605
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,120
I got a 99.

606
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,480
Oh, God fuck.

607
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:48,720
Which is the crittest of fails, except for 100.

608
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,680
Except for 100.

609
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:54,000
Hey, Thomas, you're going to lose four sanity.

610
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,680
Well, that's all I got.

611
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:58,080
Yeah, no more sanity for John Lee Pettymore.

612
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,640
Okay, I need Donovan to roll a d4 for me.

613
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,480
Oh, there it is.

614
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,120
One.

615
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:07,620
Nice.

616
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,560
So as you lose one sanity, you're still going to be able to keep your wits about you for

617
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:15,520
the time being as fucked up as that seems.

618
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,280
Not too rattled on.

619
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,280
You don't really know this guy that well.

620
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:22,800
With that, though, I'm going to have Luke and Justin leave the room.

621
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,400
You guys could just stay here.

622
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,160
He's not like a cop or anything.

623
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,640
Can you stop me, sir?

624
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,680
What are you going to do about it?

625
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,480
Don't leave.

626
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:46,320
Wait, you listen to cops.

627
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,760
As soon as they come back in the room, you're going to start chanting.

628
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,280
Can you teach me how to chant again?

629
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,880
A towel.

630
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:57,840
Towel.

631
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:58,800
Alakol.

632
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,520
Alakol.

633
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,720
Towel alakol.

634
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:00,960
Yes.

635
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,000
Towel alakol.

636
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,920
And I need you to roll a d4 for me.

637
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,440
Three.

638
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:12,800
You are going to start working on finding a way to kill yourself over the next three

639
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,440
rounds.

640
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,120
I mean, I think I just have a gun, right?

641
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:15,680
Yep.

642
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:19,200
And on the fourth round, you have to go through with it.

643
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,800
Can I go through with it before that?

644
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,440
You cannot.

645
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,320
Oh, okay.

646
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:26,320
I have to give them a chance to realize what's going on like we didn't with Joe?

647
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,600
That is correct.

648
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,100
Okay.

649
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,360
I'll get the other boys back in here.

650
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:47,280
Okay.

651
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:50,080
John Lee Pennymore walks straight back to the corner.

652
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,840
He's still doing the tippy tap thing.

653
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:57,200
Like he thinks he's floating with his face to the corner of the back wall of the slab

654
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,320
and his arms outstretched.

655
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,040
He starts saying.

656
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,960
Towel alakol.

657
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,160
Towel alakol.

658
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,440
Towel alakol.

659
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,240
Towel alakol.

660
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:09,200
And you guys notice as you, as you get into this lab, you're just paying so much attention

661
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:15,200
to John as he walks away from you and starts chanting this that you barely notice the woman

662
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:20,960
and the lab coat or the man and the lab coat sitting at a desk faced away from you.

663
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,000
Are there two people?

664
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,160
Two people, one man, one woman, both wearing lab coats and the woman looks at you and it's

665
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,600
like, oh my goodness.

666
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:32,880
Oh, oh, thank God someone came except for he's doing the, he's doing the chanting and

667
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,760
he is he.

668
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:39,120
She looks at Keith Vigna and Donovan Westhaven and it's like, do you know how to fix him?

669
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:44,320
I like briefly look at her and then I look down, I get down on my knees and I start pulling

670
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:49,760
all of the stuff out of my pockets and I start counting it with a huge smile on my face.

671
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,720
Donovan, what are you doing?

672
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,160
I don't understand the, to the, the woman who's talking, what about the man?

673
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,840
Is he also looking at us or?

674
00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:00,080
No, he's faced away from you and he's bent over a desk, kind of like slumped over.

675
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:06,560
Okay, well, I'll acknowledge the person who's acknowledged me as is Donovan's way.

676
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,080
I don't, I don't understand what's happening.

677
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:12,960
These, these people, they've all started going crazy and I don't know what's happening.

678
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,720
Everyone all over the campus is going crazy.

679
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,160
And they've all been committing suicide after they started going crazy.

680
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,960
I'm trying to count here.

681
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,720
Why is he counting screwdrivers?

682
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,600
I don't, I don't know.

683
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,600
He just started doing this minutes ago.

684
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:31,840
And then you guys look out and through the glass, you see into the hallway

685
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:36,720
filled with smoke and bathed in red emergency bulbs.

686
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:43,600
Through the gas, you see the beams from four flashlights attached to the barrels of this

687
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,680
four man squad's rifles.

688
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:53,040
The hazy gleam illuminates the screwdriver filled old woman and the body of Clark Bishop

689
00:33:53,040 --> 00:34:00,640
before all four rifles are pointed at Leon Simpson, who has ceased to dance.

690
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:15,280
And you hear and then, and then he falls over without doing anything.

691
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,680
He's just standing there chanting.

692
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,800
And then he falls over clear.

693
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,840
We got more in the lab.

694
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,000
On the right.

695
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:27,680
It is John Lee Pettymore's turn.

696
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:32,320
John turns around from the wall and looks at the door and draws his gun.

697
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,160
And that's his turn.

698
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:34,800
Keith Vigna.

699
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,720
As I'm counting, I like look over my shoulder through the glass.

700
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,800
I see Leon fall down.

701
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,760
What else do I see?

702
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:48,080
These guys, they move in and they're all wearing this like full tactical gear from

703
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:55,760
combat boots all the way up to a gas mask, big goggles on the gas masks and helmets on top.

704
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,000
Just some straight Resident Evil motherfuckers.

705
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,640
I position myself to wear my pile of goodies.

706
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,280
Like it's me, my pile of goodies.

707
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:10,800
And then I have clear sight of the door looking at them, but also just continue counting.

708
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,000
What's your name, sir?

709
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,480
Donovan.

710
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,440
Donovan Westhaven.

711
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,160
I go here.

712
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,720
Are you the only one about them who's got the wits?

713
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,600
I think so.

714
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:21,600
I don't know why, but I haven't been infected with whatever's happening.

715
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,320
I'm Barbara.

716
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,120
This is Phillip.

717
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:29,360
And she points at the man who slumped over behind her and she's like, we are also fine.

718
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:32,240
Everyone's going crazy around us and we're just fine.

719
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,680
That's a relief that there's, it's not just me that's safe.

720
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,640
Yes, absolutely.

721
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,520
But I mean, you've seen it all from the beginning, ain't you?

722
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,240
I guess I have.

723
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:45,040
I just, I thought there was some like weird campus prank or something in the beginning.

724
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,400
And now it's freaky.

725
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:51,200
It's it's I don't, I don't, he doesn't know how to find the words to describe the terrors

726
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,560
that he is experiencing.

727
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,800
When he's, he's like stammering and finishes.

728
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,320
I look over my shoulder at him.

729
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:00,320
I'm like, I think they sent the tweets and then I continue doing what I'm doing.

730
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:00,960
Oh yes.

731
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,880
Yes, I did send those tweets.

732
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,520
Yes, me and me and Phillip both sent those tweets.

733
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,640
And Phillip, tell them, tell them what you told me earlier.

734
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:10,960
Dead silence.

735
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:15,840
And then she's like, Phillip, you have such a wit about you.

736
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,120
Fuck.

737
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:21,200
Like, he's so like, he's like, Oh God, I'm literally the only sane person right now.

738
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:21,840
I look over at her.

739
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,760
I'm like, did you guys leave this outside?

740
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,400
Did you leave all this outside?

741
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,280
Oh, and I, I wave, I wave one around.

742
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:33,120
Barbara looks back up to Donovan and she's like, why is he doing that?

743
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:33,760
I don't know.

744
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,560
I mean, I guess there's no reason for any of this anymore.

745
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,400
I suppose it's just more for me then.

746
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,080
Oh, crazy.

747
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:44,080
I think, I think we need, is John still chanting?

748
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,160
I think we need to, can we, can you help me restrain him?

749
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:52,480
Yes.

750
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,440
Yes, of course.

751
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,840
I'm like walking towards, do I even know John's name?

752
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,560
Oh God, sir.

753
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,080
I just know Clark and Leon.

754
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,120
Yeah, probably not.

755
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:06,000
So I'll let you guys roll a, uh, if, if John, uh, doesn't want to be.

756
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,320
John will contest it, whatever you do.

757
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:12,000
Okay, so you'll get a strength check and I'll give you, because there are two of us doing

758
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,640
it, even though we're probably not as strong as John Lee Pettymore is, I'll give you a

759
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,600
70 strength with two people working together.

760
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,440
So it's a blackjack rules.

761
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,160
So you want to roll as high as possible without going over.

762
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,040
Price is right rules.

763
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,000
John's got a 50.

764
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:26,800
What did I say?

765
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,760
Blackjack.

766
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,320
Oh yeah.

767
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,120
Price is right.

768
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:29,920
Makes way more sense.

769
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,240
Well, you always want to hit that big roll in blackjack.

770
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,000
Okay, come on.

771
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,760
Spay and neuter those pets, Justin.

772
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:41,540
Fuck.

773
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,040
I fucked up too.

774
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,160
So I got a 14.

775
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,280
I got a five.

776
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:45,780
Yeah.

777
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:48,740
Yes.

778
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:49,760
Okay.

779
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:53,920
So as Barbara and Donovan come toward John Lee Pettymore, what does John Lee Pettymore

780
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:54,320
do?

781
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:57,680
Oh, he just like, he very smoothly just like wiles away.

782
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,880
He just kind of like waves his arms and he's gone.

783
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:01,760
He's so slippery.

784
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:09,120
And it's John Lee Pettymore's turn as these four men point their flashlights into the

785
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:13,440
lab through the glass door and are clearly preparing an entrance.

786
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:21,840
John Lee Pettymore points his service revolver at his chin and he says, God is dead.

787
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,840
God remains dead and we have killed him.

788
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,720
And it's Keith Vigna's turn.

789
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:32,240
I look over my shoulder and I see them getting ready to come in.

790
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:37,520
I grab an arm full of what I've been counting, trying to get as much as I can.

791
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:44,080
And I run behind the desk, drop it on the ground and then prepare for an assault.

792
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:50,960
I'm going to take my gun out and I want to shoot John Lee Pettymore to stop him from,

793
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,800
I'm assuming killing himself because that's all I've seen is people kill themselves.

794
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,000
Where are you shooting him?

795
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,440
I don't know if Donovan would know better to like, not the head.

796
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,400
Yeah, you have a 30% on firearms we dictated.

797
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,440
So a called shot would give you a 10% chance.

798
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,280
So you're just going to go ahead and fire.

799
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,960
I'm just going to shoot him and hope it like

800
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,840
knocks him out of shooting himself and disables him.

801
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,360
Go ahead and roll that firearms.

802
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,480
But can I have a bonus power of love of Clark?

803
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,920
The spirit of Clark compels you.

804
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:25,440
This is for Clark, my new dad.

805
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:26,800
Oh no.

806
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,440
Yeah, I'm good.

807
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,040
Didn't.

808
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:29,680
87.

809
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,200
He's bad.

810
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,080
He's not good.

811
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:34,320
You shoot John directly in the head.

812
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:36,640
Oh God.

813
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,760
It wasn't a crit fail.

814
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:43,040
So you fire just past him and you're like, the camera zooms, like the camera is looking

815
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,560
at your gun as it fires.

816
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,200
And then when it zooms up to your face, you've got your eyes closed.

817
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,440
That checks out.

818
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:55,120
You see that there's this piece of machinery behind John Lee Pettymore where he's standing

819
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:01,280
and Barbara looks at you and she's like, that happened to be the machinery we were going

820
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:05,440
to use to try to create some sort of antivirus for whatever's happening here.

821
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:05,840
Oh God.

822
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,760
I'm so, I'm so sorry.

823
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:12,720
And then she turns to Phillip and she's like, Phillip, I just don't think that we're going

824
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,480
to be able to make it through this.

825
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:20,240
And she puts her hand on Phillip's shoulder and as she does, she kind of like pushes him

826
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:24,880
a little bit and the rolly chair that he's in rolls, like spins around.

827
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:34,080
And you see that this man has no eyes and there's blood just running down from his eye

828
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,120
holes.

829
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:43,440
And in each one of his hands, he is holding his own eyeballs, stringy mucus hanging off

830
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:47,440
the end of each one limply in both of his dead hands.

831
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,880
So you're like Pan's Labyrinth.

832
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,720
Yeah, exactly.

833
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,400
But grosser somehow.

834
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,080
Oh, much grosser.

835
00:40:54,080 --> 00:41:01,360
And at that moment, the door gets kicked in and you hear, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

836
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:05,760
And you hear canisters hit the floor and smoke starts filling the lab.

837
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,080
It's John Lee Pettymore's turn.

838
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:16,720
With a look of just complete contentment, it's honestly unnerving.

839
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:21,200
But you've never seen a being more at peace with itself.

840
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:28,320
John Lee Pettymore just looks out at all of you and like smiles and then blows his brains

841
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,520
out through the back of his head.

842
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,520
I need you both to roll sanity.

843
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:37,700
Pass.

844
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,160
He knows we're all ball.

845
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,560
I fail.

846
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,080
Roll a d4 for me, Luke.

847
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:51,760
Three, which brings me down to 16.

848
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:52,960
Alrighty.

849
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:59,920
Thomas, go ahead and leave the room.

850
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:12,960
John Lee Pettymore falls backwards and hits the ground.

851
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,600
And a pool of blood starts forming around his head.

852
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,000
And it's Keith Vigna's turn.

853
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,680
Well, I hear the gunshot and I turn around to see it.

854
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:28,100
Fuck.

855
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:35,600
And I almost like, I feel like I'm going to throw up, but I keep it down and I look down

856
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:36,640
at what's in front of me.

857
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:40,640
This is all going to his funeral, if I can keep it.

858
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:41,680
And then I look at the door.

859
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,480
The smoke is currently coming out of the canisters on the ground in front of you.

860
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,640
The next thing I want to do is when they enter the room.

861
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:47,680
Okay, Donovan.

862
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:53,280
Donovan would instinctively like go into like, I'm being arrested mode because he's like,

863
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,560
I don't know what the fuck is happening.

864
00:42:54,560 --> 00:43:00,960
And everyone he's been following has gone crazy and is either killed themselves or is

865
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,520
counting screwdrivers on the floor.

866
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:06,560
He just like gets on his knees and like submits.

867
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:09,760
Like does the hands behind the head, just gets on the knees.

868
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,080
Help, I don't know what's happening.

869
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:12,400
Help.

870
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:17,920
I hear him say that and I look over to him like, you got to help me protect this stash.

871
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,040
Get up and fight.

872
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:20,480
I do not.

873
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:27,840
I feel betrayed and then I am preparing, but I wait for the entrance of.

874
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:32,800
Yeah, if you're, if you're like holding your turn until something happens, these guys bust

875
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,600
into the room all four of them at the same time.

876
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:38,160
From that preparing, like an aim kind of thing.

877
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:38,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

878
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:39,360
So what do you do?

879
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:42,720
I pick up the objects in front of me, a handful.

880
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,160
I like focus in on them.

881
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:52,160
My mind is going a thousand miles an hour from that bump of pure coke.

882
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,280
Glass family cocaine.

883
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,240
Glass family coke.

884
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,800
Focus in on the four guys.

885
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:03,520
And what Donovan would see is I take a screwdriver in my hand, holding it like a piece of money

886
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:09,680
paper and I like snap it, flick it like I'm throwing a card.

887
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:10,240
Right.

888
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:15,920
And I'm aiming right at the neck between the helmet and the body armor.

889
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:16,480
Sure.

890
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:19,360
And that one exposed piece of skin.

891
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:19,920
Yep.

892
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:20,240
And I.

893
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,240
Try to throw a bunch of screwdrivers.

894
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:31,760
Well, I am flicking in my mind, paper money at them, trying to like get it into them.

895
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:35,280
But in reality, I'm throwing screwdrivers into their necks.

896
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:35,600
Okay.

897
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:43,680
So you're going to roll athletics and I will give you a plus 40, 20 for being prepared

898
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:49,280
and 20 for being gacked out and just fully believing that this is possible.

899
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,680
And then negative 20 for it being a called shot.

900
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,200
So it's a plus 20 overall.

901
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,080
And not one.

902
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:56,960
No, you fucking didn't.

903
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,080
I fucking swear to you.

904
00:44:58,720 --> 00:44:59,040
Seven.

905
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,600
It's a seven.

906
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:03,360
Holy shit.

907
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:04,320
God damn it.

908
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:06,880
I thought it was, but I mean, that's still pretty good.

909
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:07,120
Yeah.

910
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:08,240
It's still a pass.

911
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,240
So I thought for sure it was a one.

912
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,920
I was stoked as fuck, but nope.

913
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:12,320
Seven.

914
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:17,200
With that, I'm going to have both of you roll a constitution check.

915
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:21,520
You will be at a negative 20 for being yocked out of one mind.

916
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,280
23 on what would be a 50.

917
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,360
Pass 38.

918
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:25,760
Yes.

919
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:27,040
Okay.

920
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:33,360
So three screwdrivers hit the guy who's leading the team.

921
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:34,560
Two of them just hit him.

922
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,720
Like one hits him in the gas mask.

923
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,880
One hits him in the chest and they just bounce off.

924
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:44,640
But one of them slides through and hits him directly in the neck, right in between the

925
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,800
gas mask and his body armor.

926
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:52,480
And he falls to the ground and the other three are like, Oh shit, he's got screwdrivers.

927
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,320
He's got screwdrivers.

928
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,760
And they fire.

929
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:00,000
When I hear he's got screwdrivers, I laugh.

930
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,240
I'm like, that's what you call it.

931
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:03,520
I got screwdrivers.

932
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:07,200
Also, I am hiding behind this desk.

933
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:09,200
So I'm covered.

934
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:13,600
In order to use cover, you would have had to say, yeah, beforehand.

935
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:16,160
And then you would have taken another negative on that role.

936
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:20,480
So I think the only part exposed is your head.

937
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:23,520
My, my, my most vulnerable part of my body.

938
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:24,020
Yeah.

939
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:24,820
Okay.

940
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:33,920
All three of them passed their firearms checks and they are, they're lining you up.

941
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:37,840
Keith is going to take 22 points of damage.

942
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:40,640
I'm still alive, baby.

943
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,320
How much HP did you have?

944
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:42,960
25.

945
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:43,600
Holy shit.

946
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:48,480
So you're down to three because you took more than half of your full health points in one

947
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:48,640
hit.

948
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:52,960
You have to roll a constitution check in order to not take like major damage.

949
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,160
46 on a 70.

950
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:54,640
All right.

951
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:59,760
So not only are you still conscious, but you're not going to take like a lifelong ill effect

952
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,280
to those bullets.

953
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,840
I don't know how life, how long life is.

954
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:06,560
You're like bleeding out on the ground.

955
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:10,640
You're like laying down, but you're still conscious and you can still act.

956
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:17,520
Barbara immediately is just like hugging on to Philip, the man who is like bent over and

957
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:18,960
he's like slumping out of the chair.

958
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:24,800
And as she's trying to like cover him with her body, they both kind of fall out of the

959
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,080
chair together.

960
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:31,760
You see them both hit the ground and looking over, Barbara's eyes are wide open, but she

961
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,040
is unconscious.

962
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:35,840
Keith, it's your turn again.

963
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:37,360
I'm laying on the ground.

964
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:45,920
I put my finger into a bullet hole, pull my finger trigger, and I mainline some fucking

965
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,360
coke right into my bloodstream.

966
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:49,680
All right.

967
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:55,680
Lose 10 more luck and I'll let you just hop to and do whatever you want on your next turn.

968
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:58,240
Also, as Donovan is acting, you hear me go.

969
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,280
Did you see that?

970
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:09,440
Donovan is like, just like, what the fuck is that?

971
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,360
Like he's like still just on his knees.

972
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:11,520
Yeah.

973
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:14,240
I'm just like, I'm like, I'm, I'm not one of them.

974
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:17,280
Like I'm trying to like communicate with the people over.

975
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:20,080
Is it, are the gunshots happening as I'm talking or is it already?

976
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:21,680
The gunshots were already happening.

977
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:26,080
And then one of them, as you're like clearly giving up the gun, one of them runs up to

978
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:32,560
you holding like an oxygen mask kind of thing and is going to try to put it on your face.

979
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:33,600
Are you going to let him?

980
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:34,320
I let him.

981
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:34,640
Okay.

982
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:40,240
So as he puts it on your face, your eyes roll into the back of your head and you fall on

983
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:42,480
your back right to sleep.

984
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:42,640
Oh,

985
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:43,520
pleasant.

986
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:44,960
I need you to leave the room, Justin.

987
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:45,520
No, I'm good.

988
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:45,840
Okay.

989
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:46,560
Sounds good.

990
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:47,440
I'm not a cop.

991
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:09,840
Keith, another one runs up to you and is going to do the same thing, has a gas mask and yells

992
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:13,280
out to the others, like this one's a fighter.

993
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:13,920
Oh shit.

994
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:17,440
There's something, this one's really, what in the, and they're going to try to put this

995
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,200
gas mask over on top of your face.

996
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:24,160
This guy is looking me in the eyes and he sees my pupils are dilated.

997
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:30,560
Like I have no iris and they're dilated so much that I have very little white in my eyes.

998
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:32,560
I see him coming up doing this.

999
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:35,680
I take a screwdriver and shove it through his neck.

1000
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:36,960
Opposed melee combat.

1001
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:38,160
I do want to set this up.

1002
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:46,640
I do that with my left hand as I have my hand on my gun in case I do pass this role, preparing

1003
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:47,440
for my next.

1004
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:48,640
Okay.

1005
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:49,360
Sounds good.

1006
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:50,320
So what am I rolling?

1007
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:51,840
Opposed melee combat.

1008
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,760
That's a 42 on a 50.

1009
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:00,480
I rolled a 16.

1010
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:01,760
Oh, okay.

1011
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:06,800
So you shove this screwdriver up into the exact same spot that you hit the other guy.

1012
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:07,760
Carotid artery.

1013
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:14,160
Oh, and blood just splatters straight down all over your blood riddled body already.

1014
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:16,160
I look like Nick cage and Mandy.

1015
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:20,400
And this guy just like falls over to the side.

1016
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:25,200
And I take, I take the screwdriver out because that's a fucking hundred dollar bill.

1017
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:30,720
I shove it into my pocket and then I aim my gun at the next guy.

1018
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:34,560
So there's one who's putting the gas mask on Donovan.

1019
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:36,720
One who is coming around the other side of the room.

1020
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,200
Not the gas mask on Donovan's guy.

1021
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:39,600
Okay.

1022
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:40,160
Sounds good.

1023
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:41,840
So it is their turn.

1024
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:50,480
And as they turn the corner rifle aimed at you, they see the second victim of your screwdrivers

1025
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,080
and immediately fire.

1026
00:50:54,400 --> 00:51:01,600
Rolled a 17 and is going to get you for six damage.

1027
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:02,960
That kills me.

1028
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:14,800
As Keith Vigna is staring down the barrel of this guy in full tactical gear coming towards

1029
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:18,640
him, you know, he's a trained shooter.

1030
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,200
He's got his gun right at you.

1031
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:25,600
You've taken out two of them, but you couldn't handle all four of them by yourself.

1032
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:28,080
What is the last thought going through your head?

1033
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:31,040
I get shot in the neck in that same spot.

1034
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:32,080
I killed the other two.

1035
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:42,160
I fall to the ground and in front of me, I see this giant pile of screwdrivers and I

1036
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:46,000
smile to myself and I reach out and I touch one.

1037
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:54,240
I hope I can take this with me.

1038
00:51:54,240 --> 00:52:12,720
Through the haze and red emergency lights, we see the two casualties of Keith's screwdrivers,

1039
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:16,000
lifeless in pools of their own blood.

1040
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:23,200
The camera leaves the lab, passes the elderly pile of a corpse in the hallway, moves up

1041
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:25,280
the stairs and out of glass hall.

1042
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,720
The CSU campus is humming.

1043
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:31,120
Sirens are constant.

1044
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:39,040
Limp bodies are being transported by teams of two in full tactical gear and dragged into

1045
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:41,360
prison transport buses.

1046
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:45,600
The sky is littered with unmarked black helicopters.

1047
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:52,240
We see one hovering above the minion atop the bell tower, a rope ladder allowing ShamWow

1048
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:54,880
Chameleon to get even higher.

1049
00:52:54,880 --> 00:53:01,760
As we leave the CSU campus, we see a confluence of black SUVs heading toward one of the taller

1050
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:09,760
buildings of the city skyline, a building that is being climbed by something massive

1051
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:11,040
and spherical.

1052
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:17,280
We continue past the business district and swoop down into the back of a van heading

1053
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:18,480
out toward the pier.

1054
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:27,120
The broken and upgraded and dead and metal corpses of John Lee Pettymore and Keith Vigna

1055
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:35,280
are jostling around the posterior of this van that pulls up to a grand old edifice alone

1056
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:41,760
on the edge of the water with a well-lit sign outside that reads, The City Asylum.

1057
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:49,040
Inside the front doors are two familiar guards, tall and overweight and all black with prominent

1058
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:50,640
facial scarring.

1059
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:57,040
After we move down through the floor, we are immediately looking through a long line of

1060
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:58,400
the bottoms of feet.

1061
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:04,960
Body after body has been laid out in a row covered in sheets, feet sticking out.

1062
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:08,480
We stop on the final four soles.

1063
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:10,480
Both right feet are blank.

1064
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:17,040
Both left feet have dead skin in the shape of the circle of knowledge, but one left foot

1065
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:21,920
has the name Maggie burned on top of the seven circles.

1066
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:28,240
Our vision moves up through the ceiling and into a small dark room.

1067
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:37,440
Donovan Westhaven wakes up to the sounds of beeps and bloops of a machine that you feel

1068
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:46,640
yourself connected to and you're laying in a hospital bed in a room that is completely

1069
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:51,680
dark except for the lights coming from the machine on either side of you.

1070
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:58,800
You see that your blood is being drawn and there is an IV in your other arm and then

1071
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:04,880
a screen turns on like a TV that's on one of those like roller things that they would

1072
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:07,040
roll in when you're in elementary school.

1073
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:08,480
To watch Magic School Bus on.

1074
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:10,560
When your teacher was hungover.

1075
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:12,080
Yeah, sleeping.

1076
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:22,800
The screen is a freeze frame of like a webcam video and it's Harriet Marks who you would

1077
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:25,520
recognize as a fellow student at CSU.

1078
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:32,400
She was a political activist pro-union and you know made herself known all over campus

1079
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:33,440
so you knew who she was.

1080
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:39,680
She also became quite something in the news when she committed suicide in her dorm room

1081
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:43,760
and the video starts and she is mid-chant.

1082
00:55:43,760 --> 00:56:10,400
And then you see at the bottom of the screen the barrel of a gun comes up and she squeezes

1083
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:17,680
the trigger and then she with a splatter of blood behind her falls back and out of

1084
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:23,520
frame of the camera and you're just looking at her dorm room with a paint of blood behind

1085
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:27,520
her on the wall and on the ceiling and the video stops.

1086
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:34,560
And a man comes out of the darkness in the back corner of the room and you can see that

1087
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:41,120
he's lit by your machines and he's wearing a black suit with a black tie and a white

1088
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:41,600
shirt.

1089
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:46,560
I need you to tell me everything that happened.

1090
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:55,600
Okay.

1091
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:15,600
So

1092
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:45,600
