1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,520
Ho, ho, ho, my babies, it's your number one gift giver and home invader, Wolfy Claws.

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:12,520
And I'm here to throw copious amounts of garbage down your chimneys at night, whether you've

3
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:15,080
been naughty or nice.

4
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:21,200
Hope you put that fire out, because my gifts of garbage are good and grease-filled, baby.

5
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:29,920
And as always, we are delivering all that unholy holiday cheer live from 694.2 PTBP.

6
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,120
What's that smell in the air?

7
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:34,680
Is it holiday cheer and joy?

8
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:40,880
Is it the smoldering ashes of a house I accidentally ignited into flame from throwing greasy garbage

9
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,520
down their chimneys?

10
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,400
No, it's Howlin' with Wolf.

11
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:49,880
This week we got a new Howlin' with Wolf, and it comes from someone very close to my

12
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,880
heart.

13
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,920
Dear Wolf the Dog, You are handsome, you are beautiful.

14
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,520
When you command, people obey.

15
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:05,000
You are the master of trash, a savant of meat drippings, an academic of pandemics.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,120
Just wanted to let you know how special you are to everyone, especially me, baby.

17
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,560
With great admiration, Wolf the Dog.

18
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,440
Now damn, that was a nice letter.

19
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,960
We should get more like that, I think.

20
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:24,700
This kind being must have massive intellect to compose such a letter.

21
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:28,600
If you want to write up something for your wolf to howl, remember to hit us up on one

22
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,500
of the various forms of social media and tag us.

23
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:39,820
Or give us a 5 star review on iTunes and all that jazz and send us a damn email for wolf's

24
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:40,820
sake.

25
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:44,260
Pretendinpod at gmail dot com, baby.

26
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:51,300
Also if you love the show like I do, consider becoming a subscriber over on patreon dot

27
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,040
com slash pretendinpod.

28
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,760
We got some nice exclusives for y'all over there.

29
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,800
Speaking of transition, it's the news.

30
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:06,380
Leon Dunn murdered some cops while leaving Bruce Robin's office.

31
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:12,720
The city PD tried to catch them contention boys, but the fast and furious car chase ended

32
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:19,120
after Keith threw a shotgun at the lead car so hard it buried itself into the driver,

33
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,760
causing the CPD cruiser to swerve and flip an absurd number of times.

34
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:31,080
The wake of destruction got to John and Clark, and they dived into their own consciousnesses,

35
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:36,400
unresponsive and chanting the numbers that translate to Bruce Robin.

36
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,040
Right before they snapped out of their weird trance-like state, Keith learned an ominous

37
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,480
fact from Leon Simpson.

38
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:49,620
Apparently Clark Bishop is the overseer, and in his future he will go back to the past

39
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,320
and found the circle of knowledge.

40
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,320
So uh, that's fun.

41
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:59,640
Y'all it's time to introduce a new one never heard before on this station.

42
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:06,760
It's my favorite Christmas song of all time, one that inspires joy and happiness to all

43
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,560
far and wide.

44
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:16,240
No matter the dimension, no matter the timeline, it's Mariah Carey's All I Want For Christmas

45
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:20,320
Is Kudzu With No Backbone.

46
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:54,800
Clark Bishop and John Lee Pettymore, you come to and you are sitting in the car with Leon

47
00:03:54,800 --> 00:04:04,080
Simpson and Keith Vigna, and you are in a parking lot of CSU, City State University.

48
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:09,760
And Leon and Keith are just, Keith especially, is just...

49
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,520
I'm staring at you, mouth agape, like...

50
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,520
Keith?

51
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,520
Um...

52
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,520
Uh...

53
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,520
Uh...

54
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,520
Where...

55
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,520
Do you know?

56
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,520
Know...

57
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,520
Know what?

58
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,520
Where are we?

59
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,800
Yeah, I'm cool.

60
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,280
Leon touches your arm, Keith, and he says, it might not be time.

61
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,280
Oh, fuck.

62
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,620
I look at Leon, time for what?

63
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,500
Time for you guys to head on out.

64
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:39,500
So here's what I'm thinking, Keith and, what's your name, John?

65
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:44,180
If Keith and John want to go in from this way, her dorm is this next one right up here

66
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:52,380
and he points at a building, and you see the entire campus of CSU is dripping in holiday

67
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,380
festivities.

68
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:59,580
Before we get out of the car, I want to hand Clark the folder with the pictures and stuff

69
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:00,580
in it.

70
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,060
Do you remember what you were just doing?

71
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:07,540
We were in a car chase, I shot out a tire, I guess I don't remember how we got here though.

72
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:11,860
You and John were, you were just chanting those numbers.

73
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:12,860
Bruce Robin.

74
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,460
Nah, that didn't sound like us.

75
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,460
Over and over and over again.

76
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,100
I don't remember saying those numbers.

77
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,540
It was pretty freaky.

78
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:24,300
And when you open up the envelope, you see the inside of a dorm room that is a crime

79
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,300
scene.

80
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:30,300
Police tape is up and there are little, like, placards, you know, for evidence all over

81
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:36,820
the place and spray painted all over the walls and even, like, on the bed sheets and, like,

82
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:40,940
pillowcases and the desk and really anything.

83
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:50,820
Spray painted on there is 1-5-2-2-5-1-8-1-9-5-5-1-8.

84
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:51,820
I decoded that.

85
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,460
What's it say, Keith?

86
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,460
It says overseer.

87
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:58,020
Oh, that's what they called you.

88
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,900
Remember that thing, that thing at the funeral?

89
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,100
Yeah, the creepy thing.

90
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:06,140
Look at those numbers and I think that's what it called you.

91
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,340
That can't be right.

92
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,460
How, that wouldn't make...

93
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:15,020
What's stranger about that than, you know, anything we've experienced since the start

94
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:19,340
of this podcast?

95
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:23,100
Clark and I look at Leon.

96
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,100
I look at Leon too.

97
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,100
I look at you.

98
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,860
Why won't nobody look at me?

99
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:32,740
Leon, can you just, can you just tell him?

100
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:38,100
Keith, John, if you guys take the dorm room, Clark and I will head around to the other

101
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:41,980
side and get into the administration building.

102
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:44,180
Do you think I'm the overseer?

103
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,180
Yes.

104
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:48,540
What does that mean to you?

105
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:54,140
Clark, it's better not to think about it too much right now as it seems to be...

106
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,140
I don't know.

107
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,140
I was just telling Keith here.

108
00:06:56,140 --> 00:07:01,620
I don't know if I believe in destiny anymore, but if the prophecies are true, then you will

109
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:06,060
eventually start the circle of knowledge in the past.

110
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,380
That sounds right.

111
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:10,980
Your old wizard self is running all over the fucking place in time, so...

112
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:14,820
Remember that book you found that had the drawing in it?

113
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:18,580
If Leon's right, that's, I think that's you.

114
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:24,300
Clark is doing what I'm doing now, sitting in stunned silence, mulling it all over.

115
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,140
Why'd you tell that girl to kill herself, man?

116
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,020
Do you remember what was written in that book?

117
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:30,540
It is only in death that he may rise again.

118
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:31,540
Yeah.

119
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:32,540
Horseshoes and hand grenades.

120
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:33,900
What did it actually say?

121
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:37,100
It is only through death that he may rise again.

122
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,100
Oh.

123
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,100
Pretty much nailed it.

124
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,740
Yeah, that was real good without consulting notes or anything.

125
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:44,520
I don't know why you ribbed him on that.

126
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,300
So do we have to kill Clark or...

127
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,540
No, no, God no.

128
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,740
I mean, Clark is our greatest asset.

129
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:53,140
I didn't know anything about that starting the circle thing, but Maggie did tell me that

130
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:57,080
that's kind of the whole point of the circle of knowledge, wasn't it to bring about the

131
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,080
Overseer?

132
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,080
Isn't that what she told me?

133
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:07,740
In a way, yes, but it's a matter of the end-of-the-world scenario that we've heard is perhaps coming

134
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:13,980
can pretty much only be stopped by the Overseer, so we're really hoping that you show up later

135
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:14,980
now.

136
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:18,460
Clark throws up.

137
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,500
The world?

138
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,500
It's just the world.

139
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,980
Hey, you got this, buddy.

140
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:25,340
Leon, there's a huge flaw here in this whole thing.

141
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,340
I don't do magic.

142
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,340
I don't know how to do magic.

143
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,100
Do you know how to do magic?

144
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,100
No.

145
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,860
I didn't even know magic was the thing until I saw Old Me.

146
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:36,200
You obviously do in the past when your future self creates it.

147
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,620
Does the circle know magic?

148
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,700
Can you teach me to do magic?

149
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,080
It's not really magic.

150
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,080
I've never seen...

151
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,380
Where is your sense of wonder, Leon?

152
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:48,380
Honestly, I've seen too much to wonder about anything anymore.

153
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:49,880
Have you talked to the Old Me?

154
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:54,000
Do you know that Old Me has been sticking his hands in our daily lives for the last

155
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
few days?

156
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
No, what?

157
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,920
Have you seen the video of the monkey who sticks his whole hand up a pug's butthole?

158
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,360
Yes, but hold on, what was the other thing?

159
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,520
That's what he's been doing to us.

160
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:08,160
I watch that every night before I go to sleep, but I haven't seen...

161
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,160
You're saying that...

162
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:13,900
Like John said, like a monkey sticking its whole hand up a pug's butthole.

163
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:17,680
He's been messing in our business, and we jump like that pug.

164
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,680
We don't like it.

165
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:31,240
What rude monkey is Old Clark?

166
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,160
What do you know about that?

167
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:39,960
I mean, obviously I know a lot about the monkey pug asshole stuff, but I'm very curious to

168
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:44,800
hear about the ways in which Old Clark has put his fist inside of you.

169
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,800
Don't get weird with it.

170
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,120
No, no, no, you know what I mean.

171
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,680
Just follow along with in the game we're playing.

172
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,700
It seems as though he's been helping us in sort of indiscriminate ways.

173
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:57,320
He tried to warn us a long time ago when none of us were around.

174
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:01,240
He went and talked to Drew and told him something terrible was going to happen.

175
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,240
That was Old Clark?

176
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,240
It wasn't me.

177
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,640
I thought that was just a double.

178
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,320
Well, if he's time traveling, I guess it could be a younger but not the oldest.

179
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,400
Oh, man.

180
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,400
These are ancient mysteries.

181
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,680
I don't know how it works.

182
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,560
We saw him in the mausoleum too.

183
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,760
He did something to us.

184
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,760
What do you mean?

185
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,380
I show whichever one.

186
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,380
What's on my chest again?

187
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,380
Marvin.

188
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,380
Marvin.

189
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,380
And it's crossed out.

190
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:24,380
What's on my hand?

191
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:25,380
Tildy.

192
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,380
I'm going to show him that one.

193
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,360
He branded us with a name.

194
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:33,200
He branded you with a metal hot stick or like a spell.

195
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,880
And I hold out my hand too.

196
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,620
I hold out my, no, I'm not going to slap him.

197
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:41,240
I hold out my hand.

198
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,240
Look real close.

199
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,240
Watch the birdie.

200
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,720
I hold out the opposite hand to the one they're holding and then smack me with the other one.

201
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,440
It hurts really bad when you hit him with the one that's painted.

202
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,440
I don't hit him.

203
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,840
I just solemnly hold my hand up with the others.

204
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:57,040
I don't, I can't, the only thing I can assume is it was magic.

205
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,720
He held up a scroll.

206
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,720
Joe's asking that.

207
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:03,520
I think he held up a scroll and the words alighted and then we blacked out.

208
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:08,440
Yeah, he held up some kind of parchment and the words lit up and we blacked out.

209
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,440
I just assumed it was magic of some kind.

210
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:14,460
Yeah, I don't know what to call it, but the world definitely doesn't play by the rules

211
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:20,020
that we believed and were taught that it did and part of the circle of knowledge is

212
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:26,900
keeping that truth a secret from the general public because the minute that this goes wide,

213
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:27,900
chaos will ensue.

214
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:31,520
Not if he's like regulated, like set up a Hogwarts.

215
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,060
That is an extremely good point, Jon.

216
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,060
Thank you.

217
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,060
Maybe season two.

218
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:42,980
Yeah, fuck yeah, Jon as Dumbledore, right in on the discord if you want to see that.

219
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:47,020
If you don't think that the overseer would be Dumbledore, then I don't know what to tell

220
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,020
you.

221
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:50,540
Wouldn't the overseer be doing more important stuff?

222
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,540
He's Voldemort.

223
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,540
Yeah.

224
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:56,460
I touched your kids and I'm pretty sure they touched me too.

225
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,500
Leon, Dewey Cox.

226
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,060
We uh, that's Dewey Jack Black.

227
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,060
Dewey Finn.

228
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,060
Fuck.

229
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,060
Sorry.

230
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:08,820
Leon, we have other names, not embroidered, we have other names written on us.

231
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,660
Clark shoots, uh, Kila Glantz.

232
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:11,660
Yeah, I don't.

233
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:12,660
I sure don't.

234
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,340
Nevermind.

235
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:19,460
Well, you guys seem to be having some inner turmoil here, which will lead me to my point.

236
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:20,640
We are running out of time.

237
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,640
We need to get in here.

238
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,940
We need to make this quick.

239
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:25,420
So, my plan split up.

240
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:29,460
Two of you and two of us and we'll get this taken care of.

241
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:36,240
All right now, Keith and Jon, I think you guys have the best chance at going in and

242
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,900
figuring out what happened in the dorm room.

243
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,900
Talk to her roommate.

244
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,820
Talk to anyone who is friends with her.

245
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,200
Try to get the run down.

246
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:48,620
They will have already been talked to by the city police, so you're going to have to convince

247
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:51,980
them that there's a reason that you're re-interviewing them.

248
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:58,060
Clark, we're going to go ahead and sneak into the administration building and pull files.

249
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,060
All right?

250
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:02,140
Uh, I guess if you say so, if you think that's best.

251
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:05,780
That's what, I don't even know what, what are we, what are we doing, Leon?

252
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:06,780
What's going on?

253
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:11,780
We need to figure out if Harriet Marks is the beginning of this or if she passed it

254
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:13,780
on whatever it is.

255
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,940
Do you have an inkling on what it is?

256
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:19,140
Well, it seems to pass from person to person.

257
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:25,680
Perhaps, you know, Bruce Robin quote unquote got it, whatever it is from Harriet Marks.

258
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,300
She got it or whatever it is from the Overseer.

259
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,300
You guys.

260
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,300
Are you saying it follows?

261
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,140
I mean, it seems to pass.

262
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:34,940
Wait, you know that Harriet got it from the Overseer?

263
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:37,900
Look at the, look at the numbers all over a dorm room.

264
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,420
Any points of the pictures that are in your lap?

265
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,420
Oh.

266
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:45,660
So it gives the name of the last person who had it, is that the theory?

267
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,780
We were writing down Bruce.

268
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:48,780
What was Bruce writing down?

269
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:49,780
He was writing down Harriet.

270
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:50,780
Got it.

271
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:51,780
I see what you're saying.

272
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:52,780
And Harriet was writing the Overseer.

273
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:56,660
It's just a theory, but if it starts with the Overseer, we need to figure out why you

274
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:57,660
made this happen.

275
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,420
I mean, I didn't.

276
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:03,620
I understand that it's not you, but we need to figure out why future past you made this

277
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,620
happen.

278
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:10,580
Let's call him Clark, Clark, Clark, old, let's call him Clark old just so I don't feel like

279
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:13,260
you guys are accusing me of shit I didn't do.

280
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:18,340
No, old dick is really good, but let's stick with Clark old.

281
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:21,660
I mean, how do you expect us to find that out?

282
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,180
Your cops do your interrogation work.

283
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:28,020
From what I've heard, you guys are real good at putting guns in people's faces and making

284
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,020
them talk.

285
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,020
I point my gun in his face.

286
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:32,060
I'm like, you don't know a goddamn thing about us.

287
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,100
And he just keeps talking.

288
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,460
I got an idea, fellas.

289
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:40,180
If you take a picture of me and use a filter to oldify me, then you got a picture of me.

290
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,140
Ask if people have seen him around.

291
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,140
Face app.

292
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,140
I snap a pic.

293
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,260
I smile real big.

294
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,260
Snap a pic.

295
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:50,060
GRUS8 is definitely going to get in on this.

296
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:52,060
That's the, uh, nevermind.

297
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:54,740
I'm going to cut that.

298
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:57,300
Sorry about the Internet Research Agency.

299
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,220
Some Delta Green lore.

300
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:01,220
Oh, great.

301
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,220
Okay.

302
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:06,780
Well, I guess, uh, should we go to, go to her door?

303
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:07,780
You killed the vibe, nerd.

304
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:08,780
I know.

305
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:18,380
All right, get the fuck out of my, come on, let's, uh, let's, let's make this happen,

306
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,380
captain.

307
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,380
Okay.

308
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,380
I mean, I guess let's go to her dorm then, John.

309
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,380
I'm following you.

310
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,380
All right.

311
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,380
Let's split up.

312
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:43,140
Hey Joe, Clark is sitting in the back of the car.

313
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:48,820
John Lee Pettymore and Keith Vigna get out, start walking toward the dorm.

314
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:53,740
Leon puts the car in reverse and starts driving out of the parking lot.

315
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:58,940
I need you to roll either a human or an alertness, whichever is higher.

316
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:02,540
My alertness is higher.

317
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:03,700
I crit pass.

318
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,700
I crit pass.

319
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,700
I got a one.

320
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,860
I got a zero zero one.

321
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,660
I got a 33.

322
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:12,660
That's fucking wild.

323
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:13,660
Is a one better than a 33?

324
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:14,900
I think a one is better than a 33.

325
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:15,900
It sounds like it should be better to me.

326
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:19,740
I think a one is like the ultimate crit.

327
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,020
I'm so sorry, Zach.

328
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,220
I don't know how I do it.

329
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:26,020
You do never, hey, never apologize.

330
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,300
Never apologize, baby.

331
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,820
All right, shit.

332
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:29,820
Are you ready for this?

333
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:32,060
I know, but go.

334
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:41,700
You notice Leon's free hand is reaching and he grabs a gun out from under the shotgun

335
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:47,980
seat, like in between the console and the shotgun seat, and he's moving it to aim it

336
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:48,980
at you.

337
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,740
And it's not a normal gun.

338
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:53,980
It looks like the tranq gun that he gave you earlier.

339
00:16:53,980 --> 00:17:01,100
So instead of him just firing it into you, we are now going to roll against each other,

340
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,220
depending on what you want to do.

341
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:06,900
Well, I would like to kick the back of his chair to throw the aim of the gun off.

342
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:07,900
Fantastic.

343
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:12,980
So you're going to roll unarmed combat and he's going to roll at a negative 40 of firearms

344
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:16,900
and we'll see how this plays out.

345
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,620
He's got a 80% in firearms.

346
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,180
No, sorry, 70.

347
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:22,100
So he's going to go down to 30.

348
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:28,380
I'm going to use brand new dice that I've never touched before.

349
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:32,060
I got a straight 30 on a 70.

350
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:34,540
You beat him.

351
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:41,660
He fires and you see a little dart goes right into the headrest of the middle seat right

352
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:42,940
next to you.

353
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:44,500
And it is your turn to act.

354
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,340
I want to wrestle the gun away from his hand.

355
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:50,340
And as I'm doing so saying, what the fuck, Leon, what the fuck?

356
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:54,020
All right, let's roll an unarmed combat check.

357
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,020
I fail.

358
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,020
I failed too.

359
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,020
I got a 91.

360
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,020
I got a 94.

361
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:03,260
So that's just fail on fail.

362
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:07,220
So he continues driving without a wrecking.

363
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:13,160
However, the gun is just like being wildly moved back and forth and you've got two hands

364
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:17,380
on his arm and he is trying to muscle back on you.

365
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,860
It's his turn.

366
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:22,180
And he is going to try to wrestle the gun away from you.

367
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:24,180
So roll it up again, baby.

368
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:27,300
I got a five.

369
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:30,780
I crit on different dice.

370
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:31,900
These are different dice.

371
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,460
I don't think I've ever used these either.

372
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,460
It's a 33.

373
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,460
Okay.

374
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,460
You have full control over the situation.

375
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:37,460
What do you do?

376
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:41,540
I rip the gun out of his hand and I pointed at the back of his head.

377
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:42,540
Leon.

378
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:43,540
Yeah.

379
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:44,540
What the fuck?

380
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,780
I just thought it'd be easier if you weren't conscious for this next part.

381
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:48,780
Please don't.

382
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,260
Did you want me unconscious?

383
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,260
Yeah.

384
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:53,620
There's a star.

385
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:54,940
Is he still driving while we're talking?

386
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,260
He is still driving while you're talking.

387
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,520
Can I tell where he's going?

388
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,580
Has he left campus?

389
00:18:58,580 --> 00:18:59,580
He hasn't.

390
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,160
No, it's a, it's a pretty big campus.

391
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:05,580
So he's just like driving slowly through these stop signs and stuff.

392
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:08,980
I was just doing that for the best.

393
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:15,440
So, okay, so you are, you are essentially, I know this sucks, but I've got a lot riding

394
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:20,360
on you in the future and I thought it would be safest if you weren't around for this next

395
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:25,920
little bit because what if we run into issues like the whole time we were running through

396
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:32,400
the bar court place, I was horrified that a stray bullet or something ends all of this.

397
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:37,000
And if you die, maybe the world ends like I don't know, but I need to protect you at

398
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
all costs.

399
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,200
But Leon, if you're saying that the overseer started the circle and I am the overseer,

400
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,400
that means I live through all this.

401
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,400
I'm untouchable.

402
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,120
The, I don't know if the future and the past work.

403
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,960
I don't know how any of this works.

404
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:58,160
Roll a human for me, I fail a 42 on a 30.

405
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,160
I just don't know.

406
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,160
I don't know.

407
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,320
I don't know how any of this works and I have to keep you safe.

408
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,320
Listen to me, Leon.

409
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:07,160
I've started to think that maybe this overseer business sounds pretty good to me.

410
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:11,660
And if you're saying that I have bulletproof armor, cause I start the circle, I'm not saying

411
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:15,360
that you are saying that I start the circle in the past.

412
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,080
So I think I'm going to be dandy.

413
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,720
I think I'm going to get out of this unscathed.

414
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,720
You on the other hand, might want to keep your head down, cause I don't remember Leon

415
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,280
being Clark Old's right hand man.

416
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:30,280
Hey, Leon, from here on out, I'm on your side, but I want involved.

417
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,680
You don't get to knock me out and sideline me like that.

418
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,160
Okay, that's fair.

419
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,720
Oh, Clark.

420
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,920
We, uh, we gotta go to the camp.

421
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,920
It's time.

422
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,920
The camp?

423
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,920
Yeah, we gotta go to...

424
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,360
Joe's gonna say, is it the calm, comfy campground?

425
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,480
We gotta go to the calm, comfy campground.

426
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,480
Yeah, boy.

427
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,240
Aren't you proud of me?

428
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,360
I'm super proud of you.

429
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,660
Zach, I remember that without even looking at notes.

430
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,320
You get 10 luck.

431
00:20:55,320 --> 00:21:00,660
Yeah, that's what I was fishing for.

432
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:05,640
But first, do you actually, let's go back to what you just said a few moments ago.

433
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:10,720
Do you actually believe that you're like indestructible?

434
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,120
It's all I've been presented with so far.

435
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,440
Yeah, I think so.

436
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:19,520
How competent do you feel with these other two solving this situation here at CSU?

437
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:26,280
I mean, key's always a big question mark in my life, but maybe working together they can

438
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,280
figure something out.

439
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,480
I don't know.

440
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,480
You know what?

441
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,480
Let's...

442
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:38,800
I am curious, Clark, and he turns the car back and heads up to...

443
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:42,480
You actually see a sign on the building that you're heading directly towards and it's the

444
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:47,520
administrative building, which is where you guys were originally planning on going.

445
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,520
It's where he said you guys were originally planning on going.

446
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,720
Before he tried to kidnap me.

447
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,720
Uh-huh!

448
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,720
Yeah!

449
00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:01,520
Before that happened, he's like, no hard feelings on that, by the way, I just, you know, I'm

450
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,080
doing my job and I...

451
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:10,920
But honestly, if you can prove what's happening here, I mean, I would be, I'll help, I'm interested.

452
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,000
Let's just do this.

453
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,520
Let's fucking go for it.

454
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,560
And he pulls up to the spot right next to the door and...

455
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:21,440
So you're saying we're not gonna go to the comfy campgrounds then?

456
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,880
No, we absolutely will.

457
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,660
We'll just take care of this first, because I want to see if you can.

458
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:31,240
If you can, then I, you know, that'll be just incredible.

459
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,240
And then we can head over there.

460
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,160
It's not time sensitive then.

461
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:38,560
It is, but I have a feeling that we've already got a timer on this situation.

462
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,920
All right, Leon, I'll follow your lead.

463
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,920
I like that.

464
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,920
How does he get out?

465
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:47,440
Yeah, and I think you might be, he relinquished the gun to you.

466
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,920
Well, I definitely didn't give it back.

467
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,920
Yeah.

468
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,920
He hasn't asked for it, you mean?

469
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,920
No, he hasn't asked for it.

470
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,920
Yeah.

471
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:53,920
Okay.

472
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,920
Yeah, I'm gonna just hold on to it.

473
00:22:54,920 --> 00:23:17,360
John Lee Pettymore and Keith Vigna get out of the car that Clark Bishop and Leon Simpson

474
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,360
were in.

475
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:23,920
And you guys look out at the campus of CSU, City State University, and the entire thing

476
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:27,160
is riddled with holiday spirit.

477
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:31,880
There are decorations covering everything.

478
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,760
Like say a holiday decoration.

479
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,760
Wreath.

480
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:39,480
Yeah, there's a big wreath that's just like on the dorm building right in front of you.

481
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,480
Lights.

482
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,480
Oh yeah.

483
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,480
Oh, you know there's lights.

484
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,520
There's like an absurd amount of Christmas lights.

485
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:49,760
They're on every single building up the walls and on every tree on campus as well.

486
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,640
It's actually, it's quite pretty.

487
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,640
Inflatable minion.

488
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,320
There's an inflatable minion.

489
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,160
It's a wave.

490
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:01,540
It's Derek and it's wearing the Christmas hat.

491
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:02,540
What is that called?

492
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:03,540
Santa hat?

493
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:04,540
Santa hat.

494
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:06,660
It's wearing a Christmas hat.

495
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:11,240
And yeah, it's arms are just like the only thing that's moving on it.

496
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:15,000
What is the mascot of City State University?

497
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,240
The mascot of City State University.

498
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,760
Yeah, that was the question he asked.

499
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:26,360
What was the mascot of City State University?

500
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,880
I'm assuming you have this written down.

501
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,880
Just control F mascot.

502
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:34,160
Oh yeah, let me just look it up on my computer real quick.

503
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,880
It is a Venus fly trap.

504
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,880
Cool.

505
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,880
That's a native to North Carolina.

506
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,900
Well, you don't know where we are.

507
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,360
Not North Carolina though, right?

508
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,240
Probably not, but it's native to the city.

509
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,800
Tigers aren't from Detroit, so.

510
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,960
Tigers are not from Detroit, Thomas.

511
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,640
I know at least three tigers that are.

512
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,280
Anyway, wow, this place is Christmassed out.

513
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,080
This is a good podcast, guys.

514
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,080
Are there trees?

515
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:06,520
Okay, so you get past the Christmas decorations and you have been given directions to go to

516
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:13,680
the dorm room of Harriet Marks, which is 328 Giff's house.

517
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:17,080
And actually you see this building that is right in front of you.

518
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:24,760
It has a sign on it that in big capital letters it says Giff's house, G-I-F-F-S.

519
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:30,800
And the building is covered in a massive wreath that is lousy with lights.

520
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,480
Let's go in there up to the third floor, I'm assuming.

521
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,480
Room 328.

522
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:40,480
When you guys go into Giff's house, you see that all the lights are out.

523
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:45,160
Hey real quick, do you know how I already knew how that was spelled before you told

524
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,160
us?

525
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,560
If it had only had one F, you would have said it wrong.

526
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,560
That's an opinion.

527
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:57,840
So you guys were going into Giff's house and the lights are out.

528
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:02,960
On your right there is a secretary's desk and there's a computer.

529
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,360
The glow of the computer screen is the only light in this room, but you can make out from

530
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:12,400
there that to your left there's like a sitting area with a baby grand piano and ahead of

531
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:19,120
you there is a glass wall of windows with a door leading into that room and then from

532
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,320
there there's a hallway that breaks off and it goes left and right.

533
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,160
Baby grand piano is my pop star name.

534
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,920
Ooh, that's really good.

535
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,920
Yeah it is.

536
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,920
Is the secretary there?

537
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:33,040
No, there's no one in this room at all.

538
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:40,080
Is there a fire escape plan on the wall to see if we can locate 321 or 328 without?

539
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:44,120
Yeah absolutely, so you've got stairwells on either side of the building and an elevator

540
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,120
in the middle.

541
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,520
I'd like to see if I can access this computer.

542
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,520
Sure.

543
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,520
Yeah, you can hop on there.

544
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,520
Any good stuff?

545
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:54,840
Oh, there's a directory you can find out that when you look up Harriet Marks, she lives

546
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,840
in 328.

547
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:02,560
Her roommate's name is Amelia Locke and right across the hall is 330 Giff's house, which

548
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:05,260
is listed as show dorm.

549
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:10,000
Like one they show to prospective students on tours, yes.

550
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,760
Let's go up there and see if we can find anything, probably need to talk to Amelia

551
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,760
too.

552
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:21,720
Or sidebar, we change our clothes, we go crash in that show dorm until somebody realizes

553
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:27,920
what's up and we just do a whole spin-off where Keith and John Lee Pettymore go to college.

554
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,520
You know what, I like that idea.

555
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,520
Spin-off!

556
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:35,320
I certainly never went to college unless it says otherwise on my character sheet.

557
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,560
No, I went to...

558
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:39,720
Oh no, I went here.

559
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,560
Does it remind you of the good old days?

560
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,800
It does, I want to go back.

561
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,720
Well, I think we should get this investigation out of the way first.

562
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:49,280
Actually, I have written down City University, which I imagine is City State University's

563
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,280
intense crosstown rival.

564
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,280
It absolutely is.

565
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,280
Yeah, it's their big rival.

566
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,440
No, I hate fucking CSU scum.

567
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,440
Yeah, you're a poinsettia.

568
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,440
Yeah!

569
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,440
Well, I always wanted to come here because...

570
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,440
Point!

571
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,440
Poinsettia!

572
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,440
City University leads the way!

573
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,440
Nice!

574
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,440
That's our fight song.

575
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,520
I walk to where the elevator is.

576
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:15,080
And the elevator door opens as the light emits from the elevator into the hallway that

577
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,080
you're in.

578
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,980
And you can also see it from the light on the vending machines behind you.

579
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:26,200
The walls and the floor of this space are completely covered in numbers, like absolutely

580
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,420
riddled in numbers.

581
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:32,300
So many different sequences of numbers, in fact, that you can't make out any specific

582
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,300
single sequence.

583
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:34,680
What are they written with?

584
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,040
All sorts of materials.

585
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:44,200
We've got Sharpie, paint, spray paint, blood, cum, piss, like there seems to be a smear

586
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,640
of shit on the wall at some point.

587
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,160
Tell me more about the cum numbers.

588
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:54,120
So the cum numbers, they're dripping, and they were dripping, now they're coagulated

589
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,160
in place.

590
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,680
Is there a dorm room near us?

591
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,680
Just any dorm room?

592
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,680
There's actually not, no.

593
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:03,120
Well, damn, do you think people are still living in this dorm room, or in this dorm

594
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,120
hall?

595
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,120
I have no idea.

596
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:09,040
I'm not able to clean this, literally this shit up, but I don't know.

597
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,600
What dorm room are we in her dorm room?

598
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:16,120
No, you were about to get into the elevator from the main floor up to the third floor,

599
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:22,140
but you do see that when you turn to look into the elevator, in the corner that would

600
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:29,040
be out of sight when the elevator door first opened, there is a slumped over body of a

601
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,040
student.

602
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:34,600
And the head has been smashed.

603
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:42,360
Her face is no longer a face, it seems to have been hit repeatedly in the forehead and

604
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,360
nose.

605
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,120
What the fuck kind of hell dorm is this?

606
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,600
I don't know, but uh.

607
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,320
If John Lee Pettymark could roll a sanity check for me.

608
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:52,200
Yeah, John, you probably shouldn't be looking at that.

609
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,200
Fail.

610
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,520
Go ahead and lose one sanity.

611
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,520
We're getting there.

612
00:29:56,520 --> 00:30:01,520
I go over and turn the body over, look for like a, is there a purse on this person?

613
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,880
Do you see that there is a fanny pack on this person?

614
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,480
I'm gonna dig through and find identification.

615
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:11,120
Yeah, her name was Samantha Carter.

616
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,120
Poor Samantha.

617
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:15,600
Well, good thing it wasn't Amelia, because that's who I'm wanting to talk to.

618
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,320
And I hit the third floor button in the elevator.

619
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,920
Alright, and Thomas, if you could leave the room.

620
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,920
Before we do that, can you tell me what I found on the computer?

621
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:27,360
It was just the info for like who lived where.

622
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,760
Did you want to find anything else?

623
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,320
Yeah, like the answer to all these mysteries.

624
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:34,040
Oh yeah, the answer to all the mysteries isn't on there, unfortunately.

625
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,040
But there was a...

626
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,040
Wrong computer.

627
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,040
Is there a reason I'm not going with him?

628
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:42,560
There was a big, like, when you first got on the computer, the background for the entire

629
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:49,560
thing was a promotional ad, like a poster, for The Jingle Ball, taking place the night

630
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:52,640
of December 6th at CSU.

631
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:58,400
And it says, follow the scavenger hunt to make your way to The Jingle Ball.

632
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,580
Is December 6th the night that...

633
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:01,580
That's the night.

634
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:02,580
Okay.

635
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:04,120
And do we know what date Harriet died?

636
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,120
December 2nd.

637
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,120
Okay.

638
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,880
So is there a reason I'm not going up the elevator with him?

639
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,880
Yes.

640
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,880
Okay.

641
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,880
I mean, we would have gone up together, right?

642
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,880
Yep.

643
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,880
Okay.

644
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:23,760
Hey, Leon?

645
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:27,200
Yeah.

646
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:32,160
Got your gun here.

647
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,160
Yeah, I know.

648
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,760
Is this these, those mind control darts?

649
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:41,040
He looks at you with like a grimace, like he's about to burp, like I just did.

650
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,040
No.

651
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:46,080
What would they have done to me?

652
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,200
Probably fall asleep for a while.

653
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,500
How long's a while?

654
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,500
Not too long.

655
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,500
I'm going to hold on to it then.

656
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:54,680
I don't want you sneaking up behind me and doing it, trying to do it again.

657
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,160
That seems fair.

658
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,840
And I don't want to do that to you now.

659
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:05,220
I mean, if you're willing to, you seem down for the cause and with your current knowledge,

660
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:06,720
I think that we're good.

661
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,720
All right.

662
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:10,040
Let's find out what we can about the...

663
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,040
It was Harriet Marks.

664
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,800
That's what we were looking for, right?

665
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,800
Harriet Marks.

666
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,120
Let's see what we can find out.

667
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:21,760
And you guys open up the door and now I want to paint a picture for you, Joe.

668
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,720
When you're walking on this campus, it's fucking dead.

669
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,200
Like it's evening.

670
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:31,920
The sun is going down currently, but there is no one on this campus.

671
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:38,180
It's just kind of, it's Saturday, you know, but it's still a college campus and there

672
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:43,220
are holiday themed decorations obliterating this place.

673
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:50,340
It's almost as if someone like vomited delicious holiday spirit all over for a block square

674
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:52,260
of the city.

675
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:56,180
It's filthy with holiday stuff.

676
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,260
Just dirty with it.

677
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,340
It's dirty with it.

678
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:01,300
It's lousy with Christmas gear.

679
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:08,860
It's like tiny Santa clauses everywhere and menorah, like blow up menorah, just like in

680
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:11,240
a yard in front of one of the dorms.

681
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,820
It's all over the place.

682
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:13,820
It's great.

683
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:14,820
If you love Christmas...

684
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,180
How does Clark feel about Christmas?

685
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:17,780
Does he have good memories?

686
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:18,980
Oh shit.

687
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:20,140
That's a good question.

688
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:25,860
He probably has early good memories right up until his old parents didn't have Christmas

689
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:26,980
for him no more.

690
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:30,580
No more Christmas for old Clark Bishop, or young Clark Bishop.

691
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:32,700
A young Clark Bishop still had no Christmas.

692
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,020
Old young Clark Bishop.

693
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:36,420
I think you nailed it.

694
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:40,420
The technical name of your character at this point in the show.

695
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:46,620
So when you guys walk in, the administration office is actually open, but inside all the

696
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:50,500
lights are off and there's seemingly no one in here.

697
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,340
Do we know what time of day it is right now?

698
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:54,020
The sun is going down.

699
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,460
It's about golden hour.

700
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:57,820
It's yay around golden hour.

701
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:59,060
Cool.

702
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,060
Take a picture.

703
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,580
It looks beautiful.

704
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:02,580
Yeah, you and...

705
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:03,580
It must be.

706
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:06,220
You and Leon could take a great selfie right now.

707
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:08,420
Leon, Leon, hang on a sec.

708
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:09,420
Yeah.

709
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,740
Gotta take a picture with you.

710
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:13,380
Well, it's golden hour.

711
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:16,780
We look great in front of all this Christmas stuff.

712
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:22,740
Okay, so we're gonna go into where they have all the files.

713
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:23,740
I don't know.

714
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:25,340
I don't know how colleges work.

715
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:27,300
And so let's just hop in there and see what happens.

716
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:35,900
So you guys turn a corner in this unlit corridor and about halfway down the hallway, you see

717
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:42,820
two figures and one of them, you just hear this like voice that is repeatedly just going

718
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:43,820
like, please.

719
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:50,420
Oh gosh, I would love to four if you just mumble some other words and is like letters

720
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:54,460
and stuff and numbers and is like, please just hit me, hit me, hit me.

721
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,460
Oh God.

722
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,300
I'll have to do it to myself.

723
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,460
He's talking to another figure that I can't see either.

724
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:05,340
Yeah, and the other figure is just staring, just like standing there, not really moving.

725
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:08,980
I nudge Leon, they're saying numbers.

726
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:09,980
Is it the number stuff?

727
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:10,980
I don't know.

728
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:11,980
What do you want to do?

729
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:12,980
Are they totally in our way?

730
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:18,300
Well, and then you guys look over and there's a sign and it says like office and there's

731
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,560
an arrow pointing directly toward them.

732
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,540
We're both still wearing police uniforms, aren't we?

733
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:23,540
Yeah.

734
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:24,540
Sure, we'll approach them.

735
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:26,140
We'll find the records office, right?

736
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,140
Yeah, yeah.

737
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:28,140
Perfect.

738
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:30,140
I'll go get Justin from the other room.

739
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:54,500
Luke, as Keith Vigna and John Lee Pettymore stand in the elevator, the elevator door closes

740
00:35:54,860 --> 00:36:02,220
and John Lee Pettymore pulls a Sharpie out and begins writing a sequence of numbers.

741
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:04,200
I just watch him and see what they are.

742
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:09,500
On the elevator wall and it is the numbers that you have seen him write and heard him

743
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,500
chant.

744
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,500
Right.

745
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,500
Bruce Robin.

746
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,500
Bruce Robin.

747
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:16,360
The elevator door opens and you are on the third floor.

748
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:22,140
It is also completely dark, the lights are all out and it is silent.

749
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:24,900
I get my phone out to light the hallway.

750
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:28,780
I guess I'll grab John and kind of just drag him behind me.

751
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:34,040
Yeah, and when he can't write anymore he just starts murmuring those numbers over and over.

752
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:37,220
Can I just like kind of slap him a little bit to see if he pops out of it?

753
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,220
He does not.

754
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:43,420
Okay, I'm looking for 328 on the placards on the walls and I'm leading John behind me.

755
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:48,460
Yeah, you make it down there and you're at 328 Giff's house.

756
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:49,460
Is it unlocked?

757
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:50,460
It is.

758
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:56,740
It is actually wide open as is the door across the hall, 330, which John told you was the

759
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:57,740
show dorm.

760
00:36:57,740 --> 00:37:01,260
Before I go into 328 I'm going to look into 330, what does it look like?

761
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:06,740
It looks like a very well presented dorm room for a college freshman.

762
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:10,260
There's lots of, what did I say the mascot was?

763
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,260
Venus Flytrap.

764
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:18,220
There's lots of Venus Flytrap apparel and paraphernalia all throughout this city state

765
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:20,740
dorm room with their logo all over.

766
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:26,580
And in the middle of the room there is one out of place Casio keyboard with a sheet of

767
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:27,700
music in front of it.

768
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:30,340
I'll pull John in behind me and shut the door.

769
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:31,340
Okay.

770
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:32,740
That way he doesn't escape somehow.

771
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:34,220
Are there numbers on the walls?

772
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:35,740
There are, yes.

773
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:39,420
There are numbers covering the walls, the floor, the ceiling, and literally like a desk.

774
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:41,300
Was that also in the hallway and stuff?

775
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,340
Yes, every single place that you've been so far.

776
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:45,900
Okay, I'm going to go and see what the music is.

777
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:50,780
A set of music notes written on the staff is pictures.

778
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:57,300
And the pictures are seven eggs, a golf ball, a cat, a demon, and an egg.

779
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:59,380
Are they like cartoons or?

780
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:00,380
They are.

781
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:07,940
And John Lee Pettymore begins writing once again on the back of the chair in this room.

782
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:10,220
Bruce Robin in numbers.

783
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:11,220
Is the keyboard on?

784
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,220
It is.

785
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:15,260
If I press on some keys is it just, what kind of sounds are they making?

786
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:16,900
Oh no, it's jingle bells.

787
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:20,700
It's like a, it's like ching, but it's a, I gotta, it's like cling.

788
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:21,980
How do, how do bells sound?

789
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:25,260
Like jingle bells are like chink, chink, chink, chink, chink, chink, chink, chink, chink.

790
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:26,880
So it's a, it's a shunk.

791
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,740
It's a shunk, but in a specific tone.

792
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:30,740
So poke around.

793
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:33,340
It's not like fart noises and like bleh, bleh, bleh.

794
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:34,340
No, no.

795
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:37,380
It's more like the, you know how they have like the choirs on there.

796
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:39,660
They're like lah, lah, lah.

797
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:44,940
I guess I'm going to take this sheet and put it in my pocket because I don't know what

798
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:45,940
it means right now.

799
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:46,940
Sure.

800
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:50,340
I guess I'll take one more look around and then I guess go over to 328.

801
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:51,340
Okay.

802
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:55,100
So looking around, the only thing that you would notice is like there's a window in this

803
00:38:55,100 --> 00:39:01,740
dorm room and looking out you can see the whole campus from here and it too is completely,

804
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:04,540
the whole campus is all festive.

805
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:06,820
Like there are lights up everywhere.

806
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:10,780
There's all these different decorations all over the place and in the middle of campus

807
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:12,860
there's a large old bell tower.

808
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:15,020
Is there a sheet for the dance in here?

809
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,020
The ball?

810
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,020
Like a flyer?

811
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:18,020
Yes.

812
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:19,020
Yeah.

813
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:20,020
There are multiple flyers.

814
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:23,180
Can I grab one and see like what is the like first clue or whatever on it?

815
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:26,380
Actually on the back of one of them, they're written in Sharpie.

816
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:34,460
It says one plus three plus nine plus and then it like has a bunch of math and then

817
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:39,420
it says equals three 30 which you would know is the room number that you're standing in.

818
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:41,460
What else does the like flyer say?

819
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:45,260
The flyer just says it's got a bunch of like pictures.

820
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:50,820
It's a lot of like illustration and design and then it says the annual jingle ball.

821
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:57,540
Follow the scavenger hunt in order to make your way to the night of your holiday season.

822
00:39:57,540 --> 00:40:01,980
If I look around, is there anything that like looks like a scavenger hunt list or anything?

823
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:02,980
Nope.

824
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:03,980
Okay.

825
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:05,200
I'm going to go head over to 328 then.

826
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,200
In 328?

827
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,200
With John and Toe.

828
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,200
Yeah, John's with you.

829
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,620
He's still doing the same dumb shit.

830
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:14,860
In 328 you would see, it's a similar scene.

831
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:21,260
There's shit written all over the place in all sorts of different materials and what

832
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:26,580
you already learned about Harriet Marks is that she is a pro-union activist.

833
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:33,820
There are pictures of her with different groups and different protests and marches and then

834
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:42,020
her roommate, you find out her name, Amelia Locke, and she has pictures of her with different

835
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:47,740
trophies and then you see actually she has all of her trophies displayed and they are

836
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:56,720
for riddle competitions and scavenger hunt competitions and there is a space on her desk

837
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,300
where a laptop would be.

838
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:04,380
Like you see where her connecting cable, like her power cord would normally plug in.

839
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:11,740
She's got the cord ready to plug in with one of those little DIY tricks with the binder clips.

840
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:14,300
Right, right.

841
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:19,860
And then you see like on the other side, the USB for her old school USB mouse is like clipped

842
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:24,420
in on the other side for the USB port on the opposite side of this laptop that is not there.

843
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:28,420
If I look around the room, is there any, can I find like a phone number or anything for

844
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:32,140
Roll search for me.

845
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:33,140
Eight on a forty.

846
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:37,500
Uh, yes, you find phone numbers for both Harriet Marks and Amelia Clarke.

847
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:38,500
Okay, I'm gonna...

848
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:39,500
Sorry.

849
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,500
Amelia Locke.

850
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:41,500
Right, not Amelia Earhart.

851
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,500
Correct.

852
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,700
Uh, I'll write those down and I'm gonna give Amelia a call.

853
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:46,700
Okay.

854
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:47,700
Bring bring!

855
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:48,700
And...

856
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:49,700
Bring bring!

857
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:50,700
That was Taylor.

858
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:51,700
Thank you everyone.

859
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:52,700
And it goes to voicemail.

860
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:54,260
Voicemail box is not set up.

861
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:55,900
Okay, put my phone away.

862
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:57,540
What were all the trophies for?

863
00:41:57,660 --> 00:42:00,860
Oh, yeah, Brittle Competitions and Scavenger Hunt Competitions.

864
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:08,340
With your correct search role, you actually find a handwritten note in the desk of Amelia

865
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:13,860
Clarke, where she is talking about Amelia Locke, right?

866
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:14,860
God damn it.

867
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:17,240
What did I say that time, Clarke?

868
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,700
Who is Amelia Clarke Bishop?

869
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:20,140
I don't know.

870
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:28,820
So Amelia Locke has a handwritten note in her desk where she is freehand writing her

871
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:35,840
views on the suicide of her roommate, Harriet Marks.

872
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:44,300
And basically nothing concrete, but she was very confused by the way it all went down.

873
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:49,980
I did not think that Harriet was the type of person who would commit suicide and said

874
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:54,740
that she had a plan to figure out what actually happened.

875
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:56,020
Okay, interesting.

876
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:57,500
Was it just on a scrap piece of paper?

877
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:58,500
It was, yeah.

878
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:01,780
Is there anything else in the desk that looks of interest?

879
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:02,780
Dildo.

880
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:04,700
I closed the desk.

881
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:06,980
Kind of red-faced.

882
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:11,180
Glad that Jon is kind of in that state so that I'm not more embarrassed than I would

883
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:12,180
be.

884
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:15,700
Is that like where Harriet's stuff was?

885
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:17,700
Can I search around her desk and stuff?

886
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:18,700
Absolutely.

887
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:21,180
Go ahead and roll another search check for me.

888
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:23,660
31 on a 40.

889
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:29,600
Written on a sticky note and tucked away in between other papers, you find something that

890
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,120
catches your eye.

891
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:36,460
You find a sticky note that has a to-do list written on it.

892
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:44,700
And the first thing says, research most unethical corporation in the city.

893
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:50,700
And the second mark on the to-do list says, who is the overseer?

894
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:36,300
How am I the only one trying to pull over How can I have enough drowning out of the

895
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:38,140
house?

896
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:39,140
No one knows.

897
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:40,140
There's no one home.

898
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:41,140
No one home.

899
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:41,140
