1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,920
Small beans.

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,720
Big beans.

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,760
Spicy beans.

4
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,400
Creamy beans.

5
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:11,440
Those are just a few of the kinds of beans that I love.

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,760
But you know which beans I love the most, do ya?

7
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:16,840
It's y'all.

8
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,960
It's your bean connoisseur, Wolf the Dog,

9
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:24,960
cooking up a bean stew with you, live from 694.2 PTBP.

10
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:30,680
Take your fart medicine, it's about to get gassy.

11
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:34,280
This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Dimitri the Bear,

12
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,720
who tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending pod.

13
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:41,800
A very simple, effective, and cherished action.

14
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:46,260
They write, dearest Elaine, this one goes out to you.

15
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,460
You've been my friend since longer than the time

16
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:53,800
when gas is swirled and supernovae shined.

17
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,240
You shared with me your feelings, thoughts, and toys,

18
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,880
and readily endured with me the joys

19
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,160
of Wolf the Dog and our contention boys.

20
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,480
Wow, Dimitri the Bear, it's nice to finally meet

21
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:10,500
another insert name, the animal.

22
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,480
We may be few, but we are powerful.

23
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,320
Ow!

24
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:18,640
Also, good poem or whatever.

25
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,940
But as a rancid poet, I am simply more clever.

26
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:26,380
Whenever you write to me again, you better think twice,

27
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:28,600
because when you'll step into Wolf,

28
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,300
buddy, you're on thin ice.

29
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:35,360
But I'll allow you just this once to shift the blame,

30
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,480
for I will not embarrass you,

31
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:41,160
not in front of your dearest Elaine.

32
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,180
This one here is another recap,

33
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:46,420
a map of the chaps madcap mishaps.

34
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:51,180
Snap to or I'll slap you, no nap, no cap.

35
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:54,500
Strap in and lap it up before we wrap it up.

36
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,700
It's kudzu with no backbone.

37
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:31,700
After the murder of both his brother, Ferguson Beans,

38
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:35,340
and his brother's partner's mother, Joan Robin,

39
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:39,160
Keith Vigna, back at Hotel Motel, dreamt

40
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,260
he stood at a bar, empty,

41
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,860
except for himself and the bartender.

42
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:47,220
The bar was run down, smelled of piss and vomit,

43
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:51,420
and looked to have been vacated quickly by other customers.

44
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,840
The man behind the bar was dressed in clothing

45
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,840
from the late 1800s, and spoke fearfully to Keith,

46
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:03,760
asking if he wanted answers or maybe cocaine.

47
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,040
Keith asked for the former,

48
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,480
as he'd had enough of the latter.

49
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,720
The saloon-style door swung open,

50
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,560
allowing the entrance of a woman Keith recognized.

51
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,240
In her hands was a massive trunk,

52
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,440
which she heaved onto the bar and opened.

53
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,400
Inside was the camera red light lit,

54
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,760
the gun also red light lit,

55
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,160
and the radio green light lit.

56
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,120
Seeing this, Keith told the woman

57
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,080
the camera wouldn't be ready until one,

58
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,200
and knowing the other two take a few days,

59
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,720
asked what he should do if they come for him.

60
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:46,360
As is the way with dreams, Mary was suddenly gone,

61
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:50,320
and the barkeep, Lloyd, pulled a corkscrew from his pocket

62
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,960
and held it on the bar in front of Keith, pointy side up.

63
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,380
Lloyd then slammed his head into the corkscrew

64
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:58,720
and held eye contact with Keith,

65
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,520
as little bits of cocaine fell out of the hole in his head.

66
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,320
Keith looked down and found the cocaine had fallen

67
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,520
in the pattern of a stick figure family.

68
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:12,520
He pulled out a $100 bill sporting the visage

69
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,680
of Abraham Lincoln, and snorted up

70
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,200
this little powder family.

71
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,240
As he did, Lloyd phased through the back of the bar

72
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,720
and out of sight.

73
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,560
Keith came to in his police cruiser,

74
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,040
pulling into the department parking lot.

75
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,960
He had been lost in the dream,

76
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,080
and also running over the gruesome details

77
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:39,080
of the murder-suicide he had just staged earlier

78
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,360
in the early morning between Joan, Robin,

79
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,780
and Ferguson Beans.

80
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:48,500
John Lee Pettymore IV was also dreaming,

81
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:52,220
dreaming he was rolling across the ground with ease,

82
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:55,860
ignoring a man in a fancy suit who mopped the floor

83
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:59,480
and mouth trumpeted along with Louis Armstrong.

84
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:03,300
Outside, the sky appeared dark and stormy.

85
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,920
John seemed to be inside a closed store,

86
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:09,060
but the door opened anyway, triggering the bell above.

87
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,500
John looked up to the figure in the doorway,

88
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:15,140
unable to identify them through the black cloak they wore,

89
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:20,140
and this figure dropped a massive book on the ground

90
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:23,860
before stumbling back into the night.

91
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:27,780
John's vision began to distort, and he became disoriented.

92
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:31,100
As it cleared, he found that he was a baby again,

93
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:34,260
sitting on the floor in the back of clinkers.

94
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:38,020
A young Gary Daley walked into the daycare at clinkers

95
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:41,900
and pulled a large leather tome from his pack.

96
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,420
He looked over his shoulder,

97
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:45,820
and turning his attention back to the book,

98
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:50,180
winced and ripped a page from the spine.

99
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:54,660
He paused, listened, and then stowed the book away

100
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:58,340
before approaching John with the stray page.

101
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:01,580
Daley pulled a knife from his bag and began to chant,

102
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:05,260
reading from the paper, the script on which seemed to spark

103
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:07,180
as he spoke the words.

104
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:10,180
He continued to chant as he drew blood from his thumb

105
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:13,000
and let it drip onto baby John.

106
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,840
The sparks began to engulf the paper,

107
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,640
and the flames danced around John's head

108
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,400
before disappearing.

109
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,360
Daley spoke to himself as he wiped the blood

110
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,280
from John's head.

111
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,440
"'Grandpa, you old kook, you old wizard,' he sighed.

112
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,100
"'I hope this does him good.

113
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,880
"'Well, two down, one to go.'"

114
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,460
Hey, hey, John, what are you thinking about?

115
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:40,160
John also came to as he pulled into

116
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,160
the contentioned police department parking lot,

117
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,680
riding shotgun in Drew's cherry-bread Mini Cooper.

118
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,640
Drew, terrified, drove while Rosemary sat in the back

119
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,520
with both the men's guns at the ready.

120
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,920
Clark dreamt he was running,

121
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,920
running because it was imperative that he run,

122
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:02,080
running because he was close,

123
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,880
because this was a chance to stop them.

124
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,360
He narrowly dodged oncoming traffic

125
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,400
upon realizing suddenly that he was on the highway.

126
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,200
He made it to the bridge, jumped,

127
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,720
and recognized he wouldn't make the water.

128
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,720
He braced for impact.

129
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,900
Clark's shinbone pushed through his kneecap,

130
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,120
but he continued to run,

131
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:25,400
trailing a stream of blood behind him.

132
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,600
Ahead, Clark saw his old nemesis

133
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:33,120
and remembered why the animals took refuge in the water.

134
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,960
He jumped in the creek himself,

135
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,080
ignoring the pain in his knee

136
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:42,080
and this black ooze followed along the shore.

137
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,840
From the river, Clark saw himself

138
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,840
in the window of his own house

139
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:50,280
and mustered up the strength to climb out from the river.

140
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,300
He called to himself from the backyard.

141
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:55,840
He told himself to run, to get the fuck out of there.

142
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,840
He told himself he could get it right this time.

143
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,560
Clark jolted awake in the back of the cab.

144
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,060
He noted a tightness in his chest

145
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:08,780
as the car turned into the parking lot of the contention PD.

146
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:13,400
It was December 5th, a foggy blustery day in contention.

147
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,420
An old Husky made its way down the road

148
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,940
and paused before fleeing

149
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:22,420
upon hearing the three cars approach.

150
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:25,820
The officers had a moment to judge each other's situations.

151
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:28,300
John turned and finally asked Rosemary's name,

152
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,460
eventually explaining that if she wants the gun,

153
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,940
Drew and John will need theirs back.

154
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,100
Rosemary agreed, but was quick to explain

155
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,940
that if she happened to go missing,

156
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:41,420
Marvin Glass would find and torture anyone

157
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:42,820
who might be connected.

158
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:45,220
The officers noted that a stranger's car

159
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:49,660
was parked in the lot, a red 2001 Mitsubishi Eclipse.

160
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:52,220
Clark admitted to the taxi driver he had no money,

161
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:56,500
but the cabbie explained the ride had been paid for already.

162
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,900
Upon stepping outside, the other two cops wondered

163
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:03,060
why Clark was dressed in pajamas.

164
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:06,900
Clark lied saying he'd been sleepwalking.

165
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:09,460
John smoothed things over between Rosemary

166
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,540
and his nervous partners while insisting

167
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:14,860
they would all soon be traveling to the city

168
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:18,260
to deliver the gun to Marvin Glass.

169
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:22,620
John reminded his partners of Jermaine and Alfred Glass.

170
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,860
Marvin's sons were trying to find the gun.

171
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:29,000
Given the officer's knowledge of the gun and the sons,

172
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,860
John suggested they might be in a good place

173
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:35,260
to do business with Marvin, essentially allying

174
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:38,420
the contention PD with the Glass crime family.

175
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,820
John thought that working together,

176
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:44,020
they might be able to use the gun to bring people back

177
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:46,160
from wherever they disappeared to.

178
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,780
They planned to leave for the city

179
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:50,500
as soon as the gun was in hand.

180
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,340
The officer circled back to a conversation about the husky,

181
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:57,260
the first animal they'd seen out of the water in days.

182
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:00,740
They decided to head into the station rather than follow it

183
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:04,540
when they remembered the strange sports car in their lot.

184
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:07,740
Keith looked into the red 2001 Mitsubishi Eclipse

185
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:11,320
and saw a massive container of creatine powder,

186
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:15,780
empty Red Bull cans, and a pair of Oakleys.

187
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,960
John, wielding two guns, kicked in the door to the station

188
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,440
and shouted the words,

189
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:24,340
"'Contention PD, freeze, douchebag.'"

190
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:27,380
A young man in a blue suit and red striped tie

191
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,860
had been pacing the floor of the department

192
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:32,180
and froze Red Bull in hand.

193
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:34,980
The man obediently dropped the beverage on the carpet

194
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:38,120
and invited the officers to take the FBI badge

195
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,520
from his jacket.

196
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,940
This was Agent Trent Chad.

197
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,540
As soon as Clark had the badge,

198
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,460
he tranquilized the agent with a dart

199
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,700
from the circle of knowledge

200
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:51,180
and Chad became immediately suggestible.

201
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:54,260
Clark's partners were suspicious of the dart gun,

202
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:58,000
but Clark explained that his previous night's detour

203
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,900
had informed him the FBI would arrive.

204
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:04,680
He couldn't give specifics, but this had all been expected.

205
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,460
As the officers decided what to do

206
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,940
with the tranquilized agent,

207
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:10,860
Drew arrived and saw that Chad had been digging

208
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,700
through the department's files.

209
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:16,140
When Agent Trent Chad suggested the three present officers

210
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,300
were some of the worst in history,

211
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:22,220
the crew asked if he had any experience in PR.

212
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:24,420
Chad had plenty of experience, it turned out,

213
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:27,580
so the officers devised an impromptu press conference

214
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,500
to calm the population.

215
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,460
They settled on a filmed statement

216
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,840
that confirmed everything was okay,

217
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,260
that the contention PD should be given room

218
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,800
to do what they need to do,

219
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,880
and that everything done so far

220
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,620
had been in the interest of the people.

221
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:45,300
Having filmed the statement, they told Agent Chad

222
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:49,140
to convey the same sentiments to his superiors.

223
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,160
As Clark moved to the back of the station

224
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,200
to retrieve his spare clothes,

225
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,080
he noticed the cells were empty.

226
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,800
Though the cell doors were locked,

227
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:02,160
Dr. Marie Jacobs and the body of Doug Jacobs had vanished.

228
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,840
Keith suggested they review the security footage.

229
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:10,160
This footage revealed the cat running wildly

230
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,000
about the station, jumping from spot to spot to spot.

231
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,680
The Jacobs' bodies and their cells were picked up

232
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,420
into the air and slammed into the ground repeatedly

233
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:25,260
by some unseen force before they disappeared.

234
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:28,340
The officers noticed the cat had been looking up

235
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,740
when it became scared.

236
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,500
Given the consistent patterns,

237
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:35,580
they concluded this was all likely the work of the goo.

238
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:38,020
The officers considered what they knew,

239
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:40,540
that animals could see or sense the goo,

240
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:44,180
and that they had the power to become animals themselves

241
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,580
if they needed to.

242
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,660
While discussing the possibilities presented

243
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:50,100
by the strange evidence they'd collected,

244
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:53,940
Keith said the camera might be active again at 1 p.m.,

245
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,540
a suspiciously specific thought.

246
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:59,460
They walked into the evidence locker together

247
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:01,280
and found the helmet red light lit,

248
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,040
the camera red light lit, the gun red light lit,

249
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:08,020
and the radio green light lit.

250
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,380
Doug the cat appeared in the locker room

251
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:13,580
and indicated he had something to say to Keith.

252
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:17,040
Clark bolted from the room as Doug jumped up onto the shelf

253
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,020
and began to rub along the green lit radio,

254
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:21,900
fearing a body switch.

255
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:25,340
Outside, Agent Chad mopped up Red Bull

256
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:29,260
and Rosemary tapped an impatient foot.

257
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:31,840
John Lee Pettymore pulled Doug away from the radio

258
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,340
and chided him for the attempt to switch bodies.

259
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,700
The cat became frantic,

260
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,860
but John hugged him tightly to his chest

261
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,940
and began to consider the possibility

262
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:44,460
of switching the man inside the cat back out

263
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:46,000
for information.

264
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,420
When Doug agreed to switch with the FBI agent,

265
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:51,940
the officers suggested Agent Chad sleep

266
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:55,940
and dragged his unconscious body into the evidence room.

267
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,620
With everything set up for the switch,

268
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,600
the officers listened from outside

269
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,260
as the radio transitioned from music

270
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:06,500
to a jumble of audio culminating in a high-pitched tone

271
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,220
that screeched in their ears.

272
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:13,260
A light flashed inside and there was silence.

273
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:17,060
Soon, they heard Chad's voice from inside.

274
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,020
It was Doug, resituating himself

275
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,860
in the body of the fit agent.

276
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,100
Agent Chad and the cat's body attempted

277
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,540
to make a panicked escape as they opened the door,

278
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:27,580
but they captured him with Doug's help.

279
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:30,140
The officers asked Drew to go buy a cat kennel,

280
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:32,100
prompting a strange look.

281
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,860
Rosemary began to insist on the gun

282
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:37,660
and the officers became condescending.

283
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:40,940
She unlocked the police station door and left.

284
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,460
The officers ran after Rosemary

285
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:45,300
and found her banging on the trunk of Drew's car

286
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,020
as he attempted to back out.

287
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:48,820
She quashed the potential conflict,

288
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:52,460
saying she only wanted the briefcase in the back.

289
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:55,620
With that in hand, she released Drew to his errand.

290
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,220
Despite the tense situation,

291
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:59,620
Rosemary calmly explained that the case

292
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:02,260
contained five million dollars.

293
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:05,180
Content, Rosemary returned to the police station.

294
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:07,160
John and Clark followed.

295
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:10,220
Inside, Doug stood marveling at his new body.

296
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:12,620
He had a very clear memory of what had happened

297
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,060
prior to the body switch,

298
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:17,380
but before he could explain, he began to panic.

299
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:19,100
He could see the ooze,

300
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,940
though it was invisible to everyone else.

301
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,220
Clark rushed to the sink

302
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,700
and began to toss water about the station.

303
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:28,540
John pulled a pipe from the break room sink,

304
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:31,280
allowing water to flood onto the floor.

305
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,380
Rosemary, unsure of what was happening,

306
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:37,540
perched calmly on Drew's desk with the briefcase.

307
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,700
They attempted to get more detail from Doug,

308
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:40,700
but he was terrified.

309
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,540
The water wasn't stopping the ooze.

310
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,140
Doug made a run for the door.

311
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:46,540
Keith and Clark followed him out to the parking lot,

312
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:49,140
and there, they found him standing frozen.

313
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,300
Doug's mental state continued to devolve

314
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,960
as they led him to Keith's car,

315
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:56,520
and their attempts to calm or slap sense into him failed.

316
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,480
Clark confirmed that Doug and Chad's body

317
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,000
was still under the influence of the tranquilizer.

318
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,580
He was able to explain that in the days leading up

319
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:06,380
to his becoming a cat, he had been sick.

320
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:08,840
His wife, Marie, had brought the radio in,

321
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,620
and a dream-like blur followed.

322
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,260
He began to disassociate,

323
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:16,180
claiming they were all part of a dream.

324
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,500
He tried to explain they were not dreaming,

325
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,100
but Clark leaned into the idea.

326
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,620
What was the worst that could happen to Doug

327
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,500
if he helped in the dream?

328
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:28,000
Inside, John found a vacuum and attempted blindly

329
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,580
to capture the ooze.

330
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:32,700
In leaping about, he noticed Agent Chad's briefcase

331
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,260
on one of the desks.

332
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,620
Assuming the coast was clear, he opened it,

333
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:39,660
found several signs, a list, a map,

334
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:43,740
and a small cell phone jammer that was turned on.

335
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,820
Keith and Clark brought Doug back inside

336
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,880
to see if he still saw the goo.

337
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,840
He didn't, and he became distracted by his reflection

338
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,280
in the break room mirror.

339
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:55,000
Doug was unsure whether lingering animal instincts

340
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,820
had allowed him to see the goo,

341
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,380
or if it had been an illusion.

342
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,560
He was pretty certain he was still in a dream.

343
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,920
John drew the group's attention to the signs

344
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,000
in Agent Chad's briefcase.

345
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,040
They read,

346
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:11,800
Attention, a chemical spill from the unincorporated land,

347
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:15,680
once the town Perdition, just west of contention,

348
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,280
is heading this way.

349
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,640
Please evacuate immediately.

350
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,560
Don't forget your pets.

351
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,320
The list contained all the locations Agent Chad

352
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,980
had planned to place the signs,

353
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:28,900
and the map detailed all the missing persons

354
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,760
and the dates they disappeared.

355
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,600
All the disappearances occurred

356
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,720
on December 1st, 2nd, and 3rd.

357
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,480
Marked an explosion in cases across town.

358
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,080
Rosemary stood suddenly and gave the officers

359
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,560
five minutes to turn over the gun.

360
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,020
They used their time to decide

361
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:50,560
between visiting Perdition or the city.

362
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,480
The officers called Drew and asked him

363
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,820
to put Chad's signs up in town,

364
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:59,060
but Drew claimed he had seen literally no one on his errand.

365
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:01,800
No customers in the store, no employees,

366
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,560
no cars on the road, nothing.

367
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,440
But then a car arrived at the station

368
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,080
driven by an older woman.

369
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:14,080
It was Jan Manstein, the mother of an Ari Manstein,

370
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,860
whose name was not immediately familiar.

371
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:20,600
Jan had arrived to gather Ari's possessions

372
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,840
from the station.

373
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,740
Her daughter had been killed

374
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:26,720
in the hospital fire in the city.

375
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,240
The officers recognized that Ari's position

376
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:33,920
matched that of Ray, or was it Tim, or Lauren,

377
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,960
Florence, who they had sent to the hospital.

378
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,300
As soon as they understood the name switch,

379
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,800
the officers were flooded with memories

380
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,660
of this fourth contentioned police officer,

381
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:49,800
all of whom they last remembered sending to the hospital

382
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,720
on an ambulance with Rosemary.

383
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,700
Clark tried to console Jan as she cleaned out Ari's desk.

384
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,720
She invited them all to her funeral the following day

385
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,280
at the city cemetery,

386
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:04,120
where Ari was to be buried with her family.

387
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:07,760
In the back room, Rosemary eyed the evidence locker

388
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,260
as John interrogated her about the hospital fire.

389
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:13,740
Rosemary eventually admitted to starting the fire

390
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,280
that killed their colleague.

391
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:19,200
John insisted that she play it cool while Jan was around.

392
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,280
As Jan finished picking up Ari's things,

393
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:25,440
she struggled to decide whether or not to tell her husband,

394
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,940
Ari's father, Stan Manstein,

395
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:31,740
who had been in the city asylum for 28 years.

396
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,100
When John offered to tell him,

397
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,920
she agreed enthusiastically.

398
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,340
Just as Jan was leaving,

399
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:39,700
they asked if she'd seen anybody about town

400
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:43,260
as she came through, and she told them she hadn't.

401
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,600
With Jan out of the station,

402
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,880
the officers finally let themselves feel shaken

403
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:51,980
by the conflicting personas of this mysterious colleague.

404
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,660
The memories seemed to combine

405
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:56,060
into one almost anonymous individual,

406
00:19:56,060 --> 00:20:00,260
their only connection being the family name, Manstein.

407
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,140
John pulled Rosemary aside again

408
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,860
before they piled into the car.

409
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:07,820
Out of view, he pushed his pistol to Rosemary's head

410
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,440
and threatened to kill her

411
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,940
if she didn't return Drew's money.

412
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:15,100
Rosemary surrendered the money and slowly turned

413
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:19,840
so that the gun's barrel was centered between her eyes.

414
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:24,840
It's hilarious that you think you can kill me.

415
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:34,960
She chuckled before walking back out into the station.

416
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,760
John collected himself and stashed the briefcase

417
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,560
in the evidence locker.

418
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:42,360
An email from Wolf the dog revealed

419
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,600
their PSA was about to air.

420
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,720
The message was followed

421
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:49,300
by news of the Beans Robin murder suicide.

422
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:52,260
John and Clark looked up at Keith DeGage's reaction.

423
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,820
Keith stared at the ground

424
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:56,060
and admitted that Ferguson was his brother

425
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:58,300
but said he hadn't seen him in a while.

426
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,420
Keith agreed it'd be worthwhile to check in

427
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:02,900
with the city PD about the crime scene,

428
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,300
the crime scene he had orchestrated.

429
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:08,340
As the officers headed toward the highway

430
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,900
on their way to the city,

431
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:13,000
they confirmed the utter abandonment of contention.

432
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,820
Gone were the runners, the beggars,

433
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,820
the teenagers and their pot smoking.

434
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:18,900
Gone too were the protests.

435
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:20,780
The town would have been silent

436
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,740
if not for the distant sound of other cars

437
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:27,000
and the cries of abandoned animals from the creek.

438
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,420
Given that two of the cruisers

439
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,140
had been involved in accidents,

440
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:32,460
the officers told Rosemary to lead the way

441
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:36,180
and they piled into a single cruiser with Doug Chad.

442
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:39,140
The crew stopped by Clark's spotless garage

443
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:42,380
to ransack the US military branded crates

444
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:45,000
they had stolen from John Peter's storage units

445
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,340
for pistols, shotguns, rifles,

446
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,940
a shoulder mounted anti-aircraft weapon,

447
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:52,180
an EMP rifle, a grappling gun,

448
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:54,420
a small gun that shot tracers,

449
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:56,480
lots of grenades, a sniper rifle

450
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,420
and a very tiny but powerful gun.

451
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:02,500
Each of the officers also donned body armor

452
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,340
and packed a small bag of cocaine.

453
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:07,640
They remembered at the very last moment

454
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,340
to bring the strange gun and camera

455
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:12,980
with the odd glass tubes.

456
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,020
On the ride to the city,

457
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:16,420
John placed a call to Harry Klinker

458
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,340
and immediately realized they had packed

459
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:21,540
and failed to deactivate the cell phone jammer.

460
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,300
As John waited for Harry to pick up,

461
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:26,020
Keith began to receive missed calls

462
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:28,180
and voicemail notifications.

463
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,960
On the phone, John asked Harry

464
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,780
if he knew where everyone had gone

465
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:34,140
but the gravel-voiced man could only guess.

466
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:36,700
Harry, in turn, began to ask about the actions

467
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,540
of the officers and lie the protests

468
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:42,260
but was happy to side with his daycare alumni.

469
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:45,320
Harry was always something of a confidant for the officers

470
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:48,040
and so John began spilling details

471
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,160
of the bizarre events they had witnessed

472
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,400
in the last few days,

473
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,040
much to the surprise of everyone else in the car,

474
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,280
especially Doug Jacobs.

475
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,960
Harry expressed some worry

476
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:01,600
suggesting a spiritualist might be useful to John

477
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,160
so John inquired about Harry's partner, Gary Daley,

478
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,760
who dabbled in acting as a medium.

479
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,000
Harry admitted Gary hadn't come home the night before.

480
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,720
He did say that Gary had been meeting

481
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,780
with his book group more regularly,

482
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:16,900
a gathering of occultists that included

483
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:19,700
Dr. Marie Jacobs and Mildred Mitchell.

484
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:23,260
John thanked the barman and ended the call.

485
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:25,900
Keith had received a single text

486
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:28,780
and four voicemails while the jammer had been active,

487
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:31,180
all from John Lee Pettymore IV.

488
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,860
John ranted about Keith breaking in,

489
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:35,540
fucking with his Smokies,

490
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:39,060
and admitted that he had $5 million.

491
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,540
The group texted Drew,

492
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:43,900
asking him to keep an eye on contention in their absence.

493
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:46,940
Doug Chad clarified that his central motivation

494
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:48,480
was returning to his own body,

495
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,980
but that he was willing to help for some cash on the side.

496
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:53,240
At Doug's suggestion,

497
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,940
the officers called Gary Daley on speakerphone

498
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,600
and after several rings,

499
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,900
they heard Gary in the middle of a conversation.

500
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:02,580
I told you, you old witch, you're just going crazy,

501
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,540
you know, that's all, that's fine,

502
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:06,660
and we can deal with that, hello.

503
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:09,340
The group suggested Gary check in with Harry.

504
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:11,100
When they asked about the witch,

505
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,540
Gary explained he was chatting with Mildred Mitchell,

506
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:17,140
the grandmother of Tildy B. Mitchell at her house.

507
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:19,900
She was suffering a breakdown of sorts.

508
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,940
See, Mildred was under the impression

509
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:24,300
that her histories have been split,

510
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:27,220
and she has become obsessed with a picture

511
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:29,540
of the founders of contention.

512
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:32,300
Silas Cole, she insisted, looked different

513
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,460
than he did before,

514
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:37,180
less attractive and possibly stupider.

515
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:40,140
Mildred also believed she could see the reflection

516
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:42,280
of Tildy B. in the photo.

517
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,400
The officers were shaken by the thought

518
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:49,000
that the gun at least appeared to send people back in time,

519
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,520
and the split histories could explain in part

520
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,800
their mysterious colleague, Ari.

521
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,720
John asked about Gary's grandfather

522
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,560
and described the recent dream

523
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:01,120
in which Gary had performed a protection ritual on John.

524
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,480
Gary admitted this had indeed occurred

525
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:06,820
and went on to say his grandfather, Gingerfred,

526
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:10,360
had passed down a book with three pages left

527
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:13,120
and instructed Gary to read those pages

528
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:17,080
over the heads of the boys, spilling blood in the process.

529
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,920
The reason for this, Gary's grandfather had explained,

530
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:24,920
was that the three men were the key to everything.

531
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,240
They thanked the owner of the Daily Pho

532
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:30,060
and prepared to enter the city.

533
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:34,120
The streets of the city were drab, gray,

534
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,920
and littered with trash.

535
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,300
A foul smell hung in the air

536
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:41,420
and billboards covered the faces of buildings.

537
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:45,340
The city residents seemed bloated and lifeless.

538
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,800
In opposition to the industrial gloom,

539
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:51,340
flowers of every shade and shape grew in the alleys

540
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:53,340
and from cracks in the pavement.

541
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:55,960
Rosemary led the officers downtown

542
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,940
to a tall granite skyscraper.

543
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:01,100
In a small surveilled parking garage,

544
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,820
Rosemary gestured for the officers to enter

545
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:07,460
a small elevator made of polished onyx.

546
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:11,220
Everyone, including Rosemary, agreed that Doug's presence

547
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:15,640
as FBI might prove valuable leverage.

548
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:20,640
Rosemary remained in the garage though as the doors closed.

549
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:24,920
The elevator contained no buttons or floor indicators

550
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:28,260
and for a while it seemed as though it didn't move at all.

551
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,900
As John held the gun artifact up to the ceiling

552
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,660
and called for an audience,

553
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:37,180
one of the walls opened into a dark room.

554
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,300
A spotlight in the center of the room

555
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:42,460
partially lit Marvin Glass.

556
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:47,060
A humanoid figure with a massive gaunt frame

557
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:52,040
dressed in a fitted black tuxedo and a red bow tie.

558
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:55,620
The lower half of Marvin's face was visible in the light.

559
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:59,140
The skin there appeared hairless and translucent.

560
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:02,180
Above the sharp see-through chin,

561
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:07,180
a candy red lipstick messily encircled a round hole.

562
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:11,140
The orifice began to move as Marvin Glass

563
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:14,720
introduced themself and asked if the crew knew

564
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,860
why they were in this room.

565
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,220
The officers weren't sure.

566
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:21,260
Marvin explained that Ferguson Beans had been trying

567
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:24,740
to buy cocaine from a contention police officer.

568
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:28,620
Cocaine that had been stolen from Marvin Glass.

569
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:31,380
Rosemary was sent to collect the money from the deal.

570
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:34,460
This surprised John who hastily suggested

571
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:36,940
he knew nothing about the cocaine deal

572
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:39,980
and Glass called out the lie for what it was.

573
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:42,540
The officers were confused.

574
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:44,800
Rosemary had been insistent about the gun

575
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,320
but Marvin said he sent her specifically

576
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,500
to recover the money.

577
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,740
They pulled Doug Chad aside and instructed him

578
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:53,920
to say the money had been confiscated by the FBI.

579
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:57,980
Marvin flew into a rage before quickly calming down.

580
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:01,580
He explained that Alfred's state was pitiable

581
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:04,500
but not the current concern.

582
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,800
John clarified it was germane they were hoping

583
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,540
to return to Marvin.

584
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:10,280
John laid the situation out.

585
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:13,260
It wouldn't be long before whatever haunted contention

586
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:15,720
made its way into the city.

587
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:19,780
Marvin explained in plain words that they cared more

588
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:22,540
for the money than for their missing son.

589
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:25,420
Realizing the extent of their miscalculation,

590
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:28,660
the officers began to switch blame to Rosemary.

591
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:31,380
Marvin became increasingly agitated

592
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:35,340
as John recalled the money had been in the woman's hand

593
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:40,280
but she let it go for the promise of this strange gun.

594
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:44,020
Marvin revealed they had orchestrated the killing

595
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:48,780
of Ferguson Beans through Keith's niece, Francis Beans.

596
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:52,940
Glass congratulated him on finishing the job so effectively.

597
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:56,780
Francis herself emerged from the darkness behind the desk

598
00:28:56,780 --> 00:29:00,360
and flipped her uncle, Double Birds, as a third figure

599
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:03,700
with spiky white hair and a long white lab coat

600
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,120
joined the glass retinue.

601
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:09,940
This mad scientist stood tall behind Francis Beans

602
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:13,860
and slowly tapped long, wobbly fingers

603
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:17,340
against her protege's collarbones.

604
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:19,480
John and Keith doubled down on their denial

605
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,700
of all these events but as the women backed

606
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:24,420
into the darkness, Keith stepped forward

607
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:26,540
and asked for his money.

608
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:28,940
Marvin told him he would receive his winnings

609
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:31,940
if he was able to prove himself worthy.

610
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:33,860
Marvin offered John support

611
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:36,820
if he could prove himself capable.

612
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:40,380
They then apologized to Clark for having to be in the room

613
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:44,700
which began to fill with a noxious gas.

614
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,900
Clark ran to the elevator but failed to pry it open.

615
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:50,720
John asked Keith point blank if he had sold them out

616
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,620
and Keith denied it before passing out.

617
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,520
The officers woke in separate cages

618
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:01,480
to the sounds of a jubilant crowd.

619
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:06,400
The cages hung from the ceiling of a smoky, dimly lit room.

620
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,920
Three other cages were present populated

621
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:13,160
by a muscled stranger, a malnourished child

622
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:16,960
and Doug Jacobs in the body of Agent Trent Chad.

623
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:20,880
Below, the audience indulged in vices

624
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,880
and crowded the middle of the room on couches, cushions,

625
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,040
piles of blankets, a papasan chair.

626
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:32,520
The sinners eagerly watched two teenagers fight

627
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:37,020
in a plexiglass cage hanging over the center of the space.

628
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:40,080
The crowd cheered as one teen began

629
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:44,160
to viciously beat the other, spraying those below

630
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,360
with blood through holes

631
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:50,000
in the elevated fighting box's floor.

632
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,040
Keith checked his underwear to see

633
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:56,240
if his tiny gun had been seized.

634
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,560
Thankfully for all of them, it had not.

635
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:03,360
The winner of the bloody fight stumbled to his feet

636
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,720
and tried to run back to his cage which had locked

637
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:09,720
into place on the side of the hanging plexiglass room

638
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:12,120
but he slipped on the blood of the beaten boy

639
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:15,600
and panicked as the ceiling began to lower.

640
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,720
The weakened champion boy scraped and crawled

641
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,720
just quickly enough to slide into his cube of metal bars

642
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:27,160
as the ersatz ceiling closed in on the perforated floor

643
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:31,800
eliciting a guttural moan from the deceased,

644
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:35,640
crushed, juiced boy.

645
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,480
The blood rained down onto the gaudy

646
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,400
and deranged crowd below.

647
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:44,440
Many held their mouths open and tongues out.

648
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:48,560
The two cages attached to the plexiglass combat cage closed

649
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:51,480
and withdrew through an exit in the wall,

650
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:54,200
taking the winner of the fight with them.

651
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,840
The officers did some quick math

652
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,280
and realized their turn would come soon.

653
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:01,000
Keith had indeed located his tiny powerful gun

654
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,160
in his briefs and he called over to Doug

655
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:06,080
to confirm the man was still suggestible.

656
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,160
As a precautionary measure, they told him losing

657
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,960
would allow him to wake up from the nightmare

658
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:14,480
he believed he was experiencing.

659
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,240
As retribution for the current state of affairs,

660
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:20,080
John attempted to urinate on the audience

661
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,360
but slipped and fell on his own penis.

662
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,960
A few members of the audience happily bathed

663
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,320
in the bloody urine he emitted.

664
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,400
Clark Bishop scanned the crowd

665
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,960
and noticed several important figures

666
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,320
including the mayor, the chief of police

667
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:38,120
and the district attorney of the city.

668
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,680
Keith looked for a host or leader of the event

669
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:44,640
and spotted at the bar a lone black clad figure

670
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,560
who sported a mustache and medical scars

671
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,440
on his forehead and neck.

672
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,000
The man seemed to be watching over the event

673
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,440
rather than partaking.

674
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:57,520
As Clark rechecked his cage, it began to move

675
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:01,560
along the conveyor and toward the plexiglass room.

676
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:05,440
The cage of the malnourished boy followed suit.

677
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,880
As the cages locked onto the combat chamber,

678
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,560
their doors opened and a buzzer sounded,

679
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:15,160
eliciting a new wave of cheering from the audience.

680
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:18,240
The child, not older than 12, slowly crawled

681
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,560
from the cage and stood.

682
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:24,080
He began to beat his chest and scream.

683
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,160
Clark called down through the plexiglass

684
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,600
trying to convince someone in the crowd

685
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,800
to put an end to the fight.

686
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,800
Clark's failure to rally the audience

687
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:35,600
saw him caught off guard when the boy flung himself

688
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:38,720
across the room and kicked the officer's head.

689
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,040
The kick sent Clark into a rage

690
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,280
and he turned on the malnourished boy.

691
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,560
The two began to grapple but Clark easily

692
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,520
gained an advantage on the small child

693
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,840
pressing him into the floor of the room.

694
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,520
The boy's eyes widened as he saw the ceiling

695
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,480
of the cage begin to descend.

696
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,240
Clark bashed the boy's head against the plexiglass

697
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,840
hoping to render him unconscious.

698
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,640
When the boy finally went under, Officer Bishop stood

699
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,600
and began to proclaim his innocence

700
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,080
seeing as the boy had attacked first.

701
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:11,400
The crowd laughed as the ceiling closed in on the two.

702
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,600
Clark grabbed the boy and dragged him

703
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,840
across the room toward his cage.

704
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:18,080
As soon as Clark crossed the threshold with the boy,

705
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:21,880
the cage electrified and the officer's skin cooked.

706
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:24,640
But when Officer Bishop pushed the boy back out

707
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:27,800
under the looming human garlic press,

708
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,080
the electrical current terminated.

709
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:33,160
The boy's body was pressed through the holes

710
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,320
in the bottom of the combat room,

711
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:39,520
the pulp of which rained down on the crowd below.

712
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,960
Clark's cage disengaged and headed away

713
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,680
but seemed to jam and stopped just short at the dark exit.

714
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:49,320
50 yards away, the two other officers noticed

715
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,600
the word mayhem tattooed on the back of the muscled man

716
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:57,200
who then introduced himself as Oz Mayhem Wolf.

717
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,960
Oz couldn't locate Marvin in the crowd

718
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:02,920
but revealed the man in black was Kevin.

719
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,960
Marvin's head of security.

720
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,520
John asked Oz if a large amount of money

721
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,600
might persuade Marvin to free them

722
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:12,200
and Oz scoffed at the idea.

723
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:16,080
People in their situation were for sport, not work.

724
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:19,960
Oz explained the fights in the den of sin were easy.

725
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:23,440
Keith considered his chances against a man like Oz

726
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,400
and began to weep.

727
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,480
He attempted to trigger the door release

728
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:30,120
just as the cage began to move.

729
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:33,200
Keith's skin burned as his cage locked

730
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:37,440
against the plexiglass wall and John Lee Pettymore's cage

731
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,160
locked into the other side of the room.

732
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:43,760
The two men surveyed each other across the blood pool

733
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,400
that once made up a child.

734
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,940
Keith reached into his underwear,

735
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:50,680
grasping his tiny but powerful gun

736
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,960
and the men worked together,

737
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:55,880
Keith blasting the floor and John stomping on the cracks.

738
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:59,520
When stray shots killed denizens of the den of sin,

739
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,600
others rushed in to lap up their blood.

740
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:06,940
It took three jumps to bust through the perforated circle

741
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:11,040
of plexiglass floor and the two officers landed directly

742
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,280
on a man in a papasan, crushing him.

743
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,160
The crowd went wild.

744
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,640
Some attempted to flee while others basked

745
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,180
in the violent scene.

746
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:23,240
Keith fired toward the bar but missed Kevin,

747
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,940
obliterating the barkeep instead.

748
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:29,080
In a rage, John flew at the nearest attendee,

749
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:32,760
a man with a curly mustache and a flowing ascot.

750
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:37,760
He screamed into the throng while Clark spat from above.

751
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:41,280
The crowd quickly dissipated, leaving a small group

752
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,960
of people obsessively drinking and snorting the blood

753
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,000
on the ground.

754
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,680
Kevin also remained.

755
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,960
The man hadn't moved from his place at the bar.

756
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:54,240
Keith tried to tackle this mysterious head of security

757
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:58,320
but Kevin caught him midair and slammed Officer Vigna's head

758
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:02,440
into the bar, leaving him limp and unconscious.

759
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:06,160
As Clark shook his cage above, John rushed to Keith

760
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,560
and grabbed the tiny gun from his hands.

761
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,000
Looking into Kevin's eyes, John felt as though

762
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,160
he recognized this man but couldn't quite place him.

763
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,600
Kevin's dead stare seemed to flicker

764
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,520
with the same acknowledgement.

765
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:23,200
And John seized the moment to fire a couple rounds

766
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,040
at the man.

767
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,200
He missed and Kevin broke for the door,

768
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:29,760
leaving John to nurse his penis amidst the carnage.

769
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,440
As the last of the crowd ran from the room,

770
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:35,160
Clark's cell broke from the ceiling.

771
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,480
The door opened as it struck the floor

772
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:40,840
but Clark was pierced by one of the cage's bars

773
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:44,520
and his body came to rest, listless at the bottom

774
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,460
of the cage.

775
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,000
John Lee Pettymore IV found himself the sole surviving cop

776
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,880
from contention here in the Den of Sin.

777
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:57,720
Two creepy twins were still in the den trying to sneak out

778
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:00,440
but John caught them and found out they designed

779
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:03,320
the security system here in Marvin's lair.

780
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:06,120
John tried to bargain with them to escort him out

781
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:09,200
with limited success so he shot one in the knee.

782
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:13,400
Fearful, the twins swore to pay John $5 million

783
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,680
in exchange for their lives.

784
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,560
This was interrupted by a voice near Clark Bishop's

785
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,360
shish kebabed corpse.

786
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,960
John looked over and saw a hunched man wearing

787
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:27,280
an old tattered robe with a hood that covered his face.

788
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,760
The voice was crackly and muttering something ancient

789
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,960
and jaunty.

790
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,840
A bright light began to form under the hood

791
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:37,720
that was obfuscating this being's face.

792
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:40,160
As it reached its hands into the light,

793
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:44,000
the hood was drawn back and this old man ripped

794
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,240
an unnaturally bright light out of his familiar face.

795
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:52,160
This much older Clark Bishop took his beaming hands,

796
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,960
reached deep into the chest of the unconscious

797
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:59,240
Clark Bishop, yanked the bar from his younger self's chest

798
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:03,240
and threw his limp former body over his older

799
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,640
cloaked shoulder.

800
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:07,840
The two Clark Bishops, old and dead respectively,

801
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:11,480
then disappeared in a ball of light.

802
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:15,120
The off-putting brothers, Rich and Richard Nichols,

803
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:18,360
told John Lee Pettymore IV that John Peters

804
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,960
had tried to big time it at the den.

805
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:24,760
Apparently he had posted online about these visions

806
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,760
he saw while in a coma.

807
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:30,240
When he came out of the coma, he was visited by an agent,

808
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:34,320
Victor, who told him about a mind probing device

809
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,720
being used by ISIS.

810
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,560
John shot Richard Nichols in the other knee

811
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:42,760
and then he finished the job and put old Dick Nichols

812
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:45,320
out of his pleasurable misery.

813
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,960
Rich began drinking his brother's blood

814
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,280
before John forced him out of the den

815
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,320
into a long hallway where they found

816
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,280
the individual rooming quarters of Rosemary,

817
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,280
Kevin, Charles and Francis.

818
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:01,560
Rosemary had a framed picture of germane glass

819
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,560
hidden under her pillow.

820
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:06,640
On the photo of the slender, muscular man

821
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,440
with tribal tattoo sleeves on both arms

822
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,080
going down to his hands and fingertips,

823
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:15,560
there was a sharpied heart around this man's face,

824
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:18,080
which was stoic, almost blank.

825
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,840
Kevin had a Spartan room with a desk,

826
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,960
bed and a chest of drawers.

827
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:27,960
Under the desk, he had carved repeatedly, not Kevin.

828
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:32,200
In between the mattress and box spring, there was a notepad.

829
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:35,200
On every page, it said,

830
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,160
I had the same dream again last night.

831
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:43,160
She just says, I'm so sorry, he's just so beautiful.

832
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:47,600
You don't have to do this, we can leave, we can run.

833
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:51,120
Carved repeatedly inside the chest of drawers

834
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:54,920
was the phrase, Mary in the woods.

835
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:59,520
Charles was doing extensive research on contention,

836
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:02,040
including the Piston Pig Farm.

837
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,280
A draft email on his computer revealed

838
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:07,600
that he and Rosemary had run into Tilde B

839
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,920
in possession of the gun.

840
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,280
Francis's room was a complete wreck,

841
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:14,160
but was covered in advanced,

842
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:17,320
seemingly impossible mathematical equations.

843
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:21,160
There was also a small drawing of one of the small spheres.

844
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:24,240
As John and Rich began to leave the dorm area,

845
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:27,120
they noticed four figures in brown uniforms

846
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:29,040
with fishhook sides,

847
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:32,720
dragging the body of Keith Vigna down the hallway

848
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,400
into an elevator.

849
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,440
Continuing the search across the hallway

850
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,720
in a room lined with file cabinets,

851
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:42,000
John Lee Pettymore IV found his own file.

852
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,960
He learned that he was adopted by John Lee Pettymore III

853
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:48,240
from Cole's orphanage.

854
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:51,760
The next file he found was Kevin's.

855
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,720
There was a picture attached.

856
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,560
Missing the surgical scars

857
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:59,120
and looking much younger and happier than Kevin,

858
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:02,720
the hollow shell of a man working for Marvin Glass,

859
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:07,680
John recognized his father, John Lee Pettymore III.

860
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:11,760
The file revealed that an unknown, alias Kyle,

861
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,120
Anne Love, alias Karen,

862
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:17,920
and John Lee Pettymore III, alias Kevin,

863
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:21,200
were once a team called K-Cell.

864
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,600
Marvin Glass caught Kevin and Kyle,

865
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:26,240
but Karen was able to escape.

866
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:30,760
Marvin supernaturally forced Kevin to kill Kyle.

867
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:34,760
Glass was after information on how the sphere worked.

868
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:38,080
John also came across a file named Satan

869
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:40,880
with a picture of a disturbing-looking woman

870
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:44,280
with a mouth that not only took up half of her face,

871
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:47,160
it showed an amount of unbridled pleasure

872
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:49,640
he could barely comprehend.

873
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:52,800
Kevin, the empty vessel that was once John's father,

874
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,800
found the snooping pair

875
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,880
and began emptying clips into the room.

876
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:01,800
John IV sacrificed Rich Nichols to Kevin's withering fire

877
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:04,160
before attempting to face down his father

878
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,960
with Keith's small but powerful pistol.

879
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,160
John winged Kevin, revealing mechanical components

880
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:12,320
below his skin, but to no avail,

881
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:15,880
as John Lee Pettymore IV was immediately mowed down

882
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:18,120
by his own adopted father.

883
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:21,160
And then the world was dark for John,

884
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:24,800
but he still felt very much alive.

885
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:29,680
He was moving, like Gogurt busting out of a plastic tube

886
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:30,920
by pressure alone.

887
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:35,840
He felt himself squeeze out of a dark constricting space

888
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:40,280
onto the cold, hard floor, and he began rolling.

889
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:42,840
His limbs extended from his form

890
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:45,400
and slammed into the file cabinet walls

891
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:46,840
on either side of him.

892
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:49,560
It gave John, or whatever John now was,

893
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:53,560
the leverage he needed to fling his silver round frame

894
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:54,800
at his target.

895
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,640
As he landed down on Kevin,

896
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,360
one of his appendages sliced into the soft tissue

897
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:01,240
on the back of his prey's neck.

898
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:03,520
Another snapped Kevin's head forward,

899
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,800
and John could feel the fracture

900
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:09,400
as a third reached in, gripped the top of the spine,

901
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,880
and ripped the entire spinal cord

902
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:16,160
out of John Lee Pettymore III's body in one swift motion,

903
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:21,160
promptly forcing itself into the then vacant spinal column

904
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:24,080
of this human being.

905
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:26,840
Keith Vigna, unconscious, perhaps dead,

906
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:30,640
saw himself violently holding a pillow over someone's face

907
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:35,120
when the pillow itself transformed into an oily black ooze,

908
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:38,480
and it washed over the face below it, not of a person,

909
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,840
but the face of the watch his father, William,

910
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:44,080
gave his brother, Ferguson, so many years ago.

911
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:46,720
Looking down at his wrist, he was wearing this watch,

912
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:49,760
but when he looked up, he didn't recognize the world.

913
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,720
Dust clouds settled to reveal a horse

914
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:56,040
pulling a wagon through a small frontier town,

915
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:59,280
and the bald man Keith knew as Billy Harrison,

916
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,320
the one who took Keith's uniform and gun in the clinic,

917
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:04,480
he was walking in Keith's direction,

918
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:05,800
and he kept repeating,

919
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:08,800
I did everything that you asked me to do, Officer Vigna.

920
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,800
Holding up the strange looking camera

921
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,880
Officer Pettymore found in the car of Julie Maxwell,

922
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:16,080
Harrison took a picture of Vigna.

923
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,840
The light was blinding, and as it faded,

924
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:22,720
Keith was standing in darkness, dank and chilly.

925
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,520
Right in front of Keith was a massive tank

926
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:30,120
filled with the now eerily too familiar opaque ooze.

927
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:32,600
Keith pressed his face against the tank

928
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:35,040
to see something creeping toward him,

929
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:39,000
and as the face of Tildy B. Mitchell came into focus,

930
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,720
Keith stood in an open field,

931
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:44,640
the dead grass covered in a thin freeze

932
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:48,760
crunching under his feet as he approached a metal hatch,

933
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:52,520
but water, gross murky water with bits of grass and sludge

934
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:56,680
began spewing from the creases of this metal hatch.

935
00:45:56,680 --> 00:46:00,720
The water began to flood this field at an alarming pace.

936
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,640
Keith looked down and saw his reflection

937
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:06,560
in the rippling water, but something looked off.

938
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:10,640
Keith came to in a strange room on an operating table.

939
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:14,240
The room was lined with jars of organs and body parts

940
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:18,920
as well as tubes that ran to vats filled with fish.

941
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:21,680
The tall mad scientist with spiky white hair

942
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:24,960
woke up a dude with brown hair and frosted tips

943
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:28,360
wearing frat boy clothes and a puka shell necklace.

944
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:30,280
His name was Bread.

945
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,600
The scientist clicked a button and both Keith

946
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:35,640
and the fratty Bread felt an intense pain

947
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:37,360
through their entire bodies.

948
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:40,320
She clicked the button again and the pain was gone.

949
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:43,840
Suddenly, a fish head with a small human body

950
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:46,240
popped out of Bread's pocket.

951
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:49,360
The little fish fella was curious about the world.

952
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:51,440
Both he and Bread had never left the room

953
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,440
and they were really hoping Keith could help them

954
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,960
venture into the beyond.

955
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:58,160
Keith promised the two experiments he would take them

956
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,400
to Las Vegas if they could help him.

957
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,920
Just then, Keith's niece, Frances, came into the room.

958
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:07,640
She showed Keith a mirror to reveal surgical scars

959
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:10,960
across his brow, down his nose, past his lip

960
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:13,080
and onto his collarbone.

961
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:16,360
There were also scars from the tip of his finger

962
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:18,120
up to his elbow.

963
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:21,720
She explained they had brought him back to life

964
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:23,680
with a few upgrades.

965
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:26,680
He had a supply of cocaine in his forearm

966
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:28,680
which could be shot out of his index finger

967
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:32,160
into his new metal nose, a nose capable of handling

968
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:35,800
as much cocaine as his internal organs could muster.

969
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:38,960
He also lost his ability to empathize with humanity,

970
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:41,400
something brand new to Keith Vigna,

971
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,920
the now partially mechanical man.

972
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:47,600
Keith named the little fishman Peter Dieter.

973
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:50,000
After Frances left the room, Bread and Peter

974
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
freed Keith from his restraints.

975
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,920
Keith, only in his surgery gown, threw on Bread's

976
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:58,800
extra clothes, a too tight orange polo,

977
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:01,760
teal shorts that were three sizes too big

978
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:04,800
and a pair of Sperrys and put Peter Dieter

979
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:05,760
up on his shoulder.

980
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,320
They all left the room and as they tried to find the exit,

981
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:11,040
they happened upon a black marble hallway

982
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:14,280
with a massive door at the end and four guards

983
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:17,040
with scythes shaped like fish hooks.

984
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:20,440
The guards looked like fish people, like Peter,

985
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:22,760
but fully grown, human sized.

986
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:25,560
As Keith, Bread and Peter bailed,

987
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:27,080
Frances intercepted the group

988
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:29,720
and took them to see Marvin Glass.

989
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:32,560
They walked back into that black marble hallway,

990
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:36,120
through the enormous door at the end and into a room

991
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:37,920
the size of a basketball court.

992
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:41,200
One wall was made entirely of glass,

993
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:44,800
which looked into a murky aquarium.

994
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:47,120
Marvin stood there, looking into the water

995
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:51,560
before he turned around to face the chai fraps.

996
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:54,200
Frances clicked a button on a small remote

997
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:57,560
and everyone in the frappe frat was paralyzed.

998
00:48:57,560 --> 00:49:01,520
With a clear upper hand, Marvin offered Keith a deal.

999
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:05,080
He would give the new metal vigna the $1 million earned

1000
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:07,840
by killing Ferguson if Keith will do

1001
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:10,280
just one more thing for Marvin.

1002
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:13,400
To show the former police officer, current android,

1003
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:16,760
how serious he was, Marvin grabbed Peter,

1004
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:20,960
walked back over to the unfathomably massive aquarium

1005
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:24,560
and reached unnaturally through the glass.

1006
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:27,680
He placed Peter Dieter into the murky water

1007
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:32,680
and pulled his gaunt spindly arm back into his dry office.

1008
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:36,320
Some sort of giant fish monster in the aquarium

1009
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:39,880
swam by and swallowed Peter Dieter

1010
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:42,240
as everyone in the room watched.

1011
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,600
Marvin then set his sights on Bread.

1012
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:47,440
He took the frat boy apart piece by piece

1013
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:51,880
until the problematic robotic boy could no longer function.

1014
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:54,440
Then Marvin Glass assigned the new Keith vigna

1015
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:56,120
to his next task.

1016
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:59,320
In order to prove Keith's loyalty and pay his debt,

1017
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:02,440
Keith must go to the Manstein funeral

1018
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:07,440
and bring back Stan Manstein, Ari's father, for questioning.

1019
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:09,200
Keith agreed.

1020
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:12,000
A thick fog obfuscated Clark's vision.

1021
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,240
The air, like gravity, felt stronger than normal

1022
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,480
and the whisper of a familiar voice

1023
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:19,960
sent a shiver down his spine.

1024
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:22,320
Clark sensed a sudden drop in temperature

1025
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:24,520
as a stainless steel door appeared

1026
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:26,120
and it opened in front of him.

1027
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:28,760
Behind, a woman began to scream.

1028
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:30,720
When he turned around, he was greeted by the face

1029
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:33,760
of Tildy B. Mitchell on a television screen.

1030
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:36,200
In a shaky voice, she began repeating herself

1031
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:41,200
over and over, bonus round, bonus round, bonus round.

1032
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:44,400
Suddenly, Clark was running down the street,

1033
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,320
the street on which he lived.

1034
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:49,080
He noted a familiar boy about to enter the house

1035
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:50,080
on the left.

1036
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:54,400
Clark tried to scream, but the fog veiled him once again.

1037
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:57,960
His screams echoed infinitely into the endlessness

1038
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:59,280
that engulfed him.

1039
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:02,140
Then, a new voice reached him and he looked up

1040
00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:06,320
to see the face of his once mentor, Gerald Fingerson.

1041
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:08,800
It had been some time since the two had seen each other,

1042
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:11,320
but Gerald had aged with grace.

1043
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:14,120
It was December 6th, a crisp winter morning

1044
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:16,480
and Clark was dressed only in briefs

1045
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:19,800
and a pump and dump branded t-shirt.

1046
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:22,960
Clark wore no shoes or socks and despite the cold

1047
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:25,680
and the recent events, the man felt amazing,

1048
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:27,360
the best he'd felt in a long time.

1049
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:29,480
A string was wrapped around Clark's wrist

1050
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:33,460
and attached to a bag of ice from which protruded a rod.

1051
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:36,260
The bag of ice leaked red liquid down the driveway

1052
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:37,480
on which the two men stood,

1053
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:40,280
centered in a suburban neighborhood.

1054
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:44,360
Clark noted the name Jim Cook on the mailbox nearby.

1055
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:47,680
Gerald didn't know how Clark had come to be in the driveway.

1056
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:49,320
He discovered him there as the officer

1057
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:50,900
regained consciousness.

1058
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:53,760
Clark hastily recalled the events in the Den of Sin,

1059
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:56,000
none of which were familiar to Gerald.

1060
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,760
Opening the bag of ice, Clark recognized the bar

1061
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:01,560
was pulled from a cage in the Den of Sin.

1062
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:03,840
As he checked himself for wounds that might account

1063
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:05,800
for the blood, Clark pulled up his shirt

1064
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:09,760
to reveal a gaping hole where his heart should be,

1065
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:12,320
lined with skin and cartilage.

1066
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:17,280
He was rightfully shaken, despite feeling physically well.

1067
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:19,680
Gerald declined to touch Clark's body hole

1068
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:21,620
and suggested they step inside the house

1069
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:23,400
where he'd planned to share a dinner

1070
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:26,200
of cashew chicken with Jim Cook.

1071
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:27,760
Clark had to inform Gerald

1072
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:30,600
that Jim had been found dead in an alley.

1073
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:32,600
Clark and Gerald decided it would be wise

1074
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:34,720
to leave the street and made their way

1075
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:37,360
into the unlocked Cook residence.

1076
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:39,520
The house was older but cozy.

1077
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:42,920
Papers and binders were strewn across the living room,

1078
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:46,200
covering every surface and stagnant dust

1079
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:48,200
hung in the light from the window.

1080
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:49,960
Clark made his way to the bedroom

1081
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:52,200
and donned a pair of Jim Cook's pants,

1082
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:54,320
several sizes too small.

1083
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:56,880
Back downstairs, Clark noticed a picture

1084
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:59,320
of his parents on the fridge.

1085
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:01,920
They were posed in silly hats with Jim Cook

1086
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:04,520
who smiled begrudgingly long.

1087
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:06,480
His investigation further discovered

1088
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,920
a bullet-torn tarot card.

1089
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:11,840
The major arcana card, the devil,

1090
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:13,720
and a taxidermied baby squirrel

1091
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:16,680
bagged and placed in a chest of drawers.

1092
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:20,160
Behind the couch, Clark noticed an empty holster.

1093
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:24,480
The words, scientia morse est, were tooled into the leather.

1094
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:28,560
Below that was a dash and an uppercase K.

1095
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:32,240
In the bathroom, Clark found a smooth silver ring

1096
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:34,240
with a plateau on top.

1097
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:36,960
Two books stood out among the papers in the living room.

1098
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:39,080
The leather cover of the thicker tome

1099
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:41,600
was embossed with a familiar symbol,

1100
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:44,880
a large circle surrounded by six smaller circles,

1101
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:48,120
and the other was a thin, red notebook.

1102
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:50,280
It seemed vaguely familiar.

1103
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:52,280
Clark opened the leather tome

1104
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:54,520
where a girthy wooden bookmark

1105
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:56,360
had been placed near the back.

1106
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:59,600
Written over and over on the ancient parchment

1107
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:00,720
was the phrase,

1108
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:05,680
it is only through death that he may rise again.

1109
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:07,800
Drawn over the obsessive scrawling

1110
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:10,200
was a hooded figure with brilliant light

1111
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:12,200
shining from its maw.

1112
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:14,760
The book closed with supernatural force

1113
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:16,680
as Clark tried to flip forward

1114
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:20,120
and an envelope fluttered out from between its pages.

1115
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:24,280
Inside the envelope was a letter signed by Jim Cook.

1116
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:27,400
Jim seemed to be refuting something called

1117
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:30,400
the revelation of the overseer,

1118
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:33,400
calling it the scratches of a broken man.

1119
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:37,280
The letter went on to outline a set of new guidelines,

1120
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:39,320
including the immediate reassignment

1121
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:43,080
of all members of the disposal unit.

1122
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:45,880
The circle symbol was present at the top of the letter

1123
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:47,960
and it was accompanied by the creed,

1124
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:52,160
faith through knowledge is just called knowledge.

1125
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:55,840
The clicking hammer of a cocked gun startled Clark.

1126
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:57,560
He raised his hands in the air,

1127
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:00,600
dripping blood from the ice bag.

1128
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:03,200
Chief Maggie Cook spoke behind him,

1129
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:05,480
leveling her pistol at his back.

1130
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:10,640
Clark, what the hell are you doing in my daddy's house?

1131
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,600
Tears formed in Clark's eyes

1132
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:15,080
as he and Maggie lowered their arms.

1133
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:18,000
Gerald halfheartedly stood between the two

1134
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,360
as Clark explained that he thought Maggie was dead.

1135
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:24,040
The former chief also confessed an amount of confusion

1136
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:27,640
and the two awkwardly sandwiched Gerald in a hug.

1137
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:31,080
Clark told Maggie he'd seen the charred remains of her body

1138
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:33,080
and he withdrew from the embrace.

1139
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:35,640
The woman was dressed in a dark hoodie and jeans

1140
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:37,240
and it marked the first time Clark

1141
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:39,760
had ever seen her out of uniform.

1142
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:43,480
She brushed by him to retrieve the red notebook.

1143
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:45,440
Maggie was unsure of what to make

1144
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:47,920
of Clark's presence in her father's home.

1145
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:50,200
He explained he had gaps in his memory

1146
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:52,080
and Maggie prodded Clark's chest

1147
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:54,200
where the tunnel had formed.

1148
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:57,560
She gasped as Clark lifted his shirt.

1149
00:55:57,560 --> 00:56:01,320
Immediately excited, she insisted Clark follow her,

1150
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:03,040
that she'd been waiting a long time

1151
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:04,560
for these events to occur.

1152
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:06,280
Gerald interjected claiming

1153
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:08,920
that Maggie had always been a bitch

1154
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:11,760
and Maggie asked if Clark was all right.

1155
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:16,760
He began to realize Maggie couldn't see Gerald Ferguson.

1156
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,120
Gerald's voice became echoey

1157
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:21,280
as he frantically tried to convince Clark

1158
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:23,560
that Maggie was not to be trusted.

1159
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:26,440
Addressing Maggie, he insinuated that Clark knew

1160
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:29,880
what was at the mill before Clark approached the old man,

1161
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:33,160
reaching out to his librarian mentor.

1162
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:37,040
As they grasped hands, Clark felt nothing but air.

1163
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:40,200
Gerald Ferguson dissipated.

1164
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:45,080
Clark, are you with me?

1165
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:45,920
Are you here?

1166
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:49,840
Clark turned solemnly back to Maggie.

1167
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:51,120
Before they got to work,

1168
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:53,960
Clark suggested he fill his bag with more ice,

1169
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:56,440
fearing it contained what had been scraped out

1170
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:58,920
to form the tunnel in his chest.

1171
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:01,360
Maggie investigated and found a heart

1172
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:04,200
impaled on the bottom of the metal rod.

1173
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:06,240
Clark emptied Jim's ice trays

1174
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:08,800
before joining Maggie in her silver Camry

1175
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:13,600
for a ride out to the mill on the other side of the city.

1176
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:17,680
Clark used the silent drive to examine the canvas bag

1177
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:19,920
next to the human heart in the ice.

1178
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:24,920
The bag contained tiles with the letters S-T-L-E-N-R

1179
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:30,880
and a symbol, a circle inside a square.

1180
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:33,640
Clark quickly determined those are the letters

1181
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:36,000
given at the beginning of the bonus round

1182
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,440
of Wheel of Fortune.

1183
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:39,360
Clark broke the silence in the car

1184
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:42,320
when he asked Maggie why she was still alive.

1185
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:44,680
She answered by explaining that the leather tome

1186
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:47,400
in her dad's house contained a prophecy,

1187
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:50,800
the revelation of the overseer.

1188
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:53,600
The Circle of Knowledge believed the overseer

1189
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:56,160
was coming to set an order in the world

1190
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:59,080
and they prepared the way and protected the world

1191
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:01,320
from unnatural forces.

1192
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:03,320
Maggie had been skeptical,

1193
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:05,000
but she claimed to be coming around

1194
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,680
to an understanding of the forces at play.

1195
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:11,120
She believes fire and fear kept the world safe,

1196
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:13,040
that most people couldn't handle the knowledge

1197
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:16,080
of the supernatural, but that people like her and Clark

1198
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:18,880
and the Circle of Knowledge had been tasked

1199
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:22,320
with a responsibility to keep the world moving.

1200
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:24,600
Clark admitted to having met Leon Simpson

1201
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:27,320
and broke down as he tried to explain the horrors

1202
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:30,160
the officers had experienced in her absence.

1203
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:32,760
When Clark asked Maggie why she wasn't there,

1204
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:35,800
she asked in turn if the ant questions

1205
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:38,440
when it's being moved by a boot.

1206
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:41,560
She alluded to the idea that much larger things

1207
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:44,760
were at work than what Clark had seen so far.

1208
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:46,240
They lapsed into silence again

1209
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:49,920
as the Camry pulled onto a country road outside of town,

1210
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:52,800
passing through a verdant tunnel of trees

1211
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:54,320
on the way to the mill.

1212
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:56,000
A few miles later, they arrived

1213
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:00,480
at the massive brick building with two enormous smokestacks.

1214
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:03,480
The mill on the other side of the city

1215
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:05,000
was filled with people,

1216
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,840
none of whom paid any mind to Clark's current dress

1217
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:10,680
or the blood dripping from the ice bag he carried.

1218
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:13,080
Clark recognized no one.

1219
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:15,400
Maggie led them through a secure door in the back

1220
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:18,680
and down a spiraling stone staircase.

1221
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,640
Clark recognized the room at the bottom,

1222
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:23,560
circular with six stone slabs.

1223
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:25,640
Each slab held two bodies

1224
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:29,080
and a xenonimatode was attached to each body.

1225
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:33,040
The unconscious figures were covered in open sores

1226
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:37,320
from previous placements and their skin was rotted.

1227
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:41,000
Maggie led Clark to the center and chuckled grimly,

1228
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:44,720
asking Clark to lie down on the middle slab.

1229
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:45,880
Clark was reluctant,

1230
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:48,720
remembering that Leon had said he would need to sacrifice

1231
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:50,640
neither flesh nor limb.

1232
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:52,080
Maggie agreed, mostly,

1233
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:54,960
but suggested a little flesh was necessary

1234
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:57,120
now that the game had changed.

1235
00:59:57,120 --> 00:59:58,240
Clark called for Leon,

1236
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:00,480
but Maggie told them they'd been sent away.

1237
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:03,640
She grabbed his shoulders and repeated the creed,

1238
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:05,960
faith through knowledge.

1239
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:07,520
It's just called knowledge.

1240
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:09,960
She claimed Clark needed knowledge

1241
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,480
and pressed on his chest

1242
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:15,040
before moving down to his left foot, still bare.

1243
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:18,800
Maggie twisted a circular handle at the base of the slab

1244
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:22,720
and pulled up a cartridge the size of a parking pylon.

1245
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:25,760
Inside the cartridge was a xenonimatode

1246
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:27,200
and with a swift motion,

1247
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:30,880
Maggie pulled it out and placed it on Clark's foot.

1248
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:33,200
Clark's vision immediately darkened.

1249
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:37,560
Suddenly, the ground he stood on was made of light.

1250
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:40,320
Clark felt absolute contentment in this new world,

1251
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:44,600
but noted he was otherwise surrounded by absolute darkness.

1252
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:47,080
12 figures were clear in the distance,

1253
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:50,040
as was a giant black mass,

1254
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:52,120
all dimly lit from below.

1255
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:55,000
The 12 appeared to be following the massive being

1256
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,200
as they walked away from Clark.

1257
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:58,600
When Clark moved closer,

1258
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:01,080
he began to hear their chanting.

1259
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:04,320
Ahead of them stood a towering beast,

1260
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:07,640
its shoulders 25 feet from the ground.

1261
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:12,000
As Clark stared, its image seemed to form and reform,

1262
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,720
changing and glitching and it roared

1263
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:18,320
and Clark fell to the ground

1264
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:21,000
and began to weep uncontrollably.

1265
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:25,160
Clark came to in the mill on the other side of the city

1266
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:28,920
as Maggie returned the xenonimatode back into the ground.

1267
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:33,080
Clark, that thing's coming and we keep it from coming here.

1268
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:35,880
Clark was shaken and he stammered over questions

1269
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:37,360
about what he had just witnessed.

1270
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:39,320
He asked if there's anything Maggie could do

1271
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:40,360
about the heart.

1272
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:42,440
She lifted it from the bag by the rod,

1273
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:45,240
slowly sliding the organ from the metal.

1274
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:47,680
Maggie held the heart in one hand

1275
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:50,080
as it began to sputter blood.

1276
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:52,840
She calmed Clark and retrieved a small wooden stick

1277
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:53,680
from the corner.

1278
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:56,560
She ran the stick through the hollow rod

1279
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:58,600
and caught two small pieces of metal

1280
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:00,560
that emerged from the other end.

1281
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:03,120
Maggie reminded Clark of their backup plan

1282
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:07,240
from the last job and noted he hadn't come back in time.

1283
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:09,080
The circle of knowledge had already tried

1284
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:12,360
to take his heart once and yet he still stood.

1285
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:15,280
Maggie meditated on the fact that things move stranger

1286
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:17,200
in the world than most thought possible.

1287
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:19,200
She gave Clark his first job,

1288
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:21,960
refusing to answer further questions.

1289
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:24,360
The job would take Clark to Ari's funeral

1290
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:26,160
at the city cemetery.

1291
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:28,600
Maggie admitted to being shaken by the woman's death

1292
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:32,040
but it presented an opportunity to be in the same place

1293
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:35,920
as Stan Manstein who rarely left the city asylum.

1294
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:38,200
Clark's job was to assassinate Stan

1295
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:39,800
at his daughter's funeral.

1296
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:41,520
Clark was initially horrified

1297
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:44,560
but he remembered the unspeakable entity

1298
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:47,120
waiting to break into this world,

1299
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:50,960
steeled himself and requested a firearm.

1300
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:54,520
John Lee Pettymore IV stood in front of a storage unit

1301
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:57,600
with a large yellow symbol on the door.

1302
01:02:57,600 --> 01:03:00,520
It was the logo of the circle of knowledge,

1303
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:03,720
six circles surrounding a larger circle.

1304
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:06,920
Inside, he found a wooded territory

1305
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:10,760
and he was suddenly holding one of the silver balls.

1306
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:13,200
It gave off a comforting warmth.

1307
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:17,160
Looking out, he saw a sky of endless darkness

1308
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:19,960
under which two children held hands.

1309
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:23,560
John's senses began to be overwhelmed

1310
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:27,600
by the sounds of torment that filled his ears.

1311
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:30,360
And then he woke up in the room with the filing cabinets

1312
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:33,880
where he had been shot repeatedly by his own father

1313
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:37,400
and John was confronted with the sight of his own body

1314
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:38,960
dead on the ground.

1315
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:40,600
Inspecting his reflection,

1316
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:45,400
he saw he was now in his father's former frame.

1317
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:48,280
John decided to covertly remain Kevin

1318
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:50,200
for as long as he could.

1319
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:53,360
Rosemary called for Kevin to join her

1320
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:56,640
and John Lee Pettymore IV followed in his new body,

1321
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:59,200
though he largely failed in his attempts

1322
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:01,440
to extract any intelligence.

1323
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:04,000
At the end of a black marble hallway,

1324
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:07,560
jumpsuited fishmen guarded Marvin's massive,

1325
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:09,760
strange office door.

1326
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:12,840
Marvin greeted them, Rosemary and Kevin,

1327
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:16,240
and announced they were moving into the final phase

1328
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:18,920
of contentions demolition.

1329
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:23,800
A small silver sphere sat on a tripod atop Marvin's desk

1330
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:26,840
and an intense light show glinted out

1331
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:28,760
from the room behind him.

1332
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:32,400
Marvin ordered Rosemary and Kevin to go to the funeral

1333
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:35,440
of Ari Manstein, the contention police officer,

1334
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:38,760
to ensure that the new Charles, Keith Vigna,

1335
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:43,200
was successful in his mission to apprehend Stan Manstein.

1336
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:45,480
As they headed out into the city,

1337
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:49,640
John Lee Kevinmore witnessed a rowdy band of revelers

1338
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:52,720
using dirty dog grooming loyalty cards

1339
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:56,600
to enter a grate that took them underground.

1340
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:59,720
Keith left the glass compound and headed to the funeral

1341
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:02,520
of Ari Manstein and his police cruiser.

1342
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:05,400
The strange gun and camera with glass tubes

1343
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:08,400
were no longer in this car.

1344
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:11,960
On his phone, he found multiple missed calls from Drew,

1345
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:15,800
as well as a voicemail that said the mass is growing

1346
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:19,120
and pleaded for the officers to stay far away

1347
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:20,280
from contention.

1348
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:23,760
He sounded panicked and the call ended abruptly.

1349
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:27,200
Keith chose to not change out of his tight orange polo

1350
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:29,880
and big coral shorts and boat shoes.

1351
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:33,520
In the city cemetery, the smell of a crawfish boil

1352
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:36,440
wafted through the above ground mausoleums

1353
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:39,360
and directed Vigna to the funeral,

1354
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:41,680
where he spoke briefly to Ari's mother

1355
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:44,520
and took a seat in the front row.

1356
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:46,840
Clark came to on the concrete slab

1357
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:49,680
in the middle of the underground dungeon room

1358
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:53,120
below the mill on the other side of the city.

1359
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:54,680
Maggie Cook backed away quickly

1360
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:57,680
as she lowered the Xenon nematode back into the ground.

1361
01:05:57,680 --> 01:06:00,880
Maggie moved on, told Clark that after he completed

1362
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:02,960
his mission of killing Stan Manstein

1363
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:04,360
at Ari Manstein's funeral,

1364
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:06,600
he was free to do whatever he pleased.

1365
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:08,040
She offered to house him back

1366
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:09,720
at the circle of knowledge if he wanted.

1367
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:11,200
This job won't be daily.

1368
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:13,960
At first, she said, but they would get him trained up

1369
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:16,160
and working more often eventually.

1370
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:19,520
Clark pressed her on it not being daily.

1371
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:21,800
He was shaken by the thing he saw in his vision

1372
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:24,600
and wanted to stop it immediately.

1373
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:26,720
She was glad to see Clark's fire.

1374
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:30,320
She said that's exactly what they need in the organization.

1375
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:33,040
Maggie gave Clark a burner phone, a gun,

1376
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:35,640
an old contention police uniform,

1377
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:37,920
and a silver Honda Accord.

1378
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:42,320
She'd be in contact with him the next day, December 7th.

1379
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:45,840
Clark stopped for gas on the way to Ari's funeral.

1380
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:47,400
While he was busy pumping,

1381
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:49,680
a woman stealthily dropped a phone

1382
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:51,920
into his car passenger seat.

1383
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:53,200
Phone was scrubbed clean,

1384
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:56,120
save a single text message that read,

1385
01:06:56,120 --> 01:06:59,680
do you wanna know why your parents were killed?

1386
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:02,720
Clark immediately texted back, who is this?

1387
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:04,960
Clark arrived at the city cemetery

1388
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:07,600
and followed his nose to a small clearing

1389
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:11,040
where a funeral service was set up for Ari Manstein.

1390
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:14,240
Ari's mother, Jan, greeted visitors in the front.

1391
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:17,320
Sat up there by the crawfish boil was Keith Vigna

1392
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:21,440
wearing Sperry boat shoes, big coral blue shorts,

1393
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:23,800
and a tight orange polo.

1394
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:26,440
From Clark's distance, Keith looked healthy.

1395
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:30,680
Clark, however, last remembered seeing Keith fucking die.

1396
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:34,000
Then again, Clark seemingly came back from the dead himself,

1397
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,640
so maybe it wasn't that surprising.

1398
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:39,920
Clark didn't see Stan or John Lee Pettymore.

1399
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:42,240
Leaning casually against a mausoleum,

1400
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:47,200
he tried to inconspicuously hide in the back of the crowd.

1401
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:49,880
While Rosemary drove John Lee Pettymore IV

1402
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:52,120
and the body of his father, John Lee Pettymore III,

1403
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:55,120
whom she knew as Kevin, to the cemetery,

1404
01:07:55,120 --> 01:07:59,040
Rosemary revealed the news of Charles' death shook her

1405
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:03,000
as she thought the enhancements made them more robust.

1406
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:05,160
Kevin reflected on the truth.

1407
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:06,920
Everything dies.

1408
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:08,760
They made their way through the raised

1409
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:11,240
New Orleans-style tombs to the funeral

1410
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:14,120
where they found a large crawfish boil.

1411
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:16,120
John saw Keith sitting in the front row

1412
01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:19,400
in a ridiculous outfit and Clark near the back

1413
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:22,880
in an old-fashioned contention PD uniform.

1414
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:26,420
John split away from Rosemary, approached Clark from behind,

1415
01:08:26,420 --> 01:08:29,320
and muttered, bubblegum tree.

1416
01:08:29,320 --> 01:08:32,960
Recognizing the body of Kevin, Clark was apprehensive

1417
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:36,000
but tentatively responded, bubblegum tree.

1418
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,480
John Lee Kevinmore said nothing

1419
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:41,680
and faded back into the crowd.

1420
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:44,440
Jan Manstein settled behind the podium,

1421
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:46,280
thanked everyone for coming,

1422
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:48,800
and introduced her ex-husband,

1423
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:50,420
who doesn't get out very often.

1424
01:08:50,420 --> 01:08:52,960
Stan Manstein, dressed in all white,

1425
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:55,780
his hair and beard both long and tangled,

1426
01:08:55,780 --> 01:08:57,760
his face weathered like leather,

1427
01:08:57,760 --> 01:08:59,520
approached the microphone flanked

1428
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:01,920
by three heavily armed guards

1429
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:05,520
with various scars across their faces.

1430
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:08,080
And then Stan began to speak

1431
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:12,320
in a fully nonsensical language, but through the noise,

1432
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:16,120
the three officers heard Stan in perfect English

1433
01:09:16,120 --> 01:09:20,400
as time itself began to slow down.

1434
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:25,400
My daughter was kind, hardworking, and good every time.

1435
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:29,680
She was those things when she was a police officer.

1436
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:32,520
She was those things when she was a school teacher.

1437
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:35,720
She was those things when she was a historian.

1438
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:39,800
You see, one long time ago, when this land was stolen

1439
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:42,080
and pioneer towns began to form,

1440
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:45,200
Silas Cole was a miner in the mine

1441
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:48,860
that employed the town nearby of contention.

1442
01:09:48,860 --> 01:09:50,800
While down in the mines,

1443
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:54,500
Silas Cole came upon an odd black substance

1444
01:09:54,540 --> 01:09:57,460
and he became obsessed with studying it.

1445
01:09:57,460 --> 01:10:01,220
The substance was invisible to others, but not to Cole.

1446
01:10:01,220 --> 01:10:04,300
Exploiting the substance's wrong qualities,

1447
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:07,020
he became an inventor and made so much money

1448
01:10:07,020 --> 01:10:10,140
off of his inventions that he bought the mine.

1449
01:10:10,140 --> 01:10:12,180
He built an office on the top floor

1450
01:10:12,180 --> 01:10:14,580
of the tall, skinny mining company building

1451
01:10:14,580 --> 01:10:17,340
that sat right above the mine itself.

1452
01:10:17,340 --> 01:10:19,540
He began to harvest the residue

1453
01:10:19,540 --> 01:10:23,140
and acquired a much firmer grasp on its tendencies.

1454
01:10:23,180 --> 01:10:25,860
He invented wild, magical things.

1455
01:10:25,860 --> 01:10:28,780
Each new invention brought him wealth and power,

1456
01:10:28,780 --> 01:10:33,440
but also released more of this inky substance into the town.

1457
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:35,700
To divert his raising paranoia,

1458
01:10:35,700 --> 01:10:37,860
he began looking for a partner.

1459
01:10:37,860 --> 01:10:40,180
He found a similarly intelligent engineer

1460
01:10:40,180 --> 01:10:43,740
in his wife, Mary Cole, who could also see the substance

1461
01:10:43,740 --> 01:10:45,980
they began calling residue.

1462
01:10:45,980 --> 01:10:48,700
But Silas Cole was scared of their inventions.

1463
01:10:48,700 --> 01:10:51,780
He became paranoid that other people could see the residue

1464
01:10:51,820 --> 01:10:54,300
that was loose all over the town.

1465
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:57,360
Consumed, he believed the town was plotting against him,

1466
01:10:57,360 --> 01:11:01,620
so he began kidnapping people he suspected knew too much.

1467
01:11:01,620 --> 01:11:04,780
As Stan spoke, Clark surveyed the crowd,

1468
01:11:04,780 --> 01:11:07,860
slowed around him as he moved at normal speed.

1469
01:11:07,860 --> 01:11:09,920
The guards looked slowed as well.

1470
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:11,580
Clark made his way to the front.

1471
01:11:11,580 --> 01:11:14,500
John moved into a position behind Stan.

1472
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:18,580
Keith made eye contact with Clark and they bubblegum treed.

1473
01:11:18,580 --> 01:11:22,140
Clark saw Keith's fresh scars running from his elbow

1474
01:11:22,140 --> 01:11:23,700
down to the tip of his finger,

1475
01:11:23,700 --> 01:11:26,520
as well as across his forehead down his face.

1476
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:28,740
It didn't seem like the crowd was able

1477
01:11:28,740 --> 01:11:30,940
to understand Stan's speech,

1478
01:11:30,940 --> 01:11:35,180
but the three armed guards started to converge on Manstein,

1479
01:11:35,180 --> 01:11:37,420
though they moved in slow motion.

1480
01:11:37,420 --> 01:11:38,620
Following his orders,

1481
01:11:38,620 --> 01:11:42,380
Clark drew his gun and shot Stan in the chest.

1482
01:11:42,380 --> 01:11:45,460
Time immediately resumed back to normal pace.

1483
01:11:45,460 --> 01:11:47,860
John Lee Kevin Moore emerged from behind the stage

1484
01:11:47,860 --> 01:11:50,300
and began firing at one of the armed guards.

1485
01:11:50,300 --> 01:11:52,480
The crowd dispersed, panicked.

1486
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:54,380
Keith joined in firing at the guards

1487
01:11:54,380 --> 01:11:56,540
with his small, powerful gun.

1488
01:11:56,540 --> 01:11:59,580
Three gunshots rang out from an unseen location,

1489
01:11:59,580 --> 01:12:01,540
finishing off one of the scar-faced,

1490
01:12:01,540 --> 01:12:03,900
black tactical gear-clad guards.

1491
01:12:03,900 --> 01:12:07,320
Another guard tried to fire off his wire arm,

1492
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:09,060
like the android that attacked them

1493
01:12:09,060 --> 01:12:10,580
at James the Millworker's house,

1494
01:12:10,580 --> 01:12:12,500
but this time the massive man

1495
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:15,020
accidentally hogtied himself.

1496
01:12:15,020 --> 01:12:17,320
John executed the other robot man

1497
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:20,960
and Keith shoved his fingers into Stan's bullet wounds

1498
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:22,380
to plug the leaks,

1499
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:25,320
which jolted Stan back to consciousness.

1500
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:28,040
The restrained robot guard fired at Clark,

1501
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:30,560
putting bullets in his chest and arm.

1502
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:34,040
Stan mustered the strength to continue his speech

1503
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:38,720
and time began to slow once again.

1504
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:42,680
The town was suspicious of the disappearances,

1505
01:12:42,680 --> 01:12:45,880
but most of the ones gone were bad people,

1506
01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:48,680
the whole saloon staff, the bartender, Miss Kitty,

1507
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:50,800
the piano player, there was a few gamblers,

1508
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:53,400
the town drunk, so they kept their heads down

1509
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:55,160
and went about their business.

1510
01:12:55,160 --> 01:12:57,160
But then some good people disappeared,

1511
01:12:57,160 --> 01:13:00,420
a professor, a circuit judge, a rancher, a homesteader,

1512
01:13:00,420 --> 01:13:02,040
the homesteader's wife.

1513
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:05,160
Then the preacher disappeared, the town freaked out

1514
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:08,640
and they hired a roaming cowboy named Cornelius Beams

1515
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:12,520
to kill their weird, paranoid figurehead.

1516
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:15,800
Silas and Mary Cole were never seen again.

1517
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:18,480
Neither was Cornelius Beams.

1518
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:22,280
That was the history of contention,

1519
01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:26,560
when my daughter's name was Mia or Leah or Micah or Ben,

1520
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:29,360
but her name is Ari forever now

1521
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:31,840
and our history is different.

1522
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:34,520
Mine is now definite.

1523
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:38,960
Upon finishing his speech, Stan's body seemed

1524
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:42,080
to instantly turn itself inside out

1525
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:44,520
and blip out of existence.

1526
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:47,840
Clark lost his shit and charged the hogtied guard

1527
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:48,760
who had shot him.

1528
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:52,560
Clark unloaded his entire clip into this man's head

1529
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:53,840
while screaming.

1530
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:57,220
Metallic clangs and buzzes clanged and buzzed,

1531
01:13:57,220 --> 01:14:00,380
sparks sparkled and wires spilled out

1532
01:14:00,380 --> 01:14:02,280
of the robot guard's head.

1533
01:14:02,280 --> 01:14:03,960
The crowd had made a run for it

1534
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:06,040
and the three officers stood in silence

1535
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:08,900
over the three massacred metal man bodies

1536
01:14:08,900 --> 01:14:11,820
next to the crawfish boil in the casket.

1537
01:14:11,820 --> 01:14:14,820
Keith made sure Ari's body was actually in the coffin.

1538
01:14:14,820 --> 01:14:15,740
It was.

1539
01:14:15,740 --> 01:14:18,240
Unsure of each other due to Kevin's presence,

1540
01:14:18,240 --> 01:14:20,940
Keith's scars and Clark's dated uniform,

1541
01:14:20,940 --> 01:14:24,440
the three men held each other at gunpoint.

1542
01:14:24,440 --> 01:14:26,000
Bubble gum tree.

1543
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,380
They lowered their guns.

1544
01:14:27,380 --> 01:14:29,540
Keith admitted Kevin killed him,

1545
01:14:29,540 --> 01:14:32,120
but he owed Kevin's organization,

1546
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:34,800
the Glass family, for his life.

1547
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:37,060
Kevin asked Clark to speak to him alone

1548
01:14:37,060 --> 01:14:38,980
for a moment without Keith.

1549
01:14:38,980 --> 01:14:42,040
Keith went and occupied himself with the crawfish pot.

1550
01:14:42,040 --> 01:14:45,980
Kevin explained he used to be John Lee Pettymore IV.

1551
01:14:45,980 --> 01:14:48,820
John Lee Pettymore was more of a state of mind.

1552
01:14:48,820 --> 01:14:51,780
Turned out John's daddy was lobotomized

1553
01:14:51,780 --> 01:14:55,280
and had been Marvin Glass's head of security for a while.

1554
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:58,140
When John died, it seemed he was some kind

1555
01:14:58,140 --> 01:15:00,860
of alien squid being or something.

1556
01:15:00,860 --> 01:15:05,240
He sucked out of John's brain and entered his dad's body.

1557
01:15:05,240 --> 01:15:08,500
Clark tried to clarify the squid being part.

1558
01:15:08,540 --> 01:15:09,900
Kevin said he didn't really know.

1559
01:15:09,900 --> 01:15:11,360
Maybe he was just mechanical.

1560
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:16,040
He just knew he left John's body and entered Kevin's body,

1561
01:15:16,040 --> 01:15:19,400
the body of John Lee Pettymore III.

1562
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:22,700
John Lee Kevinmore urged Clark to ask him something

1563
01:15:22,700 --> 01:15:24,340
only John would know.

1564
01:15:24,340 --> 01:15:26,460
Clark asked him about the little twins

1565
01:15:26,460 --> 01:15:28,540
they lost to the goo in the suburbs,

1566
01:15:28,540 --> 01:15:30,660
and John confirmed the story.

1567
01:15:30,660 --> 01:15:33,600
As they embraced, Clark whispered into John's ear,

1568
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:36,520
Maggie's alive.

1569
01:15:36,520 --> 01:15:37,880
Kevin didn't believe him

1570
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:40,260
and proposed that the chief was dead,

1571
01:15:40,260 --> 01:15:42,920
but that there were other versions of each of them.

1572
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:45,920
Kevin explained he saw Clark broken and shattered

1573
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:47,960
on the ground back in the Den of Sin,

1574
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:51,160
but an older Clark came by, whispered some shit

1575
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:55,160
over the body, and the two disappeared in a flash of light.

1576
01:15:55,160 --> 01:15:57,920
Clark lifted his shirt and showed John the hole

1577
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:00,560
through his chest where his heart should have been.

1578
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:03,400
Clark told John about waking up with his own heart

1579
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:05,640
in a bag and running into Maggie.

1580
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:08,200
He said he was now working for the Circle of Knowledge

1581
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:11,940
and that Maggie and Jim Cook were both also involved.

1582
01:16:11,940 --> 01:16:14,560
Clark asked if John knew how Keith survived.

1583
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:17,320
John had seen some figures with funny-shaped sides

1584
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:19,280
drag Keith's body away.

1585
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:21,840
Marvin Glass told John they'd turned Keith

1586
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:23,600
into the new Charles.

1587
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:26,960
The Glass family performed some sort of upgrade procedure

1588
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:28,600
on all of their cronies.

1589
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:31,560
Clark asked if John was medley now.

1590
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:34,320
Through his bullet holes, they could both see

1591
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:38,040
metal lining in the layers of flesh.

1592
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:41,040
The two looked back at Keith to see him dipping his hand

1593
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:44,400
straight into the boiling pot of crawfish.

1594
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:47,320
John walked up to Keith and whispered in his ear,

1595
01:16:47,320 --> 01:16:49,920
I know what you did to my smokies,

1596
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:51,420
and punched him in the gut.

1597
01:16:51,420 --> 01:16:54,760
Keith realized Kevin was John and gave him a hug.

1598
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:57,840
A big smile spread across Keith's face.

1599
01:16:57,840 --> 01:17:00,160
John stopped him and explained he had learned

1600
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:03,880
this was all some kind of business play for Marvin Glass.

1601
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:06,300
Marvin wanted to demolish contention

1602
01:17:06,300 --> 01:17:07,980
so he could have the land.

1603
01:17:07,980 --> 01:17:10,480
They've got to save the town.

1604
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:13,480
Clark shared it may be bigger than just the town.

1605
01:17:13,480 --> 01:17:16,880
He recounted the vision he saw, barely keeping it together.

1606
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:19,400
Clark explained the Circle of Knowledge is a group

1607
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:22,580
he worked for now that tried to keep the thing he saw

1608
01:17:22,580 --> 01:17:25,440
in the vision from becoming a reality.

1609
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:27,560
Part of that mission apparently included

1610
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:29,400
killing Stan Manstein.

1611
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:32,120
That really fucked Keith over.

1612
01:17:32,120 --> 01:17:35,320
The Glass family rebuilt him and tasked him

1613
01:17:35,320 --> 01:17:38,420
with bringing Stan back alive.

1614
01:17:38,420 --> 01:17:41,980
Additionally, Drew had been calling Keith to tell him

1615
01:17:41,980 --> 01:17:44,280
to get the hell away from contention.

1616
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:47,220
Unfortunate because Clark had planned on grabbing his guns

1617
01:17:47,220 --> 01:17:50,200
and things from his house and moving shop up to the mill

1618
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:52,000
on the other side of the city.

1619
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,560
Keith mused that he hoped the helmet and radio

1620
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:56,180
were still in the evidence room

1621
01:17:56,180 --> 01:17:58,280
at the contention police department.

1622
01:17:58,280 --> 01:18:00,840
They realized the gun and the camera

1623
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:04,380
now likely belonged to Marvin Glass.

1624
01:18:04,380 --> 01:18:07,440
John thought about it, put his hands up to his head

1625
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:11,440
and his eyes went white as he looked elsewhere.

1626
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:17,640
John, as your eyes roll backward, your vision goes dark.

1627
01:18:17,640 --> 01:18:19,960
Images begin flashing through your mind,

1628
01:18:19,960 --> 01:18:22,820
just snippets, moments, and you try to keep up

1629
01:18:22,820 --> 01:18:26,120
as the speed of this sequence waxes and wanes.

1630
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:30,240
You see a motel safe, shiny, black, and closed.

1631
01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:32,720
You see the sign for Bean's Pond,

1632
01:18:32,720 --> 01:18:35,260
the little pond behind Chief Maggie Cook's house

1633
01:18:35,260 --> 01:18:36,480
in contention.

1634
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:37,900
You see a television.

1635
01:18:37,900 --> 01:18:40,320
It's blinking with different letters on it.

1636
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:44,320
R-S-T-L-N-E.

1637
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:46,560
You see a small clearing in the woods.

1638
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:48,520
The ground is scorched.

1639
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:52,180
In a dark room lit by various electronics and machines,

1640
01:18:52,180 --> 01:18:56,340
you see a massive, shiny metal sphere, 20 feet tall,

1641
01:18:56,340 --> 01:18:59,940
with silvery arms extending from either side.

1642
01:18:59,940 --> 01:19:04,020
A tube connects this gargantuan ball to a machine below.

1643
01:19:04,020 --> 01:19:05,700
The machine begins whirring,

1644
01:19:05,700 --> 01:19:07,560
and you see a small metal sphere,

1645
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:09,220
roughly one inch in diameter,

1646
01:19:09,220 --> 01:19:12,020
begin moving up through the tubing

1647
01:19:12,020 --> 01:19:15,940
into the larger armed version of itself.

1648
01:19:15,940 --> 01:19:19,020
As this happens, a vast circle opens up in the ceiling

1649
01:19:19,060 --> 01:19:22,260
and a disorienting amount of light and sound

1650
01:19:22,260 --> 01:19:26,540
pours into this room, revealing text painted on the back wall

1651
01:19:26,540 --> 01:19:30,420
that says the same thing you hear violently chanted

1652
01:19:30,420 --> 01:19:35,420
by an unseen crowd, Planet Juggernaut.

1653
01:19:36,260 --> 01:19:37,320
The scene changes again,

1654
01:19:37,320 --> 01:19:39,940
and you see Marvin Glass standing at his desk

1655
01:19:39,940 --> 01:19:43,340
in the grand room you recently stood in as Kevin,

1656
01:19:43,340 --> 01:19:45,300
alongside Rosemary.

1657
01:19:45,300 --> 01:19:48,460
Marvin is holding the odd camera with glass tubes

1658
01:19:48,740 --> 01:19:53,740
closely inspecting it, tapping its lit red luminaire.

1659
01:19:53,780 --> 01:19:57,260
On his desk are two file folders splayed open

1660
01:19:57,260 --> 01:20:00,640
entitled Clark Bishop and Keith Vigna,

1661
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:02,760
contention police officers.

1662
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:06,020
You can see in Keith's file are various clippings

1663
01:20:06,020 --> 01:20:07,700
about the Beans family,

1664
01:20:07,700 --> 01:20:11,140
the tragic accidental deaths of William and Lena,

1665
01:20:11,140 --> 01:20:14,380
Keith's parents, the takeover of the family business

1666
01:20:14,380 --> 01:20:15,580
by Ferguson.

1667
01:20:15,580 --> 01:20:18,300
In Clark's file, there's a newspaper article

1668
01:20:19,100 --> 01:20:22,100
about the murderer who killed Clark Bishop's parents

1669
01:20:22,100 --> 01:20:23,580
and love.

1670
01:20:23,580 --> 01:20:27,920
There's a mugshot of a woman smiling a cold, vacant smile

1671
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:31,900
behind asymmetrical bangs covering one of her eyes.

1672
01:20:31,900 --> 01:20:35,020
And written in Sharpie underneath the mugshot,

1673
01:20:35,020 --> 01:20:38,300
it says in all caps, Karen.

1674
01:20:39,460 --> 01:20:41,100
In the mid morning sunlight,

1675
01:20:41,100 --> 01:20:44,060
in the wake of a funeral gone horribly awry,

1676
01:20:44,060 --> 01:20:47,000
Keith and Clark watched John's eyes,

1677
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,360
which had rolled into the back of his head,

1678
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:50,800
returned to normal.

1679
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:53,880
John believed he'd developed the second sight

1680
01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:56,360
in his transition from John to Kevin,

1681
01:20:56,360 --> 01:20:58,400
or perhaps he'd had it all along.

1682
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:02,460
He relayed everything he saw sans the planet juggernaut bit.

1683
01:21:02,460 --> 01:21:05,640
Keith recalled his brother's watch was in his safe

1684
01:21:05,640 --> 01:21:07,240
at Hotel Motel.

1685
01:21:07,240 --> 01:21:09,120
When Keith had put on the watch,

1686
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:12,440
he felt like he was on some alternate plane

1687
01:21:12,440 --> 01:21:14,680
and knew he needed to take it off.

1688
01:21:14,680 --> 01:21:17,600
Clark asked Keith if it was as though the ground

1689
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:19,120
were made of light.

1690
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:21,560
No, it was more like in his mind,

1691
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:23,680
he was seeing different stuff.

1692
01:21:23,680 --> 01:21:27,040
It was hard to decipher what was real and what wasn't.

1693
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:30,480
John asked if Bean's pond meant anything to anyone.

1694
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:32,080
When he thought about the objects,

1695
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:34,080
those were the things he saw.

1696
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:36,680
Clark made the connection that the letters John saw

1697
01:21:36,680 --> 01:21:39,200
flashing on the TV are the letters they give you

1698
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:42,200
for the final puzzle in Wheel of Fortune.

1699
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:44,280
When Clark woke up with the hole,

1700
01:21:44,760 --> 01:21:45,960
he had a bag with him.

1701
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:49,200
In the bag was what he thought was his heart

1702
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:51,520
and next to that was another bag

1703
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:54,200
that had those letters in it.

1704
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:57,680
John informed them they are not the first group of three

1705
01:21:57,680 --> 01:22:00,040
to try to combat this kind of stuff.

1706
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:02,080
Before John, Clark, and Keith,

1707
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:04,680
there was a group called K-Cell.

1708
01:22:04,680 --> 01:22:08,120
Kevin, John Lee Pettymore IV's adopted father

1709
01:22:08,120 --> 01:22:10,880
who he now inhabited the body of,

1710
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:13,240
a man named Kyle, unknown,

1711
01:22:13,240 --> 01:22:18,040
and a woman called Karen, also known as Anne Love.

1712
01:22:18,040 --> 01:22:21,000
John told Clark he knew Anne Love

1713
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,840
had been the one to kill his parents.

1714
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:24,760
He didn't know why,

1715
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:27,760
but Marvin Glass turned the group against itself

1716
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:30,800
and Karen was the only one to get away.

1717
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:33,520
Marvin made Kevin shoot Kyle.

1718
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:36,080
He was looking for the metal sphere

1719
01:22:36,080 --> 01:22:39,520
and he apparently already had one in his possession.

1720
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:41,840
Everyone wants these spheres.

1721
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:45,480
John had one when he arrived at the Glass family compound.

1722
01:22:45,480 --> 01:22:49,080
Marvin Glass had one and he wanted to collect more

1723
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:50,640
and learn how they work.

1724
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:52,760
They realized the one John had

1725
01:22:52,760 --> 01:22:57,000
was now likely in the possession of Marvin Glass.

1726
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:00,720
In John's vision, he had just seen one of those spheres,

1727
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:03,120
but it was massive, gargantuan.

1728
01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:06,520
It had arms and a little tube coming out of the bottom

1729
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:10,360
and up that tube he saw one of the small spheres go.

1730
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:12,560
A huge light opened in the ceiling

1731
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:15,160
like it was opening to allow this thing to come through

1732
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:19,120
and the wall behind it read, Planet Juggernaut,

1733
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:20,960
like the bedding stubs they found

1734
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:23,760
in John Peter's house and storage unit.

1735
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:26,400
Keith remembered that when he had the watch on,

1736
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:27,920
it clouded his thoughts

1737
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:30,360
and made him feel like he was going insane,

1738
01:23:30,360 --> 01:23:32,320
but one of the feelings he had

1739
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:35,040
was wet dirt and grass on his fingers

1740
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:39,360
and he saw a metal door slightly buried that read,

1741
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:43,920
here lies the beans, scientists beyond measure,

1742
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:46,560
saviors of the world.

1743
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:50,480
Keith was positive somewhere along the beans bloodline

1744
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:52,600
was something he didn't know.

1745
01:23:53,560 --> 01:23:57,200
Clark reminded Keith it was someone related to Keith

1746
01:23:57,200 --> 01:24:00,040
that came in and solved the town's Silas

1747
01:24:00,040 --> 01:24:02,920
and Mary Cole problem back in the day.

1748
01:24:02,920 --> 01:24:05,880
Keith didn't know where Cornelius beans fit in

1749
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:08,200
with his family being scientists

1750
01:24:08,200 --> 01:24:11,840
and he didn't know where to find that metal door,

1751
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:13,760
but he felt the door was real

1752
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:18,560
and maybe there's something inside it they needed to find.

1753
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:20,640
One of the last things Clark remembered

1754
01:24:20,640 --> 01:24:22,400
was being in Glass's office

1755
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:25,800
and it sounded an awful lot like Glass hired Keith

1756
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:28,720
to kill his own brother, Ferguson Beans.

1757
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:31,080
Keith had even asked where the money was.

1758
01:24:31,080 --> 01:24:32,720
Since they're all working together again,

1759
01:24:32,720 --> 01:24:35,720
Keith didn't see the point in hiding it from them anymore.

1760
01:24:35,720 --> 01:24:39,280
Keith didn't know it was Marvin Glass hiring him to do it.

1761
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:41,240
He was approached by his niece.

1762
01:24:41,240 --> 01:24:44,520
Keith explained that he'd hated his brother Fergie

1763
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:46,160
since they were little boys.

1764
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:50,120
So when this opportunity arose, he jumped at it.

1765
01:24:50,120 --> 01:24:53,000
The agents, Kennedy, McKinley and Harrison

1766
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:56,720
had tasked them with quote neutralizing the threat

1767
01:24:56,720 --> 01:24:59,600
and they were supposed to call a phone number.

1768
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:02,560
It'd been about 48 hours since they'd seen the agents

1769
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:05,360
and the agents had given them a 48 hour deadline

1770
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:09,200
so it'd be right about now that they'd be receiving a call

1771
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:12,040
back at the contention police department.

1772
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:13,840
Keith tried giving Drew a call

1773
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:15,960
but it went straight to voicemail.

1774
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:17,840
John pointed out the Glass family

1775
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:20,160
might think Keith is still one of them

1776
01:25:20,160 --> 01:25:22,200
and they definitely think Kevin John

1777
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:23,960
is still one of them as well.

1778
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:26,240
And while Keith may have failed at his mission

1779
01:25:26,240 --> 01:25:28,280
of bringing Stan Manstein back,

1780
01:25:28,280 --> 01:25:31,040
he wouldn't have to infiltrate the Glass building.

1781
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:32,840
He could return under the guise

1782
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:35,720
of bringing in the guy who killed Stan Manstein,

1783
01:25:35,720 --> 01:25:37,000
that being Clark.

1784
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:40,800
Then all three of them would be inside if things go awry.

1785
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:43,240
The plan was to Chewbacca Clark

1786
01:25:43,240 --> 01:25:47,800
and use that farce to get close enough to kill Marvin Glass.

1787
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:50,240
They decided to call the number the agents left them

1788
01:25:50,240 --> 01:25:53,000
on the way to the Glass family compound.

1789
01:25:54,120 --> 01:25:56,400
Suddenly, with an erupting shriek,

1790
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:58,880
a massive creature materialized

1791
01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:01,200
on top of a nearby mausoleum.

1792
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:04,520
It was a six and a half or seven foot tall creature

1793
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:07,440
with long limbs wearing a black suit

1794
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:12,040
over its gaunt frame covered in translucent skin.

1795
01:26:12,040 --> 01:26:14,240
This thing looked Clark Bishop in the eyes

1796
01:26:14,240 --> 01:26:18,720
and screeched, hello subject one, five, two, two, five,

1797
01:26:18,720 --> 01:26:21,920
one, eight, one, nine, five, five, one, eight,

1798
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:25,080
please add me the book, please.

1799
01:26:25,080 --> 01:26:27,160
The figure stared and stuck out

1800
01:26:27,160 --> 01:26:29,800
one of its overtly long arms.

1801
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:33,600
Clark's gun was immediately trained on the mysterious figure.

1802
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:37,760
John reached out a hand in greeting from 20 feet away.

1803
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:40,280
The creature's arm was long, but not that long.

1804
01:26:40,280 --> 01:26:43,160
Keith ran behind the closest mausoleum and hid

1805
01:26:43,160 --> 01:26:44,880
as he pulled out his gun.

1806
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:49,080
Clark felt an internal struggle, but managed to overcome it

1807
01:26:49,080 --> 01:26:52,280
and he continued to hold his gun steady at the creature.

1808
01:26:52,280 --> 01:26:55,600
Please, I would not like to ask again,

1809
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:57,960
please give me the book.

1810
01:26:57,960 --> 01:27:00,520
Clark didn't know what book the creature was talking about.

1811
01:27:00,520 --> 01:27:05,520
The thing asked Kevin Lee John Pettimore the Thirth his name.

1812
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:09,080
Kevin John responded in truth that his name was Kevin John

1813
01:27:09,080 --> 01:27:10,720
and that it was a long story.

1814
01:27:10,720 --> 01:27:12,960
He asked the creature its name.

1815
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:17,160
The creature said its name was four, three, six, two, nine

1816
01:27:17,160 --> 01:27:20,280
and reiterated it was therefore the book.

1817
01:27:20,280 --> 01:27:22,760
Kevin Lee Pettimore the Thirth said again

1818
01:27:22,760 --> 01:27:25,800
that none of them knew which book it was talking about.

1819
01:27:25,800 --> 01:27:30,360
The creature claimed it could feel the book was nearby.

1820
01:27:30,360 --> 01:27:32,400
Clark looked around for Keith and noticed him

1821
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:35,880
behind the mausoleum just as Keith took a shot at the creature

1822
01:27:35,880 --> 01:27:37,920
with his small powerful gun.

1823
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:41,880
The bullet blasted through the creature's arm, but as it did,

1824
01:27:41,880 --> 01:27:47,040
the arm merely dissipated and began to slowly reform.

1825
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:50,120
Before Keith could smell the smoke from his gunshot,

1826
01:27:50,120 --> 01:27:52,120
the creature was standing in front of him

1827
01:27:52,160 --> 01:27:54,360
with a hand on Keith's throat,

1828
01:27:54,360 --> 01:27:58,000
holding him up against the outside of the mausoleum.

1829
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,720
It was as if they had all been standing still

1830
01:28:00,720 --> 01:28:03,720
as the creature walked casually towards him,

1831
01:28:03,720 --> 01:28:07,120
but it moved at an impossible speed.

1832
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:11,120
It was probably like what the crowd saw them doing earlier

1833
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:13,680
during Stan's speech at the funeral.

1834
01:28:13,680 --> 01:28:16,920
It asked Keith his name as it continued holding him

1835
01:28:16,920 --> 01:28:21,160
by the neck and Keith responded immediately with his name

1836
01:28:21,160 --> 01:28:25,000
without ever making the decision to do so.

1837
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,520
He answered the creature's next questions too.

1838
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:28,800
He was here for the funeral

1839
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:30,920
and he was shooting because he was scared.

1840
01:28:30,920 --> 01:28:33,880
The thing slowly placed Keith back on the ground

1841
01:28:33,880 --> 01:28:37,040
and commanded that he not be scared.

1842
01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:41,000
And with that, Keith wasn't scared.

1843
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:44,920
The creature told them it was only there for one thing

1844
01:28:44,920 --> 01:28:48,720
and it would leave as soon as it had the book.

1845
01:28:48,720 --> 01:28:51,440
John told Clark to give it the book.

1846
01:28:51,440 --> 01:28:53,320
Clark stuttered and stammered nervously

1847
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:55,000
insisting he didn't know what book it wanted,

1848
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:56,320
he did not have a book

1849
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:59,280
and all he had were the clothes on his back and a gun.

1850
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:00,880
The creature looked around frantically,

1851
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:03,600
muttered to itself and began freaking out,

1852
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:07,160
unable to understand why Clark didn't have the book.

1853
01:29:07,160 --> 01:29:10,120
Keith searched Ari's coffin for a book.

1854
01:29:10,120 --> 01:29:11,840
All he found was Ari's corpse

1855
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:13,760
and all he achieved was upsetting

1856
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:15,680
the already confused old lady

1857
01:29:15,680 --> 01:29:17,920
who had been left there on her own,

1858
01:29:17,960 --> 01:29:20,680
unable to leave the funeral quickly in her wheelchair.

1859
01:29:20,680 --> 01:29:23,040
Clark asked the creature to describe the book

1860
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:24,480
but the creature only responded

1861
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:27,720
that it was necessary for it to take the book from him

1862
01:29:27,720 --> 01:29:31,720
because Clark's time with the book had come to an end.

1863
01:29:31,720 --> 01:29:34,560
They did not want him using the book any further.

1864
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:36,800
The creature insisted the book was there

1865
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:38,560
and it needed to bring it back.

1866
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:40,600
Keith started shooting the thing again,

1867
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:44,200
it dissipated fully into smoke and ceased to be there.

1868
01:29:44,200 --> 01:29:46,520
Keith lost his shit and attacked Clark,

1869
01:29:46,520 --> 01:29:48,200
paranoid and afraid.

1870
01:29:48,200 --> 01:29:49,760
They eventually calmed him down

1871
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:52,160
with smooth words and quick slaps.

1872
01:29:52,160 --> 01:29:53,120
When he snapped out of it,

1873
01:29:53,120 --> 01:29:55,080
Keith wondered aloud if that thing

1874
01:29:55,080 --> 01:29:57,560
reminded them of Marvin Glass.

1875
01:29:57,560 --> 01:29:59,880
Conversations circled back to the book.

1876
01:29:59,880 --> 01:30:02,280
Clark mentioned he had previously encountered

1877
01:30:02,280 --> 01:30:04,720
a strange book at Jim Cook's house.

1878
01:30:04,720 --> 01:30:06,960
Jim Cook was in the circle of knowledge

1879
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:10,400
and Clark had found a particular leather bound book of his

1880
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:13,160
that was quote, freaky deaky.

1881
01:30:13,160 --> 01:30:15,480
He also described this book as quote,

1882
01:30:15,480 --> 01:30:19,040
extremely grimoire-ish and it had the symbol

1883
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:21,360
of the circle of knowledge on the front.

1884
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:23,840
It was possible that this was the book

1885
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:27,080
the creature had wanted but he hadn't taken it.

1886
01:30:27,080 --> 01:30:29,720
Keith asked if Clark opened this book.

1887
01:30:29,720 --> 01:30:33,400
Clark reiterated its freaky deaky nature.

1888
01:30:33,400 --> 01:30:36,600
He could only open it to the last page.

1889
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:39,480
It was held shut by some unseen force.

1890
01:30:39,480 --> 01:30:41,680
Keith asked if he meant like magnets

1891
01:30:41,680 --> 01:30:43,200
to which Clark agreed.

1892
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:44,840
There on the final page,

1893
01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:47,320
Clark had seen a drawing of a hooded figure

1894
01:30:47,320 --> 01:30:49,240
with light coming out of its mouth.

1895
01:30:49,240 --> 01:30:52,120
Written over and over and over on top of that

1896
01:30:52,120 --> 01:30:54,520
covering the whole page it read,

1897
01:30:54,520 --> 01:30:58,880
it is only through death that he may rise again.

1898
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:02,360
Clark went on and explained it was some kind of sacred text

1899
01:31:02,360 --> 01:31:04,000
within the circle of knowledge.

1900
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:08,760
Something to do with the revelation of the overseer.

1901
01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:11,920
Clark thought the overseer was maybe a good guy

1902
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:15,400
who lays peace on the world or something like that.

1903
01:31:15,400 --> 01:31:18,320
John remembered when he saw old Clark,

1904
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:21,120
he was wearing robes and he and dead Clark

1905
01:31:21,120 --> 01:31:24,440
disappeared into a bright light that came from his mouth.

1906
01:31:24,440 --> 01:31:26,040
Keith was confused about what he meant

1907
01:31:26,040 --> 01:31:28,080
by old Clark and dead Clark.

1908
01:31:28,080 --> 01:31:30,800
John unhelpfully clarified the Clark

1909
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:33,400
that brought this Clark back to life.

1910
01:31:33,400 --> 01:31:35,240
Keith defended that this was the first

1911
01:31:35,240 --> 01:31:37,400
he was hearing about it and they seemed

1912
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:39,800
to already know a lot more than he did.

1913
01:31:39,800 --> 01:31:42,560
All John saw was an older version of Clark show up

1914
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:44,040
that light came out of his mouth

1915
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:46,680
and then he reached into regular Clark

1916
01:31:46,680 --> 01:31:48,160
and they both disappeared.

1917
01:31:48,160 --> 01:31:51,040
That made total sense to Keith and they all agreed.

1918
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:54,160
John suddenly remembered he'd arrived with Rosemary.

1919
01:31:54,160 --> 01:31:56,200
Looking around John didn't see Rosemary

1920
01:31:56,200 --> 01:32:00,200
but he did see two city police officers headed their way.

1921
01:32:00,200 --> 01:32:02,280
He warned the others they should skedaddle

1922
01:32:02,280 --> 01:32:05,240
but they all kept talking, failed to escape notice

1923
01:32:05,240 --> 01:32:07,160
and were told to freeze.

1924
01:32:07,160 --> 01:32:09,120
Clark turned still with gun in hand

1925
01:32:09,120 --> 01:32:11,360
and told the officers everything was fine,

1926
01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:13,000
that they were contention PD.

1927
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,480
The city cops said they were responding

1928
01:32:15,480 --> 01:32:17,160
because shots were fired.

1929
01:32:17,160 --> 01:32:19,960
Keith said it was a 21 gun salute

1930
01:32:19,960 --> 01:32:23,440
and called the officers, quote, motherfuckers.

1931
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:26,880
The city officers brought out notebooks to take statements.

1932
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:28,440
Kevin John then approached,

1933
01:32:28,440 --> 01:32:31,760
pulled out a dirty dog grooming loyalty card

1934
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:34,760
and suggested the officers not bother.

1935
01:32:34,760 --> 01:32:37,760
He was with Mr. Glass.

1936
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:41,240
They whispered to one another and quickly apologized.

1937
01:32:41,240 --> 01:32:43,040
They started to ask Kevin to apologize

1938
01:32:43,040 --> 01:32:44,560
on their behalf to Mr. Glass

1939
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:46,400
but quickly changed their minds

1940
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:48,560
covering the names on their badges

1941
01:32:48,560 --> 01:32:51,640
and turning away before they hoofed it out of there.

1942
01:32:51,640 --> 01:32:53,760
John shared that the loyalty card

1943
01:32:53,760 --> 01:32:56,840
opened the door to the den of sin.

1944
01:32:56,840 --> 01:32:58,880
You know, the place where they were held

1945
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:01,400
and forced into those cage fights.

1946
01:33:01,400 --> 01:33:03,480
He had seen a bunch of rowdy degenerates

1947
01:33:03,480 --> 01:33:07,120
use theirs to open an entrance in the ground of an alley.

1948
01:33:07,120 --> 01:33:10,200
There were still a bunch of Android bodies lying around

1949
01:33:10,200 --> 01:33:14,200
and no one had actually put the casket in the tomb.

1950
01:33:14,200 --> 01:33:18,400
Together, they picked up the coffin of Ari Manstein.

1951
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:21,920
As they entered the open mausoleum, they heard a voice.

1952
01:33:21,920 --> 01:33:24,120
Clark recognized the voice the quickest

1953
01:33:24,120 --> 01:33:28,160
because it sounded so much like his own.

1954
01:33:28,160 --> 01:33:31,600
Little sparks of light could be seen in the darkness.

1955
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:34,440
They seemed to be ignited by the steady chanting

1956
01:33:34,440 --> 01:33:36,760
which echoed throughout the room.

1957
01:33:36,760 --> 01:33:39,960
The flickering light illuminated a piece of parchment

1958
01:33:39,960 --> 01:33:43,800
held by an old Clark Bishop wearing a dark cloak

1959
01:33:43,800 --> 01:33:46,520
which covered almost all of his face.

1960
01:33:46,520 --> 01:33:49,800
A light began to emanate from his mouth.

1961
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:53,160
The words he chanted ignited lifted from the page

1962
01:33:53,160 --> 01:33:56,640
in front of him and danced in a circle above them.

1963
01:33:56,640 --> 01:33:59,280
His lifted hands were cut open

1964
01:33:59,280 --> 01:34:03,200
and bled out onto the floor around them.

1965
01:34:03,200 --> 01:34:05,640
John and Clark instinctively dropped their support

1966
01:34:05,640 --> 01:34:09,600
of the coffin leaving Keith as the sole bearer of the wait.

1967
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:11,560
The coffin hit the ground.

1968
01:34:11,560 --> 01:34:14,080
Ari's corpse plopped limply out

1969
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:18,840
and onto the blood-soaked floor of the cold and dusty crypt.

1970
01:34:18,840 --> 01:34:20,800
The three of them were surrounded

1971
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:23,640
by this magically sashaying fire.

1972
01:34:23,640 --> 01:34:27,320
It covered them in a warm, somewhat familiar light.

1973
01:34:27,320 --> 01:34:29,080
The light should have been comforting

1974
01:34:29,080 --> 01:34:31,720
but Clark was overwhelmed with the urge to leap

1975
01:34:31,720 --> 01:34:33,760
at the older version of himself.

1976
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:38,520
He lunged, grabbed two handfuls of an empty cloak

1977
01:34:38,520 --> 01:34:42,960
and smashed his face against the back wall of the mausoleum.

1978
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:48,280
The boys woke up with a shock through their bodies.

1979
01:34:48,280 --> 01:34:53,200
It was dark and cold and smelled sweet and savory.

1980
01:34:53,200 --> 01:34:54,640
There was a pool of blood.

1981
01:34:54,640 --> 01:34:57,400
In it rested the body of Ari Manstein

1982
01:34:57,440 --> 01:34:59,960
half hanging out of her broken coffin.

1983
01:34:59,960 --> 01:35:02,720
John Lee Kevin Moore was in black tactical gear.

1984
01:35:02,720 --> 01:35:04,600
Keith wore a tight orange polo

1985
01:35:04,600 --> 01:35:07,400
with big coral blue shorts and boat shoes.

1986
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:11,040
Clark donned a vintage contention police uniform.

1987
01:35:11,040 --> 01:35:14,200
They felt pain on their chests, on their backs

1988
01:35:14,200 --> 01:35:16,560
and on the bottom of their left feet

1989
01:35:16,560 --> 01:35:20,160
and in the palm of their dominant hands.

1990
01:35:20,160 --> 01:35:24,160
Branded into each of these body parts were first names.

1991
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:27,240
Their chests each read Marvin.

1992
01:35:28,080 --> 01:35:29,280
Their backs Drew.

1993
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:31,720
Their left souls Maggie.

1994
01:35:31,720 --> 01:35:35,000
And their dominant palms Tildy.

1995
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,120
Under the burned name of Maggie

1996
01:35:37,120 --> 01:35:38,960
on the bottom of Clark's left foot,

1997
01:35:38,960 --> 01:35:43,600
the skin had been eaten away in a very particular pattern.

1998
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:47,720
A circle surrounded by six smaller circles.

1999
01:35:50,120 --> 01:35:53,760
Clark went mad and rushed John Lee Kevin Moore screaming.

2000
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:57,400
John quickly drew his gun and shot Clark in the leg.

2001
01:35:57,400 --> 01:35:59,480
They all agreed on a few things.

2002
01:35:59,480 --> 01:36:01,360
They were scared and confused.

2003
01:36:01,360 --> 01:36:04,160
They didn't know what the names on their bodies meant

2004
01:36:04,160 --> 01:36:06,400
and they needed to see a doctor.

2005
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:09,480
At the clinic, the officers billed the visit

2006
01:36:09,480 --> 01:36:12,040
to the first church of contention.

2007
01:36:12,040 --> 01:36:13,720
On the way to Jim Cook's house,

2008
01:36:13,720 --> 01:36:16,920
Keith called the number Agent Kennedy left behind.

2009
01:36:16,920 --> 01:36:19,200
He identified the officers involved,

2010
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:21,920
disclosed the incursion had not been stopped

2011
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:24,160
but that the incident had been covered up

2012
01:36:24,160 --> 01:36:26,800
and asked to speak to the FBI officers

2013
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:28,760
instead of a recording.

2014
01:36:28,760 --> 01:36:33,120
In Jim's house, there were papers and binders everywhere.

2015
01:36:33,120 --> 01:36:35,440
Clark grabbed the book they had discussed,

2016
01:36:35,440 --> 01:36:38,080
the one with the circle of knowledge logo on it.

2017
01:36:38,080 --> 01:36:40,280
The only page they could open to

2018
01:36:40,280 --> 01:36:43,280
was marked with a girthy wooden bookmark.

2019
01:36:43,280 --> 01:36:44,680
The page read,

2020
01:36:44,680 --> 01:36:48,760
it is only through death that he may rise again.

2021
01:36:48,760 --> 01:36:51,320
Over and over and over behind the image

2022
01:36:51,320 --> 01:36:54,880
of a hooded figure with light shining from its mouth.

2023
01:36:54,880 --> 01:36:57,240
Clark then revealed an envelope

2024
01:36:57,240 --> 01:36:59,680
containing a letter from Jim Cook.

2025
01:36:59,680 --> 01:37:01,840
His letter's intent was to quote,

2026
01:37:01,840 --> 01:37:04,800
refute the revelation of the overseer,

2027
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:09,280
which it called quote, the scratches of a broken man.

2028
01:37:09,280 --> 01:37:11,880
The letter ordered the immediate reassignment

2029
01:37:11,880 --> 01:37:15,800
of all members of the disposal unit.

2030
01:37:15,800 --> 01:37:17,840
The header of the letter read,

2031
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:21,560
faith through knowledge is just called knowledge.

2032
01:37:21,560 --> 01:37:24,080
The other interesting items Clark had found

2033
01:37:24,080 --> 01:37:26,800
included a ring, smooth and silver

2034
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:28,920
with a little plateau on top.

2035
01:37:28,920 --> 01:37:31,600
Keith put the ring on and when slipped on his finger,

2036
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:35,360
the ring glowed and revealed a familiar symbol,

2037
01:37:35,360 --> 01:37:39,680
an M made of four double helices.

2038
01:37:39,680 --> 01:37:43,080
Keith made the ring into a necklace with his shoelace

2039
01:37:43,080 --> 01:37:44,200
and wore it.

2040
01:37:44,200 --> 01:37:46,520
A drop of vodka hit Clark's nose.

2041
01:37:46,520 --> 01:37:48,640
It dripped from the ceiling above him.

2042
01:37:48,640 --> 01:37:51,280
The boys went upstairs but couldn't find a room

2043
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:54,040
where the vodka drip would have come from.

2044
01:37:54,040 --> 01:37:56,320
Clark put his ear to the wall where that room

2045
01:37:56,320 --> 01:37:59,440
should have been and he heard static.

2046
01:37:59,440 --> 01:38:01,640
Unable to find the door to this hidden room,

2047
01:38:01,640 --> 01:38:04,760
Keith kicked a hole through the wall where the room would be.

2048
01:38:04,760 --> 01:38:06,520
Keith landed on the other side of the wall,

2049
01:38:06,520 --> 01:38:10,080
pushed through by his colleagues and covered in debris.

2050
01:38:10,080 --> 01:38:13,240
Inside, they found a small living room setup.

2051
01:38:13,240 --> 01:38:16,760
A chair with an end table faced a TV VCR unit

2052
01:38:16,760 --> 01:38:20,120
that set atop a pile of thick books.

2053
01:38:20,120 --> 01:38:23,480
A desk and a chair were pressed up against one wall

2054
01:38:23,480 --> 01:38:27,640
and a handle of vodka had tipped over on the floor nearby.

2055
01:38:27,640 --> 01:38:29,600
Its contents soaked the carpet

2056
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:32,440
that barely covered a makeshift floor.

2057
01:38:32,440 --> 01:38:34,640
Clark noted a proper door in this room

2058
01:38:34,640 --> 01:38:37,000
that led into the upstairs hallway.

2059
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,080
Static played on the television

2060
01:38:39,080 --> 01:38:42,400
and illuminated the titles of the tomes underneath,

2061
01:38:42,400 --> 01:38:46,080
textbooks on physics and quantum mechanics.

2062
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:50,120
On the end table sat a small vial of clear liquid,

2063
01:38:50,120 --> 01:38:53,040
a scalpel and a box of tissues.

2064
01:38:53,040 --> 01:38:56,000
Keith twisted the top off the vial and wafted it

2065
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:59,520
into his nose but smelled nothing and suffered no ill effects.

2066
01:38:59,520 --> 01:39:02,800
He slipped the vial into one of his spacious pockets.

2067
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:06,880
The TV VCR unit had no input cable or antenna,

2068
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:11,880
a tape labeled Bishops WOF was discovered inside the unit.

2069
01:39:12,920 --> 01:39:16,680
It contained an episode of Wheel of Fortune,

2070
01:39:16,680 --> 01:39:18,520
a special couples episode

2071
01:39:18,520 --> 01:39:21,120
on which Clark's parents were contestants.

2072
01:39:21,120 --> 01:39:22,480
They had just been married

2073
01:39:22,480 --> 01:39:25,120
and were hoping to win money for their honeymoon.

2074
01:39:25,120 --> 01:39:28,400
On the desk were three folders and an envelope.

2075
01:39:28,400 --> 01:39:31,440
The first folder contained a large stack of papers

2076
01:39:31,440 --> 01:39:34,120
regarding Operation Stapler.

2077
01:39:34,120 --> 01:39:37,400
The double helix M logo appeared on the second page

2078
01:39:37,400 --> 01:39:40,320
above the word myriad.

2079
01:39:40,320 --> 01:39:41,920
Keith flipped to the index

2080
01:39:41,920 --> 01:39:43,840
and gleaned that it was the work of someone

2081
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:47,640
who had been tasked with rewriting an existing program

2082
01:39:47,640 --> 01:39:50,360
put in place to create androids.

2083
01:39:50,360 --> 01:39:53,880
This respect operation aimed to cut costs

2084
01:39:53,880 --> 01:39:56,320
and sell to private companies.

2085
01:39:56,320 --> 01:40:00,240
John Googled myriad and the screen briefly wobbled

2086
01:40:00,240 --> 01:40:04,160
before returning to normal with no clear results.

2087
01:40:04,160 --> 01:40:08,520
The second folder was entitled Operation Hole Puncher.

2088
01:40:08,520 --> 01:40:11,120
The title page included the name and symbol

2089
01:40:11,120 --> 01:40:13,160
of the circle of knowledge.

2090
01:40:13,160 --> 01:40:16,360
This folder contained a list of companies,

2091
01:40:16,360 --> 01:40:21,360
mostly nonprofits, think tanks, charities and universities.

2092
01:40:21,600 --> 01:40:26,120
The third folder referred to Operation Three Ring Binder

2093
01:40:26,120 --> 01:40:30,440
and was empty except for a dirty dog grooming key fob

2094
01:40:30,440 --> 01:40:32,200
tucked into the pocket.

2095
01:40:32,200 --> 01:40:34,040
Clark's parents did well on the show,

2096
01:40:34,040 --> 01:40:36,400
eventually making it to the bonus round.

2097
01:40:36,400 --> 01:40:38,280
As the final puzzle was displayed,

2098
01:40:38,280 --> 01:40:41,720
Clark's mom turned to his dad and said,

2099
01:40:41,720 --> 01:40:44,240
we were already given the best letters.

2100
01:40:44,240 --> 01:40:46,920
They solved the final puzzle and won the prize,

2101
01:40:46,920 --> 01:40:48,280
a honeymoon.

2102
01:40:48,280 --> 01:40:52,320
Clark noticed the tape in the VCR showed a great deal

2103
01:40:52,320 --> 01:40:55,840
of wear like it had been played many times.

2104
01:40:55,840 --> 01:40:58,320
John opened the envelope and found the symbol

2105
01:40:58,320 --> 01:41:00,280
of the circle of knowledge at the top.

2106
01:41:00,280 --> 01:41:04,440
It said, faith through knowledge is just called knowledge.

2107
01:41:04,440 --> 01:41:07,640
Fellow keepers, it is with great sadness

2108
01:41:07,640 --> 01:41:08,920
that I write to you.

2109
01:41:08,920 --> 01:41:11,840
I fear a change is coming.

2110
01:41:11,840 --> 01:41:15,680
I cannot be certain, but I suspect there's one among us

2111
01:41:15,680 --> 01:41:18,200
scheming with treacherous intent.

2112
01:41:18,200 --> 01:41:20,760
I have recently grown a tail.

2113
01:41:20,760 --> 01:41:24,320
He is not particularly skilled in going unnoticed.

2114
01:41:24,320 --> 01:41:27,640
He is an odd little man with round glasses

2115
01:41:27,640 --> 01:41:31,080
on a fat face with no hair and no chin.

2116
01:41:31,080 --> 01:41:35,480
He is a journalist fired for trying to write an expose

2117
01:41:35,480 --> 01:41:37,080
on Marvin Glass.

2118
01:41:37,080 --> 01:41:41,840
Stay alert, step carefully, we are being watched.

2119
01:41:41,840 --> 01:41:44,040
Signed, Jim Cook.

2120
01:41:44,040 --> 01:41:46,440
Several individual letters in this letter

2121
01:41:46,440 --> 01:41:50,920
were over or underlined and the men quickly found the name

2122
01:41:50,920 --> 01:41:54,800
Maggie Cook was coded into the message.

2123
01:41:54,800 --> 01:41:58,200
They inferred Jim thought his daughter might be the traitor

2124
01:41:58,200 --> 01:42:00,640
inside the circle of knowledge.

2125
01:42:00,640 --> 01:42:03,400
The officers discussed the order of Jim's letters,

2126
01:42:03,400 --> 01:42:06,440
the connection between Chief Cook and Harold Dorsey,

2127
01:42:06,440 --> 01:42:09,680
the resurrection of Maggie and the lurking horror

2128
01:42:09,680 --> 01:42:13,520
she'd revealed to Clark through the Xenonematode.

2129
01:42:13,520 --> 01:42:15,760
The men didn't come to any clear conclusions,

2130
01:42:15,760 --> 01:42:19,040
but agreed Marvin Glass was the most addressable threat

2131
01:42:19,040 --> 01:42:20,120
they had.

2132
01:42:20,160 --> 01:42:23,040
With that, they resolved to storm the gates

2133
01:42:23,040 --> 01:42:27,320
of the Glass compound using Clark as a false hostage.

2134
01:42:27,320 --> 01:42:29,920
On the way, John mentioned the Glass company card

2135
01:42:29,920 --> 01:42:34,600
for Large Eddie's Gun Emporium in Kevin's pocket.

2136
01:42:34,600 --> 01:42:37,400
Large Eddie himself kicked open the door to the back

2137
01:42:37,400 --> 01:42:39,920
where he kept all the cool guns.

2138
01:42:39,920 --> 01:42:42,960
The renegade officers equipped themselves with a sampler

2139
01:42:42,960 --> 01:42:46,920
of grenades and firearms and drove to the secret entrance

2140
01:42:46,920 --> 01:42:50,760
of the Den of Sin in the heart of the city.

2141
01:42:50,760 --> 01:42:53,840
There, as John pulled out the dirty dog grooming

2142
01:42:53,840 --> 01:42:58,200
loyalty key fob, the great gave way beneath the men's feet

2143
01:42:58,200 --> 01:43:01,640
and they plummeted into darkness below.

2144
01:43:01,640 --> 01:43:03,960
As they fell downward into darkness,

2145
01:43:03,960 --> 01:43:08,040
the former cops slowed to a feeling of weightlessness

2146
01:43:08,040 --> 01:43:11,280
before being abruptly confronted with a bright light,

2147
01:43:11,280 --> 01:43:13,840
huge words in a spray painted font

2148
01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:16,960
and a deafening voiceover saying the same,

2149
01:43:16,960 --> 01:43:20,320
welcome to the scrap pit.

2150
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:23,880
A video screen showed them an enormous Glass arena

2151
01:43:23,880 --> 01:43:27,360
with hundreds of screaming spectators

2152
01:43:27,360 --> 01:43:29,960
and a shadowy form began to emerge,

2153
01:43:29,960 --> 01:43:32,520
but before this person could even hit the lights

2154
01:43:32,520 --> 01:43:36,960
of the arena, a giant metal tentacle erupted into view,

2155
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:40,600
gripping the humanoid being and ripping it out of frame.

2156
01:43:40,600 --> 01:43:43,400
The screen faded to black and they found themselves

2157
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:48,760
in an oily obsidian room with an entrance to the scrap pit

2158
01:43:48,760 --> 01:43:53,160
and a separate door guarded by two fishmen armed with scythes.

2159
01:43:53,160 --> 01:43:55,960
On seeing the officers, the guards moved

2160
01:43:55,960 --> 01:43:57,880
to let them through this door.

2161
01:43:57,880 --> 01:44:01,800
Keith and John marched Clark through and into an elevator

2162
01:44:01,800 --> 01:44:05,000
as if he were their prisoner.

2163
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:06,880
The elevator door opened

2164
01:44:06,880 --> 01:44:10,080
and they saw five malnourished children

2165
01:44:10,120 --> 01:44:14,480
along with Oz, Mayhem, Wolf, passed out on the floor,

2166
01:44:14,480 --> 01:44:19,280
attended to by grandmotherly old women in identical clothes.

2167
01:44:19,280 --> 01:44:22,200
These women poured a liquid into the mouths

2168
01:44:22,200 --> 01:44:24,480
of the unconscious bodies.

2169
01:44:24,480 --> 01:44:28,240
Keith and John both saw a ghostly black dog

2170
01:44:28,240 --> 01:44:32,320
and red lion diving in and out of the bodies.

2171
01:44:32,320 --> 01:44:34,320
One of the women entered the elevator

2172
01:44:34,320 --> 01:44:37,840
with our heroes inside and it continued moving.

2173
01:44:37,840 --> 01:44:40,280
She introduced herself as Ursula

2174
01:44:40,280 --> 01:44:45,280
and explained her role in preparing the sacrifices.

2175
01:44:45,680 --> 01:44:50,160
The boys exited the elevator into a massive foggy room

2176
01:44:50,160 --> 01:44:52,600
that contained a network of catwalks

2177
01:44:52,600 --> 01:44:55,600
over dark green murky water.

2178
01:44:55,600 --> 01:45:00,280
The fishiness was pungent, rusty moss covered chains,

2179
01:45:00,280 --> 01:45:03,400
dangled large hooks between the catwalks

2180
01:45:03,560 --> 01:45:07,880
and some of these hooks suspended prisoners above the water.

2181
01:45:07,880 --> 01:45:10,760
Doug Jacobs in the body of Agent Trent Chad

2182
01:45:10,760 --> 01:45:13,480
was one of these unlucky folks.

2183
01:45:13,480 --> 01:45:15,800
When he saw them, he freaked out

2184
01:45:15,800 --> 01:45:17,680
at their return from the grave.

2185
01:45:17,680 --> 01:45:22,080
This entire chamber was seemingly patrolled by one fish man

2186
01:45:22,080 --> 01:45:24,840
and Francis Beanes could be heard questioning

2187
01:45:24,840 --> 01:45:29,440
Cathy and George Piston deeper into the cavernous space.

2188
01:45:29,440 --> 01:45:33,000
Francis asked Cathy Piston about silver spheres

2189
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:37,760
as well as the residue and outbreak in contention

2190
01:45:37,760 --> 01:45:41,680
while dipping a clearly distressed George Piston

2191
01:45:41,680 --> 01:45:44,880
slowly into the murky water.

2192
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:47,160
Kevin John got Francis's attention

2193
01:45:47,160 --> 01:45:48,960
and told her that they'd brought Clark

2194
01:45:48,960 --> 01:45:50,280
as a prisoner to torture

2195
01:45:50,280 --> 01:45:52,800
and that Marvin wanted to see her right then.

2196
01:45:52,800 --> 01:45:54,960
She was not convinced to leave immediately

2197
01:45:54,960 --> 01:45:57,320
so Keith resorted to his backup plan.

2198
01:45:57,320 --> 01:46:00,280
He tried to whack her with his heavy metal hand.

2199
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:03,560
He missed and Francis threw him into the water.

2200
01:46:03,560 --> 01:46:04,720
She was about to run for it

2201
01:46:04,720 --> 01:46:07,240
but Kevin John persuaded her to stay

2202
01:46:07,240 --> 01:46:10,400
for more of her beloved torturing.

2203
01:46:10,400 --> 01:46:12,120
At that moment, it occurred to Keith

2204
01:46:12,120 --> 01:46:14,960
he might be swimming with the giant creature

2205
01:46:14,960 --> 01:46:18,240
that ate his little fish friend, Peter Dieter.

2206
01:46:18,240 --> 01:46:22,480
Keith freaked out and began to climb up George Piston.

2207
01:46:22,480 --> 01:46:27,080
Erupting up out of the water just under Keith's boat shoes,

2208
01:46:27,080 --> 01:46:31,760
the massive creature swallowed both Keith and George

2209
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:36,400
and re-submerged into the vast murky pool.

2210
01:46:36,400 --> 01:46:39,080
Clark, John, and Francis watched

2211
01:46:39,080 --> 01:46:42,480
as the water began to calm in front of them.

2212
01:46:42,480 --> 01:46:46,000
Francis Beans, unaffected by the apparent death

2213
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:49,640
of her uncle, prepared to hang Clark up for some torturing

2214
01:46:49,640 --> 01:46:52,880
which prompted a failed sneak attack from John.

2215
01:46:52,880 --> 01:46:55,440
Francis countered by pushing the hook

2216
01:46:55,480 --> 01:46:58,200
directly through John's shoulder.

2217
01:46:58,200 --> 01:47:00,720
Clark kicked her right over the edge into the water

2218
01:47:00,720 --> 01:47:03,880
and she clanged her head on the railing as she went.

2219
01:47:03,880 --> 01:47:06,280
The soon to be corpse of Francis Beans

2220
01:47:06,280 --> 01:47:08,960
floated face down in the water.

2221
01:47:08,960 --> 01:47:10,560
Keith Bigna and George Piston

2222
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:14,000
were inside an enormous creature.

2223
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,320
They tried to claw and push their way out

2224
01:47:16,320 --> 01:47:20,480
as the disgusting, burning ooze inside the beast

2225
01:47:20,480 --> 01:47:23,560
slowly digested them.

2226
01:47:23,560 --> 01:47:26,760
Keith used George Piston as a human shield

2227
01:47:26,760 --> 01:47:30,280
and blasted out of this fish monster's side

2228
01:47:30,280 --> 01:47:31,760
with a frag grenade.

2229
01:47:32,800 --> 01:47:35,800
While gazing down at the floating body of Francis Beans,

2230
01:47:35,800 --> 01:47:39,000
Clark and John saw a flash of light deep under the water

2231
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:42,480
followed by bubbles and a gasping Keith of Igna,

2232
01:47:42,480 --> 01:47:44,440
skin covered in burns.

2233
01:47:44,440 --> 01:47:46,640
They pulled him out and Keith broke the news

2234
01:47:46,640 --> 01:47:50,560
of George's death to Kathy in a typically kind

2235
01:47:50,560 --> 01:47:54,400
and sensitive manner, sparing no details.

2236
01:47:54,400 --> 01:47:57,440
The boys decided to leave Francis Beans to her fate

2237
01:47:57,440 --> 01:48:00,600
and continued to question the hanging Kathy Piston

2238
01:48:00,600 --> 01:48:03,480
about why she was supplying people

2239
01:48:03,480 --> 01:48:05,120
to the Circle of Knowledge.

2240
01:48:05,120 --> 01:48:06,840
Clark admitted he already knew why

2241
01:48:06,840 --> 01:48:09,520
and told Kathy he was working with Maggie.

2242
01:48:09,520 --> 01:48:12,360
Kathy agreed to help the team take down Marvin Glass

2243
01:48:12,360 --> 01:48:15,600
if they just explained where Leo was.

2244
01:48:15,600 --> 01:48:18,880
They told her he disappeared from this plane of existence

2245
01:48:18,880 --> 01:48:21,040
and they blamed it on Marvin Glass.

2246
01:48:21,040 --> 01:48:24,560
Even though she was awful human trafficking scum,

2247
01:48:24,560 --> 01:48:28,520
her crack shot ability was a necessary addition.

2248
01:48:28,520 --> 01:48:31,480
John and Keith pulled down the hanging Doug Jacobs

2249
01:48:31,480 --> 01:48:33,760
in the body of Agent Chad.

2250
01:48:33,760 --> 01:48:37,520
Clark discreetly asked Kathy her opinion on Maggie.

2251
01:48:37,520 --> 01:48:40,480
She said Jim's daughter was rougher around the edges

2252
01:48:40,480 --> 01:48:43,700
than her dad, but Kathy had been too busy at the hospital

2253
01:48:43,700 --> 01:48:45,840
to pay too close attention.

2254
01:48:45,840 --> 01:48:48,400
Clark told her the truth about Leo's last hours

2255
01:48:48,400 --> 01:48:51,560
and about how he had killed Julie.

2256
01:48:51,560 --> 01:48:55,360
On the metal catwalk above the hazy greenish water stood

2257
01:48:55,360 --> 01:48:57,840
Clark Bishop, John Lee Pettymore IV

2258
01:48:57,840 --> 01:49:00,640
in the body of his father, John Lee Pettymore III,

2259
01:49:00,640 --> 01:49:03,780
AKA Kevin, Keith Vigna, Kathy Piston,

2260
01:49:03,780 --> 01:49:06,960
and Doug Jacobs in the body of Agent Trent Chad.

2261
01:49:06,960 --> 01:49:11,160
Their goal, leave this enormous dank prison alive.

2262
01:49:11,160 --> 01:49:15,280
The only exit they could see, a closed elevator door.

2263
01:49:15,280 --> 01:49:18,360
The issue, fishmen in brown jumpsuits

2264
01:49:18,360 --> 01:49:22,040
with mouths full of human teeth and scythes.

2265
01:49:22,040 --> 01:49:26,120
And those human teeth mouths, they were singing.

2266
01:49:37,320 --> 01:49:40,040
This song's purpose was revealed

2267
01:49:40,040 --> 01:49:43,040
when the catwalk was dragged down into the water

2268
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:46,040
by a massive version of the fishmen,

2269
01:49:46,040 --> 01:49:50,160
an enormous creature with a huge pus-leaking wound

2270
01:49:50,160 --> 01:49:53,840
in its side and a hunger in its eyes.

2271
01:49:53,840 --> 01:49:56,460
The monster dug into Keith's chest

2272
01:49:56,460 --> 01:49:58,720
and ripped its claws through his skin,

2273
01:49:58,720 --> 01:50:01,000
revealing metal insides.

2274
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:04,420
The pain was too much for Keith Vigna to bear,

2275
01:50:04,420 --> 01:50:08,080
and he passed out on the metal walkway.

2276
01:50:08,080 --> 01:50:11,160
Keith, in the darkness you see a woman

2277
01:50:11,160 --> 01:50:13,540
wearing old-timey clothing.

2278
01:50:13,540 --> 01:50:16,340
She looks very normal, except for the hole

2279
01:50:16,340 --> 01:50:18,160
right in the middle of her head.

2280
01:50:18,160 --> 01:50:21,120
Regardless of how she turns to look, either way,

2281
01:50:21,120 --> 01:50:24,440
you can see right through the middle of her head,

2282
01:50:24,440 --> 01:50:26,320
and she is walking toward you.

2283
01:50:26,320 --> 01:50:30,200
As she walks, her clothes change multiple times,

2284
01:50:30,200 --> 01:50:33,540
as if she's in an unnatural fashion show

2285
01:50:33,540 --> 01:50:37,000
that's moving forward in time, decade by decade.

2286
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:40,560
She pulls out a Zippo lighter, and as it hits the ground,

2287
01:50:40,560 --> 01:50:45,440
you see the house of Chief Maggie Cook go up in flames.

2288
01:50:45,440 --> 01:50:47,400
You saw this happen in the front yard,

2289
01:50:47,400 --> 01:50:51,400
but this time, right now, you see it from the backyard.

2290
01:50:51,400 --> 01:50:54,240
The fire spreads and explodes toward you,

2291
01:50:54,240 --> 01:50:56,820
over you, through you, and you turn around

2292
01:50:56,820 --> 01:51:00,840
to see these flames ignite the pond, Bean's Pond,

2293
01:51:00,840 --> 01:51:04,460
and immediately, the water evaporates.

2294
01:51:04,460 --> 01:51:08,400
Looking down into a dry basin filled with fish

2295
01:51:08,400 --> 01:51:11,640
flopping their final flops, you see your brother,

2296
01:51:11,640 --> 01:51:15,460
Ferguson Beans, crouched over a hatch in the ground,

2297
01:51:15,460 --> 01:51:18,720
wearing a cowboy hat and spurs,

2298
01:51:18,720 --> 01:51:21,960
and the watch your father, William, gave him.

2299
01:51:21,960 --> 01:51:24,920
You look down on your wrist, and the watch is there.

2300
01:51:24,920 --> 01:51:28,680
You look up, and the pond is filled with water and animals,

2301
01:51:28,680 --> 01:51:31,520
until the B. Mitchell comes walking up

2302
01:51:31,520 --> 01:51:33,520
out of the water toward you,

2303
01:51:33,520 --> 01:51:36,800
and darkness fills your vision once more.

2304
01:51:38,400 --> 01:51:40,880
Outside of Keith's unconscious dreams,

2305
01:51:40,880 --> 01:51:43,620
the fight continued, the water was still murky,

2306
01:51:43,620 --> 01:51:46,120
the air was still heavy, the fishman's teeth

2307
01:51:46,120 --> 01:51:49,040
were still unsettling, and the elevator door

2308
01:51:49,040 --> 01:51:51,520
had still yet to open.

2309
01:51:51,520 --> 01:51:54,160
Bullets whizzed around the enormous prison.

2310
01:51:54,160 --> 01:51:56,280
Flash bangs erupted and flashed.

2311
01:51:56,280 --> 01:51:58,900
Doug Jacobs, in the body of Agent Trent Chad,

2312
01:51:58,900 --> 01:52:02,840
was decapitated by the scythe of a fishy humanoid.

2313
01:52:02,840 --> 01:52:05,860
Kathy Piston likely saved all of their lives

2314
01:52:05,860 --> 01:52:09,220
with her nonstop firearms proficiency.

2315
01:52:09,220 --> 01:52:12,980
Grenades destroyed entire sections of the catwalk,

2316
01:52:12,980 --> 01:52:15,180
and persuaded the enormous fish monster

2317
01:52:15,180 --> 01:52:18,220
to dive back down below the surface.

2318
01:52:18,220 --> 01:52:21,380
One of the human-sized bipedal amphibians

2319
01:52:21,380 --> 01:52:26,100
lodged its scythe into the skull of Kathy Piston.

2320
01:52:26,100 --> 01:52:29,600
John was swallowed whole by the big daddy fish monster,

2321
01:52:29,600 --> 01:52:32,940
but he swam out through the hole Keith had previously made.

2322
01:52:33,020 --> 01:52:35,940
He saw another creature make an escape as well,

2323
01:52:35,940 --> 01:52:40,400
a little toy-sized human body with the head of a fish.

2324
01:52:40,400 --> 01:52:44,220
However, an unseen force suddenly grabbed John

2325
01:52:44,220 --> 01:52:47,880
and dragged his body down to the bottom of the tank,

2326
01:52:47,880 --> 01:52:51,860
up against the glass of this gargantuan aquarium.

2327
01:52:51,860 --> 01:52:55,180
John was forced to stare directly

2328
01:52:55,180 --> 01:52:59,740
into the unblinking eyes of Marvin Glass,

2329
01:52:59,780 --> 01:53:03,460
and as John Lee Kevinmore the thirst's lungs

2330
01:53:03,460 --> 01:53:08,140
filled with water, Marvin Glass smiled.

2331
01:53:10,620 --> 01:53:14,180
Clark stood on a wet, partially destroyed catwalk

2332
01:53:14,180 --> 01:53:17,780
with Keith in his arms with nowhere to escape to

2333
01:53:17,780 --> 01:53:21,300
across from the last standing fishman.

2334
01:53:21,300 --> 01:53:24,020
The human amphibian swung wide,

2335
01:53:24,020 --> 01:53:27,220
and Clark stabbed it to death with its own scythe.

2336
01:53:27,380 --> 01:53:30,860
He saw bubbles in the water before the two halves

2337
01:53:30,860 --> 01:53:35,340
of the enormous creature, as well as bits of George Piston,

2338
01:53:35,340 --> 01:53:37,220
floated to the surface.

2339
01:53:37,220 --> 01:53:40,580
Clark broke down in tears as a god

2340
01:53:40,580 --> 01:53:42,760
who had failed his followers.

2341
01:53:43,860 --> 01:53:45,700
The elevator arrived.

2342
01:53:45,700 --> 01:53:48,660
Clark dragged the unconscious body of Keith Vigna

2343
01:53:48,660 --> 01:53:51,220
halfway in to block the elevator door

2344
01:53:51,220 --> 01:53:54,500
before going to see if he could find John's corpse.

2345
01:53:54,500 --> 01:53:55,740
He did not.

2346
01:53:55,740 --> 01:53:57,740
In a desperate search for closure,

2347
01:53:57,740 --> 01:54:00,300
Clark stripped down to his tighty-whities

2348
01:54:00,300 --> 01:54:03,340
and took the scythe down into the water with him,

2349
01:54:03,340 --> 01:54:06,460
diving into the disgusting murk.

2350
01:54:06,460 --> 01:54:10,220
At the bottom and side of this massive aquarium,

2351
01:54:10,220 --> 01:54:13,420
he found John Lee Kevinmore the thirst's body

2352
01:54:13,420 --> 01:54:18,140
pressed against the glass by an unseen influence.

2353
01:54:18,140 --> 01:54:20,540
Looking for the source of the force,

2354
01:54:20,540 --> 01:54:23,460
he saw Marvin Glass standing in his office

2355
01:54:23,460 --> 01:54:25,500
on the other side of this glass.

2356
01:54:25,500 --> 01:54:28,760
Marvin shook a picture at Rosemary.

2357
01:54:28,760 --> 01:54:32,460
Clark couldn't find a pulse and John's body wouldn't budge.

2358
01:54:32,460 --> 01:54:34,460
Then he remembered Keith's small

2359
01:54:34,460 --> 01:54:36,400
but incredibly powerful gun,

2360
01:54:36,400 --> 01:54:39,500
swam back up, fetched it from Keith's shorts,

2361
01:54:39,500 --> 01:54:42,660
and still, in his soaking wet tighty-whities,

2362
01:54:42,660 --> 01:54:46,780
Clark fired into the aquarium wall over and over

2363
01:54:46,780 --> 01:54:50,260
until it broke, sending a tidal wave

2364
01:54:50,260 --> 01:54:54,640
of murky green wet into Marvin's office.

2365
01:54:54,640 --> 01:54:58,880
However, Marvin calmly lifted himself and Rosemary

2366
01:54:58,880 --> 01:55:03,880
up atop the water and made direct eye contact with Clark.

2367
01:55:04,440 --> 01:55:06,340
With the slightest gesture,

2368
01:55:06,340 --> 01:55:09,920
Marvin then moved the impotently enraged Clark

2369
01:55:09,920 --> 01:55:12,960
down from the catwalk of the adjacent room.

2370
01:55:12,960 --> 01:55:17,960
Helpless and paralyzed, Clark was placed in front of Glass,

2371
01:55:18,080 --> 01:55:22,080
compelled to stand motionless on top of the water.

2372
01:55:22,080 --> 01:55:25,840
Keith woke up in darkness,

2373
01:55:25,840 --> 01:55:28,600
jammed halfway into an elevator door.

2374
01:55:28,600 --> 01:55:30,940
Thankfully, his little friend Peter Dieter was there

2375
01:55:30,940 --> 01:55:35,400
to heal his shredded chest with its weird saliva.

2376
01:55:35,400 --> 01:55:38,780
Keith looked down and saw the scene in Marvin's office.

2377
01:55:38,780 --> 01:55:41,640
Marvin looked back but Keith managed to scurry away.

2378
01:55:41,640 --> 01:55:45,600
Unfortunately, Peter was dragged away by Marvin.

2379
01:55:45,600 --> 01:55:48,520
The elevator doors closed and took Keith to a lab

2380
01:55:48,560 --> 01:55:52,240
full of computers, math, and electrical shit

2381
01:55:52,240 --> 01:55:55,580
with a sort of interrogation window into a side room

2382
01:55:55,580 --> 01:56:00,080
that was completely painted in blood and viscera.

2383
01:56:00,080 --> 01:56:03,360
The tall, awkward, mad scientist was working

2384
01:56:03,360 --> 01:56:04,880
here in the main lab.

2385
01:56:04,880 --> 01:56:07,880
Keith broke the news of Peter Dieter's likely death,

2386
01:56:07,880 --> 01:56:09,720
which bummed her out.

2387
01:56:09,720 --> 01:56:11,440
He explained the scene he saw

2388
01:56:11,440 --> 01:56:15,280
in Marvin's aquarium water-filled office from the elevator.

2389
01:56:15,280 --> 01:56:18,480
Poking around this lab, Keith saw a bunch of VHS tapes

2390
01:56:18,480 --> 01:56:21,520
labeled with names, and he asked to see one.

2391
01:56:21,520 --> 01:56:25,120
The scientists obliged, and they watched a malnourished

2392
01:56:25,120 --> 01:56:29,160
child in the bloody room stand behind a desk

2393
01:56:29,160 --> 01:56:32,260
with a small metal sphere on it.

2394
01:56:32,260 --> 01:56:34,160
The child picked up the sphere.

2395
01:56:34,160 --> 01:56:36,880
The sphere promptly ripped out his spine

2396
01:56:36,880 --> 01:56:40,360
and entered his body, which then began slamming itself

2397
01:56:40,360 --> 01:56:42,240
repeatedly against the wall,

2398
01:56:42,240 --> 01:56:45,560
much to the amusement of the scientist.

2399
01:56:45,560 --> 01:56:47,960
She was very surprised to hear that Keith had seen

2400
01:56:48,440 --> 01:56:50,000
someone handling a sphere.

2401
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:51,600
While they walked down to Marvin's office,

2402
01:56:51,600 --> 01:56:54,240
he told her about the black Nike bag.

2403
01:56:54,240 --> 01:56:57,120
When they opened the large, strange obsidian doors

2404
01:56:57,120 --> 01:57:01,080
to Glass's office, water erupted out and into the hallway,

2405
01:57:01,080 --> 01:57:03,080
sweeping the two of them away,

2406
01:57:03,080 --> 01:57:07,240
though their bodies were held by Marvin's unnatural ability.

2407
01:57:07,240 --> 01:57:10,200
Without effort, they moved through the water,

2408
01:57:10,200 --> 01:57:13,560
into the office, and up to the little meeting

2409
01:57:13,560 --> 01:57:17,080
between Marvin, Rosemary, Peter, and Clark.

2410
01:57:17,080 --> 01:57:21,480
Glass held a Polaroid photo and demanded explanation.

2411
01:57:21,480 --> 01:57:24,560
It depicted Clark Bishop and Keith Vigna,

2412
01:57:24,560 --> 01:57:28,840
alongside Kevin, in a world where everything was made

2413
01:57:28,840 --> 01:57:33,840
out of darkness except the ground, which was made of light.

2414
01:57:35,560 --> 01:57:37,780
Clark was rendered unable to move

2415
01:57:37,780 --> 01:57:41,080
by Marvin Glass's unnatural grasp.

2416
01:57:41,080 --> 01:57:45,100
In his catatonic state, he witnessed an odd discussion

2417
01:57:45,100 --> 01:57:47,240
between Marvin and Rosemary.

2418
01:57:47,240 --> 01:57:49,440
Marvin showed Rosemary the picture

2419
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:52,540
and asserted that something was wrong.

2420
01:57:52,540 --> 01:57:54,380
You gotta send me over there.

2421
01:57:54,380 --> 01:57:57,340
I don't know how, but we gotta figure out something.

2422
01:57:57,340 --> 01:57:59,020
Suddenly, Marvin perked up.

2423
01:57:59,020 --> 01:58:02,260
He looked up past the former confines of his office

2424
01:58:02,260 --> 01:58:05,620
where the elevator door beeped, unable to close

2425
01:58:05,620 --> 01:58:09,180
due to its sensors and Keith Vigna's body.

2426
01:58:09,180 --> 01:58:10,980
Marvin held out his hand.

2427
01:58:11,020 --> 01:58:15,540
He seemed confused when a small creature landed in his palm.

2428
01:58:15,540 --> 01:58:18,900
Peter Deeter, with the softball-sized fish head

2429
01:58:18,900 --> 01:58:21,620
on a human body the size of a Barbie doll,

2430
01:58:21,620 --> 01:58:25,800
chatted and chatted with Glass, who glared at Rosemary

2431
01:58:25,800 --> 01:58:28,980
while alluding that her job title was in jeopardy

2432
01:58:28,980 --> 01:58:31,700
and could be available soon.

2433
01:58:31,700 --> 01:58:34,900
Marvin's face shifted like he smelled something

2434
01:58:34,900 --> 01:58:38,540
or experienced some other unknown sensation.

2435
01:58:38,540 --> 01:58:40,740
He reached out again and out of the water

2436
01:58:41,340 --> 01:58:45,380
stood Keith Vigna and the white lab coat-clad scientist,

2437
01:58:45,380 --> 01:58:49,300
maniacal hair now dripping, and her eyes lit up

2438
01:58:49,300 --> 01:58:52,660
with excitement to see Peter Deeter still intact.

2439
01:58:52,660 --> 01:58:55,100
Keith and the tiny fish-man creature

2440
01:58:55,100 --> 01:58:59,260
greeted each other warmly before Marvin shut him down

2441
01:58:59,260 --> 01:59:01,380
with the flick of a hand.

2442
01:59:01,380 --> 01:59:05,520
Peter's large fish eyes stared blankly past his new friend

2443
01:59:05,520 --> 01:59:08,420
as Clark's normal human eyes blinked back

2444
01:59:08,460 --> 01:59:11,300
to his unbelievable reality.

2445
01:59:11,300 --> 01:59:14,300
Marvin Glass asked the two former police officers

2446
01:59:14,300 --> 01:59:17,620
about the strange picture and they felt unnaturally

2447
01:59:17,620 --> 01:59:21,020
compelled to answer to the best of their abilities.

2448
01:59:21,020 --> 01:59:24,200
The picture came from the camera sitting on Marvin's desk.

2449
01:59:24,200 --> 01:59:26,260
It shows things that aren't there.

2450
01:59:26,260 --> 01:59:28,840
They thought the pictures were from a different dimension

2451
01:59:28,840 --> 01:59:30,260
or the past or something.

2452
01:59:30,260 --> 01:59:33,500
Marvin asked how many pictures they took.

2453
01:59:33,500 --> 01:59:35,160
There was the one with the torches

2454
01:59:35,160 --> 01:59:36,880
in the old-timey clothing,

2455
01:59:36,880 --> 01:59:40,760
one with John Peters and oily black stocks,

2456
01:59:40,760 --> 01:59:43,700
and another of a guy with tribal tattoos

2457
01:59:43,700 --> 01:59:46,260
kneeling before a cowboy with his hand up

2458
01:59:46,260 --> 01:59:48,240
to hide his face from the camera.

2459
01:59:48,240 --> 01:59:50,680
Marvin asked Clark to confirm the part

2460
01:59:50,680 --> 01:59:52,720
about the man with tribal tattoos

2461
01:59:52,720 --> 01:59:56,000
running down both arms to his fingertips.

2462
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,080
And Rosemary dove for the gun.

2463
01:59:58,080 --> 02:00:00,160
As she grabbed it, Marvin reached down

2464
02:00:00,160 --> 02:00:03,100
and flung the sphere at her from off the desk.

2465
02:00:03,100 --> 02:00:06,700
Multiple shiny limbs extended from the small sphere

2466
02:00:06,700 --> 02:00:08,900
slammed into the desk for leverage

2467
02:00:08,900 --> 02:00:13,780
and slung its silver round frame at its target, Rosemary.

2468
02:00:13,780 --> 02:00:16,780
One of its appendages sliced into the soft tissue

2469
02:00:16,780 --> 02:00:18,780
on the back of Rosemary's neck.

2470
02:00:18,780 --> 02:00:20,780
Another snapped her head forward.

2471
02:00:20,780 --> 02:00:23,200
A third metal tendril reached in,

2472
02:00:23,200 --> 02:00:25,860
gripped the top of Rosemary's spine

2473
02:00:25,860 --> 02:00:29,820
and ripped her entire spinal cord out of her body

2474
02:00:29,820 --> 02:00:32,140
in one swift motion.

2475
02:00:32,140 --> 02:00:34,580
This ball promptly forced itself

2476
02:00:34,580 --> 02:00:39,420
into the now-vacant spinal column of this human being.

2477
02:00:39,420 --> 02:00:43,700
The new Rosemary had a crazed look in her eyes.

2478
02:00:43,700 --> 02:00:47,200
She blew her nose into her hand,

2479
02:00:47,200 --> 02:00:52,200
slammed the mucus into the empty chamber of this odd gun,

2480
02:00:52,300 --> 02:00:55,700
and without aiming, squeezed the trigger.

2481
02:00:55,700 --> 02:00:57,660
An almost blinding flash of light

2482
02:00:57,660 --> 02:01:00,100
illuminated the entirety of Marvin's

2483
02:01:00,100 --> 02:01:02,500
enormous, flooded office.

2484
02:01:02,500 --> 02:01:05,460
And then, as if she had never been,

2485
02:01:05,460 --> 02:01:07,480
the body of Rosemary was gone.

2486
02:01:07,480 --> 02:01:08,820
Aah!

2487
02:01:08,820 --> 02:01:11,820
Marvin Glass roared in anger.

2488
02:01:11,820 --> 02:01:13,860
And where Rosemary just stood,

2489
02:01:13,860 --> 02:01:17,100
they could now see a pool of viscous black sludge

2490
02:01:17,100 --> 02:01:19,820
enveloped a placid body.

2491
02:01:19,820 --> 02:01:24,020
Her limbs seemed to peacefully fold into the ooze,

2492
02:01:24,020 --> 02:01:27,380
becoming one with the sentient mass of goop

2493
02:01:27,380 --> 02:01:30,140
that then slid across the water.

2494
02:01:30,140 --> 02:01:32,780
Marvin reached out a hand, grabbed the goo,

2495
02:01:32,780 --> 02:01:36,560
and hurled it downward into the murky water below.

2496
02:01:36,560 --> 02:01:39,360
And a strange noise filled the air,

2497
02:01:39,360 --> 02:01:41,980
like when a tube TV is turned on,

2498
02:01:41,980 --> 02:01:45,060
a noise that could almost be felt in your head

2499
02:01:45,060 --> 02:01:46,840
or in the back of your throat.

2500
02:01:48,600 --> 02:01:50,780
Marvin pressed the two petrified men

2501
02:01:50,780 --> 02:01:53,220
on their knowledge of this black substance.

2502
02:01:53,220 --> 02:01:54,940
How many times had they seen it?

2503
02:01:54,940 --> 02:01:56,060
Had it taken people?

2504
02:01:56,060 --> 02:01:57,700
Did they know how to contain it?

2505
02:01:57,700 --> 02:02:00,280
Was it running rampant through contention?

2506
02:02:00,280 --> 02:02:04,480
Next, he questioned them about the small silver spheres.

2507
02:02:04,480 --> 02:02:07,660
Keith explained that the contention PD had a bag,

2508
02:02:07,660 --> 02:02:10,220
and when they put the silver ball in the bag,

2509
02:02:10,220 --> 02:02:11,260
it disappeared.

2510
02:02:11,260 --> 02:02:13,300
Marvin was curious about this.

2511
02:02:13,300 --> 02:02:15,900
Would anything in the bag disappear?

2512
02:02:15,900 --> 02:02:18,120
Keith admitted they never tried anything

2513
02:02:18,120 --> 02:02:20,020
other than the metal spheres.

2514
02:02:20,020 --> 02:02:22,780
Marvin commented on the plural Keith used

2515
02:02:23,140 --> 02:02:26,940
asked how many silver balls they'd come into contact with.

2516
02:02:26,940 --> 02:02:29,580
Keith said they'd only made the one disappear,

2517
02:02:29,580 --> 02:02:32,420
but another was found embedded in the skull

2518
02:02:32,420 --> 02:02:36,460
of a severed head they'd pulled out of some storage units,

2519
02:02:36,460 --> 02:02:39,820
adding that one of the contention PD

2520
02:02:39,820 --> 02:02:41,760
touched the silver ball.

2521
02:02:41,760 --> 02:02:43,860
Marvin assumed this was their coworker

2522
02:02:43,860 --> 02:02:46,780
who was recently gunned down and ripped apart.

2523
02:02:46,780 --> 02:02:49,400
Keith explained that John Lee Pettymore IV,

2524
02:02:49,400 --> 02:02:51,980
the man who held the sphere previously,

2525
02:02:51,980 --> 02:02:54,180
was inside Kevin's body.

2526
02:02:54,180 --> 02:02:57,820
Marvin's eyes widened, as did Clark's.

2527
02:02:57,820 --> 02:02:59,660
Clark thought Marvin had something to do

2528
02:02:59,660 --> 02:03:00,940
with the body switching.

2529
02:03:00,940 --> 02:03:03,140
Skeptical of all of this information,

2530
02:03:03,140 --> 02:03:05,820
Marvin extended a hand downward

2531
02:03:05,820 --> 02:03:09,920
and pulled the body of John Lee Kevinmore the third up

2532
02:03:09,920 --> 02:03:11,640
from out of the water.

2533
02:03:11,640 --> 02:03:14,140
With one hand holding Kevin's body,

2534
02:03:14,140 --> 02:03:18,380
he used the other to twist open Kevin's head

2535
02:03:18,380 --> 02:03:20,220
like an avocado.

2536
02:03:20,220 --> 02:03:24,300
Sitting inside his head like the pit of an avocado

2537
02:03:24,300 --> 02:03:26,820
was a small silver sphere.

2538
02:03:26,820 --> 02:03:30,640
Marvin ripped Kevin's body in half right down the middle.

2539
02:03:30,640 --> 02:03:34,500
Where a spinal cord should have been, there was nothing.

2540
02:03:36,100 --> 02:03:38,940
Since Clark and Keith were now gonna be a part

2541
02:03:38,940 --> 02:03:41,460
of some heavy entertainment,

2542
02:03:41,460 --> 02:03:44,280
Marvin offered to answer a few questions.

2543
02:03:44,280 --> 02:03:47,660
Clark immediately asked what the silver balls are.

2544
02:03:47,660 --> 02:03:49,900
Marvin has been doing research on them

2545
02:03:50,420 --> 02:03:52,060
and has come to very few conclusions,

2546
02:03:52,060 --> 02:03:54,900
though they are not from this realm.

2547
02:03:54,900 --> 02:03:58,100
Marvin was working to secure their destruction.

2548
02:03:58,100 --> 02:04:00,920
Keith asked where he found the balls.

2549
02:04:00,920 --> 02:04:03,300
One had been brought to him a long time ago

2550
02:04:03,300 --> 02:04:05,540
by two men he was seeking out.

2551
02:04:05,540 --> 02:04:07,740
They, along with one other person,

2552
02:04:07,740 --> 02:04:09,980
had stolen something from him.

2553
02:04:09,980 --> 02:04:12,660
Clark pointed out that when Marvin threw the sphere

2554
02:04:12,660 --> 02:04:16,100
at Rosemary, he was aware it did something.

2555
02:04:16,100 --> 02:04:18,100
Marvin confirmed he knew the spheres

2556
02:04:18,100 --> 02:04:20,980
and intended to enter the person they touched,

2557
02:04:20,980 --> 02:04:22,800
but Rosemary still shot the gun

2558
02:04:22,800 --> 02:04:24,820
after being taken over by the sphere.

2559
02:04:24,820 --> 02:04:26,260
Did it not work?

2560
02:04:26,260 --> 02:04:29,040
Marvin admitted he didn't suspect the entity

2561
02:04:29,040 --> 02:04:31,540
would do anything other than try to kill itself

2562
02:04:31,540 --> 02:04:33,280
as it normally did.

2563
02:04:33,280 --> 02:04:35,420
Keith asked if Marvin knew anyone

2564
02:04:35,420 --> 02:04:38,620
with the previously described tribal tattoos.

2565
02:04:38,620 --> 02:04:42,140
That was one of his sons, Jermaine Glass.

2566
02:04:42,140 --> 02:04:45,640
Keith asked why Marvin wanted to destroy the spheres.

2567
02:04:45,640 --> 02:04:48,280
Glass saw the balls as competition.

2568
02:04:48,280 --> 02:04:50,520
If he couldn't figure out how to utilize them,

2569
02:04:50,520 --> 02:04:52,920
he wanted them eradicated.

2570
02:04:52,920 --> 02:04:55,960
Glass was in search of as much power as possible

2571
02:04:55,960 --> 02:05:00,640
in an attempt to obtain control over this domain.

2572
02:05:00,640 --> 02:05:04,240
Finally, Clark asked what Marvin was.

2573
02:05:04,240 --> 02:05:06,280
Glass said he was not one of them,

2574
02:05:06,280 --> 02:05:10,500
rather one of many who were in control, who ran things,

2575
02:05:10,500 --> 02:05:13,920
but he had become bored, left the bureaucracy,

2576
02:05:13,920 --> 02:05:17,600
and had been battling Myriad ever since.

2577
02:05:17,600 --> 02:05:19,400
Then Marvin snapped his fingers

2578
02:05:19,400 --> 02:05:22,160
and Keith and Clark were unconscious.

2579
02:05:22,160 --> 02:05:24,760
They awoke in a room with walls covered

2580
02:05:24,760 --> 02:05:28,600
and every piece of weaponry and gadget imaginable.

2581
02:05:28,600 --> 02:05:31,020
A cage like the ones they'd been trapped in

2582
02:05:31,020 --> 02:05:34,920
above the Den of Sin appeared at a darkened window.

2583
02:05:34,920 --> 02:05:37,200
Oz Mayhem Wolf climbed out,

2584
02:05:37,200 --> 02:05:39,640
said it seemed they were gonna fight together,

2585
02:05:39,640 --> 02:05:43,040
and excitedly grabbed his preferred combat gear.

2586
02:05:43,040 --> 02:05:46,640
A timer began counting down, water began filling the room,

2587
02:05:46,640 --> 02:05:49,280
and a circle opened above them.

2588
02:05:49,280 --> 02:05:52,680
A disorienting amount of light and sound hit

2589
02:05:52,680 --> 02:05:55,880
as an unseen crowd chanted the name

2590
02:05:55,880 --> 02:05:59,880
of this group's opponent, Planet Juggernaut.

2591
02:06:04,960 --> 02:06:09,700
In a dark room lit by various electronics and machines,

2592
02:06:09,700 --> 02:06:14,700
there sat a massive shiny metal sphere, 20 feet tall,

2593
02:06:14,940 --> 02:06:18,740
with silvery arms extending from either side.

2594
02:06:18,740 --> 02:06:23,020
A tube connected this gargantuan ball to a machine below.

2595
02:06:23,020 --> 02:06:26,260
The machine began whirring and a small metal sphere,

2596
02:06:26,260 --> 02:06:28,100
roughly one inch in diameter,

2597
02:06:28,100 --> 02:06:30,620
began moving up through the tubing

2598
02:06:30,620 --> 02:06:34,220
into the larger armed version of itself.

2599
02:06:34,220 --> 02:06:38,740
As this happened, John Lee Pettymore IV felt

2600
02:06:39,900 --> 02:06:42,580
alive again.

2601
02:06:42,580 --> 02:06:45,540
John felt his consciousness extend itself

2602
02:06:45,540 --> 02:06:47,140
throughout his new body,

2603
02:06:47,140 --> 02:06:50,940
this colossal monument to destruction.

2604
02:06:50,940 --> 02:06:53,940
A vast circle opened up in the ceiling above,

2605
02:06:53,940 --> 02:06:56,780
and a disorienting amount of light and sound

2606
02:06:56,780 --> 02:06:58,680
poured into this dark room,

2607
02:06:58,680 --> 02:07:01,460
which revealed text painted on the back wall

2608
02:07:01,460 --> 02:07:04,820
that read the same thing heard violently chanted

2609
02:07:04,820 --> 02:07:08,820
by the unseen crowd, Planet Juggernaut.

2610
02:07:09,820 --> 02:07:14,060
Here's the way, here's the way, here's the way.

2611
02:07:14,060 --> 02:07:19,060
John gave his new hands a tentative punch together

2612
02:07:19,220 --> 02:07:21,020
and dug in his foot.

2613
02:07:23,380 --> 02:07:27,140
Clark Bishop, Keith Vigna, and Oz Mayhem-Wolf

2614
02:07:27,140 --> 02:07:29,700
walked up the stairs and into the lights

2615
02:07:29,700 --> 02:07:31,620
and sounds of the arena.

2616
02:07:31,620 --> 02:07:35,300
This colossal room was circular and funneled downward,

2617
02:07:35,300 --> 02:07:37,180
at least 10 stories.

2618
02:07:37,220 --> 02:07:41,700
Thousands of seats surrounded a massive covered cage,

2619
02:07:41,700 --> 02:07:45,940
50 yards across, with a bubble-looking rounded top on it,

2620
02:07:45,940 --> 02:07:49,460
entirely made of a crystal-clear material.

2621
02:07:49,460 --> 02:07:52,260
Aggressively loud dubstep blared,

2622
02:07:52,260 --> 02:07:56,140
strobe lights made the entire experience otherworldly,

2623
02:07:56,140 --> 02:07:58,820
as green and red and blue lasers

2624
02:07:58,820 --> 02:08:00,900
swung wildly around the room,

2625
02:08:00,900 --> 02:08:02,820
like a futuristic Las Vegas

2626
02:08:02,820 --> 02:08:05,860
filled with the spirit of all of Vin Diesel's films

2627
02:08:05,860 --> 02:08:08,300
if they were tarred and feathered,

2628
02:08:08,300 --> 02:08:11,020
but the tar was replaced by Red Bull

2629
02:08:11,020 --> 02:08:14,060
and the feathers replaced by cocaine.

2630
02:08:14,060 --> 02:08:16,900
An enormous logo in the center of the arena floor

2631
02:08:16,900 --> 02:08:20,700
read in all caps, The Scrap Pit.

2632
02:08:20,700 --> 02:08:23,060
And all around the Scrap Pit,

2633
02:08:23,060 --> 02:08:26,220
in a massive circle were the repeated words,

2634
02:08:26,220 --> 02:08:28,600
Planet Juggernaut.

2635
02:08:28,600 --> 02:08:32,700
A gigantic circular jumbotron hung above the bubble,

2636
02:08:32,740 --> 02:08:36,780
blinked a countdown timer and flashed the words,

2637
02:08:36,780 --> 02:08:41,780
Oz Mayhem Wolf and Friends versus Planet Juggernaut.

2638
02:08:42,380 --> 02:08:46,260
The exceptional voices of Mick and Nick Nichols

2639
02:08:46,260 --> 02:08:48,700
echoed through the pandemonium

2640
02:08:48,700 --> 02:08:51,220
and announced an evening of bloodsport

2641
02:08:51,220 --> 02:08:54,060
the audience would never forget.

2642
02:08:55,820 --> 02:08:59,620
The floor opened and Planet Juggernaut slowly rose

2643
02:08:59,660 --> 02:09:03,340
into the Scrap Pit to an explosion of roars

2644
02:09:03,340 --> 02:09:05,140
from the eager audience.

2645
02:09:05,140 --> 02:09:09,740
The sight of the gigantic shiny metal sphere 20 feet wide

2646
02:09:09,740 --> 02:09:14,200
with two metallic arms extending from either side

2647
02:09:14,200 --> 02:09:16,820
knocked something loose in Clark.

2648
02:09:16,820 --> 02:09:20,140
He lunged straight at Oz Mayhem Wolf in a frenzy

2649
02:09:20,140 --> 02:09:21,940
and tried to rip his head off.

2650
02:09:21,940 --> 02:09:25,980
A confused Oz Wolf ran away from his antagonistic teammate

2651
02:09:25,980 --> 02:09:29,560
but clumsily tripped over and fell to the ground.

2652
02:09:30,440 --> 02:09:32,640
Planet Juggernaut sent lasers blazing from its eyes

2653
02:09:32,640 --> 02:09:34,980
at Keith Vigna who jumped out of the way

2654
02:09:34,980 --> 02:09:37,720
with his cool jumping boots.

2655
02:09:37,720 --> 02:09:42,720
Mid air Keith shot Planet Juggernaut with a saw launcher

2656
02:09:42,720 --> 02:09:44,880
and embedded a circular saw

2657
02:09:44,880 --> 02:09:47,920
in the giant robot balls midsection.

2658
02:09:47,920 --> 02:09:51,240
Planet Juggernaut propelled itself into the air

2659
02:09:51,240 --> 02:09:55,660
and landed on Oz Wolf as it slammed Clark down

2660
02:09:55,660 --> 02:09:58,320
with its powerful metal hand.

2661
02:09:58,360 --> 02:10:00,880
Keith Spidermanned up the Scrap Pit wall

2662
02:10:00,880 --> 02:10:04,520
with suction gloves and froze Planet Juggernaut's propeller

2663
02:10:04,520 --> 02:10:07,120
with a nitro thrower.

2664
02:10:07,120 --> 02:10:11,320
A crushed Oz crawled out from beneath the burnished behemoth

2665
02:10:11,320 --> 02:10:15,520
which sat eerily still as it clearly charged up something

2666
02:10:15,520 --> 02:10:17,920
somehow even more sinister.

2667
02:10:17,920 --> 02:10:21,020
Keith tried to release his suction cups from the dome

2668
02:10:21,020 --> 02:10:22,320
but his feet were stuck.

2669
02:10:22,320 --> 02:10:24,660
He looked into the apotent audience

2670
02:10:24,660 --> 02:10:28,020
and saw a short young woman and tall old man

2671
02:10:28,660 --> 02:10:31,780
wearing suits, ties and ill fitting windbreakers.

2672
02:10:31,780 --> 02:10:34,900
He recognized agents Kennedy and McKinley

2673
02:10:34,900 --> 02:10:37,700
as they made their way through the crowd.

2674
02:10:37,700 --> 02:10:40,900
Clark launched himself up onto Planet Juggernaut

2675
02:10:40,900 --> 02:10:43,900
which rapidly spun its exterior shell

2676
02:10:43,900 --> 02:10:46,580
while hovering just above the battleground

2677
02:10:46,580 --> 02:10:49,740
in order to hit the pit rolling at a quick clip

2678
02:10:49,740 --> 02:10:51,900
toward its slow foes.

2679
02:10:51,900 --> 02:10:55,500
This squashed Clark but absolutely obliterated

2680
02:10:55,500 --> 02:11:00,020
Oz Mayhem Wolf into a pile of organs and teeth

2681
02:11:00,020 --> 02:11:03,580
which sat in a dark red paste.

2682
02:11:03,580 --> 02:11:08,580
As Nick and McNiggles discussed the mayhem scene and lost,

2683
02:11:08,980 --> 02:11:12,340
a small hoover poked out of Planet Juggernaut

2684
02:11:12,340 --> 02:11:17,340
to suck up and collect the loose teeth of Oz Wolf.

2685
02:11:17,820 --> 02:11:20,900
An artificial wind began to pick up

2686
02:11:20,900 --> 02:11:23,060
in the corner of the Scrap Pit

2687
02:11:23,060 --> 02:11:24,900
and headed toward Clark Bishop

2688
02:11:25,180 --> 02:11:27,620
who fired his high powered sniper rifle

2689
02:11:27,620 --> 02:11:29,420
into the giant ball robot

2690
02:11:29,420 --> 02:11:32,060
while thinking about his friend and coworker,

2691
02:11:32,060 --> 02:11:34,100
John Lee Pennymore the fourth.

2692
02:11:34,100 --> 02:11:38,020
Planet Juggernaut grabbed Clark with his extendo arms

2693
02:11:38,020 --> 02:11:39,820
and Mickey Mouse gloves.

2694
02:11:39,820 --> 02:11:44,140
It pulled Clark close and attempted to speak.

2695
02:11:44,140 --> 02:11:44,980
Clark.

2696
02:11:46,980 --> 02:11:47,820
It's me.

2697
02:11:49,340 --> 02:11:50,180
It's John.

2698
02:11:51,860 --> 02:11:53,860
I don't wanna fight you.

2699
02:11:55,900 --> 02:11:58,060
We've gotta find a way outta here

2700
02:11:58,060 --> 02:12:00,060
and into Marvin Glass's booth.

2701
02:12:01,540 --> 02:12:03,780
Can we kill him together?

2702
02:12:03,780 --> 02:12:07,020
Nick and McNiggles cut to a video segment

2703
02:12:07,020 --> 02:12:10,100
incorrectly called Fighting Pro Tips

2704
02:12:10,100 --> 02:12:13,860
from Alfred and Jermaine Glass.

2705
02:12:13,860 --> 02:12:18,540
The jumbotron showed a dark room with a single light on.

2706
02:12:18,540 --> 02:12:20,580
A young man in the shadows of the room

2707
02:12:20,580 --> 02:12:22,300
huddled in the field position

2708
02:12:22,900 --> 02:12:25,060
and stammered about a gun,

2709
02:12:25,060 --> 02:12:26,620
someone disappearing,

2710
02:12:26,620 --> 02:12:28,420
it coming after him

2711
02:12:28,420 --> 02:12:31,580
and a missing girl before the feed was cut off

2712
02:12:31,580 --> 02:12:35,340
and the attention turned back to inside the Scrap Pit.

2713
02:12:35,340 --> 02:12:38,540
In the clutches of the speaking Planet Juggernaut,

2714
02:12:38,540 --> 02:12:40,420
Clark's mind snapped

2715
02:12:40,420 --> 02:12:43,700
and he pleaded for help from Planet Jonernaut

2716
02:12:43,700 --> 02:12:46,460
who was focused on a young bald fit man

2717
02:12:46,460 --> 02:12:50,620
with sunken intense eyes and a black t-shirt and jeans.

2718
02:12:50,620 --> 02:12:55,060
Agent Billy Harrison was headed toward Marvin Glass's box.

2719
02:12:55,060 --> 02:12:58,460
Planet Jonernaut threw himself with all its might

2720
02:12:58,460 --> 02:13:01,060
into the dome above the Scrap Pit.

2721
02:13:01,060 --> 02:13:02,980
The crystal clear material,

2722
02:13:02,980 --> 02:13:05,380
considered indestructible by all

2723
02:13:05,380 --> 02:13:07,980
who had fought inside its bubble previously,

2724
02:13:07,980 --> 02:13:09,020
shattered.

2725
02:13:09,020 --> 02:13:13,180
Its pieces floated down into the pit like a firework.

2726
02:13:13,180 --> 02:13:15,460
The crowd scattered for their lives,

2727
02:13:15,460 --> 02:13:18,460
perhaps to add fuel to the confusion fire

2728
02:13:18,460 --> 02:13:19,980
to aid in an escape,

2729
02:13:20,020 --> 02:13:23,140
Keith Vigna sprayed his nitro thrower

2730
02:13:23,140 --> 02:13:25,300
into the panicking mob.

2731
02:13:25,300 --> 02:13:28,820
Suddenly, a rushing cascade of murky water

2732
02:13:28,820 --> 02:13:30,740
containing different kinds of fish

2733
02:13:30,740 --> 02:13:32,620
and a few humanoid figures

2734
02:13:32,620 --> 02:13:35,780
blasted out from Marvin Glass's theater box.

2735
02:13:35,780 --> 02:13:38,460
In the deluge were four flushed folks,

2736
02:13:38,460 --> 02:13:41,340
Agents Kennedy, McKinley and Billy Harrison

2737
02:13:41,340 --> 02:13:44,100
as well as a body wearing a tuxedo

2738
02:13:44,100 --> 02:13:48,300
with gaunt skin stretched across long bones.

2739
02:13:48,300 --> 02:13:49,980
Marvin Glass.

2740
02:13:49,980 --> 02:13:54,020
All four were washed into the middle of the Scrap Pit.

2741
02:13:54,020 --> 02:13:56,460
Clark unloaded three rounds into Marvin

2742
02:13:56,460 --> 02:13:58,540
and triggered a deafening roar.

2743
02:13:58,540 --> 02:14:00,260
Ah!

2744
02:14:00,260 --> 02:14:04,580
Planet Jonernaut requested that Clark jump up on him

2745
02:14:04,580 --> 02:14:07,180
to avoid the ever rising tide.

2746
02:14:07,180 --> 02:14:10,820
Keith, using his nitro thrower against the bad guy

2747
02:14:10,820 --> 02:14:12,300
instead of the audience,

2748
02:14:12,300 --> 02:14:15,700
completely encased the floating body of Marvin Glass

2749
02:14:15,700 --> 02:14:18,380
in a sort of dry ice cube.

2750
02:14:18,380 --> 02:14:20,820
Clark, from atop Planet Jonernaut,

2751
02:14:20,820 --> 02:14:23,740
yelled to Keith the wacky and wondrous news

2752
02:14:23,740 --> 02:14:26,340
that Planet Juggernaut was John.

2753
02:14:26,340 --> 02:14:29,900
Planet Jonernaut sent one extendo arm toward Keith

2754
02:14:29,900 --> 02:14:33,500
as the other reached for a breach in the dome above.

2755
02:14:33,500 --> 02:14:35,820
Keith threw down his riot shield,

2756
02:14:35,820 --> 02:14:40,180
rode it like a surfboard toward Jonernaut's extended hand

2757
02:14:40,180 --> 02:14:42,340
and shot a saw through the middle

2758
02:14:42,340 --> 02:14:44,420
of the newly formed ice cube

2759
02:14:44,420 --> 02:14:49,020
and directly into the frozen Marvin Glass trapped inside.

2760
02:14:49,020 --> 02:14:52,020
The Scrap Pit began to shake violently

2761
02:14:52,020 --> 02:14:55,180
and Jonernaut successfully pulled Keith and Clark

2762
02:14:55,180 --> 02:14:58,140
up through the dome as lava moved up

2763
02:14:58,140 --> 02:15:01,620
through the cracking and bubbling Scrap Pit.

2764
02:15:01,620 --> 02:15:05,260
Marvin Glass, sliced by the saw and still frozen

2765
02:15:05,260 --> 02:15:07,740
in this strange chemical compound,

2766
02:15:07,740 --> 02:15:12,740
melted into the lava pit below and the scene changed.

2767
02:15:14,860 --> 02:15:18,660
There was a road lined on either side by trees

2768
02:15:18,660 --> 02:15:20,940
that reached over, blending together,

2769
02:15:20,940 --> 02:15:23,500
creating an autumnal canopy.

2770
02:15:23,500 --> 02:15:27,340
A rabbit recklessly raced across the patchy pavement,

2771
02:15:27,340 --> 02:15:30,220
leaving behind a trail of blood thick enough

2772
02:15:30,220 --> 02:15:32,740
to assume the animal's fate.

2773
02:15:32,740 --> 02:15:36,340
A boxy black sedan drove furiously down the road,

2774
02:15:36,340 --> 02:15:39,780
trailed closely by a four-wheeler.

2775
02:15:39,780 --> 02:15:42,180
They took a right down the gravel road,

2776
02:15:42,220 --> 02:15:46,860
blowing past a sign that read, The Contention Woods,

2777
02:15:46,860 --> 02:15:50,860
and text at the bottom of the screen came up.

2778
02:15:52,140 --> 02:15:54,700
25 years earlier.

2779
02:16:24,860 --> 02:16:25,940
What's up, everybody?

2780
02:16:25,940 --> 02:16:28,660
It's Zach, still Zach, so much Zach,

2781
02:16:28,660 --> 02:16:30,780
and we are now halfway through

2782
02:16:30,780 --> 02:16:33,100
this stupidly overwhelming undertaking

2783
02:16:33,100 --> 02:16:36,300
of a full recap of season one.

2784
02:16:36,300 --> 02:16:38,940
It's been really fun and I'm so glad,

2785
02:16:38,940 --> 02:16:42,940
I'm so glad, no, it's been a bit of a fucking nightmare,

2786
02:16:42,940 --> 02:16:45,460
but it's halfway over, yay!

2787
02:16:45,460 --> 02:16:48,500
Thankfully, we've had an absolute shitload of fun

2788
02:16:48,500 --> 02:16:50,740
recording some bonus content for everyone,

2789
02:16:50,740 --> 02:16:53,460
which will be on this main feed soon.

2790
02:16:53,500 --> 02:16:55,900
More on what exactly that entails

2791
02:16:55,900 --> 02:16:58,580
at the end of this little epilogue.

2792
02:16:58,580 --> 02:17:01,860
And later this month, patrons will see a new episode

2793
02:17:01,860 --> 02:17:03,460
drop in that exclusive feed,

2794
02:17:03,460 --> 02:17:06,420
wherein I run Joe, Luke, and Thomas

2795
02:17:06,420 --> 02:17:09,220
through a space adventure in a space game

2796
02:17:09,220 --> 02:17:11,520
of space roll for shoes.

2797
02:17:11,520 --> 02:17:14,780
That session was seriously some of the most lighthearted,

2798
02:17:14,780 --> 02:17:16,900
enjoyable role play I've ever had the pleasure

2799
02:17:16,900 --> 02:17:18,140
to take privilege in.

2800
02:17:18,140 --> 02:17:19,140
Ha ha ha ha!

2801
02:17:19,980 --> 02:17:23,700
All right, and for those of you who slosh around

2802
02:17:23,700 --> 02:17:26,100
in the Den of Sin, be on the lookout

2803
02:17:26,100 --> 02:17:28,060
for a live stream this weekend.

2804
02:17:28,060 --> 02:17:30,820
We'll post the time and date on our Twitter

2805
02:17:30,820 --> 02:17:34,000
and Instagram at PretendingPod.

2806
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:38,100
We're playing a game called, oh fuck, I can't remember,

2807
02:17:38,100 --> 02:17:41,920
Patrick, something about Patrick, Inside Patrick.

2808
02:17:41,920 --> 02:17:44,620
We're all, we're all, no.

2809
02:17:44,620 --> 02:17:47,500
As for the next and third part of this here

2810
02:17:47,500 --> 02:17:50,980
season one recap project, I need your help

2811
02:17:50,980 --> 02:17:53,940
and I'm willing to send you clothes in return.

2812
02:17:53,940 --> 02:17:56,260
There's a link in the show notes and on Twitter,

2813
02:17:56,260 --> 02:17:59,120
Fuck Jack Dorsey and Facebook, Fuck Mark Zuckerberg,

2814
02:17:59,120 --> 02:18:01,140
to a Google Doc we can all share.

2815
02:18:01,140 --> 02:18:03,180
It'll have the transcript for this episode

2816
02:18:03,180 --> 02:18:05,700
which covered episodes 24 through 46

2817
02:18:05,700 --> 02:18:07,420
as well as the previous recap

2818
02:18:07,420 --> 02:18:09,260
covering episodes one through 23.

2819
02:18:09,260 --> 02:18:13,780
Now, if you write up a few succinct but thorough paragraphs

2820
02:18:13,780 --> 02:18:16,200
recapping an episode of this show,

2821
02:18:16,200 --> 02:18:19,740
you will be entered to win a PTBP t-shirt.

2822
02:18:19,740 --> 02:18:23,640
Now, if you write up a few succinct but thorough paragraphs

2823
02:18:23,640 --> 02:18:26,480
recapping three or more episodes,

2824
02:18:26,480 --> 02:18:31,220
you will be entered to win one of five PTBP t-shirts.

2825
02:18:31,220 --> 02:18:33,720
So if only five people write up three or more episodes,

2826
02:18:33,720 --> 02:18:35,040
boom, you got a shirt.

2827
02:18:35,040 --> 02:18:38,560
And finally, if you really go heels to Betsy on this,

2828
02:18:38,560 --> 02:18:41,680
if you write up a few succinct but thorough paragraphs

2829
02:18:41,680 --> 02:18:44,720
recapping five or more episodes,

2830
02:18:44,760 --> 02:18:48,400
I will guarantee you a PTBP t-shirt.

2831
02:18:48,400 --> 02:18:52,240
And leave your handle or email address commented in there

2832
02:18:52,240 --> 02:18:54,860
so we know who wrote what and how to contact you

2833
02:18:54,860 --> 02:18:58,560
in case we get to ship you a shirt like Dylan B did.

2834
02:18:58,560 --> 02:19:02,360
Dylan B wrote recaps for six episodes

2835
02:19:02,360 --> 02:19:04,960
and a shirt is on its way.

2836
02:19:04,960 --> 02:19:08,860
Also, an enormous shout out to Here Be Tigers

2837
02:19:08,860 --> 02:19:13,360
from the Discord who so far has written four recaps

2838
02:19:13,360 --> 02:19:16,280
that were absolutely excellent.

2839
02:19:16,280 --> 02:19:18,900
For those of you looking into joining this project

2840
02:19:18,900 --> 02:19:22,100
and earning a shirt, those recaps by Here Be Tigers

2841
02:19:22,100 --> 02:19:24,600
are what you should model your work after.

2842
02:19:24,600 --> 02:19:28,960
Succinct but thorough, ugh, bless you, Here Be Tigers.

2843
02:19:28,960 --> 02:19:31,180
So please, join us, earn a shirt,

2844
02:19:31,180 --> 02:19:34,200
and help us finish the remaining two recap episodes

2845
02:19:34,200 --> 02:19:37,600
so we can deliver you the final arc of season one

2846
02:19:37,600 --> 02:19:39,160
of Pretending to Be People.

2847
02:19:39,160 --> 02:19:41,720
I am so very excited.

2848
02:19:41,720 --> 02:19:44,680
Now, the next episode you see on this main feed

2849
02:19:44,680 --> 02:19:46,080
will be a bonus.

2850
02:19:46,080 --> 02:19:49,280
Unfortunately, Luke wasn't able to join us

2851
02:19:49,280 --> 02:19:51,040
because he got COVID.

2852
02:19:51,040 --> 02:19:53,200
Wear a fucking mask.

2853
02:19:53,200 --> 02:19:55,480
Thankfully, he is feeling much better now

2854
02:19:55,480 --> 02:19:59,400
and will be joining us for the end of this bonus scenario,

2855
02:19:59,400 --> 02:20:02,360
which is a game of Call of Cthulhu

2856
02:20:02,360 --> 02:20:06,160
with guest keeper Scott Dorward,

2857
02:20:06,160 --> 02:20:09,780
an RPG writer and editor whose name might sound familiar

2858
02:20:09,780 --> 02:20:13,340
because he co-authored the Pope Cthulhu campaign,

2859
02:20:13,340 --> 02:20:15,960
Two-Headed Serpent, as well as a collection

2860
02:20:15,960 --> 02:20:20,060
of six scenarios for Call of Cthulhu named Nameless Horrors.

2861
02:20:20,060 --> 02:20:24,100
He also wrote an excellent scenario called Hell in Texas

2862
02:20:24,100 --> 02:20:26,740
that's in Stygian Fox's Cthulhu modern book

2863
02:20:26,740 --> 02:20:28,740
called The Things We Leave Behind,

2864
02:20:28,740 --> 02:20:32,620
and so, so, so much other amazing material.

2865
02:20:32,620 --> 02:20:35,480
Scott is also an established podcaster,

2866
02:20:35,480 --> 02:20:39,020
and I have personally listened to every episode

2867
02:20:39,020 --> 02:20:41,860
of The Good Friends of Jackson Elias,

2868
02:20:41,860 --> 02:20:44,980
a podcast about Call of Cthulhu, horror films,

2869
02:20:44,980 --> 02:20:47,260
and horror gaming in general.

2870
02:20:47,260 --> 02:20:50,080
Scott is a magnificent game master

2871
02:20:50,080 --> 02:20:54,340
with the voice of an angel in the mind of an elder god,

2872
02:20:54,340 --> 02:20:59,340
and we had a disgusting, revolting, marvelous time

2873
02:20:59,380 --> 02:21:01,860
playing a scenario he wrote and published

2874
02:21:01,860 --> 02:21:04,980
set in a Hooverville in the Great Depression

2875
02:21:04,980 --> 02:21:07,900
entitled Bleak Prospect.

2876
02:21:07,900 --> 02:21:11,020
Thank you, thank you all so much

2877
02:21:11,020 --> 02:21:13,500
for your continued support.

2878
02:21:13,500 --> 02:21:14,620
Times are hard.

2879
02:21:14,620 --> 02:21:15,840
Check in on your friends.

2880
02:21:15,840 --> 02:21:17,900
Be honest, be vulnerable.

2881
02:21:17,900 --> 02:21:19,820
Admit it when you need help.

2882
02:21:19,820 --> 02:21:21,800
I'm finally doing that myself.

2883
02:21:21,800 --> 02:21:24,700
For years, I've said everyone should be in therapy,

2884
02:21:24,700 --> 02:21:27,620
all while not seeing a therapist.

2885
02:21:27,620 --> 02:21:30,200
I even got my degree in behavioral science.

2886
02:21:30,200 --> 02:21:31,700
I understood the benefits.

2887
02:21:31,700 --> 02:21:35,180
I understood it would help me, but I was scared.

2888
02:21:35,180 --> 02:21:36,020
Well, fuck that.

2889
02:21:36,020 --> 02:21:38,660
I'm still scared, but I'm not gonna let that stop me.

2890
02:21:38,660 --> 02:21:41,940
So I'm starting therapy, and I'm consciously working

2891
02:21:41,940 --> 02:21:43,660
to become who I want to be.

2892
02:21:45,780 --> 02:21:46,920
I hope you're all doing well.

2893
02:21:46,920 --> 02:21:47,980
This was all very serious.

2894
02:21:47,980 --> 02:21:51,660
Quick, picture Tom Hanks in a courtroom.

2895
02:21:51,660 --> 02:21:54,540
He's the judge, but he's wearing a mesh crop top,

2896
02:21:54,540 --> 02:21:57,020
and you're pretty sure his nipples are pierced

2897
02:21:57,020 --> 02:21:59,860
and connected by a nerd's rope.

2898
02:21:59,860 --> 02:22:00,700
Okay, bye.

2899
02:22:00,700 --> 02:22:02,460
Hot dog.

2900
02:22:31,200 --> 02:22:39,200
Am I the only one trying to pull over?

2901
02:22:39,200 --> 02:22:47,700
How can you have enough drowning out of the noise?

2902
02:22:47,700 --> 02:22:53,700
This love I know.

2903
02:22:53,700 --> 02:23:01,700
This love I know.

2904
02:23:01,700 --> 02:23:05,700
Fly to fly to the stream.
