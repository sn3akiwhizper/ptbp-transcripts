your bodies are fully in shock your ears are ringing your stomach feels full and content

44
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:22,880
but also just like wretched at the same time somehow it's dark it's cold and it smells

45
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:29,120
there's some sort of what is that it's it's like savory it's in the air there's a sweetness to it

46
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:34,320
and your eyes begin to adjust you see there's a pool of blood on the floor

47
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:41,680
and next to it is a coffin on the ground in this mausoleum you look at each other

like with his first actions as not a giant robot ball like the the just like sheer mundane humanness

57
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,600
of his own movements sends an existential depression through john lee pettymore

58
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,920
at while at the same time like eliciting a comforting nostalgia but he's like

98
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:49,200
games life is a negotiation zach often okay what else are we doing what else you're doing is

99
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:56,240
you're currently in this dark mausoleum and you've just recently realized you are here again

100
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:04,400
clark looks at his watch that has the date on it is it the same day it is indeed december 6th

104
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:28,880

107
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,520

108
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:55,440
my new sanity is 15 i hit my breaking point my new breaking point is three nine is eight all

109
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:01,840
right clark bishop we're gonna roll for a phobia this time so you're gonna roll 3d 100 and then

110
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:07,280
we'll choose which phobia you would like to take and let's go ahead and uh do you want to make this

111
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:11,760
a secret and have them leave the room if you want yeah let's do that get on out of here boys we're

112
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:15,680
just gonna start guessing random fears and throwing them at you throughout the campaign

113
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,000
it might become depending on what it is it could be real obvious real quick

114
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:32,080
all right joe roll d100 for me a 45 45 is going to be herpetophobia which is the fear of reptiles

115
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:38,320
it's fun that would have worked out well last arc are fish people reptiles yeah i don't know

116
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:47,680
no uh 50 50 is iatrophobia which is the fear of doctors

117
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,320
uh for story reasons that'd be great for uh role-playing game reasons that'd be awful

118
00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:02,960
and the third one let's see what you roll here a 46 46 i did 45 50 46 oh weird uh

119
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:10,160
homoclophobia which is the fear of fog fear of fog fog i mean joe would love to take that one

120
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,960
would you let me take that one yeah i don't know if it would ever come up if i mean we'll we'll see

121
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:20,000
it would be fun when it came up if it came up to be afraid of fog yeah let's make it happen i like

122
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
that yeah yeah let's go with fear of fog that's fun all right we'll get the other boys in here

123
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,240
wait am i still do i still think i'm god because that was i think what i got when i broke in the

124
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:33,120
mausoleum the first time what do you think well i never played it very well so i'll leave it up

125
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:39,040
to you do you want another shot at it oh another time that to be better at playing it sure uh

126
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,320
i mean i'll give it a shot i'm worried that i wasn't good at it because i never remembered

127
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,160
it we'll see let's yeah let's try it okay yeah i'll try and keep it into both of them all right

128
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:51,600
cool thinking he's god is so antithetical to the way i like created clark it's really hard to play

129
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,800
him that actually makes sense well that's i part of the whole point of this game right is to have

130
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:02,080
a character that just delves into madness and darkness i'll try and dig a little deeper for

131
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:21,200
you babe oh thank you just tap that well tap that dark viscous well and pump it out i dig it

132
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:30,400
so you guys are all looking at each other in the darkness you see the blood splattered on each

133
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:35,600
other you're having all these memories flashback and you remember everything that already happened

134
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:41,920
and you remember being here keith rips his shirt off to see if the same words are still branded

135
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:47,920
when you rip your shirt off the first thing that you see is the word marvin that was burned into

136
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:55,200
the flesh of your chest has a strike through it it is completely crossed out looking around at

137
00:15:55,200 --> 00:16:01,280
the other burn marks that you remember from last time tilde is still written inside your dominant

138
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:06,800
palm it's not crossed out each of you kind of check each other drew is burned into the flesh

139
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,560
on your backs it's not crossed out i was planning on getting one of those anyway so

140
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:20,800
a drew brand yeah for the boys and maggie is burned into each of your left feet the bottom

141
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:28,640
of your left foot says maggie and clark as you saw last time and the other two saw as well the

142
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:35,280
flesh on the bottom of your left foot has been eaten away in the symbol of the circle of knowledge

143
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:40,880
but her name is not crossed out that is correct what about our injuries sustained like fighting

144
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:47,120
the robot and things those injuries are not a part of your body do you do you fellas think it

145
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:53,920
think it all happened did it happen i want to go back i want to go back at the juggernaut we we we

146
00:16:53,920 --> 00:17:01,600
we saw marvin die and now now his name's crossed out oh i mean we're back here we're back we're

147
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,600
back now i don't know i don't know what i don't know what it means i mean to really get to the

148
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:10,720
bottom of it we'd have to go figure out if he's dead right now or not what if we i think we should

149
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,760
just go take care of this other shit cross brands off our body we lost other people in there is

150
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,280
there somebody is there some way we could we don't have to figure out marvin's there now just

151
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:23,840
something we did between now and what we remember that we could check on we're at the funeral right

152
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:30,000
now right yeah there's ari's body right there you see that ari's body is inside the coffin

153
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,320
were the agents at that funeral did we notice them i didn't look around and see if they're

154
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:41,840
here peeking your head out you see the the sun is shining and uh it is scarce you see the bodies

155
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:48,400
of three men that you fought they're the men with the scars on their faces and necks wearing all

156
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:54,880
black and their bodies are still strewn across the makeshift stage of ari manstein's funeral

157
00:17:54,880 --> 00:18:01,040
what happened rosemary yeah did we see her die first i need an intelligence check from

158
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:05,040
whoever has the highest intelligence i think it's me 75.

159
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:14,000
79 oh do you want to do you want to spend four luck in order to succeed on this check i'll spend

160
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:24,800
two luck life isn't always a highway thomas um no i'm comfortable feeling that okay

161
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:29,920
luck is a precious resource for me right now i only have 20 joe and luke the last time you

162
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:36,320
saw rosemary was when you were standing on top of water right and she reached for the gun

163
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:42,880
john lee pettymore wasn't there but clark bishop oh yeah keith vigno were then why did i roll the

164
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:47,360
chest that was it for a different piece of information gotcha do we have a way to contact

165
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:53,280
rosemary a better piece of information i don't yeah i mean i've got our number do i have kevin's

166
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:59,680
cell phone yeah like yeah but it might be weird me and uh keith saw rosemary die in glass's office

167
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:04,720
so if she answers the phone we'll know that whatever we did didn't didn't happen i don't

168
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,920
know i don't know i don't know how any of this works well let's just doesn't happen let's just

169
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:15,680
assume that some happen somehow he is dead and we did kill him what do we do now i mean start

170
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:19,680
crossing off more names yeah the name got crossed off that's do we need to kill maggie

171
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:27,440
and drew that seems odd are we supposed to not be crossing names off we ain't got no cause to

172
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:34,640
harm tility maybe we just happen to kill one but the other ones we just gotta make go to some

173
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:43,360
we gotta send them on a vacation away from here i'm tired of this damn game we're playing

174
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:51,760
it's like our lives are decided on the rolls of dice well we we could go we could go try to find

175
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:56,720
drew why don't all right i'm gonna call rosemary and we'll see if we've taken her out of all

176
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:02,720
existences in worlds or just the one we can also if she's still alive we'll just call her back in

177
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:10,880
an hour and see if she see if she's dead then then we can get an idea of the the causality that's

178
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,320
going on around us i mean we should yeah let's go ahead and do that but i'm starting to wonder if

179
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:19,040
it even matters if the name is crossed off on our chest and like we just don't we just don't mess

180
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:30,640
with marvin this time what if we just walk away from all like possible loose ends and in like

181
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:37,840
three months x like no marvin's just been building his crime empire you didn't call rosemary so he

182
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:45,040
lived uh i'm gonna call rosemary okay would you like to put it on yeah all right there it is and

183
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:56,480
then we have taylor yeah click all right we'll try that again in an hour and i text rosemary sorry

184
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:04,720
but though okay you get a call back but then it immediately goes away because she sees the time

185
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:10,880
yeah exactly happens all too often okay well i like the idea maybe maybe here in an hour or so

186
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:16,800
all that might be going down did we need anything else from marvin because if that somehow is all

187
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:21,040
going down right now we could it's a huge distraction have we asked ourselves what we

188
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:26,080
even got from marvin in the first place it feels to me we're more lost now than ever well that's

189
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,680
yeah so we went we went over there to see i haven't been clark in a while

190
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:43,120
oh yeah we went down to the goddamn marvin glasses scrap pittin uh we went we went up there to figure

191
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:48,320
out if uh cousin fucking good time what his plans were for contention and we were going to stop him

192
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,880
and i mean if his name is crossed off on her chest maybe we stopped him maybe we stopped his

193
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:59,040
evil plans he did kind of clue us in on that right what was that zack what were his plans

194
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:04,640
for contention i think he told us right i believe that clark bishop and keith vigno were in the room

195
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:10,560
and got to ask a few questions of marvin glass i don't know if we ever asked him about kevin

196
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:16,560
oh kevin asked and then they were just like you idiot like you know do you remember much about

197
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:20,160
that conversation i don't remember i remember that i remember the big one i asked him that's

198
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:25,280
the interesting thing about being alive and dying and then being alive again is it's really hard to

199
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:31,360
remember some stuff listeners that feels that feels like a lifetime ago well do we still have

200
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:36,880
the gun at this point or no i mean theoretically marvin would have it still because we there was

201
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:41,040
another thing that we were going to get right because he had it i don't think no no he wanted

202
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:46,560
us to bring the gun to him yeah oh well no we did yeah and then we got in cages and then we died the

203
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:54,800
first time man if only there was some kind of let's say app like discord where interested parties

204
00:22:54,800 --> 00:23:01,520
could clue us in on what we might be missing if you have any notions on what leads we should be

205
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:08,800
pursuing just head on over to the pretended to be people discord help your boys out where is the gun

206
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:14,880
zach marvin glass as far as you know marvin glass is in possession of the gun that is what your

207
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:21,600
vision john kevin lee pettymore showed you right after the funeral of ari manstein yes earlier

208
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:29,360
today that is correct okay remind the listeners of what happened in that uh vision it was a

209
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:35,840
television screen that's all i remember did it have yours it had your uh my little

210
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:43,200
culture and what letters yeah i remembered mine john as your eyes roll backward your vision goes

211
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:50,640
dark images begin flashing through your mind just snippets moments and you try to keep up as the

212
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:59,840
speed of the sequence waxes and wanes you see a motel safe shiny black and closed you see the sign

213
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:07,120
for beans pond the little pond behind chief maggie cook's house in contention you see a television

214
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:16,320
it is blinking with different letters on it r s t l n e you see a small clearing in the woods

215
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:24,480
and the ground is scorched in a dark room lit by various electronics and machines you see a

216
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:32,160
massive shiny metal sphere 20 feet tall with silvery arms extending from either side

217
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:40,080
a tube connects this gargantuan ball to a machine below the machine begins whirring and you see a

218
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:47,120
small metal sphere roughly one inch in diameter begin moving up through the tubing into the larger

219
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:54,400
armed version of itself as this happens a vast circle opens up in the ceiling and a disorienting

220
00:24:54,400 --> 00:25:00,240
amount of light and sound pours into the room revealing text painted on the back wall that

221
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:08,080
says the same thing you hear violently chanted by an unseen crowd planet juggernaut

222
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:16,160
the scene changes again and you see marvin glass standing at his desk in the grand room you

223
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:23,680
recently stood in as kevin alongside rosemary marvin is holding the odd camera with glass tubes

224
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:30,800
closely inspecting it tapping its lit red luminaire on his desk are two file folders

225
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:40,160
two file folders splayed open entitled the real files on clark bishop and keith vigna

226
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:48,560
contention police officers you can see in keith's file are various clippings about the beans family

227
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:56,080
the tragic the tragic accidental deaths of william and lena keith's parents the takeover of the

228
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:02,800
family business by ferguson in clark's file there is a newspaper article about the murderer who

229
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:12,160
killed clark bishop's parents and love there is a mugshot of a woman smiling a cold vacant smile

230
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:18,560
behind asymmetrical bangs covering one of her eyes written in sharpie underneath the mugshot

231
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:26,000
it says in all caps karen as he kind of remembers and comes out of it just like planet juggernaut

232
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,080
planet juggernaut is still kind of ringing in his ears and they just see like a single

233
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:36,000
tear go down his eye and like touch the the faint smile on his lips john you all right

234
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:44,480
yeah yeah man i'm fine i just miss an old friend well i've i've kind of got an idea

235
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:50,160
marvin has the gun and the camera if we think our actions might be permanent

236
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:56,080
like our old actions in this world like they'll happen here and later on in the day let's just

237
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:01,120
hang around town until afterwards slip on in after everybody's dead take that gun and camera

238
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:06,960
and then head on back to contention i'd get a burger or something in the meantime you're quite

239
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:11,120
full john lee pedemore was always down for a burger what if we somehow interfered with what

240
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:16,080
we had already done if we do that that's why we wait but we would be here now wouldn't wouldn't

241
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:23,200
we i look around i mean wouldn't we be here now if we if the motion was still going forward in time

242
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:28,720
back then well this isn't where we came back into the world i'm this isn't when we came back into

243
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:35,280
the world like look out there what happened at the funeral's already happened what's your point

244
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:42,560
i think the bottom line is that let's say let's say old clark me in the future put these brands

245
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:49,840
on us they set us into a tizzy and we went over and did stuff against marvin and then we woke up

246
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:56,400
back here where old me has put brands on us and marvin is crossed out so maybe he's trying to tell

247
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:01,680
us not to worry about marvin anymore and go after something else on our body list yeah i mean it

248
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:07,680
seems that way well one thing i was thinking in your vision you had beans pond was in it right

249
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:14,640
yeah i remember when i got that watch from my brother when i put it on i had a vision of of

250
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:20,800
digging through dirt and mud and and finding like a door or something in the ground and for some

251
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:26,160
reason i just think i just feel like i i ought to go get that watch and we maybe we should go to

252
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:31,040
beans pond and i think there's something there for us you still have that watch oh it's in it's

253
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:38,400
in my safe at my uh at my hotel room hotel motel hotel motel i mean if we want to just choose a

254
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:43,600
course and go that's that's our first most readily available i mean and i feel more comfortable

255
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:48,000
putting it back on with you guys around because it was making me go crazy you were seeing you

256
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,440
were seeing things keith when you put it i felt like i wasn't i was in a different dimension or

257
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:59,280
universe or timeline or something i had to take it off because it was i felt like i could have

258
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:04,160
got stuck there but with you guys watching me you'd be able to you know make sure nothing too

259
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:09,520
bad happened and i think maybe if i put it on around beans pond i might be able to remember

260
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:13,840
exactly where i was digging or it might show me something else but it's the only thing i can think

261
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:19,920
of and i don't i mean i just came from fighting planet juggernaut and dealing with marvin already

262
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:24,560
i don't really feel like doing that again let's say we do that can you think of what name on our

263
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:29,840
body that might relate to well if it's in contention it could be maggie or drew i mean

264
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:34,400
i feel like also uh we'll find out what name is connected to when we get to the pond yeah plus

265
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:39,200
it's in contention so it could be maggie or drew we see tilde waiting for us beneath the door like

266
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:45,040
holding a gun like you've discovered my brilliant plan detectives yeah you haven't heard her voice

267
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:57,120
yet but that's definitely it so i mean the last we heard from drew was that that creepy

268
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:02,080
voicemail what voicemail was that just said don't go back to contention yeah when's the last time

269
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:09,680
he listened to drew i mean we got his name printed on us and you know he's our co-worker he's our

270
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:14,640
he's our friend i feel like if he was in trouble we might as well go back and try to find him and

271
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:20,000
investigate this this watch i didn't do this last time but i could check in with maggie

272
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:26,320
my my job here was to kill stan manstein and i did that and last time she said i'd have some

273
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:31,040
downtime between here and there if i wanted to help you guys whatever but get a hold of her this

274
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:36,000
time i guess i could call her and say shit's fucked up yeah call her tell her i mean you

275
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,640
basically did your job you check back in with her see tell her what happened but don't tell her that

276
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:45,840
her name's on your foot but i can tell her about the future past i don't know if you trust her i

277
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:51,040
don't know i guess i could just not say just check in and tell her that stan's dead and see what she

278
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:56,400
says can you summon old clark anyway i just like thinking real hard about wheel of fortune or

279
00:30:56,400 --> 00:31:05,680
clark does that and he's like i want to return to this point in the future now clark roll unnatural

280
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:10,320

290
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:21,600
thing i ever heard keith remembers this from last time i kind of step in the way put my foot out

291
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:26,800
trying to trip him while he's running it john and i roll dodge okay perfect go ahead and roll

292
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:37,040

293
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:42,640
i rolled so and joe go ahead and roll unarmed combat for me this part didn't happen because

294
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:50,640
you shot me last time i'm glad we've reached a new level in our relationship that's shooting from the

295
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:54,640
hip to the hip isn't it it's readily available

296
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:01,680
unarmed combat so i fail my hell yeah okay the three of you all trip onto the ground

297
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:08,480
in a pile on top of each other all three of you are in a pile on top of the coffin like

298
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,040
i gave ari a kiss on the cheek goodbye ew

299
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,480
that was horrible inappropriate why'd you say that

300
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:22,480
clark's in the middle of it probably right yeah i was charging you you'd probably fall

301
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:27,680
on me and fell no i fell on the bottom i was trying to trip you up if i'm on the top i get

302
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:31,920
up and kind of i don't um that happened last time i don't i don't know what it is about being in

303
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:36,560
this mausoleum i just it gets me every time while he's disoriented i draw my gun and fire

304
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:49,520
oh no into the air to calm things down i i walk outside the mausoleum to get a breath of fresh

305
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:56,080
air so does clark after that you finally fully make your way out of ari manstein's mausoleum

306
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:02,320
and the sun is beating down on this frigid december day aside from the three android men

307
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:08,320
bodies you notice the crawfish boil still going strong and then there's that old lady in a

308
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:13,920
wheelchair who's like trying to get out of here as fast as she can it's taking a while but only

309
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:20,240
because she's super old do you want let's help her keith is doing some weird gymnastics in his

310
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:28,320
head he's like if rosemary's still alive but she's dead and we came back in time but what we did

311
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:38,640
still counted does it matter if we help this old lady yes by your own questioning emphatically yes

312
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:47,600
if what happened still happened when you guys approach this old woman she looks at you with

313
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:57,360
wide eyes what what hey lady did you by chance see us come through here earlier

314
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:03,360
what is happening ma'am you look like you've seen us before

315
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:11,120
you you came through you you walked through and then you you didn't walk back in you walked

316
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:16,800
through you didn't walk back in no no we walked back in we walked back in it's roll psychotherapy

317
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:26,720
for me what about persuade you can roll persuade yeah it's fun 97 oh and you knew it you know

318
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:38,320
you know that you've been who are you i show her the name marvin like crossed out on like the burn

319
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:44,480
and i'm like that's the last person who asked me too many questions demons demons you're all

320
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:50,640
demons and she rolls as slowly as possible away from you well we definitely didn't help this old

321
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:55,120
lady but we got some questions so what did you what did she mean she said we we went and walked

322
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:59,840
out and then she saw us come out a second time without going back in that means that means we

323
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:05,840
are already on our way good so maybe we should just fucking hang around until after we see

324
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:11,440
planet juggernaut burst out of that pit with ye boys on its back and then we just go in and

325
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:17,520
collect do you think we can just get into the audience maybe well i mean we risk getting froze

326
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:24,080
we just won't we just won't sit in that section i know which section it was the butterfly i mean

327
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:31,520
oh i have disguise i could i could dress up as a little kid since it's family night did you

328
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:36,400
just spoiler this for us you said the butterfly effect that means we weren't there the first time

329
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:43,760
haha i haven't seen it okay keith is pretty steadfast on this me dressing up as a kid

330
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:51,760
idea is there a particular reason it's family night so we could we could blend in better it's

331
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:57,040
not what i meant we escaped we all got out of there fine what if we let us take care of us do

332
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:01,600
something else i mean let them do their job but we need to find the way yeah we need to find the

333
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:07,120
camera and the gun the camera's probably in in marvin's office you think it was there when we

334
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:13,040
were there and then did rosemary use our gun at the end there was it just uh oh yeah she she used

335
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:19,040
the uh glass gun with glass tubing on it well we can't can't really steal that before we wait till

336
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:23,600
it's after all the commotion is done and we just walk in there we need to get away from this

337
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:28,400
mausoleum in case some more of ourselves come out of there let's just go all we have to do

338
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:33,520
mechanically speaking is wait for several hours and then clark's mind is blown thinking about

339
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:40,320
another group of us coming out of that mausoleum after us i can't come right none of this is making

340
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:44,800
sense hey man maybe they'll have tilde crossed off maybe they'll have maggie crossed off then

341
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:56,320
we just gotta sit here till they're all done oh shit

342
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:05,440
you got him fucking all right hey we won the campaign you win you win this has been really

343
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:12,000
fun guys honestly 53 episodes pretty solid we wrapped up every loose end yeah

344
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:20,800
i mean i know you're joking clark but do you want to try it well i mean if we came back we

345
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:25,680
got to cross one of these off i agree i think one of these is meant for us i think it'll be

346
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:29,520
the first one we happen to well what do you want to wait around and try to get those things or

347
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:33,360
just think we should try to get the items if we could let's work and bring them back to contention

348
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:36,960
do you want to literally wait or do you think we should work on something else and then we're like

349
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:41,360
oh yeah we're probably finishing up at marvin's about now then go get those well look we never

350
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:46,960
you freaked out before you called maggie call maggie real quick oh yeah do you guys want me

351
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:55,440
to call maggie yeah guys remember don't try to summon clark again oh that was the other thing

352
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,960
yeah you failed but you still get the knowledge don't get something from that i thought that's

353
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:03,360
what you said yeah you absolutely do you'll tell me later or he's gonna make it doesn't

354
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:08,480
remember the question there was no question you just told me to roll it oh you were trying to

355
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:14,160
like think real hard about coming back to the mausoleum as old clark's to maybe and then i

356
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:20,080
started yelling clark thomas and look if you want to leave the room okay hey man no he can't push us

357
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:32,720
around we're gonna stay

358
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:43,600
so joe but because you crit failed that check on a natural you're gonna get hit with a big wave

359
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:52,000
a crit fail on a natural is a good thing as much as a bad thing i get it yeah so

360
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:59,360
basically how this works is when you freaked out this knowledge wasn't in your head at all

361
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:04,880
you literally just broke a part of your brain just snapped apart right but then when they bring it up

362
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:13,280
you start to piece together what you had seen and what you saw was a dark room surrounded by wood

363
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:21,120
and stone and beautiful ornate candlesticks curtains it's really lush and beautiful in

364
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:29,120
this room it's very clearly not this time period by candlelight you see huddled over a desk is a

365
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:39,040
figure wearing a black cloak scribbling furiously into a book the book itself is extremely ornate

366
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:45,200
seems to be made of some sort of leather that you don't recognize almost uncured and bleeding

367
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:54,160
and as the camera pans around you see lit by this candle is the face of a very old

368
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,560
very decrepit clark bishop

369
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:05,680
you hear a knock at the door and this giant wooden door opens up

370
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:14,080
lord my lord and then you're immediately taken to a car and it is flying down the highway and

371
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:21,280
behind the steering wheel is maggie cook it's a silver accord and she grabs her phone and starts

372
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:27,760
dialing furiously at it can i see what she's dialing she's dialing the number for clark bishop

373
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:31,840
my number the number that i know is mine the number that you know is yours and she looked

374
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:38,800
frantic she looked extremely frantic okay you had all those memories flash through but they were

375
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:43,920
more full last time but your mind couldn't even comprehend them enough these are the traces of

376
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:48,720
information that you could pull out that you're remembering now and as you're remembering it and

377
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:56,960
you're staring at them in this moment the phone in your pocket starts to buzz fucking dope oh my god

378
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:08,080
okay

379
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:16,480
went to whatever town he was from and got me a pin that i still have that says uh

380
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:22,080
i lost my heart to alfred packer

381
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:27,680
the the university where they went was in that town and they're like sardonically in the 60s

382
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:35,680
the students named the the meal hall like alfred packer that's great that's so good we need to have

383
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:39,600
more cannibalism on this show you know there's there was some early on i got a feeling it's

384
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:47,440
coming up oh yeah there was there was an awful awful one early on so as you guys are questioning

385
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:52,880
clark bishop about oh yeah yeah as you guys are questioning clark bishop about this information

386
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:58,320
you see him reach for his pocket reach for this and i just in once with motion it comes out of my

418
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:57,280
might be her fellas clark roll alertness for me

419
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:09,040
what's the wheel of fortune song i fail wheel of fortune are you going to be the one who wins

420
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:18,000
wheel of fortune a fortune can you be the one who crushes the wheel that's it tight all right so

421
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:26,240
you guys are standing around and a silver honda accord comes flying down it matches the one that's

422
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:33,520
sitting in front of you and driving is maggie cook john lee pettymore and keith vigna have not seen

423
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:39,120
her in the flesh but you've been told that she's alive so i'm not gonna have your old sanity but

424
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:46,400
she pulls up right next to you guys rolls down her window and she's got big ass sunglasses on

425
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:53,440
and she looks at clark clark we got a mission we got a this is okay so i sent out everybody else

426
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:58,800
and i you you three might be the only one who can handle this right now because if he sees me

427
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:05,280
he will lose his marbles but you know bruce robin and then she looks at keith vigna specifically and

428
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:13,520
keith you would know that bruce robin is ferguson's business partner okay and he is now the full owner

429
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:21,360
of bar corp do you get it bruce robin like batman and robin yes yeah yeah like a hundred percent

430
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:28,320
you would know bar corp is beans and robin corporation they just go by bar corp he has

431
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:34,160
gone just fully insane he is a danger to everyone around him he is a danger to the mission of the

432
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:40,080
circle of knowledge and he is a danger to the world as we know it i hate to do this to you

433
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:50,160
again right back to back but i think he might need to be taken out physically with death do you think

434
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:57,360
round trip that could take us less than three or four hours absolutely i mean he i would imagine

435
00:47:57,360 --> 00:48:02,240
he's at one of the businesses right now which can't be more than an hour away so well hey we

436
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:06,560
we were looking for something to do to kill the time before we get those things maggie is this

437
