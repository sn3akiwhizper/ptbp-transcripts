38
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:23,900
dude that looks like he has like ramen noodle hair and he's like walking by and for i literally had

39
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:30,140
to rewind it because i thought it was kyle mooney like doing a character because he like walked like

40
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:36,460
kyle mooney and was making some weird like joke and like making his hands and arms do exactly

41
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:43,020
kyle mooney shit but it was just some old like dude with like terrible hair oh are you talking

42
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:47,820
about his weird security guard guy yeah he like doesn't look like a real person but i was like

43
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:53,500
i'm like is kyle mooney in this and then realized no because he was probably 10 years old when that

44
00:05:54,060 --> 00:06:01,180
was filmed you were right luke it was good that we discussed that on the podcast instead of before

45
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:08,860
we recorded well i just wanted something to say i think he said he had multiple things to say

46
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:16,460
about the documentary well i ended up looking up who that guy was so we've gotten the first one

47
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:23,660
oh oh one b so part two of the first thing who is the skiff fellow i uh don't remember his name

48
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:29,260
but he was like worked security for the for the united center and that was it that's all i could

49
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:40,700

52
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:58,540
record this on the podcast we would still not be recording the podcast and that's a very good

53
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:03,900
true yeah he engineered it he made it happen he hacked us all and some would argue we're not

54
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:11,420
recording the podcast yet only if it takes it in are we technically recording the podcast

71
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:07,260
i like i'm down on the ground yeah no absolutely because you succeeded on your constitution check

72
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:12,860
you don't have any mechanical disadvantages toward you currently based on the way that

73
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:19,660
i like playing this game cool okay good to know i mean if you try to sprint after someone i'll

74
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:24,860
probably be like hey maybe take a massive negative yes yeah yeah besides that what's professor horse

75
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:30,940
green doing i don't know where are we yes that is correct that was my question for you

76
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:37,260
yeah no one answered no i'm covering the door and he's injured outside the door

77
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:43,500
right yard of this the coal home i think you're also injured next to me no i'm very hurt i know

78
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:49,900
that but i got a little healing so i'm yes i was i was close to dead no i'm not you just blew the

79
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:56,700
brains like you just blew the head off of the preacher doctor sheriff bobby custard right but

80
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:01,580
i didn't see it so i missed the sanity and you're the only one who didn't lose sanity

81
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:11,020
so horace horace shouts uh by god maybe he'll listen to the law or a man of god where's the

82
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:18,620
preacher sheriff he just starts reaching around him trying to feel out for the the preacher

83
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:23,260
sheriff everett is not going to look back but just kind of gesture back to where the body is

84
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:28,620
you done nailed him you done nailed him and you're gesturing to the back of the wagon where his body

85
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:35,740
flew but the head is sitting about 10 feet away from horace green on the ground where it landed

86
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:43,740
with a thump and if you were golfing you would have to fix the divot that the head made when

87
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:50,300
it landed initially in the dirt horace green vomits good heavens

88
00:10:55,900 --> 00:11:03,340
pearlman's just clinching his his leg and he's just like god damn it but somehow due to his

89
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:09,180
his sex icon status i think is really powering to stand up because you can't be sexy while you're

90
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:13,100
bleeding on the ground i thought you're gonna say sitting down or sitting down

91
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:23,580
zack trust me no one's ever looked sexy sitting in a chair ever or sitting on the ground or

92
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:29,660
laying down has anyone ever been sexy laying in a bed i'm looking at five really sexy dudes

93
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:36,620
sitting in chairs right now we should record the show standing maybe oh no i think the vibe change

94
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:42,140
the people couldn't handle that there'd be way too much chaotic energy happening if

95
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:46,060
i we weren't bound to our chairs over each other more sorry i stood for a second

96
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:56,460
god damn it i i have to download these files luke no you don't you literally don't like it's not a

97
00:11:56,460 --> 00:12:01,980
rule that you have to look at what luke sends us over the chat while we're recording minions

98
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:07,420
pornography it's true it's it's not a rule but luke if you want people to look at them you need

99
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:10,780
to send a link or something because these make you download the file and i'm not gonna do that

100
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:16,940

109
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:18,140

the bed and still in handcuffs but he's not cowering in fear he's now crouching in concentration

132
00:15:54,860 --> 00:16:03,020
focusing deeply on the words he is chanting into this disheveled bedroom a beaming light forms on

133
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:11,820
his lips and a white hot blaze of color begins dripping down viscous and alive and it puddles

134
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:19,660
beneath silas cole's chanting mouth onto the dusty floor below before flowing gently toward the far

135
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:28,460
side of the room okay luke you can also see as mary cole there's an oily black substance leaking

136
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:36,620
from your facial orifices you can kind of feel it like a like a perpetual runny nose and eyes

137
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:45,020
and ears and mouth and this squamous eye core seems to almost pull itself down to the ground

138
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:51,340
where this mesmerizing brilliant light has pooled between the two doors of this room

139
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:58,940
the syrup made out of the absence of color that just came out of you begins swirling into its

140
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:06,380
opposite and the two unnatural ungodly glass-forming liquids at first refuse to blend

141
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:14,860
like oil and vinegar but then the most beautiful awe-inspiring color you've ever seen forms from

142
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:22,140
this bond and another equally mind-shattering color joins it and another and another and now

143
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:28,140
the old wooden floor on the far side of this bedroom between the only two doors

144
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:34,380
is covered jam to jam with a perversely extraordinary technicolor portal

145
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:48,060
right so i'm gonna go over and take the handcuffs off of silas look at him and be like okay i'm gonna

147
00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:02,140
portal carefully and opens the door shuts it behind him and as he enters back into the living

or join us next time so judge ephraim courtland opens up the front door to the cole homestead

164
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:54,220
as ever at pace and jack promen have their guns set on the front door and professor horace green

165
00:19:54,220 --> 00:20:03,100
is horrifyingly staring at the head of pastor sheriff preacher doctor pastored preacher

166
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:08,940
doctor pastored preacher sheriff doctor bobby custard which is on the ground about 10 feet

167
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:15,260
away from him judge ephran courtland as you walk out you see that head just sitting on the ground

168
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:23,740
and you do not see the body blood is everywhere and the three of these men

169
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:29,820
are the only ones out here you no longer find the wild crazed teenager

170
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:39,740
like one of those teenagers at one of those concerts that you might find just wild smoking

171
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:45,180
reaper oh my god can you even imagine that's probably what made her this way every every uh

172
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:50,380
jumps and it almost shoots but oh it's judge horace sees its judge and shoots

173
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:58,460
i come outside and look and see the head and i just look at them like what

174
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:06,540

182
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:01,180
ain't much for fighting but sometimes things just happen in battle you can't you can't always

183
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:05,980
predict it i've been in plenty of bar fights where i accidentally punched some fellers i

184
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:10,540
didn't mean to and when you throw guns in the mix you just know you're asking for trouble it ain't

185
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:16,860
your fault so just to if you could if you could put the head down and and we might need you in

186
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:23,260
here but there's there's things happening so if you put it down of of course of course we're

187
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:27,340
needed inside and he takes he doesn't put the head down he carries it with him

190
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:47,420
and i just kind of point to the first room inside i'll carefully start dottering up but i want to

191
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:52,060
keep my gun kind of at the ready i'm not pointing at anything in particular but i could if i needed

192
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:57,580
to and i'm cautious about it all every night doing so hot if you want to take lead i'll back

193
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:04,300
you up though as i'm i assume i'm like dripping blood all over the place at this point 100

194
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:09,980
professor horace green is also dripping blood from the head he's carrying are you carrying it

195
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:15,820
with you into the home with two hands or by the hair with one hand or you buy the hair with one

196
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:26,060
hand uh-huh why just curious uh horace green doesn't he doesn't hear that question

197
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:34,620
no yeah i'm asking thomas i guess what's going on inside professor horace green's

198
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:37,980
mind well it's because this is a comedy podcast and that's hilarious

199
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:47,020
yeah i don't know why you're slowing it down like this sack

200
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:50,460
oh i was thinking that we could have like a good character moment

201
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:52,780
you're you're interrupting a good character moment

202
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:58,940
he's dazed carrying a head around and not saying anything

203
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:05,420
he's busy downloading my pictures of wasniac that won't make sense because i'll have edited

204
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:18,620
it as the three of you head in specifically horace green uh the smell of rotten flesh

205
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:26,460
is the first thing you notice as you pass through the swinging open front door of the whole abode

206
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:32,460
at first you think the stench could be from the unattended dishes strewn throughout this living

207
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:40,700
room the remnants of several meals now covered in a few buzzing flies but that static hum of flies

208
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:47,980
it's so loud in your ears and looking over you see that that is due to the large swarm hovering

209
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:54,700
about the body of miss kitty which is laying lifeless across one of the sitting chairs

210
00:24:55,340 --> 00:25:02,780
lifeless to be sure because this body the skin is chewed up so badly that chunks are hanging off

211
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:11,740
or completely missing and the dripping dark red blood pooling below on the floor but especially

212
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:20,860
lifeless due to the way this body is crumpled her back held directly in the middle by one of

213
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:29,740
the armrests there's an unnatural angle there as the top half of her torso dangles straight down

214
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:35,500
perpendicular to the floor i'll never get a chance to string her up now

215
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:44,140
uh go ahead and roll sanity for me pace pearlman and green oh god my dice

230
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:16,060

233
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:41,020
i think he's gonna fix it on that head

234
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:47,820
so

235
00:27:56,300 --> 00:28:03,340
horse green jack pearlman judge ephraim courtland the three of you hear a slight murmur

236
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:05,820
from the next room deeper into this house

237
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:22,620
bob he's oh i chased him in there and he's uh tied up but he's been yet just saying those

238

239
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:35,580
right there horace holds the head up and looks at it quizzically i don't think he'll like this

240
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:39,660
this is the first time ever he's noticed that you've brought the head in with you

241
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:44,220
what the hell you why are you holding up the head you should have just left that outside what

242
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:49,900
are you why'd you bring a head in it what's going on here horse so he can see he's dead horse he's

243
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:58,140
dead he killed him okay professor horse green starts laughing no no no yeah no he doesn't

244
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:05,340
horace looks really confused and he looks at you and he looks at the head and then he moves the

245
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:12,300
jaw holy shit and he's like i'm not dead oh my god

246
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:21,340
ever ever exchanges a glance with like jack pearlman but it's not of like scared it's just

247
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:32,460
like well we lost one i guess uh jack just shrugs yep you're getting the floors dirty with all that

248
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:38,940
blood there i don't horse if you could put a napkin under bobby that would be he's dripping

249
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:46,380
he's causing me oh my oh my how how rude and horace takes off his um his handkerchief and

250
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:53,740
ties it around the stump on the neck i don't think you're gonna be making much more of a mess

251
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:58,540
that's already in here those other two rooms ain't too ain't too good either well it ain't

252
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:07,900
proper for a head not to be covered on the bottom i think he's quite dashing now aren't you yes i am

253
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:19,260
why are you all looking at me like that maybe we should continue upon our our our business here and

254
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:25,740
talk to horace about some stuff later yeah well if we i think i hear him still chanting in there but

255
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:34,300
uh he's just passed in through those doors what did you do to him i just i got him

256
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:43,900
beat up pretty good and i got him hogtied and and and cuffed up and he's just i don't know i might

257
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:48,460
have hit him in the head too hard or something what do you reckon he killed his kitty for i i

258
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:54,140
didn't really have time to find out i just kind of lost it on him and then uh came to see what

259
00:30:54,140 --> 00:31:00,620
you guys were doing i'm you know didn't want to do it alone you think maybe she was breaking into

260
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:04,460
his house last night and that's he must have caught her that's that's got to be what happened

261
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:09,660
could be why to keep her inside though he didn't he didn't mention her back at the at the church

262
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:13,420
seems like that something he would have never liked silas maybe he stole something from her

263
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:20,460
like he stole something from me but what do you think happened teddy i think the zombie girl

264
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:28,220
later oh well now that's a thought perhaps what do you guys think maybe we ought to just go ask

265
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:34,220
him yeah i think it's best we talk to silas cole face to face right man figure this all out if you

266
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:39,740
want to lead the way go ahead because i feel like i'm gonna lose it on him again if i go in there

267
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:46,060

311
00:36:56,060 --> 00:37:01,260
or you can continue to walk behind him i'll still stay behind him with my gun kind of tracked on the

312
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:10,380
door so i'm trailing him i'm letting it is your turn i uh sorry finish that thought oh me yeah

314
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:19,580

318
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:47,180
uh but now zach's all like let's make this a forecast but that was really good no

319
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:55,180
what was that a pun of podcast oh forecast anyway

320
00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:01,580

323
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:22,700
gently grab a horse by the sleeve and like pull him like guide him into the room

324
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:26,460
horse and the skull look at each other and they're like after him

325
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:28,940

330
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:08,140
professor horace green as you keep direct eye contact with preacher sheriff doctor

331
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:15,500
detached head bobby custard you notice out of the corner of your peripheral a disturbingly

332
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:23,100
magnificent technicolor swirl of light covering the part of the floor in this room that's

333
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:30,220
immediately in front of you it's likely the most beautiful thing you have ever seen and yet there

334
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:38,060
is an endlessness about it that inspires both awe and dread i need you to roll sanity

335
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:53,420
uh fail um 73 on a 60 you're gonna lose one sanity um horace uh horace walks through the

336
00:39:53,420 --> 00:40:02,060
portal horse green with this head in one of your hands you step down into nothingness

337
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:06,860
and immediately you feel content

338
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:16,860
that's all i can say at this time oh dang did i just turn myself into a tilde zombie i can't

339
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:23,340
answer that question currently well a zombie with a zombie with a little head buddy would

340
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:31,500
be really funny it would be very fun all right so you can uh you can leave the zoom call if you

341
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:37,500
want honestly okay i'll stay i mean i'll be by my phone so yeah you can hang out on the zoom call

342
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:42,380

343
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:57,180
ever paste jack pearlman judge ephraim courtland the three of you see professor horace green walk

344
00:40:57,180 --> 00:41:05,020
into the room however you are at a current angle where you are right now walking towards this door

345
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:10,620
to where you can't quite see where he went once he got into the room and you can't really see

346
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:18,300
into the room quite yet into the next room where silas is exactly okay and ever at pace it is your

347
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:27,660
turn the fact that we're in turn order would make joe nervous but ever it's just walking in to see

348
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:34,620
where judge ephraim courtland tied up silas i think ever pace would be nervous due to the odd

349
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:42,380
chanting that you can now hear coming from this room that you know is silas cole who is apparently

350
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:50,940
tied up hogtied uh who is saying bob da hahaha bob da hahaha bob da hahaha and with the door

351
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:56,220
open you can hear it quite clearly and there's that body that was all munched up on i kind of

352
00:41:56,220 --> 00:42:02,220
stop when i hear wait what oh the miss kitty you mean yeah yeah there's reasons to be uh nervous

353
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:08,380
not forever namely everything that's just a chewed up body ain't nothing here now found

354
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:16,300
miss kitty she's dead that sucks so it goes but mission accomplished he hears uh he hears the

355
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:21,260
chanting and stops and listens for a second and kind of looks back at judge and pearlman

356
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:27,820
bob da hahaha ring a bell for anybody bob da hahaha is he is he in town you think he's a relation

357
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:32,620
or something maybe it's his lawyer he needs his lawyer bob da hahaha maybe i i don't know judge

358
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:37,900
is there a is there a lawyer in town bob da hahaha i think i've dealt with him once or twice

359
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:42,380
that's what it is he's gonna need a good lawyer for this one and i keep walking in

360
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:48,860
uh yeah justin and luke take off your headphones real quick for me

361
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:06,140
joe as you walk toward the open door you see a technicolor swirl has taken over the entirety

362
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:13,740
of the floor right is you where you're about to walk in on i need you to roll a sanity check as

363
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:21,980
all of these rainbow colors just wash back and forth in a circle around where your next step

364
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:30,620
might be i pass a 16 on a 78 you lose no sanity ever wants to look up at the ceiling to see what's

365
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:36,540
projecting this down onto the floor there's nothing up on the ceiling that would affect

366
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:41,100
what is happening here on the floor does anything change with my step

367
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:46,700
like into like onto it do you step onto it i thought you said i did you don't have to

368
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:55,020
well fuck i think i think since he didn't pass a since he passed a sanity role he doesn't he's

369
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:59,020
not too worried about it he just thinks that a pretty light show going on in here somehow

370
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:04,860
there must be a stained glass revolving uh candle lit thing and as that first step goes down you

371
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:12,700
feel your foot continue to move through the floor as ever it pays trips and falls face first into

372
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:21,980
this technicolor swirl and you feel your body become wholly content in this moment welcome

373
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:31,660
evert professor horace green says to you in a space of pure darkness and somehow at the same

374
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:46,220
time completely technicolor welcome evert horse is that you yes eddie's here too oh you you

375
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:52,780
brought the you brought the head with you too all right where are we who cares doesn't it feel great

376
00:44:53,900 --> 00:45:02,460
yeah i mean i don't know if i ever experienced a time when i was so it just it's relaxing i guess

377
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:07,980
and the two of you are just falling but you're falling up seemingly you reckon you think we're

378
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:13,020
on our way up to the big man in the sky i think that's probably what this is what do you think

379
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:16,620
happened you think we we must have stepped in a bear trap got us got us through an artery or

380
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:22,220
something in that room to me it looked like a beautiful gateway to an ascendant plane

381
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:27,100
that's what i saw too that must have been the last drags of the blood leaving our body and

382
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:32,460
making our brains see the something that would give us comfort in our final moments evert uh

383
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:41,100
normally i'm a man of of reason and science but uh well science never made me feel like this

384
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:47,660
i think probably we just yeah we died you're right yep we died don't question it we're going

385
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:56,620
to heaven this is great uh just enjoy this this falling upwards as it were clara here i come

386
00:45:56,620 --> 00:46:03,980
and above you you see only darkness it'll take me a minute i don't even see the light yet but

387
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:20,220
i'll be there jack promen yeah hey man hey it's your turn uh i'm following evert into the into the

388
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:27,260
thing gun out and as you walk up to the door that is slightly open that both professor horse green

389
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:36,540
and evert pace have walked through you see on the floor an incredible swirl of technicolor

390
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:44,460
vibrancy just washing about in circles around and around the floor and i need you to roll sanity for

391
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:51,420
me but it's so party it is but it is crazy as hell oh 51 yeah on a 39 it'd be cool if i could

392
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:56,140
pass one sanity check well with a failed sanity check

393
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:04,060
you're going to be at a negative depending on what you want to do here okay but looking into

394
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:10,060
this room uh you just see the majority of this floor about half the room is covered in this

395
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:19,020
gorgeous rainbow colored swirl like light that is mesmerizing light like bioluminescence or whatever

396
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:25,580
you do not see ever at pace you do not see professor horse green you only see

397
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:30,220
a bed that is flipped over and from behind it you hear

398
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:40,300
silas what the hell are you chanting that for who's bob to hob and i guess i'll have you roll

399
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:49,980
a dexterity at a negative 20 to keep your footing as you enter into this room negative 20 because

400
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:56,940
you failed you're saying fuck 29 on a 25 so close that'll do it as you uh

401
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:06,220
as your foot steps into this room without being able to make the jump

402
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:13,980
over it or stop yourself from stepping onto it your foot moves through the floor

403
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:24,940
and you begin falling through this technicolor swirl of a portal and you begin falling upward

404
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:34,940
and upward and you feel completely content physically oh that sounds nice except for

405
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:40,460
the part where i'm in an endless hell of some kind yes it is complete darkness and at the

406
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:47,340
exact same time every color you've ever seen swirling around you and above you there's nothing

407
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:53,580
but the absence of light and the bodies of ever at pace and professor horse green who are having

408
00:48:53,580 --> 00:49:00,220
a perfectly normal conversation oh shit jack did the bear trap get you too we just all plumb ran

409
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:07,180
into it didn't we hello jack um long story short we're probably in heaven uh i don't want to get

410
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:11,500
too into it because we're probably gonna have to do this again with the judge really quickly here

411
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:17,340
so uh but if you could if if you can just wait if you could just wait wait we're gonna get to

412
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:28,540
it in just a moment i'm sure we'll answer all your questions and you wait and you wait

413
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:36,300
and the judge does not come oh thank god the judge must have skipped over that bear trap in

414
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:42,380
that room kind of bear trap sends you into another goddamn i guess it could have been some kind of

415
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:46,220
trap that fell from the ceiling but either way something killed us as soon as we walked in the

416
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:51,340
room and now we're on our way up to heaven most likely you sure we're dead can i touch ever at

417
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:57,260
pace's face like i put my hand out to touch his face like face off where i go yeah and touch his

418
00:49:58,060 --> 00:50:04,220
face you're asking a lot of questions for a content person you're kind of ruining the vibe

419
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:12,700
here man when i when i reach out to touch his face do i feel it feels like someone else's hand

420
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:19,740
is touching his face yep jack it's me oh but that feels right to you well i don't know what we can

421
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:25,580
do did you all try looking around are we walking right now are we like floating we're floating up

422
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:31,100
we're going to heaven it's just a matter of time when jack says that though ever it's like hey i

423
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:35,820
didn't i didn't try that and he puts his arm behind him and tries to get momentum in one

424
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:41,740
direction or another see if he can move through the air i feel so graceful i've never felt this

425
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:47,500
graceful not for not for 50 years at least seemingly out of nowhere the three of you are

426
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:54,460
sitting on the ground above you is pure darkness the same darkness that you've seen above you this

427
00:50:54,460 --> 00:51:04,940
entire time and beneath you the ground is made of pure light well it would appear we've made it

428
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:08,460
holy fuck sack

429
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:17,340
yeah i thought there'd be more clouds and harps do you think jesus is up here jesus

430
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:25,500
jesus jesus you here jesus me every jesus you come out now jesus jesus

431
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:35,580
and as professor horace green opens and closes the jaw of the decapitated head

432
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:42,460
of preacher sheriff dr bobby custard as he's jeff dunham's jesus

433
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:49,180
that's right that's right that's what i think of you professor horace green

434
00:51:56,300 --> 00:52:00,540
the biggest insult i can think of you belong in the gutter

435
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:12,060
the eyes of preacher sheriff dr decapitated head bobby custard open and then the camera pans down

436
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:33,820
into the bright pure light and as the camera pans down into this bright white light it begins

437
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:41,660
traveling through this technicolor cylinder and on the other side goes up into the bedroom

438
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:48,860
of silas and mary cole moves directly up to the face of judge ephraim

439
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:54,860
courtland uh well silas that was a hell of a lot easier than i thought it was gonna be

440
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:11,340
oh fuck you holy shit chanting stops the technicolor swirl on the floor dissipates

441
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:19,020
and silas pushes the bed back over into its horizontal position and he rushes

442
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:26,140
to judge ephraim courtland and throws his arms around the back of his neck

443
00:53:26,860 --> 00:53:34,140
judge ephraim courtland places his lips right on silas's mouth and a deep deep kiss

444
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:43,980
holy shit and silas cole pulls back and says i love you mary

445
00:53:46,780 --> 00:53:57,260
what the fuck back i love you too silas oh my god so i can never trust any of you again

446
00:53:58,140 --> 00:54:00,780
like in a zack game

447
00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:07,580
i was like okay i'll just get them in here i'll probably have to fight them into the portal

448
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:18,380
