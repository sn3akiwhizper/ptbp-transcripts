00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,820
Hey y'all, just in case y'all forgot, it is indeed 26 years ago, and for some reason,

2
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:22,280
my voice can transmit to the past, from the present, and speaking of the present, y'all

3
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:28,600
know I am here to bestow my vocal gifts upon all of y'all, no matter the when.

4
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:37,440
Live from 694.2 PTBP, time traveling dogs named Wolf can be scary, but what is not scary

5
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:45,780
is howling with Wolf, a segment I am definitely not forced to do against my will by my amorphous

6
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:52,140
producer who may or may not possess ownership over my soul.

7
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:58,400
This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from At Perfect Us Nemo, who tweeted about the show

8
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,700
and tagged at Pretending Pod.

9
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:07,500
They wanted to hear your boy Wolf vocalize the frustrations of the BBEG in their own

10
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,660
campaign.

11
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:16,660
They write, I am the ancient, I am the land, I was vain, and due to my hubris, I lost my

12
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:17,660
beloved.

13
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:24,200
When I let outsiders into my own home, I was met with trickery and recklessness, going

14
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:29,980
through my domain like a plague, destroying everything that was dear to me.

15
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:35,980
Let them rally the creatures in the valley, let them storm my castle, all they will achieve

16
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:40,540
is a long and painful prelude to an eternal march.

17
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:45,780
And I shall wait as long as it is necessary, for nothing is gone forever.

18
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:50,340
I will reclaim what is rightfully mine.

19
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:58,060
Well that was certainly very fun and light hearted and not at all super fucked up dark

20
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,060
and weird.

21
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:05,220

40

63
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:52,500
anyway that's all i have to say all right so this man who just walked into the circular

64
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:58,980
meeting room is wearing a white dress shirt gray slacks and black shoes there are six

65
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:05,360
chairs and a half circle all facing a single chair that this man stands in front of as

66
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:11,300
he introduces himself hello there folks my name is james and i am the executive director

67
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:23,680
here at calm comfy campground i need everyone to roll a constitution check what pass fail

68
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:32,380
pass solid fail okay so justin charles digby and thomas bradley cooper would both realize

69
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:40,980
that that's your name that this room is sort of tilted as you're walking to your seats

70
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:48,400
you feel an uneasiness in your balance as this room is tilted a bit toward the chair

71
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:54,560
that is alone on the other side and you all sit down in this half circle and he sits down

72
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,120
with you i pull the chair out for angela even though there's nothing that she's scooting

73
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:02,880
up to i just kind of stand behind and pull it out let her sit and push it under thank

74
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:08,920
you so much for really like seeing me in that moment and acknowledging that i'm here of

75
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:13,740
course i want to start by introducing myself and telling you a little bit about this place

76
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:21,040
we obviously as you know uh specialize in taking people who need to focus on something

77
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:27,600
and get that focus either a little bit more accurate or there at all some people need

78
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:33,180
to be forced all the way in so uh we're just here to help you achieve whatever desires

79
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:39,220
you may be heading toward we can help you with that goal and i just think the group

80
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:44,120
session is the best way to start any of these sort of weekend events so if everyone could

81
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:49,100
go around and introduce themselves i think that would be absolutely fantastic well i

82
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:57,100
am angela fairfield and i'm here with my husband raj hey hey there hey there folks and we're

83
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:03,980
here to really focus on like moving forward in our marriage and making this thing last

84
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:09,500
and and really like we both care so much about each other that i think that we're going to

85
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:15,340
be able to do it right raj we're certainly gonna gonna try of course i'll do i'm open

86
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:27,060
and uh i'm willing and was that walter clapping walter claps james looks around the room at

87
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:34,060
the others okay well uh let's uh jump in here uh i like to play two truths and a lie to

88
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:39,200
get things started so basically how this works is we'll go around the half circle here and

89
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:47,300
everyone will say three statements two of which are true and one of which is a lie and

90
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:52,940
after you say the three statements we'll each go around and ask a question about the three

91
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:57,740
statements to try to determine which one the lie is right so we'll ask a question you'll

92
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:01,520
have to answer it and then we can all kind of gauge who each other are and how we react

93
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:06,760
to each other i've got a question shoot psychologically what is the point of this game oh it's just

94
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:11,340
to help with these group sessions moving along we really want there to be an air of openness

95
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:15,600
and vulnerability and so we think the best way to do that is to have you all know each

96
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:22,360
other why lie in the background i ask alan what is openness it's just a willingness to

97
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:27,440
connect with others i believe who the fuck is alan thank you alan is the older man who

98
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,860
is the tall lead man wearing the charcoal suit who is there with the 16 year old walter

99
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:37,740
when he notices that they're there together i give you guys both like a strange look i

100
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:42,780
am still just looking at my feet taking this in i lean to the council it was like a batman

101
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:48,880
situation as his ward puts yeah i think it's definitely a batman type situation uh they

102
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:53,180
can probably explain to you their father-son dynamic more than i could but let's go ahead

103
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:57,500
and start with uh charles digby down there you got two treats in the life for me sir

104
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:03,300
yeah i got a couple for you fire away i blackmailed the mayor of the city i have an overweight

105
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,700
cat named rolo

106
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:17,300
she's working on it she was you guys stopped i sold one of my kidneys to buy my new car

107
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:21,360
oh those are some spicy ones all right let's go around the circle here and ask some questions

108
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:31,680
let's start with you bradley why'd you sell your kidney i mean what kind of car

109
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:42,060
it's a uh a new mobile lie that's the lie i agree did you show us your belly i would

110
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:48,480
like to ask openness i would like to show us go with his line of questioning and ask

111
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:54,120
to see the renal scar i don't feel comfortable enough with you guys to to do that i look

112
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:58,800
at uh what's your character's name bradley cooper that's not a famous person's name yeah

113
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:05,940
i look at bradley and i go i agree with your thought it is a lie thanks charles how much

114
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:11,600
is uh kidney going for these days it's about 20 000 or so did the car cost all of that

115
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,260
money or did you have some left over i had some left over what'd you spend it on got

116
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:21,620
a new camera what was your first lie my first lie that you ever told the first lie that

117
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:26,700
no the first lie of the three that you read you uh you blackmailed a mayor what was that

118
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:32,420
about i had some stuff on them what did you have on the mayor dad i can handle this oh

119
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:37,580
i'm part of the group as well and i would like to contribute so what what did you have

120
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:44,040
on the mayor there alan let the kids be i accept the line of questioning i'm not allowed

121
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:49,140
i'm not allowed to discuss it that's part of the blackmail deal did you get money for

122
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:54,620
it or was it some other yes you got money for it for blackmailing the mayor yes i do

123
00:12:54,620 --> 00:13:01,640
want to reiterate that this is two truths and a lie both of these seem like lies but

124
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:06,080
one of them isn't one of them's fake he got money from either blackmailing the mayor or

125
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:12,860
selling his kidney that's how i pulled up here in a new mobile i but he wouldn't need

126
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:18,720
money twice no one needs no one needs more money so i i reached my things i reached my

127
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:26,060
hand out and poke him in like the side walter i like where where a kidney scar would be

128
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:32,620
walter you can't just poke people i i also go in and start it is part of this is part

129
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:37,280
of the game i have to win the second thing he said let's go ahead and try to not touch

130
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:41,340
each other during this game if that's okay with i'm pretty uncomfortable with what's

131
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:47,880
happening here what was the second thing he said hey do i feel a scar through my can i

132
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:56,840
roll that can i roll like search or something yeah roll search no roll surgery tied i got

135
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:29,940
away charles does he feel a surgery scar there he does not oh i believe that that is the

136
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:35,340
lie if he touched him and there's no scar if there's no scar i bet that's the lie i

137
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:44,140
agree calm down i get like really fucking uncomfortable and i'm like kind of like hugging

138
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:47,780

189
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:39,540
purpose of the game you better yeah i i don't think maybe you should participate in the

190
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:45,220
questioning on this one but i look down at my feet and stand motionless who's your favorite

191
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:50,900
character on the beverly hillbillies milburn driesdale he's a good businessman and he's just

192
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:55,620
trying to keep the money in his bank what does steak taste like steak oh i like the meaty

193
00:20:56,420 --> 00:21:01,300
just ripping something apart questioning what's uh what what's that's a ribeye part from from

194
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:09,940
other steaks why is it so special to you i love the fat i like how fat it is uh nothing i like

195
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:16,820
more than just the fat on a steak do you uh know the theme song to beverly hillbillies flanston

196
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:27,940

197
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:35,060
i lean over to angela that's how you figure it out pretty quick

198
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:40,180
okay you're right okay it's not my favorite show i've seen it a couple times i i like

199
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:45,460
that milburn driesdale but i i just couldn't think of anything else on the spot you got me

200
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:53,860
okay well i guess that was pretty short wind damn got it oh my god walter looks up and says

201
00:21:53,860 --> 00:22:01,460
black gold oil that is uh walter if you want to go next following your father there this is going

202
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:08,340
to be very difficult for me because i do not like to lie but i will do it for the sake of community

203
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:20,900
i don't own a bed i had a total hip replacement last year and i have only owned one pair of shoes

204
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:26,820
as an adult i want to look tennis yeah i look at the shoes what do them shoes look like what

205
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:32,980
do they look like they are pristine white new balances okay i'm pretty sure i know the lie

206
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:37,780
but just to be sure i want to kick them in the hip not like hard i want to like knock them over

207
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:43,620
with my foot what i just want to see if he can stand or if his hip got replaced bradley that is

208
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:48,740
not the kind of behavior that we want to do here well but you're reacting to that as what was the

209
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:54,740
result of my behavior is he on the ground as bradley's foot comes up to my hip i grab it that'll

210
00:22:54,740 --> 00:23:01,940
be a strength yeah let's see hold on strength or can i use martial arts you can use martial arts

211
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:08,900
either way i got martial arts i got an 85 unarmed combat don't roll don't roll worse than me

212
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:20,100
i got a one so fucking kill him he shatters your hip no it's contested whether or not it was

213
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:29,540
you destroy this child what do you want to do oh i just want to kind of like push him with my foot

214
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:35,940
and see if he can stand up i want to test his hip all right as his foot comes into me i try to

215
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:43,060
grab it but his foot is moving too fast he hits me in the hip and pushes me over like three inches

216
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:48,020
but then i immediately stand back up completely straight roger jumps out of his chair hey whoa

217
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:52,980
yeah that's not the kind of behavior that we want to like do in these group sessions like i said

218
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:57,380
about touching people earlier it's mostly a physical thing that i'm talking about right now

219
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:02,020
so if we want to not do that from here on moving forward otherwise i'm gonna have to

220
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:07,220
as soon as this happens i i stand straight and look down in my shoes are you all right walter

221
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:13,460
i am fine bradley is telling me that i am lying he's like in a practiced kung fu stance he's kind

222
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:17,860
of bouncing on the heels of his feet but he sits down when you sit back down walter alan kind of

223
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:23,060
pats you on the leg and he's like you did a great job just then my father has told me three strikes

224
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:29,380
and you're out that is one strike but i don't hold it against you cool

225
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:35,940
tell me how i'm lying if you don't own a bed let's say that that's the truth

226
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:43,380
where do you sleep i don't typically lay down usually i tend to sleep standing where are you

227
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:50,980
a vampire yeah what are you a vampire angel no i he's funny i can't consume blood so no i'm

228
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:57,620
not a vampire okay i want to get this over with i feel uncomfortable telling a lie because it's

229
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:04,740
against what i believe in what do you believe in well many things but that's not the point of this

230
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:10,100
exercise to get to know one another right yeah but that's it what's at your core kid you would

231
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:16,420
have to ask my father that i did not i've not asked that question but i i think that is beside

232
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:23,700
the point of this exercise please tell me how i'm lying you should walk across the room for us

233
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:31,380
i walk across the room can i see if he's favoring one hit versus the other yeah uh we already tested

234
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:42,500
i i walk across the room perfectly normal oh roger is just gonna point at your shoes i i think it's

318
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:16,500
called a uh this is a walkway i think it's called a little i don't think it's anything weird it's

just it's a walkway it's called little lakey walk floating walkway will do okay yeah there we go

321
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:34,180

322
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:39,780
is this sure is one floaty lakey walk i'm looking down on my feet as i walk and i'm like this is a

323
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:46,180
great lakey walk we like to guess this is new we like to give jack his uh his his amount of space

324
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:51,300
that you know he requires he's been here a long time and i'm sorry is his name jack russell yeah

325
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:56,500
that's his name jack russell like the dog bouncy dog that's hilarious that's actually

326
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:09,780
and you walk up to this boat house which is a like uh it's a two-story apartment and underneath

327
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:15,140
there are pillars coming down and there are spots for canoes that are floating in the water

328
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:20,740
underneath the second story apartment are there any other boats here or is it just the canoes

329
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:28,260
just six canoes and as you walk you see that a man is walking down from the apartments and

330
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:32,740
i'm in the wrong google doc you sure you're not still on the floating walkway

331
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:40,500
you mean the little lakey walk and so from the little long big wakey walk

332
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:47,620
wakey walk because you're awake and you're walking uh you see jack russell who's the boat man who's

333
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:51,860
walking down some stairs on the side of the apartment down to greet you he's a short

334
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:57,620
stout man in his later years and as you approach you see that he's got a thick white beard that

335
00:36:57,620 --> 00:37:05,460
makes his round face look even rounder the bags under his eyes are large and fluffy and he's

336
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:15,940
wearing a dark fluffy fluffy okay the thick luxurious fur you started to say puffy and then

337
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:26,580
you changed to fluffy you just really want to take a nap on these bags he's wearing a dark navy beanie

338
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:32,980
and a wool plaid shirt underneath olive corduroy overalls i'm thinking about the guy that plays

339
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:37,780
trumpet in neutral milk hotel well i'm always thinking about the guy who plays trumpet in

340
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:44,660
neutral milk hotel uh yeah so everyone this is jack russell the boat man and he'll be taking

341
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:49,540
care of all your canoe needs i'm gonna head on back so after you wrap up here and get all your

342
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:57,060
information you can go back onto your cottages or feel free to roam the grounds and he takes off

343
00:37:57,060 --> 00:38:05,380
back down the large flaky flock and walk a flock of lake and he walks back and he's gone roger

344
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:10,740
holds out a hand to jack jack i'm roger i'm curious what kind of not to use around here

345
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:19,220
honestly for uh for my ties you know i go with the fucking shit yeah i was doing you doing you

346
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:23,060
oh fuck oh i thought you were i was doing i thought you were doing jebediah from the

347
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:29,780
plus what kind of uh knots are using here on the stock uh i assume a clove hitch you

348
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:34,260
got anything uh special up your sleeve hey you know it's mostly clove hitch you know it's uh

349
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:41,060
do it again for ties you know i got windsor man after my heart i see and yeah so everyone here

350
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:46,740
you know come down come close you know get around here we got six canoes right and so there's enough

351
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:51,380
for everyone to take them out whenever you need them you're gonna want to go ahead and grab a life

352
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:56,420
jacket there's life jackets right over here and he points at a bin it's got a bunch of life jackets

353
00:38:56,420 --> 00:39:02,260
in it you're all seemingly adults he looks at you walter he's like except for you how old are you

354
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:10,020
what is the number that you need to hear all right it seems smart enough so all of you will

355
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:15,380
be required to take out life jackets in the canoes with you and you head on out but you don't have to

356
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:19,780
wear them except for i'm guessing you if you're under 18 you might want to have that on for the

357
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:25,380
galatee reasons should i put two of them on you can put two of them on if you want but it'll be

358
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:30,580
safer if you just have one duly noted all right so you're never gonna go out without them and

359
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:34,820
you're never gonna go out by yourself in a canoe if you go out by yourself in a canoe you're gonna

360
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:41,460
have a bad time we always say stick to two in a canoe right so you gotta have two people in the

361
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:47,380
canoe what do we gotta have in a canoe to make it work that's right the canoe good job everyone

362
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:52,580
thank you for paying attention honestly this is great so many groups get into in talking and

363
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:59,700
doing different voices it's very obnoxious what do you mean i don't even know why i brought it up

364
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:04,180
that's on me that's my bad everyone i'm so sorry why did i even invite that into the realm of

365
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:11,060
possibility so that's why we always stick to two in a canoe so stuff like that doesn't happen all

366
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:17,300
right now these waters these waters out here you look at them they're very calm right but

367
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:25,140
that's tricky isn't it it is it no not so much it's very easy to can do around this lake

368
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:34,340
however some people get a big head right i'm guessing you just looking at everything about you

369
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:39,380
you're probably going to get a bit cocky out there and there's nothing that the water takes

370
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:45,860
as such a dis to its face i say dis all the time it's one of my favorite words i mean it's

371
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:51,780
perfectly acceptable 26 years ago hey we're living in the past mate i'm living in the future i mean

372
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:56,100
hypothetically and so the water right it's it's mean

373
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:05,540
right it's me but it's yeah i'm scared it's super fucking calm right but you know it can be mean

374
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:10,980
at times right because the water is the most powerful thing that exists on this realm outside

375
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:18,580
of all and he looks up into the sky and the sun has gone down now so you've got just a beautiful

376
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:26,820
sight of the countless stars up in the sky except for those right mate right the endlessness of

377
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:34,420
space isn't it if you get out there there's nothing more powerful sometimes i feel like

378
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:40,900
maybe i'm just floating and all of this is some sort of mental reaction to everything

379
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:47,860
that i'm having as i'm just losing oxygen i'm i'm sorry jack russell have you been to space

380
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:55,540
no no but sometimes i look up there and i wonder if maybe i'm not down here you know you ever get

381
00:41:55,540 --> 00:42:01,940
that yes i would also posit that water would still be powerful up there in fact maybe more

382
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:06,820
so you could use it to stay alive or to push off of something if you needed to you could

383
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:15,780
shoot it out of a hose or when you were talking about this clouds are also water so technically

384
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:23,700
in the sky there is water as well so i think that just adds to what you are talking about you guys

385
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:29,540
are all really validating me at this time and i appreciate it you know it's not too many times

386
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:35,220
that we get people who are not so raw and ready at the beginning of the weekend you know some

387
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:40,340
people are a bit meft in the head so it's nice that you guys are all taking a group mentality

388
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:45,380
to try to validate each other's existences and thoughts and i really appreciate that so does

389
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:51,940
everyone have well it's just shit we are doing each other i do in the same voice oh i want brad

390
00:42:51,940 --> 00:43:00,980
lincoln i'm gay and i want your job um honestly i think we're all just uh i think we feel a little

391
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:07,780
protective of you because of the the thick and fluffy patch of hair underneath your eyes it's

392
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:14,900
pretty adorable he rubs it and he's like yeah it's been on my face a long time in there is it

393
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:21,380
now i grew it over the summer it's nice though to have a bit of protection from all this wind

394
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:25,860
and you know if you happen to get into water it's nice to have it and you know not you just sort of

395
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:32,660

397
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:45,540
it's a fucking fairy tale here though but also isn't your name jack russell yeah my name is jack

398
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:54,740
russell what's happening hey i think we're just terrible hey jack if we do take a boat out is

399
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:59,780
there any place you recommend maybe a nice cove somewhere or something yeah you'll find no coves

400
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:05,460
around this area right so it's just circles on circles so we got a circular island with a

401
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:12,740
circular lake right around it engulfing it eating it alive from the inside you're gonna find just

402
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:17,940
roundness at all the points around i'm so sorry jack wouldn't be eating it alive from the outside

403
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:23,860
of the you know what you're right it is it's an external force this water is right pushing against

404
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:30,500
just over and over repeatedly just thrusting thrusting thrusting there's water at the bottom

405
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:41,700
of the ocean oh does anyone have any questions uh are these our boats like uh stand down one

406
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:48,580
so we got is it but specifically like is my boat that one no or or take out any of them that you

407
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:53,620
want anyone that's left here you can take out right and so to answer your question there sir

408
00:44:53,620 --> 00:45:02,100
young sprightly man it's gonna be right over there and he points to this spot that the shoreline has

409
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:07,940
clearly even from this distance you can tell canoes have like entered this shoreline and left

410
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:13,060
a bunch of divots up there and he's like right there that's a good trail that's the best trail

411
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:18,740
on the property so like a cross yeah across the water yeah got it yeah there's no trails on this

412
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:24,340
side except for the walkways you know from the cottages back up to big house charles digby takes

413
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:28,980
this time to pull out a little notepad that he always keeps with him to take notes and looking

414
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:36,020
at the like creepy almost obsidian like water he starts like jotting down notes for ideas i love it

415
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:40,500
there you go i'm into it yeah thanks for saying it you're welcome i think it's a good character

416
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:45,620
choice for you yeah it might have something to do with something gotta keep an eye on this one

417
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:57,220
he writes shit down i approach the water and i scoop a handful of water up and then i put my

418
00:45:57,220 --> 00:46:06,420
hand in my back pocket i just see his pocket get wet i'm noticing the rings of the water the ripple

419
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:11,620
effect yeah kid i'm not paying attention i'm looking back down on my feet again kid are you

420
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:18,340

421
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:24,660

423
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:42,580
hard an oil man and i look back down indirectly i suppose yeah petroleum byproducts he's a bit of

424
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:48,260
a middleman do not degrade this man father i do think of myself as uh more of a salesman than

425
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:56,100
anything okay so i guess we should head out is there anything else jack that's pretty much it

426
00:46:56,100 --> 00:47:03,140
unless anyone has any more questions about the water the canoes or how to get from here to there

427
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:08,260
on this cold water but just remember what do we remember always have a life jacket for each

428
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:14,500
person in the canoe two canoes or something two canoes for each person two canoes for each person

429
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:19,780
that's right i don't i don't think that was no that's what he said like a chariot trick horse

430
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:27,540
racer one can one foot in each and i think it was uh one canoe 23 skidoo you can split your

431
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:33,780
pants but it's it's a good time can you remind us what it was again yeah so we always say

432
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:42,420
i looked at my computer and it says two truths and a lie

433
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:47,940
that's why we always stick to

434
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:54,180
what hold on what did i roll 50 to a canoe

435
00:47:56,900 --> 00:48:01,860
that's why we always say 50 to a canoe all right two in a canoe anyone have any more questions are

436
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:07,060
we done here if uh somebody hypothetically wanted to get out on the lake and they were alone would

437
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:12,340
you accompany them how does that yeah yeah if you ever want to go out there by yourself and have a

438
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:17,940
bit of quiet i got these and he points up at the wall and there's some like noise canceling like

439
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:21,700
gear that you would wear if you were doing construction or something like that if you

440
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:26,100
ever want to have a bit of peace and quiet you know i'll just put that in and read if that'll

441
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:32,260
be all then i think your name really i started i think maybe we should leave where your next

442
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:42,580
campground members the beatings we're here for fun and relaxing non-spooky weekend it's 56 years ago

443
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:49,060
that's right can we take a picture of rb road

444
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:57,780

445
00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:03,780
it's some nice trails there if you got some some time are there any uh fish in this lake oh i

446
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:08,420
thought you're gonna say on the trails and no there aren't but there are my question is could

447
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:15,620
i have never been fishing before but i've heard about it is it possible to go fishing in this

448
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:22,740
lake unfortunately for you there so walter you're not gonna find any fish in this lake well that's

449
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:28,180
well that's fine why are there no fish in this lake yeah roger's looking puzzled too

450
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:32,580
no no fish in the lake they stocked all these lakes back in the day when they first dammed

451
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:38,340
them up as long as i've been here there's been no fishes in this lake is this a man-made lake

452
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:44,660
yeah it's a man-made lake what do you have a deal with that no then i guess we don't have a problem

453
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:52,020
what holy shit that was a bit strong it's jack sparrow hiding out

454
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:59,060
and you're poking the bear i could go a bit of a problem that's the day you almost caught jack

455
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:07,460
russell

456
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:39,460
you

457
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:53,460
this

458
00:50:59,060 --> 00:51:07,460
