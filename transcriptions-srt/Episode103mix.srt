1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,240
How do you do fellow wolf pups? It's your fellow teen wolf. Wolf the dog pup.

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:13,080
I like to skateboards, roller them blades, and vape that juice.

3
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,240
When I spit them hot stinky thick gunky clouds

4
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:25,840
Shoot, dang. I get so many likes and so many subscribes and I am streaming at you live from

5
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:34,480
694.2 PTBP, the only radio station that is also where I am currently living.

6
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,480
I am the influencer.

7
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,400
My influence shall know no bounds.

8
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:47,840
I shall eat Mark Zuckerberg's eyes so that he may see the dark void for all eternity.

9
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,160
Smash that like button.

10
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,600
This episode's Howlin' with Wolf is from Zach.

11
00:00:53,640 --> 00:01:01,680
But not the one you know. From occupied Piscataway and Anacostian land known as Washington, DC

12
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:09,600
who tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending pod. A very productive use of 15 seconds.

13
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:15,040
He writes, I have a little love song for a very special something in my life.

14
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,560
My baby takes the morning train.

15
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:26,800
As shelter from the rising sun, she will return to me again to finally waitin' for her.

16
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:33,360
My baby's eyes can see through time. She sings to me what must be done.

17
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,880
The life I had's no longer mine. The world is waitin' for her.

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,200
Wow, Zach. What a wonderful ditty you done and gone and composed over there.

19
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:50,800
The only songs I write cannot be interpreted by human ears.

20
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,640
I think yours can though, so that's probably good.

21
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,240
Anyway, if you want to write up something for your influencer wolf to how,

22
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,920
tag it pretending pod on Instagram or Twitter.

23
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,320
These fuckers at pretending to be people repost amazing fan art,

24
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,480
share behind the scenes moments,

25
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:17,360
and dish out hot visual content with every new episode over on that there social media.

26
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:25,360
Life is full of grays, complex situations, so fuck Mark Zuckerberg and smash that follow button.

27
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,360
Fuck Jack Conte and support us on Patreon. Fuck me?

28
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,960
And picture whatever it is you think I look like the next time you're about to bust a whole nut.

29
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:40,800
Then you'll inevitably want to have a little snooze, but keep it up. It's time for the news.

30
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,720
Last time, Clark ran away from the site of the shimmering silver sea

31
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:53,120
and into Dr. Marie Jacobs and Salem the cat in Doug Jacobs' body.

32
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,800
He kept fleeing, but the next door brought him through the same threshold he had just crossed.

33
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,960
He bumped into John, who had just opened up the same hatch,

34
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:08,560
and the two stumbled forward to greet the witch doctor and her cat man familiar.

35
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:14,560
Down the ladder, Keith lied to the boat's hosts, Don D. Pettymore and Jack Russell.

36
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,800
He told them he knew where the door Jack searched for was located.

37
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:25,440
From this sea level view, Keith saw a rope bridge on the adjacent wall to the ladder he had just

38
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:31,840
used that led to a second stilted bunker above this shiny sterling surf.

39
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:37,200
Back in the room that wasn't filled with junk and a helpless Leo piston,

40
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,760
Clark and John yucked Dr. Marie Jacobs yum for a while,

41
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:48,000
and then John found solace in his quantumly colorful orifice ooze.

42
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,480
I think the image of old John squirting goo out his face holes would make for some sick album art.

43
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:00,480
Speaking of, take a moment. Check out Bandcamp or Spotify or MySpace

44
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:07,280
For those of you who are too young to remember, MySpace is my temperature contrasting basement

45
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:13,040
studio where I find the hottest new tracks with the coolest album art.

46
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:19,120
An example might be Dragon in 3 with What Kind of World Are You Livin' In?

47
00:04:30,480 --> 00:05:00,320
Uh, Thomas, Joe, any last words?

48
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,280
Last words.

49
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,680
Yeah, sorry we ended on such a banger for you last time that you really want to...

50
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,560
Okay, headphones off.

51
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,360
You want to, you just want to shut us down, you just don't want to...

52
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,240
Like, all of us?

53
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,040
Yeah, this was just an exercise to like,

54
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:21,440
oh, thanks for doing that, but that's worthless to me now. Now's a new moment.

55
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,720
Yeah, that was a week ago.

56
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,040
Is it all disposable to you? Is that what this is?

57
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,200
Yeah, right?

58
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,000
Disposable, like a camera.

59
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,400
Or thumbs on a human.

60
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,160
Yeah, disposable thumbs.

61
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,560
That's what makes me a human.

62
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,920
That's what sets us apart.

63
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,080
Yeah, our disposable thumbs.

64
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,560
Uh, Zach, if we say anything else, it's basically going to be half this episode

65
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,880
in conversation with Marie Jacobs, so why don't you just go on over to those other boys?

66
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,760
Thank you. I appreciate it.

67
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,640
Take your headphones off. Thomas, take your headphones off.

68
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,140
Joe.

69
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:58,640
Thank you.

70
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,080
Hello, Luke and Justin. Hi.

71
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:02,800
Hello, Rosanne.

72
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,840
Hi. You guys are climbing a ladder. You guys are climbing a ladder.

73
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:14,880
First on the ladder is Jack Russell, this man in a beanie, big fluffy beard.

74
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,520
And behind him, Keith Vigna, who's looking up and just said, nice view.

75
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:24,400
And then behind him, Don D. Pettymore, the three of you are climbing the ladder,

76
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:31,360
just after Keith Vigna came to a realization about where the hatches were

77
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,080
in the room you're about to walk up into.

78
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:40,560
And then where the rope bridge is that is seemingly not attached to a door

79
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,320
that you could see in this bunker-like room that you were in before.

80
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:50,160
This bunk yard, junker bunker, junker junk yard bunker, piston junk yard bunker yard.

81
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,480
The man above you kind of looks down between the ladder

82
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:59,280
and his big belly and sees you below and is like, oh, you new boy.

83
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,160
How'd you get here?

84
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,840
Are you talking to me?

85
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,600
Yeah, me and the other fella here was old cats.

86
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,960
We got here different ways.

87
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,680
How'd you get here?

88
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,800
I kind of floated in.

89
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,240
Floated?

90
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:10,800
Yeah.

91
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,840
No, I mean, what got you before you fell up?

92
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,080
What got me? Goo.

93
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:16,580
Goo?

94
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,400
Where are you from, boy?

95
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,880
Contention, USA.

96
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,840
What about you?

97
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,560
You sound like you're from across the pond.

98
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,880
I'm from Contention too, but...

99
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,720
Well, not you, this other guy.

100
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,240
Oh, this guy.

101
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,480
You sound like you're from across the pond.

102
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,920
No, I'm from Contention.

103
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,320
I thought he was talking about like the actual creek.

104
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,720
You sound like you're from across Bean's Pond.

105
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,600
You know, the dialect, it do change if you go, yeah.

106
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,800
It's very distinct from one side of Contention to the other.

107
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,840
Honestly, mate, I feel like I've lived so many lives.

108
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,520
I'm so old, you know, my memories just feel like someone else's.

109
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,480
How old are you?

110
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,360
I don't even know.

111
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I have a lost period of time there.

112
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,600
How did you guys get here?

113
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,720
What is here?

114
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,760
Where are we?

115
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:05,200
No fucking clue, but we're looking for the door out.

116
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,680
Do you know where it is or...

117
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,960
And at this point in time, you've easily climbed a 10 yard long ladder.

118
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:17,600
And so the three of you will go back into this junkyard of a room

119
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:23,600
where you do hear the crying sounds of Leo Piston as he is just in tortured pain.

120
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,520
Jack Russell turns around, helps you finish up the ladder trek,

121
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,280
does the same for Don D. Pettymore.

122
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,840
Leo, I feel awful bad.

123
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,720
Are you just gonna lay there or...

124
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,760
Nah, I can't do anything else.

125
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,040
It hurts too bad.

126
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:43,840
Are you gonna...

127
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,040
Do you think you're gonna make it?

128
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,680
Are you gonna be better or is this the rest of your life?

129
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,400
Forever, probably.

130
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,040
If you find a way out, I guess come get me.

131
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,800
Okay, okay.

132
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,760
Will do, will do.

133
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,120
I'm sure that I will not forget about you.

134
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,280
Hey, what's your name again?

135
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,560
Who, me?

136
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,080
The kid, you, yeah.

137
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,520
That's Leo Piston.

138
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:09,840
Ligma?

139
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,880
No, but you.

140
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,120
Me? I'm Keith.

141
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,760
Yeah.

142
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,960
Keith Vigna.

143
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,400
Keith, who the hell is that?

144
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,560
That, I just told you, it's Leo Piston.

145
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,800
Oh, I thought you said Ligma Piston.

146
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,760
Ligma Piston.

147
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,080
Yeah, Leo runs the up dog.

148
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:38,480
God damn it.

149
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,800
I wanna know what the goo is, mate.

150
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,800
I got here because I got eaten by some fucking monster in a lake.

151
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:49,680
He got here because he jumped through, I don't even fucking believe him.

152
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,040
I took a step in a, in a bag.

153
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:53,680
What?

154
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,320
A bag?

155
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,520
And I got here.

156
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,880
What sort of bag?

157
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,760
Here's a Nike bag.

158
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,160
Oh.

159
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,320
Things go in, they, they usually don't come out.

160
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,680
Where'd you get it?

161
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,200
I've always had it.

162
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,880
You've always had-

163
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,720
It's, I, I use the bag.

164
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,760
You still have it?

165
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,640
Do I still have it?

166
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:14,880
Yeah.

167
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:15,840
No.

168
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,480
Where is it?

169
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,600
That's how I got in here.

170
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,520
So we're in your bag?

171
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:26,160
Maybe we gotta find another bag or a hole in the ceiling.

172
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,320
Where the bag opens up.

173
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,000
Yeah, but I got here because I got eaten by a fucking lake monster.

174
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,040
Which lake?

175
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,080
Lake Comb.

176
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,840
At Comb Comfy Campground.

177
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,440
Oh, I thought you said comb.

178
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,600
Like, you gotta talk better, man.

179
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,920
Now if you just listen better, you can understand my friend Jack Russell here.

180
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,560
That's right.

181
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,880
Should we walk across that bridge?

182
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:52,400
Jack Russell starts moving all the junk that's in the way on that wall that's adjacent to

183
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,480
where you just walked into this room.

184
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,840
He clears this wall, there's no hatch.

185
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:04,560
Leo, did you see where, where'd, uh, where'd, uh, my friends go?

186
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,160
Did you forget their names?

187
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,040
Clark and John.

188
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,200
Jesus Christ.

189
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,200
I had a total brain fart there.

190
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,200
How do you not know?

191
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,960
Clark and John went through that hatch and he points to the other hatch.

192
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:24,080
I look at Jack and Don and kind of point at that hatch.

193
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,280
You guys, well, after you, I guess.

194
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,480
Lead the way, Jack.

195
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,960
All right, I guess, well, yeah, we'll all just go in here.

196
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,200
I mean, what, you got any other ideas?

197
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,800
Oh, no, I guess not.

198
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,880
And he slams open the lever of the hatch and opens up the door.

199
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,680
What do I see?

200
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:47,840
Clark and John, their backs as they are standing in a empty room that does not have a ceiling

201
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,600
on it, or maybe it does.

202
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,640
It's all just this, I found the top of the bag.

203
00:11:52,640 --> 00:12:00,960
And they are talking to Dr. Marie Jacobs and Doug Jacobs who are laying on the ground.

204
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,160
Dr. Marie Jacobs.

205
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,200
When was the last time I saw them?

206
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,680
Oh, the last time you saw them was on a security camera because they weren't in their cell

207
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,640
anymore.

208
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:14,640
And you looked at the security footage and saw them being picked up and slammed into

209
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,840
the ground repeatedly.

210
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,400
And then they disappeared as if you had never seen them.

211
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,680
Yeah, and then that just didn't stick in my mind, apparently.

212
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,600
That was just normal goings on.

213
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:30,880
Clark Bishop and John Lee, Kevin Moore III, you feel the hatch behind you open.

214
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:38,960
And as you turn around, you see that Keith Vigna, Keith Beans, has arrived into this

215
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:47,520
room along with Don D. Pettymore and this man wearing the beanie and the overalls that

216
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,280
are made of corduroy.

217
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:53,440
Before you ask anything, we've got the cat fucking all out of control.

218
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,040
Or under control.

219
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:55,440
What?

220
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,360
Cat fucking is under control.

221
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,120
It's not out of control, it's under control.

222
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,520
Now what the hell are you boys doing under your boat?

223
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,400
I thought that was the boat that would take us out of here eventually.

224
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,520
Oh, we tied it up.

225
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,160
All right, all right.

226
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:12,800
As I'm now closer and I'm realizing that my eyes weren't paying tricks on me, Don D.

227
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:21,200
is kind of frozen a little bit, seeing what appears to be his brother, but with kind of

228
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,720
a different sounding voice.

229
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:29,280
Also, as you look at him, you know how you've been in here for a while and you've kind of

230
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:35,680
gotten used to seeing that everything's made out of this inky black substance that is also

231
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:42,800
super colorful and is also the sky, but also like objects are kind of that color or texture

232
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,520
too.

233
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:52,240
That same substance is pouring out of John Lee, Pettymore the Third's bodies, eye sockets

234
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,960
and nose and mouth and ears.

235
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,960
Are you okay, John?

236
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,160
Ever been better, Keith?

237
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,320
You look crazy right now.

238
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:06,240
Do you not see what's happened to touch your face?

239
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:06,960
Can you feel it?

240
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,920
I mean, no, you can't feel it.

241
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,280
It does look cool.

242
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:18,960
Brother, I don't want to alarm you, but you got oozed, oozing out your orifices.

243
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,520
That's right.

244
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:20,640
That's right.

245
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,120
I'm the ghost of your brother.

246
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:23,440
Boo!

247
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,240
Stupid piece of shit.

248
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,400
I'm your brother, asshole.

249
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,000
Yeah, I'm your brother.

250
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,040
What's going on?

251
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,560
How you doing, bro?

252
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,200
Something seems off about him.

253
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,760
Can I roll like a human or something?

254
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,560
Yeah, yeah.

255
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,640
Go ahead and roll persuade against him, Thomas.

256
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,320
I rolled a two.

257
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,560
Tension building.

258
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,040
Sorry, my other D10 fell on the floor.

259
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,160
Oh, yeah.

260
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:02,640
All right.

261
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,280
That's a 22 on a 60 crit success.

262
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,160
Hell yeah.

263
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,360
All right, nice.

264
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,640
So this is your brother.

265
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,040
It's been a while since you've seen him, huh?

266
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:16,880
So I mean, God, it's been years and then it's been however long you've been in here.

267
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:21,440
John, how did you get down here?

268
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:29,360
John really exaggeratedly rolls his eyes to the side at Keith and Clark.

269
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,200
I need to talk to you for a second.

270
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,400
Violently stabbing his eyes to the side.

271
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,840
Hold on one minute.

272
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,840
Big brother, little brother.

273
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,080
I think I'm your big brother.

274
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,520
Am I your big brother?

275
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,880
And you used to call me little brother.

276
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,840
That's why I said that.

277
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:54,240
Big brother, I'll be gone for just a second to talk to these fellows,

278
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,680
but I do need to confer with my associates for just a second.

279
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,200
But then we'll catch up.

280
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,160
Clark, Keith.

281
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,160
And then he's really stabbing his eyes to the side.

282
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:09,120
Hey, if you guys need to talk for a second, we will stay in here with the cat lady

283
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,120
and you can go back in through this hatch.

284
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,840
And he kind of opens up the hatch that's open.

285
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:17,600
Oh, he opens it more back into the Leo piston bunker junkyard.

286
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,320
All right.

287
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,120
Nobody asked you, British guy.

288
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,920
But while y'all are in here, do not fuck that cat.

289
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,640
We'll be right back.

290
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,400
Puts out his hand.

291
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,080
John reluctantly shakes it as he's trying to walk back.

292
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,920
And he's like, again, no one asked.

293
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,200
We will be right back.

294
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,400
This won't take long.

295
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:38,080
As Clark walks past Jack, he shakes his hand too.

296
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:38,880
Like the dog.

297
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,280
Huh.

298
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,960
And then keeps following into the next room.

299
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,120
Okay, I guess, Justin, take off your headphones

300
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,480
because Thomas doesn't want you here.

301
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:48,480
Goodbye.

302
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,680
Justin, the person knows exactly what this conversation is about.

303
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,880
He just failed the persuade role about it.

304
00:16:54,880 --> 00:17:01,040
So he can be here, but this, this huddle is literally just John saying,

305
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:08,560
all right, now you might not have quite picked up on what was going on in there.

306
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,800
Might've been a little too subtle.

307
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,400
I never knew you had a brother, John.

308
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,200
That's just the thing.

309
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,160
I don't my pappy did because I'm in the body of my pappy.

310
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:16,960
That's my uncle.

311
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,680
Right, right.

312
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:25,280
So why are you, do you just not want to frighten him by telling him who you are?

313
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,800
I just, we don't know.

314
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,640
We don't know who we can trust Keith.

315
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,200
We don't know what is going on in this world.

316
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:37,040
Is that my uncle or is that the goo manifest in some kind of trader could be either way.

317
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:40,720
It might behoove us to have some kind of advantage over him.

318
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,880
Like, you know, the hidden identity.

319
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,360
John, what was your relationship with this guy?

320
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,640
Is he a, is he a good uncle?

321
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,400
Is he, was it a strained relationship?

322
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,240
Did you, did you know him very well or?

323
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,360
Now by many more standards, he was a pretty good uncle.

324
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:59,920
Like about half the time he'd take you on into the bar instead of you having to sit

325
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:00,800
out in the hard car.

326
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,920
That's nice of him.

327
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:05,920
That puts him in the top quarter for sure of my uncles.

328
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,880
But at the same time, he's a vicious criminal.

329
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:15,360
Uh, he's a mean son of a bitch and I don't really recall all my past lives, but I believe

330
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,160
I owe him money.

331
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,840
Is this the one you were telling us about?

332
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,960
Yeah, it is.

333
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,520
And he always just seemed to take a shot into my daddy.

334
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:26,800
So it, I just, perhaps while I have this physical form, I'm my daddy.

335
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,560
That's my only strategy here.

336
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:33,040
I don't have steps ahead to this thing that it just felt it's an instinctual move.

337
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:34,320
Yeah.

338
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,800
Support that or we just, do we eliminate the last 20 minutes of this podcast and just go

339
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,080
in there and tell him who I am?

340
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,120
No, I got your back.

341
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,520
I think playing our cards close to the vest at this point is the best idea if we got the

342
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,640
leg up on them already.

343
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,560
Open up your heart, Jon.

344
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,440
Shut up, Leo.

345
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,840
Yeah, shut the fuck up, Leo.

346
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,600
I'm still here.

347
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,040
You better not tell him who we is.

348
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,400
You're not a part of this.

349
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,320
So don't try to be part of the cool.

350
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,520
You're not part of the quick, but solving the mystery.

351
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,240
Yeah, we know.

352
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,320
Cope, Leo Cope.

353
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,880
We got to go talk to important people in that other room.

354
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,800
Just fucking try not to make too much noise while you're in here.

355
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,120
God damn.

356
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:29,600
I was, I was thinking you guys remember those pictures that the camera took of the people

357
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,600
and the, it was basically just complete blackness.

358
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,080
What if that's that room?

359
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,320
Or all around us, right?

360
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:43,920
And it, in the kind of the, the state of being we, we, we, or, or, yeah, just this place.

361
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:51,280
I wonder if what, you know, if that's the thing and what it means, but what, what does

362
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:51,520
it mean?

363
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,400
Where the hell are we?

364
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,840
Where the hell are we?

365
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,920
We're in the goo world where I'm from.

366
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,720
You're from what?

367
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,800
Have you not seen my God damn goo eyes?

368
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:04,320
I mean, yeah, but catch up Clark.

369
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,000
I'm Keith.

370
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:13,600
I mean, mustard Clark, the mundane design, the mundane designations of the old world

371
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,680
kind of ceased to cease to interest me as I spend more time.

372
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,600
I don't know if this is the same experience for all of you, but for me right now, there's

373
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:26,960
a lot of things that seem impossible and yet are every day, they seem normal and not normal

374
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,160
all the time at the same time.

375
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,320
And when, when John just said that he's from here, that didn't ring any bells for him.

376
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,720
That didn't ping any, any alarms for me.

377
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,880
Oh, uh, that's the end of the last episode.

378
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,080
You should go listen to that.

379
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:42,080
No, I'm saying it didn't, it didn't scare me that you said that and it sounded normal.

380
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,360
It sounded correct.

381
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:43,680
Yeah.

382
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,400
Yeah.

383
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,600
The Samesies, bro.

384
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,040
Let's go lie to my uncle.

385
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:51,200
What were you guys talking to Dr. Marie Jacobs about?

386
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,760
Oh, like very little before you burst in.

387
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,320
You'll honestly get as much a chance to talk to her as we would.

388
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,640
Basically we just established, well, we accused her of cat fuckery.

389
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,400
I don't know if you noticed, but Doug's in there also, but that Salem and Doug's body

390
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:04,960
remember.

391
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:10,000
So, and they were, they were cuddling in a really unsettling way.

392
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,480
Exactly.

393
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,200
Right.

394
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,840
Well, yeah, that's the question.

395
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:20,800
Cause she's all like, Oh, isn't it just normal for a person to just be like hanging out with

396
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,360
their cat and then other stuff.

397
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,200
And you're like, well, what does other stuff mean?

398
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,240
And she's like, how dare you say what other stuff means, you know?

399
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,480
And it's like, she's fucking her cat.

400
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,760
I think that's illegal.

401
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:43,760
I think we might have to do something about that.

402
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,240
You're absolutely right, Keith.

403
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,160
But we, I think we need to get some information out of that cat fucker.

404
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:56,400
And I agree that can, that can wait until after it.

405
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,680
So she's another one.

406
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:02,080
We're just going to have to lie to you and kind of be like, Hey, we are cool with you

407
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,960
and we're not about to arrest you for fucking your cat man.

408
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,800
Also, there's just a question of jurisdiction.

409
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:10,960
It doesn't seem quite practical here, but we will get to the bottom of all of this.

410
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:17,440
John Clark, you notice that a lot of the junk on the wall that is adjacent to the two walls,

411
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:24,480
basically four walls in this piston bunker junkyard and two of the walls that are parallel

412
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,800
with each other have hatches on them.

413
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:30,560
But then one of the walls has been cleared of junk.

414
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,800
So you can clearly see that junk has been moved.

415
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:38,640
So you can see three walls now, two with hatches, one without.

416
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,400
Leo, you've been picking up in here?

417
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,840
You've been, you've been cleaning up?

418
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:46,640
And no, that beast guy came in here, knocked it down and said, why isn't there a fucking

419
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,200
hatch here?

420
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:52,160
If you want to go onto rope bridge, whatever Keith was talking about.

421
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:52,480
Yeah.

422
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,080
Jack Russell cleared it out.

423
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,080
Why did they clear out the wall without the door?

424
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,760
Would you see if there was a door behind it?

425
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,680
I would assume.

426
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,360
Why would they do that though Keith?

427
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:11,920
Uh, or we, uh, uh, I was under the impression that we cleared the junk to see if there was

428
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,320
a door.

429
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,880
I will never find out now.

430
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,960
Listen to the episode.

431
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,960
At the end of the day, it seems like, uh, that these two guys, your uncle and whoever

432
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:28,480
the Jack Russell is, they've got, they got more of a situational awareness to maybe let's

433
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,000
talk to Jack and Don.

434
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Don said he got in, got here from a bag.

435
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,280
He has a Nike bag.

436
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,200
He got in it and that's how he got here.

437
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,480
Clark gasps.

438
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,560
Did it, did the bag fall into it?

439
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,480
Oh, he got in the bag and now he's here.

440
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:49,360
Yeah, he's, we're, he's in the bag, which means we're in the bag, which in that room

441
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:55,360
in there, there didn't seem to be a ceiling on that room.

442
00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:02,080
And so I was thinking maybe that is the, how we got to climb up out of the bag or something.

443
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,840
Oh, you think we're, we're in the bag.

444
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:07,280
We could technically also be in a giant lake creature.

445
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:11,520
Why would the roof of the bag be described as having endless stars?

446
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:17,920
Cause it might be nighttime and the bag is pointed up at the sky.

447
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,000
But you can't see that through the bag, bud.

448
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,080
Well, the bag's probably open.

449
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:26,400
To, to, to recap though, that bag is the thing that we were throwing, or we were told to

450
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,360
throw balls into that they said they didn't know where those, where those went.

451
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:33,280
So now we know that guess that they come here, or at least that's what happens when a person

452
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,080
goes in the bag.

453
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:39,200
Who said just something, perhaps an episode ago about a ball falling from the sky into

454
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,080
this very ocean.

455
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:41,600
Was that Marie?

456
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,240
That was me.

457
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,280
That, oh, hey bud.

458
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,640
Hey, you want to talk to me again?

459
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:53,360
Yeah, how many balls, how many balls you seen fall from the sky?

460
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,600
I reckon one so far.

461
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,440
That was probably the ball we dropped in here.

462
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,080
Yeah.

463
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,400
We've only dropped one ball in here, right?

464
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,600
Two now, I guess.

465
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,200
And John looks kind of proud.

466
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,160
He slicks his hair back.

467
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:10,960
Uh, I'm embracing my identity, Keith.

468
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,280
Sorry.

469
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:14,720
My headphones just like stopped working, but now they're back.

470
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,240
So I didn't hear anything you said.

471
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,760
Well, just be happy for me.

472
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,640
I'm happy for you.

473
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,040
Thank you.

474
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:23,360
Also, Jack Russell said he got swallowed up by a lake creature, so we could also be in

475
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,400
a lake creature too.

476
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,400
And I mean, we didn't, we didn't go in a bag either.

477
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,480
We got sucked up by a wave of ooze.

478
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,400
So it's like all these different vectors point us in the same direction.

479
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:37,440
That ball came down here like a metal spider and jumped inside Julie Maxwell.

480
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:42,000
She went out the Marie Jacobs door, which we've been out twice now and wrapped back

481
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:42,960
around once.

482
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,800
And she wasn't, she wasn't between here and there.

483
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,200
Yeah, but then she left again out the other one.

484
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,840
Oh, she went out, she went out the, she went out the ocean door.

485
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,840
Yeah, she went out both of them a bunch of times.

486
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,800
Does she ever talk to you?

487
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,240
When did she finally leave?

488
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,360
She's coming and going.

489
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:58,580
Hmm.

490
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,400
When's the last time she left?

491
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,520
Um, two minutes ago.

492
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,400
Oh no.

493
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:04,880
Two minutes?

494
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,200
Like days, weeks, forever?

495
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,400
It was forever ago.

496
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,840
See guys, this is what I'm talking about.

497
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:14,080
This, this, this place is, is all, it's all backwards and forwards and yeah.

498
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:17,600
Makes it real easy to understand where people are.

499
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,720
They could be anywhere.

500
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,000
Well, I suppose that's true.

501
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,840
You know, I'm always right here though.

502
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,800
I'm right here.

503
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,520
We're actually, we're from a time where you weren't right here.

504
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,600
How do you feel about that?

505
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,800
That blow your little gourd?

506
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,160
All right.

507
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,840
Well, you know, I probably should.

508
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,560
That was mean.

509
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,200
That was mean.

510
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,840
I tried to feel superior to you because I'm not lying here, mortally wounded on my back,

511
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,120
just rolling around for eternity.

512
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:51,360
Oh, when you put it like that, will you please come find me?

513
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,920
If you find a way out, please bring me back.

514
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,160
Yeah.

515
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,880
I mean, yeah, that's, that's the goal.

516
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,360
Remember, I promise not to forget you, Leo.

517
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:03,520
And I, I am glad, you know, you don't got to keep reminding us.

518
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,160
We'll find you.

519
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:09,920
Well, if you promise to not forget me, then I'll remind you that you said something about

520
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:13,840
a bridge being on the other side of this wall, but there ain't no hash out.

521
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:18,640
That's why we were looking for the height of the hatch for the bridge.

522
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,040
There's a bridge on the other side of this wall.

523
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:21,920
That is that a fact?

524
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,120
Yeah.

525
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:28,080
There's a bridge and it goes to, uh, like a Terabithia.

526
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,160
No, it goes to, uh, that's a YA novel.

527
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,400
I don't know how to describe the thing.

528
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:43,200
It's, uh, if you were to Google Terabithia red sand forts, it would remind you of that.

529
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,720
No, I believe that's where we are.

530
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:50,800
But wasn't the bridge going to one of those in the ocean?

531
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,280
Okay.

532
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:51,440
Yeah.

533
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:56,080
So it goes to, there's a bridge to another one of the things of which we are currently

534
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:56,960
inside.

535
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,160
Is that the accepted theory?

536
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,680
Yes.

537
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,640
Did Don and Jack see it from their boat?

538
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,160
Is that how they knew it was there?

539
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:07,280
I saw it when I was down the ladder.

540
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:07,840
I saw it.

541
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,880
You saw a bridge extended from this feller over to another feller.

542
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,360
Maybe we should try to break, break through the wall.

543
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,640
Clark just wants to touch that wall.

544
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:23,280
He just wants to walk up to it kind of slowly, both arms outstretched and just kind of feel

545
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:23,600
it.

546
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,640
Is there anything there?

547
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,040
Oh yeah.

548
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:32,480
It feels like a little oozy like goo because it's dark and colorful and, uh, and your hand

549
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,240
just kind of like presses into it.

550
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:39,680
And it's a little wet and cold, uh, but then it's not at all.

551
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,120
It's just normal wall.

552
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,320
I don't break through the other side of it though or anything.

553
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:49,360
It's just, it's just a solid wall suddenly again at the same time as it being goo.

554
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:49,920
Of course.

555
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:55,440
John has a hunch and he wants to touch the wall in the exact same spot where Clark did.

556
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,880
What do you want to do about it?

557
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,400
Does my hand behave the same way?

558
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,520
What do you want to happen?

559
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,600
I want to see if I can just poke right on through.

560
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,720
Roll a natural.

561
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,160
Pass.

562
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,880
29 on a 60 whatever.

563
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,360
Describe.

564
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:18,560
You can see bad-ass like black ooze coming from John's fingernails and dripping down

565
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,520
his hand.

566
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:25,360
And as he touches the wall, the ooze from his fingernails kind of reaches out and little

567
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:30,400
tendrils and the wall reaches out and little tendrils back and they emerge and then his

568
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,840
hand just passes through.

569
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:32,320
Yup.

570
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,000
And he's like, Oh, I got us.

571
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:39,600
And John just kind of like whips open an opening because it's, it's just him.

572
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,400
It's the same thing.

573
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:49,040
What the absolute fuck is that?

574
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:54,800
As the other hatch opens, Jack Russell and Don D. Pettymore walk into this room as John

575
00:29:54,800 --> 00:30:03,680
Lee moves his hands into this wall and makes an opening and you can see out there is a

576
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:09,120
looks like a rope bridge, but it's made out of the same texture that makes up the wall

577
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,760
and the sky and everything around you.

578
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:19,120
And it's a rope bridge that leads to a second bunker stilted above about 10 yards.

579
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,840
This shimmering silver sea.

580
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,720
Do you guys think we should go across?

581
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,920
I start walking across it.

582
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,760
Wait, Keith.

583
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:33,040
Keith, careful that, uh, we don't know where, uh, uh, Leo told us that Julie's ball now

584
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,960
and it sounds like maybe a mean ball.

585
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,640
I don't know if it's a good ball, like John here, or if it's a mean ball.

586
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,520
Like we've like a spine ripping ball.

587
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,360
She could, she could be anywhere.

588
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,400
You mean you ball.

589
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,920
I didn't mean anything by it.

590
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,960
Uh, you know, you know how I feel about you and what we're doing now.

591
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,480
I just mean there's, there's you type of balls and there's Julie Maxwell type of balls.

592
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,640
That seems like there's maybe a helpful ball and not, not helpful balls.

593
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,640
Mean, mean spine ripping balls.

594
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,640
Isn't John a spine ripping ball?

595
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,880
Yeah, I don't know what you, how do you know Julie's a spine ripping ball?

596
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,040
You don't know a goddamn thing about that ball.

597
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,520
You're just assuming that ball is going to rip your spine out.

598
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:16,240
I am assuming that because, because it did that to Julie.

599
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,120
That's what Leo said.

600
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,440
Leo said it came down and ripped her spine out.

601
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,160
Well, my ball did that to my daddy.

602
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,600
So do you have a problem with that?

603
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:31,200
I mean, I kinda, I didn't really realize that you were a spine ripping.

604
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,600
Yeah, we never talked about that, but that's crazy.

605
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:40,320
Dondi Pettymore is now hearing this entity inside of his brother.

606
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:44,080
Talk about ripping out the spine of his brother.

607
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:48,080
And for the second or third or millionth time this campaign,

608
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,000
Thomas has forgotten who's in the room.

609
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,240
John, shut the fuck up, uncle Don.

610
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,400
Yeah, I'm, I'm John.

611
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,280
I'm ball.

612
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,920
I just made this opening in the ooze.

613
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,720
Walk through it.

614
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,080
If you want to live, wait, you're any questions?

615
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,440
I didn't think so.

616
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,920
Get across the fucking bridge, uncle.

617
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:14,240
Dondi Pettymore has like a wild look in his eyes as he approaches.

618
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,560
What he thought was his brother.

619
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:21,120
John, John, little John, not the rapper.

620
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,400
Don't make a joke about the rapper.

621
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,240
What?

622
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,200
What?

623
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:27,760
Okay.

624
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:33,680
Oh no.

625
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,720
I said little John.

626
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,200
Oh no.

627
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,040
You said little John three times.

628
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,960
He grasps you and tries to like, like look, look into your soul.

629
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,320
Is that you boy?

630
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,360
Yeah, it's me.

631
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,960
How the hell did you get in my brother?

632
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,080
I kind of want to know that now too, I guess.

633
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:56,000
Well, so what happened is, but y'all know I'm ball.

634
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,280
You know I'm ball.

635
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,640
You all know this.

636
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,080
What the hell is ball?

637
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,120
We've talked about me.

638
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:08,400
Well, I ripped out of my John the fourth spine and I landed in my daddy's spine.

639
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:15,440
But at the time he was kind of a semi brainwashed, you know, super soldier, half robot for an

640
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,360
evil crime Lord in the city.

641
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:22,560
You know, more or less my ball took over his body.

642
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,920
That is your brother's body.

643
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:24,800
I'm your nephew.

644
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,680
You know, you got to laugh.

645
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,080
And well, I'm technically his dad.

646
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:30,800
Hey, that's right.

647
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,080
Screw you.

648
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,040
I guess it's, I guess it's just the terminology that I was hung up on.

649
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:42,800
Like just then you just said things like landed in and became, but you ripped out the spine

650
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,960
of a person and put yourself into their place.

651
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:49,920
That's just a little more violent than I'd ever been picturing before, but I guess you

652
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:50,720
haven't done it to me.

653
00:33:50,720 --> 00:34:00,080
So John Lee, Kevin Moore, like is just looking dead at Clark.

654
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:04,320
And he thinks at first that he's looking like the eye, but then he realizes he's looking

655
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,040
right at his neck.

656
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,240
Oh gosh.

657
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:11,120
It's like, no, no, I never have done that to you Clark.

658
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:11,920
And I never will.

659
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:17,200
You got, you got a skinny little neck and he kind of like touches his tongue as he sees

660
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,560
the thick neck of Keith.

661
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:30,160
Keith Vigna like tries to kind of sink his neck, make it shorter, like a little turtle.

662
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:35,920
Keith Vigna, are you turtley enough for the turtle club?

663
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:36,560
Turtle.

664
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,120
Turtle.

665
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,080
What's the turtle club?

666
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,520
Is that a weird looking penis thing?

667
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:42,720
Is that about wieners?

668
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:43,680
Yeah, that a wiener thing?

669
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:45,920
That's about it's about, yeah.

670
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,040
That's about beans.

671
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,320
That's about your dinger.

672
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,920
I'll show you a dinger.

673
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,120
I always say a little ding-a-ling.

674
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,240
Let's go across this bridge.

675
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:57,200
What I've been saying, but y'all wanted to know about spies.

676
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,520
I think, I think my point still stands.

677
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,560
We don't know the motives of this Julie ball.

678
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,360
Just keep an eye out.

679
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,880
Just keep, keep a head on a swivel.

680
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,640
Yeah, obviously we're looking out for bad guys, but like.

681
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,920
When y'all are saying ball.

682
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,120
What kind of point is that Clark?

683
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:18,720
That we don't, oh, let's stay in these two, two rooms forever with the weird lady who

684
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,920
fucks her cat man.

685
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:26,000
Because like maybe something's out there that might wish us ill and like the last five days

686
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:26,720
of our lives.

687
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,280
Come on, man.

688
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:31,280
To be honest, I'm just wondering why we're not taking the boat and trying to get farther

689
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,920
away from this area that we know that Julie's in.

690
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:38,320
Oh, you mean that boat into the endless ocean until the, instead of like the bridge to the

691
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,920
only other structure we can see?

692
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,920
Don and Jack, you guys came from somewhere.

693
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,280
You had to have, you got a boat.

694
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,520
Let's just go back there.

695
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:50,000
It's been a long time since we've seen a structure, right?

696
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,040
I've been looking for the door out of here, right?

697
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,240
Don here came for another reason.

698
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,520
He's not trying to get out.

699
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,240
How'd you come?

700
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,480
Don, you're not trying to leave this place?

701
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:04,640
I came purposefully to this place to, uh, to find something.

702
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,240
Find what?

703
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,320
What, your goddamn sense of decency?

704
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,360
So you could go back and spend more money on my race car buckle?

705
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,560
God damn.

706
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,200
That is such a bird.

707
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,720
That was a long time ago, boy.

708
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:25,280
Well, I'm honestly like, like what does this fucking, you know, criminal piece of shit.

709
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:28,880
What purpose does he have in a mystical world of goo?

710
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,680
Like what quest do you seek?

711
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:36,240
You, I thought you to be frankly, a very shallow piece of shit individual.

712
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:40,720
So I just wonder what greater purpose you might be out here for.

713
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:45,520
Again, you were in my top four uncles, but like, you know how low that bar was.

714
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,640
You know I raised you.

715
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:50,560
I did the best I could sometimes.

716
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,120
I had big things I had to do.

717
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:59,520
I had important jobs to do in contention for very powerful people.

718
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:03,120
And I'm here to undo some of the harm that I've done.

719
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:04,420
Okay.

720
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,040
Why don't you expand on that?

721
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:11,600
How the fuck is anything you're doing here in this goo world turning things right?

722
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,480
John, I had, I used that bag.

723
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:14,880
Yeah.

724
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,640
We know about the bag.

725
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,000
Where'd you get the bag?

726
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,760
Let's just, where'd you get the bag?

727
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,600
He said he's always had it.

728
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,200
That's always been my mission.

729
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,280
We knew that bag is agent Victor's bag.

730
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,640
You couldn't have always had it.

731
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,080
We had it in fact, for a little bit.

732
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,080
I am agent Victor.

733
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:31,700
What?

734
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:36,320
Does that, do you know, do you know McKinley and Kennedy and?

735
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,200
The other one, much more important.

736
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,720
Do you know Kevin?

737
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,720
Do you know K cell?

738
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,160
I can't say I do.

739
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:47,280
Primarily worked alone, getting rid of items.

740
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,760
That's what the bag is for.

741
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:56,960
It's to get rid of things and make sure they don't ever come back to where we are, where we were.

742
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:04,240
Well, it seems like there's, you know, there's a few more portals between our world and the goo

743
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,800
than just this fucking bag.

744
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,640
I started figuring that out.

745
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,840
Cause I've been talking to Jack Russell for, I don't know.

746
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:14,240
God, I don't fucking know how long.

747
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,440
So long, mate.

748
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,920
Is this your first time that going into the bag?

749
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,120
Yeah, I didn't, I didn't know what was going to happen.

750
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,520
Why'd you go into the bag?

751
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,880
John, I did some bad things.

752
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:30,960
I'm not proud of one of the first things that really started bugging me about all this,

753
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,560
this business is I put a person in the bag.

754
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:38,160
It was only objects for a long time, but who did you put in?

755
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:42,400
Their name was, was, was Thomas, Thomas Lewis.

756
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:47,920
I believe they were an activist and they started coming down with some disease.

757
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:54,560
The organization I work for told me they'd seen this before and they needed to get rid of it.

758
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,080
Right then and there.

759
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,200
Just following orders.

760
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:01,120
Uncle, in my experience, people named Thomas are decent and good.

761
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,800
And you should have given them more of a shot.

762
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,880
That's neither here nor there.

763
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,360
So you think we're all in the bag right now?

764
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,160
I don't know.

765
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,840
But if you want to know why I'm here.

766
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,120
Yeah, let him keep talking.

767
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,920
I bet there's more to the story you'd want to hear about.

768
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,800
Yeah, let him keep talking.

769
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,760
Jack Russell's like rubbing my shoulder.

770
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,320
Go on, tell him more.

771
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,880
Who was he?

772
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:35,680
What was he like?

773
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,400
What did he do?

774
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,080
And now I'm talking like this.

775
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:41,760
All right.

776
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,360
Nobody asked you about fucking Thomas.

777
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,760
We just said, treat Thomas as nicer.

778
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,920
I asked you, did you jump in the bag and do you think we're in here?

779
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:56,240
And then Jack was like, yeah, tell him more about Thomas.

780
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,800
That's not what I asked.

781
00:39:58,800 --> 00:39:59,840
So can we just.

782
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:04,800
I think it's maybe the third time that he would have to establish that he got into the bag.

783
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,080
And that's why he's here.

784
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,520
I didn't ask them to reestablish that.

785
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:09,840
I just.

786
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,480
This is the bag?

787
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,000
Whatever you want.

788
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:16,960
Yeah, reestablish.

789
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,320
I know it's confusing.

790
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,320
It's confusing to all of us, mate.

791
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,160
It's confusing to everyone.

792
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:22,880
We don't fucking.

793
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,160
You don't fuck here from London.

794
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,440
Look at that sky.

795
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,600
Is it a blue dress or a silver dress?

796
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,200
Is it black or is it colorful?

797
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,080
I don't fucking know.

798
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,520
Is it Yanny or Laurel?

799
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,960
Goddamn, I hate you.

800
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:33,600
I'll hate you.

801
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,960
I just absolutely hate you because you've got me.

802
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,480
John, why are you talking like that?

803
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,320
It's some strange effect of this world.

804
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:41,600
Hold on.

805
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,160
Corn flakes.

806
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,680
All right, go fuck yourself.

807
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:53,280
Now I've lost track of where we are, but I want that British fellow to stop talking.

808
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,960
So John, here's the thing.

809
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:58,400
John, you asked him why he got in the bag and he said, well, to explain that, I'll have to go back

810
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,320
farther and started telling us about Thomas Lewis.

811
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:04,160
So let's just let him catch up to why he got into the bag by telling the story of Thomas Lewis.

812
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:05,440
Thank you.

813
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:06,480
All right.

814
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:06,800
All right.

815
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:11,680
All right.

816
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,240
All right.

817
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:12,800
All right.

818
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,480
Now, John.

819
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,200
You got more?

820
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,360
You just want to get your last little bit in there?

821
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,640
He's going to resist saying yeah.

822
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,080
All right.

823
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:22,320
Yeah.

824
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:28,160
You see, people can sound like all kinds of shit and they can make you feel shitty too.

825
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:32,720
I just said I don't want to hear another goddamn word out of that British feller.

826
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:33,680
And Jack Russell?

827
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:37,760
If that is your fucking name, I'd like you to respect that for a second.

828
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:38,720
I'm talking to my uncle.

829
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,720
Now, Don.

830
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,920
Please continue.

831
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:51,120
So this Thomas Lewis was an activist against this William Beanes fella.

832
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:54,640
Some kind of tech genius or some billionaire.

833
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,520
I don't know.

834
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,520
What, some kind of Martin Cupertino?

835
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,960
That was my daddy.

836
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:01,120
Your daddy was Martin Cupertino?

837
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,080
No, Beanes.

838
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:08,240
You're throwing confusion bombs into this conversation like a terrorist.

839
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,880
You don't even know who Martin Cupertino is.

840
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,160
First of all.

841
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,320
Oh, you do know who Martin Cupertino is?

842
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,440
He's a very famous man.

843
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,160
Very famous man.

844
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:21,120
It was a very astute character moment.

845
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,760
You don't even know who Steve Jobs is.

846
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,040
Does he exist in this world?

847
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,040
I'm pretty sure his name is Martin Cupertino.

848
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:28,900
Yeah.

849
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,400
Holy shit.

850
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,640
This Thomas Lewis, they were an activist.

851
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,280
They were young.

852
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:42,640
It was the first time I'd been ordered to put a person into the bag.

853
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:45,920
The bag is supposed to be for items, not for people.

854
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,920
I put them in here.

855
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:48,800
Who knows what happened?

856
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,560
They may have drowned in that metal sea.

857
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:53,840
I don't know, but that, that didn't even where it all ends.

858
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:57,280
The madness virus, it seemed to be stopped at that point.

859
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:00,000
But it was, I was never quite the same.

860
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,400
One of the items I ended up having to put in later.

861
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,160
You're not going to believe it.

862
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:07,200
It's a, it just looks like a rotary phone.

863
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:07,840
Like a road.

864
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:10,960
Have you, have y'all seen a rotary phone around here?

865
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,720
No, we're Gen Z.

866
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,000
You're Jan Z.

867
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,200
We're Gen Z.

868
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,480
We don't know what that is.

869
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:24,640
That phone might be able to heal everything.

870
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,360
They told me to get rid of this phone.

871
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:28,800
Why'd they want to get rid of it?

872
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:35,120
Because no one should have access to any of these magical doodads and items and whatnot.

873
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:41,440
But after I put that phone in the bag, I knew I made the world a worse place by putting

874
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:42,320
that phone in there.

875
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:48,560
And I, and I thought to myself, could I help Thomas if I, if I had that phone?

876
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:53,040
Maybe I could have prevented all this and maybe I could heal the world.

877
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:56,000
Maybe I can, maybe I can use it to heal us right now.

878
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,120
Even get us out of here.

879
00:43:57,120 --> 00:44:00,000
I don't know, but I know I need to find it.

880
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,440
What's the phone number for it?

881
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:05,840
Have you tried calling it?

882
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:06,080
Yeah.

883
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,520
Yeah, it seems pretty simple.

884
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:12,960
I don't think that's how it works, but let's, let's give it a shot.

885
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,160
Do you know the number?

886
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,320
Have you even tried?

887
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:17,920
Yeah, I do.

888
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:19,840
Why don't we just give it a call?

889
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:22,720
Let's see who answers.

890
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,880
Do phones work here?

891
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:26,640
There's only one in the room.

892
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:30,400
Keith, you got, uh, you still got, you still got yours on you?

893
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,760
Well, it's actually right here and I pull it out.

894
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,440
Beep, beep, beep, boop, beep, bop, boop, boop.

895
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,240
That's me plugging in the numbers.

896
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:41,360
Why are you making that noise?

897
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:49,520
Yeah, Keith, Keith, that's, that's really, you just need to dial the numbers.

898
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,680
Please don't, please don't say boop.

899
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,440
Hey Siri, beep, beep, boop, boop.

900
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,760
I guess I take the phone from him and I dial the number.

901
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:00,320
And I'm making beep boop sounds as he's doing it.

902
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:04,160
I'm sorry, uncle Don.

903
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,360
He just does that every time.

904
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:07,200
You got weird new friends.

905
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:09,280
They're not friends or coworkers.

906
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:09,840
We're friends.

907
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:19,440
Across the rope bridge, outside of this John made hole in the wall of this Leo piston

908
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:26,960
junkyard bunker, seemingly coming from inside the stilted bunker across the way.

909
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:32,480
You hear a woman's voice going bring, bring

910
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:38,320
the standard sound of all phones I've ever heard.

911
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:42,560
Yeah, clearly the sound of this rotary phone.

912
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:45,600
There's absolutely nothing out of the ordinary with that.

913
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,160
The phone's over there.

914
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:50,400
It's Claire's day.

915
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:56,960
I picture you putting tons of echo effect on Taylor's bring, bring off in the distance,

916
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:06,000
but also somehow muffled metallic reverberations.

917
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:11,760
It's inside of that other, I honestly wanted, I thought you wanted us to picture like a woman

918
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:17,600
pretending to ring like a phone from like over there.

919
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,200
And we were just fooled by it.

920
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,480
Pretending to be phones.

921
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:21,440
Pretending to be phones.

922
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:22,160
God damn it.

923
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:29,360
I think Don would, wait, can I get through that hole?

924
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:30,080
Oh yeah.

925
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:30,960
Wait, who did you answer?

926
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:31,460
Oh yeah.

927
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:35,040
What did, what did, what did Luke say?

928
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:36,800
I said, I'm going to go towards the ringing.

929
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,400
Whose dexterity is higher?

930
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,720
Mine is 11.

931
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:42,240
Mine is 12.

932
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:46,560
John has pushed an arm back real quick, like holding Clark back and he's like,

933
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:49,280
why don't we just see what happens with these fellers?

934
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:50,480
Clark is totally fine with that.

935
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:53,040
He wasn't even jumping at the bit to get out that door.

936
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:53,760
No, I'll go.

937
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:55,840
So he's last.

938
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:59,920
So it'll go Keith, then Don, then Jack.

939
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:03,200
And the three of them run out onto the rope bridge.

940
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:09,040
I assume that John and Clark are peeking their head out of this John made hole.

941
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:16,240
And you all see, not the Bay boat that Don and Jack arrived on, but a new boat.

942
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:20,000
Also made of this inky colorful darkness.

943
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:25,840
And this boat has been written on with this shimmering sea.

944
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:31,600
Numbers cover the entire hull of the boat.

945
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:39,760
And it says one, five, two, two, five, one, eight, one, nine, five, five, one, eight.

946
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:43,360
Which you know to mean oversea.

947
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,560
God damn it, Clark.

948
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:48,080
It's one of your things.

949
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:51,280
There are some things that are happening currently.

950
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:55,120
Do you guys know what the figurehead of a boat is?

951
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:56,480
Yes.

952
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,160
Is it like the naked lady?

953
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:58,800
It is.

954
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:08,560
But in this case, it's a young man with curly black hair and you all see Don's face shine

955
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:09,920
with recognition.

956
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:18,880
Because even without his glasses, Don recognizes Thomas Lewis, the activist who is anti-William

957
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:22,080
Beans, still technically alive.

958
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:29,200
His mouth is completely steeled shut with the melting silver shimmering sea.

959
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:32,640
His silver mouth is closed.

960
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:35,840
His bottom half is in the water.

961
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:43,120
Continuously melting as he cries in absolutely horrendous pain.

962
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:57,040
At the front of the boat, you see twins.

963
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:59,280
And twins.

964
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:01,920
They are children.

965
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,080
Oh my God.

966
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:05,600
And kids.

967
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:14,320
Avery and Alice Little with a bowl cut and pigtails respectively, each with overalls

968
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:22,880
on, are standing at the front of this boat and behind them is Julie Maxwell wearing a

969
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,240
hospital gown.

970
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:30,160
She has a massive gash running down her forehead in between her eyes.

971
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:37,840
Her nose seems to be missing and she smiles at you all with no teeth or lips on one full

972
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:39,120
side of her face.

973
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:48,000
That side has an eye, but her other orbital socket is oozing with the dark substance.

974
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:55,920
And suddenly the body begins to crumple into the boat as a metallic ball rises above with

975
00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:03,920
these silvery shining limbs reaching out, one of which holds up the body of Julie Maxwell

976
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:08,720
away from the steel shimmering water below this boat.

977
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:19,040
And the other tendril reaches out and rips at the bridge that Dawn, Keith, and Jack are

978
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:20,560
currently standing on.

979
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:22,400
Oh no.

980
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:23,040
That ain't good.

981
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:26,560
Well, it's a good thing they showed up right when we started to cross the bridge instead

982
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:29,920
of when we were well across it, because you fellas just get inside.

983
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:31,680
Let's all just come back inside.

984
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:32,560
We'll be fine.

985
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:36,320
Hey, I'm trying to hide my face from those kids and Clark, you should too, so they don't

986
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:36,960
recognize us.

987
00:50:53,760 --> 00:51:02,800
I'm on the borderline, leaving my mind at your altar, crossing the double line, doing

988
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:03,760
it every time.

989
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:09,760
Tell me what kind of world are you living in?

990
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:17,760
What kind of world are you living in?

991
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:45,760
What kind of world are you living in?

992
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:51,760
What kind of world are you living in?

993
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,760
What kind of world are you living in?

994
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,760
What kind of world are you living in?
