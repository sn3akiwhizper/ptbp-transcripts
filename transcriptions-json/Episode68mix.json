pretending pod if you want to get a quick recap of what's going on don't touch that uncle fucking dial because right now is the most perfect time for the news Charles Digby Roger and Angela Fairfield Walter and Alan Grimes and Bradley Cooper met with James the executive director of calm comfy campground during orientation a game of two truths and a lie got a little out of hand the group was then led to the boathouse to meet Jack Russell the boatman he was an odd guy who warned the group to never go out alone in a canoe on the brackish water of Lake calm the past doesn't seem nearly as fucked as the present I bet it definitely stays that way no way things get weirder and weirder and spin out of control nope so stay calm friends stay comfy turn yourselves down but turn up that radio it's dream girl with pretty sexual Oh hey Thomas Isaac so Bradley Cooper is standing with a key in hand it's just us you can call him Martin Cooper you're so right Martin Cupertino is standing key in hand to cottage number five and you're standing right in front of this beautiful little cottage you've walked down those same kind of a cobblestone path to get to your cottage and it is by itself secluded by all these trees and bushes and stuff and it's in a little opening space it's quite lovely and there's a front door with a window to the side and you are home for the weekend he eyes it all up and kind of huffs and says cozy and goes in yeah and when you walk in it is equally cozy inside there is a fireplace and it's fully decorated in a sort of like not quite lake house kind of decorations a little bit higher level but it's still rust yeah yeah and so your bags are up in your room which is on the second level and it's a loft by itself up a staircase and there's a bathroom attached and then downstairs there's like a living room there's a little study and there's a kitchen I prepare a small meal of fresh fruits and vegetables that I bought at a local market before I came here and while those are simmering I'm meditating on the floor but not very well because I'm paying attention to the cooking vegetables what is your mind keep wandering to when you're trying to meditate I told him I told him it had to be white but I think it should be ivory it's got to be ivory god damn it that and the smell of the cooking vegetables but he's trying to just focus on breathe just breathe Martin breathe in and out just focus on your breathing ivory would be revolutionary and after he eats the meal he's going to take out a biography of Hannibal Barca the general across the Alps to invade Rome and he's gonna read that for a while and after some time he's gonna kind of look around and see if it doesn't look like things have quieted down outside and if they have he's gonna make his way down to the boathouse and take a canoe out to the middle of the lake cool so as you're walking around the cottage you come down the stairs after doing a little bit of reading and as you're making your way out to the front door you step on this wood panel beneath you and it is extremely loose to the point to where it almost slides out completely god damn I almost slipped on this slidey and loose panel I could sue anyway I guess I'll take a look at it though what's underneath the panel what's underneath the panel who knows but it is definitely a gym bag there's a gym bag hidden underneath this panel you have to grab another panel and move it to the side in order to get the bag up out of there I get the bag up out of there when you get the bag up out of there you open it up and inside it is filled with cash money there's also a passport there are many cassette tapes and there is a map it's a map of the calm comfy campground with Lake calm and then all of the wilderness around it and the map leads to a spot far away from here in the wilderness and it is circled and it says the door there's also bottled water snacks and a syringe that is filled with a clear substance I am going to pocket the map and with a quick visual estimation how much money do I think is in here at least 10 grand okay I look at the passport the passport is for a man named Jack Russell and you'd recognize the picture as the man who is the boat man I'd recognize those fuzzy cheeks anyway fuzzy cheeks fluffy bags mmm full eyes clear heart of the eyes can't lose looks like Jack was ready to get out of here in a hurry do the tapes the cassettes have any kind of markings on them any like side a of Jack explains the mystery they're all labeled with like Jack Russell number 532 Jack Russell number 533 Jack Russell 534 Jack Russell 535 was there a stereo a cassette player in my room there's not hmm how many tapes are there how many did I just say it's 64 for four okay pocketable amount yeah I pocket them okay I guess I take the passport to have leverage he doesn't care about the money he just covers that back up there's also the bottled water snacks and syringe filled with a clear substance what kind of snacks rollos combos bugles and a bunch of nuts and some hard meat okay he takes the nuts and starts snacking on them as he considers his next move yeah they're pistachios without the shell it's kind of thing that's gonna make our country lazy Zach loves pistachios without the show it hurts my hands X lazy Zach's the kind of thing that's gonna make our country is that is accurate is there an employee parking lot you've seen no cars how did I get here roll sanity uh-huh I figured it was something like that 51 huck on a 50 god damn it oh okay yeah so go ahead and lose one sanity okay as you cannot for the life of you remember getting here you can like vaguely remember being in your car but then like you don't even remember taking a boat to get on the island you were just standing there at six o'clock not the time the position and you don't have any memory of coming to this island if I say gaze out at the far shore of the lake say it this is maybe look like we're moving oh interesting role some sort of science or survival or anything that you can think of that would be helpful to produce this just intelligence yeah you can roll intelligence okay 31 on a 70 the island does not seem to be moving okay okay there was I didn't notice any stereo or anything at the boathouse no and you didn't see anything when you're in the lobby or in the meeting room either but you also haven't been up to Jack Russell's apartment and you haven't been in the rest of the main house hmm I think I need to go find that Metallica kid maybe he had a Walkman hell yeah do you remember where he was staying no absolutely not no he got his room assignment and left went straight there okay what would you like to do I put everything back well I take the tapes out I keep the tapes in the map but I put everything else back in the hiding spot okay I go and unlock my luggage and lock the tapes back up inside it and then he's gonna go back down to the boathouse and take his canoe okay sounds good he's still like he's like this place is weird but I've really got a focus for the launch of cube so I'm sorry for the what the launch of cube voice in my head cube cube cube it's gonna be huge I've got a launch cube cube Martin Cupertino as you make your way out to the boathouse you are unmolested I'm gonna say something else you do not see anyone on your way out and about and you get to the boathouse and it seems that Jack Russell is up in his apartment and these six canoes are all looking you dead in the face I look I'm dead back what are you looking at and I grab a life vest and a paddle and I go out on a canoe and you just hear this echo and your back of your head that's why we always sticked it to you in a canoe he actually doesn't hear that echo the the listener might but as soon as he actually heard that the first time he was like very specifically just thinking about like how it did not apply to him are you comfortable on the water he is actually he was a high school swimmer he grew up in California and did did some nature things he really grew up with an appreciation of California's natural spaces and so yeah you know he knows his way around a canoe all right sounds good so you go out on the water oh god I should have asked for a joint from that girl anyway all I want to do now is row out there's not necessarily a middle of this ring like lake but I'm gonna go it's a lifesaver it's a lifesaver donut I'm gonna go to the middle part of the ring okay you know the thick of the lifesaver yeah as far from either shore as I can get and I'm gonna paddle out there lean back in my canoe and meditate on cube do you come up with anything I'm starting to second guess the whole ivory thing I don't know well I'm coming back to cream bone is also an option but that's really close to ivory roll alertness for me yes okay that's not that's a d20 36 39 on a I think I gave myself a little bit here 45 oh nice so when you're out there you decide on cream and at that exact moment you hear and looking over you see the tail end of something dip down into the inky black water of Lake calm and you see ripples slowly moving toward you he assumes a karate stance he stands up in the boat which is it's it's kind of feasible because he's only like five foot seven so yeah it doesn't move it around too much when he stands up there but he's yeah any I'd like to have you rolling athletics yeah honestly it looks like he knows what he's doing what is your athletics I think it's pretty if it's good enough you don't after all 65 oh yeah then you are good okay he gets into like an Elvis karate pose and he's like what is this industrial espionage and the lake does not reply he keeps an eye out for a while and then anything nothing cream won't do any respect you get back there and it's still quiet on all fronts so you can put everything back in peace and he does do I see a light on in any of the other cabin we can't really I was like you don't see anyone I hope well and if I leave right after this I hope no one sees me go ahead and roll stealth for me if you're trying to be sneaky that way I have it for oh he's not honestly he's not no no no he's paying a lot to be here that is yes and it's a goddamn lake trip and he is very confident it's gonna use the lake he knows how to canoe he knows karate he's fine yeah he's gonna go back to the cabin and I'm gonna study that map a little bit does it look like what I think this place should look like it looks exactly like what you think this place should look like and you see that the trail that was pointed out to you earlier by Jack Russell if you took that trail you would only need to dip off about halfway through the trail to go off trail to get to where it is marked the door okay what are the odds that I brought a Walkman I want to say zero so I'm gonna okay you have a CD player but you don't have any you know that's that player so true yeah yeah you do have a walk with yeah but not the kind I want he gets really annoyed at other people for not being early enough adapters it's 26 years ago give up the times that was a terrible laugh I'd liked it I was really scared fine I'm kind of getting invested in this mystery I guess I do have to find the Metallica kid but but not tonight and right as he says that a little beeper goes off on his on his watch on a digital watch and he's like ooh bedtime and to sleep you go yep he gets into some some really nice pajamas oh hell yeah it's a little incongruous with what he's been wearing the rest of the day sure but this is this is some good sleepwear high thread count mm-hmm hell yeah hello Joe hello Zach what's up man what's up man what's up dude what's up dude how you live how you live in large as hell large as hell all right so fuck I can't do that you got me Roger and Angela Fairfield are standing in front of cottage number nine you've got the key in your hand with the little keychain hanging down that says number nine right on it and you're staring at this beautiful little cozy little cottage it's in its own little clearing so there's trees all over but yeah there there's an opening for this cottage to be and you've got a front door and a window in the front seems to be a two-story with loft as the second story from what you can tell outside you said just a window it's not like a nice glass or anything like that it's a nice glass little bay window sure okay I got you I'm getting a picture yeah yeah it's got a chimney brick chimney and when you go in it's equally as like rustic and charming and modern as the main big house was and you see that there is a living room there's a study and there's a kitchen and then when you go up the stairs there's the lofted bedroom with a bathroom attached is the kitchen a fully fully equipped kitchen it is fully stocked and as you guys are in there actually Angela starts cooking like immediately she's like I'm just like a little hungry and you notice that as she's moving around the kitchen she seems to know where everything is she's just like opening up drawers and grabbing what she needs honey have you ever have you ever stayed here before have you been to the common comfy campground without me no you seem to know your way around that kitchen pretty dang well oh yeah well it's like this kitchen is set up so intuitively it's like everything is where you expect it to be that's that's handy yeah yeah it's wild what do you want what do they got well I'm making just like an omelet with some bacon and I figured maybe maybe some biscuits make it too all right we'll do I'm gonna go and put on my pajamas and you head off and she continues cooking you can hear kind of humming to herself from upstairs and looking around the bedroom it's just nicely decorated everything is there for you there's I was gonna say there's phone chargers like ready to go but that's silly I was like what's the nicest amenity I can think it's just a phone charger already waiting for you USB outlets everywhere it's fucking sick man and yeah there's a nice big bathroom up there that's attached Roger is changing into some really nice silk pajamas oh hell yeah what color are they gold tight you take your time changing and when you come down she's finishing up cooking I sit at the table okay so I did your eggs in an omelet like I said I was going to even though like they kind of split like halfway and so I was like I scramble should I omelet I just didn't know so whatever it's a it's fine and you look down it's a beautiful omelet I was about to ask is she a good cook yeah I'm excited for it says Joe can I get that omelet I'll be right back thanks thanks Angie this looks great you deserve it I mean thanks I don't I don't know that I did anything in particular but I just thought that you were just so open and ready for the experience and that just means so much to me you know you've talked a lot about me being open and receptive and and as I'm saying this I'm kind of holding my hand out I'm gonna hold her hand in mine it's am I doing the right thing is this is this exactly what you want me to do I'm willing to work on whatever you need me to work on it's just like communication and being being available to talk about anything like I just feel like with your work and everything you just keep everything so bottled up I don't want that for us I understand you you want you want you want open lines of communication which maybe I can I can work on I can do that are you willing to maybe meet me halfway halfway I'm going full way baby I pull my hand that I'm holding her hands I pulled the sleeve up and I I'm showing the track marks to the room to us can you tell me about these I haven't seen those before roll human I don't think I have any I got they got the baseline 10% all right it was close but no cigar it's a 26 she immediately is like well you know I had to get all those shots for when we go overseas next time when I'm going to visit you on your trip over on the new dig site did Roger have these does Roger know about these shots are they a real thing they are a real thing oh the vaccinations they they did that to your yeah it doesn't it look crazy I sure my arm where I got those two and it's nothing there now it doesn't yeah no this is this is what mine looks like this is oh my lucky oh my big strong man are you sure those aren't infected should we maybe see a doctor oh shit I didn't even think about that does it does it hurt today doesn't really hurt and she like presses on it it's like no it's it's fine I honestly didn't even really think about it otherwise I would have said something I'm so sorry yours you were scared oh did you think I was a drug addict I thought maybe something had happened that you were afraid to tell me and this whole time if I would have just been shooting up in the bathroom that's crazy I tell you what I am embarrassed to have even brought it up on oh my god you Roger does feel embarrassed good he's buying he's buying the story your wife claiming she's like into heroin or some shit I get it's 26 years ago and that might be popular but damn Angie I got it I gotta tell you it's honestly a relief that that's not what I thought it was of course it's not you know me so much better than that I have my vices but they're not that also I do have pot sorry about that I should have told you I I was a little thrown off by that but I figured you know this is part of the being open thing we're not gonna get in trouble out here I don't think no I don't think so with these big skies and everything too I thought we could just like smoke and look up at the stars will you make me a promise though that you won't go out in those canoes while you're high I just Jack made it sound like there's always a danger out there and I don't want you babe if we're out on those canoes it'll just be with me and you clear hell if I'm getting high all right yeah I feel better about all this all that this is nice this is really nice I'm glad you thought to bring us out here and you guys continue conversing while you finish up eating and then she's like I actually I do not feel good something maybe in those eggs I I don't know I'm I'm feeling fine it's just that oh oh god yeah no sorry I I'm gonna call it a night I understand I'll do I'll clean up down here and I'll meet you up there do you want me to bring you a mug of tea or something glass of water by my bed please alrighty oh I guess we do that she goes upstairs and you are left alone in the cottage you doing anything before you turn in you know what I will do is I will do what I just said I'll clean the dishes and I'll bring up her up a glass and as I set it down on the nightstand I'm gonna see what they have to read maybe maybe just sit in the den for a minute and I'll be up here and hour so how's that sound oh she's asleep oh okay yeah honey you said that I wake up honey I'm going to read for a while Jim you're not even shouldn't be here it's Jim honey and she's asleep holy shit Roger is wondering about that but he's gonna let her let the sick sick wife sleep maybe talk about that later fucking boom dear but I do want to go downstairs and see if they like you said there was a study right there's a study what kind of what kind of literature that they have in on the bookshelves there's a vast array of different styles of literature in this study and you can find really maybe anything that you're looking for if it's vague enough I would like the history of the calm comfy campground that's for sure not there yeah no no so Roger audience if you haven't been able to tell by my actions so far he wasn't exactly the one who decided to go on this trip but now that he's here and he really wants to work on this with his wife he's gonna start to embrace this forestry lifestyle like half of it is self-help well right well yeah I was gonna say that he gets he wants to pull down like a local flora and fauna like textbook you can start reading about the trees and the plants all around this neck of the woods and he's he's kind of settling into an armchair and trying to put himself in the mindset of a guy who's at a campground and he's reading about trees and you're 15 pages in before you fucking falls there's a chance Roger would be really into it he gets 30 pages in and then with that you nod off with the book just kind of slumping onto your belly as you're sitting in this nice comfy chair I like it hey Luke Kingson oh god thank you that's what yeah I'm sure yes so Walter Grimes is standing outside of cottage number three with his father Alan Grimes who is standing right behind you and the two of you are in this clearing where your cottage is surrounded by all this lush forest green and yeah Alan grabs the key up out of his pocket and is like okay let's go on in and probably call it a night walking in you see a living room there's a study on this floor and there's a kitchen and then there's stairs that go up to a lofted bedroom that has two queen-size beds and a bathroom attached but where does Alan go Alan immediately heads to the kitchen and just grabs some tea and puts on a kettle I walk over to the refrigerator and I open it up is there anything it is fully stocked as I open the refrigerator I look at Alan and I go father would you like me to prepare you any food that would be fantastic what would you like there's pretty much everything you could ask for in here breakfast eggs and bacon yeah sounds good to me so I pull out three eggs some bacon pour them a glass of milk make an omelet and cook up some bacon yeah and he's gonna go into the other room and you hear him flick on the TV and start changing channels with his tea while you do that curiously I break off a little piece of the bacon very crisp by the way I was curious yeah I break off a little piece of the bacon and I put it in my mouth and I chew it I masticate yuck and I attempt to swallow sure and when I swallow it is immediately rejected out of my body not puke but like just sent back into my mouth and I spit it out and in my mind I I think I wish that I could enjoy this like he does and then I bring him his breakfast for dinner as you walk into the room you see that the channels are flipping from channel to channel to channel to channel at a rapid pace at one point Wheel of Fortune comes up sure I see the clue is just things and there's no letters on the board and I immediately guess beer battered rock shrimp and then they spin the wheel and they guess B oh my oh my god that was incredible I wish that this was fun for me as well here you go and he flips to another channel and when it flips to the next channel the picture is a square instead of a rectangle like is the shape of the TV and the square picture is in black and white and it is the living room entryway of a cottage that looks identical to the cottage that you are in so it looks like like video like surveillance surveillance videos what what what is going on I stand there and I just continue looking at the video you see that Bradley Cooper makes his way into frame and seems to step on something on his way to the front door so in the entryway in between the stairs in the front door Bradley Cooper steps on something and immediately looks down and then you see him get down on his knees and he pulls a wooden plank off of the floor looks into it and then he grabs another wood plank and moves it and then he grabs a black duffel bag out of the floorboards and when he opens it you can't quite see what is inside but then he pulls out this piece of paper that is folded up that he kind of looks at for a second refolds it and puts it back and then he grabs four cassette tapes while he does that make me roll something for this but I zoom and enhance with my eyeballs well you get my eyeballs in quotation marks my cameras okay go ahead and roll search seven whole shit okay roll a d10 for okay so add four to that skill so take the time right now to explain to the listeners what the deal is with Walter Grimes I gave Walter Grimes 30 skill points on almost everything almost every skill except everything except like unnatural firearms and unarmed combat yeah and like heavy artillery and shit like that the yeah but besides that has got 30% and everything and I've told you that every time you roll whether you succeed or fail you learn something and you gain a d10 so right now I've got 30 on everything except search I now have 34 and surgery I have a 33 fantastic surgery of all things I think when I was like oh I've got a 30 in surgery they were like yeah Thomas was looking at your character she like what the fuck and then I think he saw that you have 30 on everything yeah that's not right because I don't want to give away I'm a freaking robot I leaned into it a little bit but I'm hoping that they haven't I did say something along the lines of like I have the same hit hips that I was made yeah you definitely made and Joe gave me a look of like God like kind of like oh interest and I was like damn it well we'll see if you wrote it down yeah so you zoom in with your eyes onto this TV screen and somehow the picture clears up enough and where you're looking for you to see that the map that he pulled out is of calm comfy campground and he kind of ran his face the island over the island and the the greenery around the island of the lake and he kind of pointed at a point at the top there can I make a mental note for my character of where he pointed to yeah sure it's in the northeast quadrant of the map you also see him pull out four cassettes and you just see a name on all of them and then a number afterward and it says Jack Russell number three hundred and and then something now all four of them are three hundred and something Alan looks at you and he's like we got up I guess we should look around to see if there's cameras like that and and this in this cottage I think you might need to look for cameras and I'm going to look underneath the floorboards by the entrance smart so go ahead and roll search 16 oh you pry up some of the floorboards they're not easy to get up but you well I shove my fingers there's like I find one little spot that the floorboards aren't completely touching each other and I shove my entire hand down into it some of my silicone skin rips a bit and blood comes out but then I have enough grip underneath the floorboard and I pull it up and looking down there you see absolutely nothing and Alan comes up behind you and he's like okay thankfully there are no cameras in this cottage it must just be in that one band-aid oh god oh yes of course and he goes and grabs a band-aid throws it on you and then it's like okay enough of all this nonsense I'm going to bed for the night you did a great job today Walter and I think that you'll do even better moving forward I think we're definitely I think you've convinced them so far and if you can make it through this thing we're on to the next step do you need me to tuck you in yes please I follow Alan to the bedroom he lays in bed and I very mechanically like tuck him in to bed and I place my hand on his forehead good night father I will discontinue soon good night Walter you can just say you're going to sleep I will go to sleep soon and he is out like a light pretty quick Walter stands there watching him until he goes to sleep he walks out of the bedroom he takes up the floorboard that he had ripped out earlier places it back where it came from kind of like stomps on it to like put it in place yeah and then does a little tour of the house just walking around looking at every little piece of each room he goes next to the door where Alan is sleeping he looks down at his shoes he reaches behind his head and presses on a pressure point shirt on his head the matrix spot and his piercing blue eyes turn to completely black and he's out perfect hey Justin hello so Charles Digby is standing outside of cottage number seven he's got the key in hand with the nice little keychain rubber with the number seven on it says calm comfy campground and looking at this cottage it's quaint cute it's got a little brick chimney and a front door with a window right next to it and the front door is painted red because that's nice how calm is it oh dude it's calm as shit you can't hear anything the only thing that you hear is the wind and looking up you see the beautiful stars above you mildly off-putting there's no sounds out here pretty weird to be honest can you hear crickets no you cannot unsettled so when you go into the cottage you are going to find a living room and that's in the entryway and then back there's a study and there's also a kitchen on the main floor and then up the stairs there's a lofted bedroom with a bathroom attached I'm gonna go to the kitchen and make myself a little cup of coffee for sure anything in it no just black absolutely sad coffee sad coffee my favorite kind personally sad coffee for a sad boy what's Charles thinking about as he's going through here Charles is thinking about just how how he got here he's wondering if this is all a mistake he's not used to opening up to anybody he's thinking about his past relationship and how she would have enjoyed being at this kind of outdoorsy place and how he being from the city does not particularly enjoy it although he's trying his best with your cup of coffee are you going straight to bed are you the type to take caffeine right before sleep yes this is this is like kind of his nightly ritual gotcha he does the whole like slug down some coffee and then lay down and try to fall asleep let your brain just go yeah it's weird so as you're laying there staring up at the ceiling ceiling fan going around and round and round five blades on the ceiling fan you kind of like focus your eye on one of them as it goes and then you hear from underneath the bed hello is it like someone the floor below me it does not sound like it's on the floor below you it sounds like it is under the bed I like immediately like like I just like get out of bed like freak out cover like fling covers off like like you know how sometimes you waking dream where a spider is coming down onto your face I don't know if I'm the only person who has this all the time you could ask Joe he fucking hate spiders I have that where I literally will have like a right before I wake up it looks like a spider is like from its web like coming down onto my face and I will spring out of my bed and throw my covers off the bed holy shit I've literally never sprung out of bed it's bad sometimes I get sprung in bed just like like a knee-jerk reaction of like what the fuck and like look under under look under the bed immediately yeah under the bed there is a little walkie-talkie down there and it goes hello oh fuck okay and then he grabs it relieved that it is not yeah a little creepy person or something yeah that would be worse activates it and like hi oh oh hello sir who is this oh you know is this Charles Digby this is he who are you oh I just wanted to know if you figured it out yet what what am I supposed to be figuring out the reason why you're here I mean that's it's kind of private why I'm here okay sleep well we'll talk later Charles gets like a shiver up his spine and it's like what the fuck wait wait and tries to talk again this is a walkie-talkie so you can talk all you want who are you what's going on here how did you know I was gonna be here and there's nothing but he puts it on the nightstand next to him anyway nice and lays back down but he's like staring fucking just dead eyes staring at it just waiting kind of you don't turn it off you leave it on yes yeah I'm just gonna leave it on for a while at least until nothing happens and then maybe I'll turn it off to try and get some sleepies eventually but he's very perturbed yeah seemingly was this a young girl's voice maybe it was a young girl's voice interesting is there anything else I could it you can ask anything you want baby welcome to the show did I hear the girl's voice earlier you did not whenever I was okay I assumed I didn't and did I see her with a walkie-talkie earlier which we did not sing with okay say I might I would I would assume that this
