It's the news Last time lots of information was shared and then Keith went berserk on little old Mildred Mitchell John kicked things off by telling the group about his uncle Don D. Pettymore who could burn folks with his hands John also recalled being chased by two tall gaunt Fancy men in suits while being pushed in a wheelchair by Uncle Don Keith also remembered seeing those lemmy Translucent fellas infiltrate his father's estate the day Ferguson was given the watch John put the watch on and saw his daddy steal him the vector and adopted baby from the Kane Family burning down their house But unaware of Adam Kane's survival Keith slapped the watch on and saw John murder him and Clark in order to take the watch and walk down into beans pond But the watch didn't come off his wrist when he came back to reality and he became real suspicious of John Shit got heated with Mildred Mitchell blaming the three PCs for her granddaughter Tilly B's Disappearance showed them a picture of the founders of contention the face of Silas Cole had settled on the face of Keith Vigna and a Reflection in the glass looked a whole lot like that miss until DB Keith lost it and Keith did up Grinding the old stoner into the old stone ground. This was a step too far Harry and Gary asked them to leave at gunpoint and the three headed south into a tunnel and toward beanspond Never mind They completely ignored the spell that fell out of Mildred Mitchell's back pocket as well as the fact that Casey Kristoff the longtime janitor of the first Church of contention was clearly Eavesdropping instead of reading his book. It'd be a shame if old Casey wasn't actually down there in the sewers to avoid Big Daddy Kane, but rather doing Reconnaissance for his employer. Well, what do I know?

So oh well Oh God, he also said if we stop testing the numbers will be very low Which is true. Yeah, it's been proven, correct Yep, welcome to hell world fuckheads. Oh You thought you were gonna get away from the world by listening to a role-playing podcast we've all been touched by the devil hands Don D. Petty more patient zero God-dang Don D. Don D. I wonder when he'll show up Yeah, so much happened last episode that I kind of forgot that that's where we started was a man who could burn other people with his bare hands I Thomas and I hadn't talked about the past of that and Hearing that it was just a staple in their childhood camping trips was pretty horrifying to hear It's like I'm trying to think of like anything my family or like like a weird trick and uncle can do or something But nothing really matches. Yeah, my uncle can pull his thumb clean off. He puts it right back My uncle that's so on multiple occasions has stolen my nose off of my face Oh shit, but it's he always puts it back sometimes not right away, which is scary, but He lost it one time we had to look all around it was in the couch Yeah uncle Dave all uncles are Dave all uncles are Dave. I have one uncle Dave. I have an uncle Dave I have an uncle Dave. Really? I have two uncles named Dave. You got a Jimmy and I got a Jimmy So maybe they're all Jimmy. Oh, I've got a Jimmy to Story. Yeah, me too. My uncle Donny's name is Jimmy now. I Renamed Dave who didn't exist in the first place. Welcome to 84 Pretending to be people where everybody's uncle has a name. Wait, how many uncles do you have just on your dad's side? Six and how many else Yeah, I just won wait, but they all live together. Yeah. No, they did it one point They actually didn't their ages were so like the oldest to the youngest I think is an 18 year difference So they'd weren't ever in the house all at the same time. I don't think oh Can you imagine getting rid of one and then there's just a new one all the sudden there about yeah Their numbers didn't change at all. Definitely after the first one like grew up a little bit They were like, oh shit. These things are handy if you teach them how to like 18 years of like fresh kids definitely seems like some kind of forced labor program or like Something they were getting out of it Not joy or love you can get that one, too How do ants get made In pursuit of an ant Wait wouldn't if your uncle fucked your grandma you would get you get you get a grant grandpa Well, no, we only discuss you get another you get an aunt you get an aunt If your uncle fucked your grandpa then you'd get another mom All right, you you would get another Grandma, cuz if you fuck your dad you get a mom So if your uncle fucked your grandpa by the trans you would get a grandma another grandma I was never good at biology in school. So I don't know if this really checks out. It's like And recessive jeans and stuff. Yeah, you have to look at the Punnett Square. Yeah Invented by Who's who is that guy Recessive gene and a dominant gene and Taylor has two recessive genes Then when we have sex, we'll get a great-grandma correct What was that now I got to figure out Who's the guy that figured that out his name was something he was like a monk or a priest or something I bet Thomas will be upset that you had to google it. What who discovered recessive genes Thomas was it Mendel? Yep, Gregory. Yeah, Mendel men who actually I don't know if you guys knew this same guy is Rasputin people Don't know that but he's the same guy. It's the exact same guy Yeah, he just went by Gregory when he was doing science Close enough for me. Have you guys been watching the great on Hulu never heard of it? No, I hear it's good though It's really good. It's it's the guy who did the or the people who did the favorite? So it's a lot of that movie rule same sense of humor style, and I don't know what the favorite is Who knows your guys Lanthimos is last movie with oh I did see that that was really good. Yeah, Emma Stone and Holly Coleman leak Peaky Blinders. Yeah, I'll be sure Paulie Shore and Nicholas Holt So Nicholas Holt is that there's one of the main characters in the in the great and he's fucking great in it It's a really surprisingly. So I was a big skins UK fan when I was it. Oh, is that What's the code Tony Tony stolen yes season one Tony Alright, so Clark Bishop and John Lee Pettymore the third they're walking down this tunnel having just been essentially forced out of this room By the only two people you've been able to trust and contention thus far Essentially, yeah, that didn't feel too good you catch up and you see Keith Vigna on the right side of this tunnel again This is an arched Very Ninja Turtles arched roof above you with a pathway on the right pathway on the left and then sewage sludge Slowly moving in the middle. You see me on the right side I'm on my back and I've got my left hand that has the watch on it and I've got both my feet on my arm just trying to like pry the watch off my wrist and I'm crying and he's crying because you can see the scrape of skin coming off and blood and I'm also he's also crying cuz he Potentially just killed someone Keith Keith Keith Keith calm down buddy. Hold on No, I got this is just fucking I know we got to get it off, but that's not working. Look at that That's not like you're hurting yourself there Keith. It hurts. It does. I just we're gonna get it off We're gonna get it off. Was she was she? I Still breathing when we left Keith, okay. Can you are you sure? Yeah, we're sure Why? Why did you do that? I? Don't know. I thought maybe she had something to do with this being stuck on it I don't I just don't think straight when shit like this happens anymore. I can understand that Think things will set us off at the drop of a hat these days. It seems like We've seen a lot. We've seen a lot in the last few days on are you still gonna shoot us when we get there? Maybe man, I don't know. I got two guns now, though Okay, listen, all I'm saying is you you do some crazy shit you attack, you know an old lady that we find there yeah, maybe I'm gonna have to shoot you but if you fucking just Okay, well maybe you can you walk in front me and Clark can walk behind you just to make me feel better Absolutely. Are we I don't even know if we're going the right way. I I get in front of them But then I turn around with gun strong Just what just playing just plants that's not very funny John a people He's got you know, it's a tense situation. Somebody's got to diffuse it a little bit So I've livened things up get get get a little get a little joy in our heart after you beat that old woman half to death fucking psychopath It wasn't really me. It was I don't know something in me. Just I Didn't I didn't want to do it. I didn't mean to but Let's just get let's just get to the fucking pond Gary said we were we were heading in the right direction you that you happen to pick the right tunnel to to crawl Good it's probably cuz I'm the Savior and I just have that kind of intuition now Sure, all right, I pet you on the back I roll my eyes at Clark Yeah, I roll I roll back as I'm patting you on the back. Yeah, that's it You nailed it Yes Would while we're walking there would this be a good time to discuss something? we haven't really talked a whole lot about we found out that we You know kind of Maybe from one point of view from a certain perspective Might have let Adam Cain's wife and his children burn to a little crisp in a minivan I mean we we just ran that help we tried to help I know but it doesn't seem like people think we did it seems like they really think we just Let them burn up and then we left town. We can a Adam Cain you what you're technically his A kind of his brother. Yeah, we've now learned that his entire family was killed and he was a sole survivor because of Kevin's slobiness Or perhaps ill ill got it. Sorry Murphy's going crazy. So good. Gotta stop him You can hear Tyler from back the way you came yelping out Tyler did like us Keith hops in the sewage and starts splashing around Keith roll Constitution To not get gonorrhea No, what do you get from from poop? Maybe like E. Coli or pink eye pink eye or What's something else you can get what happens if you eat poop Thomas? What happens if you eat poop? I think that depends on the poop a lot of people do ingest other people's poop to improve their gut biome Oh, I thought they shot it up their butts like a like a like a tall boy. They make little poop pills No way according to Illinois Poison Center eating poop is minimally toxic So I think You should eat poop. That's also is that core prophagia, huh? Is that what it's called? It was enough syllables to be right co prophagia. Let's get back to the convert What were we talking about out of character when John you were telling us the story the the canes also adopted you, right? Like right I had been a yeah, it's so first exactly and Kevin stole me because He and my my my saintly mother were trying to have a baby and could not conceive Gotcha, and so God saw fit to put me a child of destiny and ball in front of him Because I am the Savior we did we did try to save Adams family in that wreck I obviously didn't go to according to plan but we tried and there was a crowd around there that saw us trying to help I think John you might have scared him off with a couple gunshots, but they saw that we were helping I Don't think that's you know Cuz the the person we've been around who's been close to Adam was was Carrie in the body of Drew and the story She told us seems like Adam Kane and the town's version of things right now is that we let them die and then left town Yeah, that's sucks for him that he's lost two families in a horrible horrific fire accident Well, maybe not accident for the first it certainly adds a layer of terror to that memories. Yeah guys, I tried my hardest to keep it from happening, but Well also so we've Valiantly if I remember guys, we've also all had have we all had encounters with those crazy Creatures before I mean Marvin things I I mean like I told you guys before I got this watch stuck on me that I Saw three of them at least when I was a kid In my in my yard before before my dad gave this watch to my brother in my memory It was a they were chasing the I I would say a rogue figure but these days it's the road figure I think it's the same one. We've been seeing it might be old me I think it's old me that people seem to think it's old bar called Clark old and they were chasing you after your after your Accident John. Well, yeah that the last day of my racing career is kind of one big concussed blur But as far as I remember it, yeah They started chasing me and Don D that day these things have known something about us long before we ever did Yeah, maybe so they were they were targeting each of us and mine was I was only Forwarded by old me. He put chains around the library door That's where I was in the library and he put chains around the door and then took maybe he took the heat off of Mary On the front it says the Mary Cole Public Library It it seems like the yeah those those men those those those creatures in suits They were after after each of us and it sounds like I gotta have Justin change the map Well shit I How all this is just all the shits happened so fast I don't know what I don't know what to think about any of it Don't you done this all like then propose the idea that we're pawns in something else's game There was a there was some old man that told Gary that gave Gary Daley's grandfather a book and told him to put a spell on us, I don't know I mean and then these things were chasing us and Maybe you two are pawns, you know Gary just showed us that thing that Harold Dorsey wrote and you know We saw that John Peters thing in Harold's thing. It says that you know, Maggie was trying to tip him off Do you think you know, maybe she knows more about this than she lets on or oh Certainly Maggie knows a lot more than she lets on perhaps except maybe to you Clark. I mean, I don't Whether or not we believe everything she said I think I've told you everything that she told me that there's the possibility now that It's either not the Maggie that we knew or it's it is a Maggie We knew and she maybe hurt the one that we didn't know or I don't know. I don't know what's going on now I think we may need to get a hold of her before we go to Confront Kane. I don't even know what we're gonna do about that. We've certainly got a lot to think about Let's just do one thing at a time. There's a giant spider on my keyboard right now Yeah, John rolls his eyes your keyboard a Spider on your keyboard. I've never heard of that one before Well, it's do any of y'all have any money on you right now. I got three dollars How about we wage your three dollars apiece on what on ourselves being the same Well, I if I think it might be all three of us or I don't care if it's me or you or Clark or all of Us but it is me. So sure. I'll bet my three dollars About it Clark, it's just three dollars. Just a friendly little wager. I mean, I don't want to bet against saving the world Is that the bet we're making that now now the bet is that you'll save the world, but it's three dollars It's just you know It's not gonna feel too bad when you both, you know have given me six dollars That'll Be nine dollars. Yeah, I mean sure. Yeah, sure. Oh, I guess I'll bet on it Hey, I'll race you do to the end of the tunnel. Yeah, I think I see I don't know what time of day it is, but I think I see the light up there if it is daytime Bet you can't beat me. I've start sprinting. I don't think Clark is gonna race John races All right, roll athletics the two of you John Lee petty more the third than Keith Vigna are racing down this very narrow pathway. Yeah, which is a 25 as you guys are racing John Lee petty more you are a little bit behind because as you're saying like let's race keeping it just like took off and started sprinting and you chase after him And right when you're about to take the lead from him He trips over his own feet and lands face-first In the sewage just off to the left of the right side of this path That was confusing and lands face-first in the sewage in this little Small pathway that goes down the middle of this tunnel that you're in John just breezes past and raises both his arms in the air He just won the fucking Boston Marathon and both of your hands are now lit by sunlight That is coming in from a drain a storm drain. You're the it now and As I as I casually walk up to the point that Keith fell in I tried and offer a hand to help him out of There I stand up just the entire front side of me is covered and just thick green and brown Goo and I open my eyes and like you can just see my eyes are the only thing that aren't just covered in that color and Clark What do I do Grab Clark's hand And it kind of squids I try to like walk out of the middle and yeah, it's just like squeezing out of my shoes and Turn around and see this and I have to like suppress a strong Samaritan urge to mercy kill them both Let's go ahead and get some Constitution rolls for for how vile this is Keith you're at a negative 40 on this roll for being the one who fell in I have a plus 10 for my robot abilities At a negative 40, I would have 30 and I just rolled at 31 Brings me up to 70, but I rolled a 75. Oof. What'd you give me negative 20 for having it all over your hand? I pass a 72 on a 95 All right, 80 Clark is the only one who is not just like fully Wretching right now and the other two of you you're gonna take a negative 20 on all rolls until you can Figure out a way to alleviate this situation. So your abs are just like overkill working themselves because of how I like get near the storm drain. I take my shirt off and I try to use the Backside of it that's not like covered in stuff and try to like wipe my arms off a little bit and wipe my face and then I walk up to Keith's clean back and Yeah, so now I'm I'm shirtless my face has less goo my arms have less goo My hair's like matted on my face because of that and then I've got my big shorts on and you have John's vomit all over and I as I take a couple more steps, I realize that my Shoes are just soaked. So I go ahead and take my shoes and socks off to all right going barefoot That may be an issue if you need to step on stuff on spikes Role-playing baby Didn't suspect my knife floor You wanted to have a race did you I'm gonna go pee. Okay The fucking echo and your cavernous living room it that's perfect Keith vigna as you look up out of this storm drain You see the neighborhood that surrounds beans pond You can't quite see into the pond where the water is from this angle, but you know exactly where you are guys I think we're we're near Maggie's do you see smoldering remains of a house? I Can only smell one thing Guys take a look. I think we're here and then I pull my phone out and Type in something into my phone minimally toxic, okay Yeah, you probably probably don't want to use that phone again to get around some Clorox whaps though Yeah, I'll wash off in the pond when you say that you'll wash off in the pond you immediately remember your conversation with Claire Blankenship. Oh, yeah, there ain't no water in the pond. Do you guys want to crawl out first? So you don't have to you know, crawl through All this Clark happily takes him up on that. Yeah, we'll go and we'll go and order of soil I guess least the most I need everyone to roll to take out their headphones Power huh Yeah Fail 96. Wait, what is it's a negative what for my rules? You're a negative 20. I pass an 18 60 fail 87 on a 30. Okay Thomas and Luke take off your headphones Oh Clark as you crawl out when you stand you can see that beans pond has been completely emptied of its contents and There's just this muddy basin there in the middle of this little like Neighborhood where these streets kind of cross and in the middle of this pond right next to a mostly buried metal door in the ground you see a Tank of fish to the brim just teeming and inside there is a gaunt little boy and he is Drowning and he is desperately trying to stay afloat But there's so many fish in this tank that they seem to be keeping him down how far away from all this Are we? okay, so literally you're on one side of the street when you when you get up and the pond is on the other side of the street across from you and Then the pond starts what like 10 yards past the other side of the street And so the middle of the pond is probably 15 yards past that So the middle where this is happening is about 25 yards away, okay, so yeah beans pond is not very big It's just like a no like a little little water hole, you know here and there it kind of mushrooms It's bigger at the top than it is at the bottom. Okay, and you can take your headphones off Cool Thomas as John Lee Pettymore climbs up out of this you see that across the street from where you are is beans pond and In the very middle of beans pond, which is now a muddy basin sans water sans fish Just mud and in the very center there is a mostly buried metal door in the ground and Standing there right next to it is Pastor Adam Kane Wearing an old motorcycle helmet that seems to have some weird tubes and you can kind of see that the red light is Lit on it John draws his gun and tells him to take the helmet off Oh Luke yes, as you crawl out you're just scraping this Disgusting refuse on to the side of the concrete as you drag your way out and it's kind of like building up you know as you pull yourself out and When you kind of stand up you see that across the street is beans pond, but there's no water There's no fish just as you expected But what you didn't really expect is to see you know in the very middle there's a mostly buried metal door in the ground and Sitting right next to it is an old motorcycle helmet With strange tubes and the light on it is green Oh And as soon as you're all standing up there John Lee Pettymore the third pulls his gun and hollers take off the helmet Take it off now. What would help would help with John? Who's wearing a helmet Adam Pastor Kane? What he's standing on the door? I don't there's no there's nobody there John There's like there's a kid who's floundering over there in that tank of fish right there. What do you talk? Well, no fish. There's just the helmets near the door on Adam Kane What clearly you two are not savior material and I pulled the trigger roll firearms three you fire and Joe Luke take your headphones off Thomas when John Lee Pettymore fires aims true world damage rolled e10 eight immediately let me roll Constitution Pastor Adam Kane falls backwards and the helmet flies off of his head into the mud behind him and he lays Motionless on the ground right next to the metal door that is mostly buried in the ground I run up to administer first aid. Okay, John begins running into beans pond Rolled dexterity for me 43 on a 45. Oh, yeah so as you kind of like get up to the edge you see it's just mud slide kind of down and You can put your feet wide enough apart to kind of balance as you kind of slide down into where the bottom of the pond was and You run up to administer first aid Oh Clark Bishop you see John Lee Pettymore fire his weapon into this tank and You see a lot less Movement from inside only the fish are going crazy and you see the water begins turning red Okay, Clark. What do you do? I'm running up to get a better look at what's what's Following John I'm following John I think right and he run in in the same direction that I would want to be running Absolutely, go ahead and roll a dexterity to try to like get into the bottom of the pond without slipping and falling. I Pass a 25 on a 60. All righty I John Lee Pettymore fires his weapon hits one of the tubes on this old motorcycle helmet the tube explodes just this and Then he runs into the base and slides down the side and then Clark Bishop follows right behind him. I run after them To Amazing go ahead and roll dexterity as well at a negative 20 as you're sliding down You can see this mud. It just kind of looks like the refuse that is all over you I gotta check my decks minus 20 to see if I pass Shirtless you have these giant. Oh nice. Okay, so I have 50 decks minus 20 is 30 and I rolled 79 I Had to do some math in my head But I fail Keith vignette eat shit as he's trying to get into this pond slips falls face forward into the mud and begins slowly sliding down the pond wall as the other two make their way into the very center and Immediately shots begin firing from either side of you Keith vignette You're face down in this mud You can feel yourself kind of sliding forward and then all of a sudden you feel a bullet Pierce into your ribs on your left side and you don't know whether it went all the way through but breathing becomes Extremely difficult as you take seven damage Shit Except you can't really breathe in too much because it's just mud all up in your face spot and shit Clark Bishop, it's your turn. What do you do? Clark wants to run up to The tank that I see and try and put myself between it and one of the you said it was coming from both sides Right the shooters. Yep, put the tank between one and another shooter and try to return fire from where I think it's coming from Okay roll search To see if you can figure out where these shots are coming from not alert news 49 on us 20 for search. What's your alertness 70? Oh, man, your alertness is so much better than your search No, that'll play that'll play alertness would come in here because you're focused on doing something else and the shots are ringing out so you can kind of immediately see that there is a privacy fence and You see that there's a gun being held just like over the fence. That's just like firing. What do you do? I would like to try and fire at where I see the hand coming from I would be aiming for center mass if I could picture a person standing behind it through the fence. Okay, roll firearms. I Pass 47 on an 80. Okay, then roll a detentive damage. We'll subtract two for fence cover. We'll subtract one It's just a wooden fence Three okay minus one is two and you hear a yelp come out from that side a female voice screams out in pain John Lee Pettymore the third. What are you doing slowly realizing that if Adam Kane was wearing the helmet and Had already swapped that I might have just shot someone dear to me What if even he swapped drew out of Carrie Paige's body into his body and he's in Carrie Paige's bodies Anyway, I'm running up to I'm running up to the person I just shot and you you made it their last round So what are you doing you your goal was to get first aid on to this person? But shots began ringing out you can change what you were doing if you want or you can continue trying to do first aid I don't have a great first aid. Can I try to persuade them to first aid their selves? Yeah, he is still conscious oh no, he is unconscious he failed his constitution check I'd like to persuade him to become conscious When When I see Clark Shoot the person behind the fence or return fire in that direction I spin around the other direction and try to see where the other fire is coming from and I've got I've got both John's gun Man what a episode Title 90 on a 60 It's not the kind of episode title you typically want but a 90 on a 60 is an equivalent of what you tried to say With your words and so it's your firing with both John's gun Neither one hits as your oh as you're trying to figure out where it came from where you fuck. Sorry You know, I just looking without you're just looking you cannot figure out where this these shots are coming from from the other side I fire a couple impotent shots into the air just to try to intimidate them That is the John Lee petty more way Keith Vigna. What are you doing? I want to ask you a question real quick I'm Zach. You can ask me a question at any time I guess they already know about that. I'm like part robot or whatever, but Would that have had any effect on when I got shot or was that I don't remember well mechanically Unfortunately, we didn't make that a thing which seems like it should have been it's probably doesn't matter I could have done better. But here we are. Okay Okay, so I was shot in the left side, right? Yeah, correct I like sit up or like sit on my butt. I wipe all the mud off my face and I blow the mud out of both my nostrils and then I shove my finger up my nose and get a little bump do you have on your character sheet what the Improvement is for doing that it has varied. Yeah, it was willpower based, but we weren't we're not really If you lose 10 luck, then I'll let you go ahead and make an action this turn. How about that? Okay, I'll Lose my 10 luck that I made the other day And I just want to sprint back up the wall of the not pool Absolutely Since I got shot in the left side. I want to like look over to that direction Is that where Clark is shooting at? I was picturing in my head that I was shooting to the right because that was where the tank kind of was Like I would put myself shooting over it to the right. Yeah, he was shooting the right So John was shooting up in the air, but he was looking left. I'm gonna draw a quick map real quick Keith you got hit from the left side, which is the side that John is kind of looking for someone on that side. So I want to turn around run up the wall of the pond and So that at that point I'll be on my right look over to the right and do I see any anybody or any? first off go ahead and roll a Dexterity or athletics to get back up without slipping at a negative 20 still fail So as you're trying to slide back up, you're kind of looking off to the right But you can't get your grip on this mud for long enough to be able to keep your head straight especially with this deep pain coming in your side and shots begin firing off once more as The shots fire off. None of you get hit Clark One of the bullets flies right by your ear and the other ones are all hitting the mud right next to Keith Vigna Clark Bishop, it's your turn is the person behind the fence still shooting Yes, I'm gonna shoot again. I want them to stop shooting Roll it up, baby Pass 23 on an 80 roll a d10 a Two okay fence is still in the way so you kind of aim low and you There that was a weird noise it wasn't the correct noise, sorry, okay, that was an alarming noise. Yeah Specifically wasn't Drew's voice, please. No Okay, John Lee Pettymore, what are you doing since they kept firing on us? have I now identified where the fire on the left is coming from if you roll a search or an alertness with a Plus 20 since they've done been firing she haven't teen Yeah, you actually see that there is someone hiding behind a grill in someone's backyard There's no privacy fence on this backyard and on their deck There's a little propane grill and there's someone hiding right behind it and they keep poking up and firing I'd like to fire back anything cool. This is the end of your stakeout, buddy Plus 20 on the firearms check 29 roll a d10 for damage 3 I rolled the tens one Will you give me the 30? You fire and you hear a man's voice cry out and he's like Keith Vigna, what are you doing stuff? I'm gonna try to get out of the Pond again, and yeah, you'll be able to make it out on this turn Okay, I do that and then when I hear John yell I want to look over and can I see the guy too or do I need to roll a check? No Now the John has shot him and he's kind of shown himself both people have been shot and you guys kind of know where they At least were last round at the beginning I'm going to pull my gun out and run towards the grill and I'm gonna fire as I'm running Go ahead and roll a negative 20 a 9 So yeah, I'd be 10 for damage 6 yeah, I'll do Cool as you're running you're kind of like slipping on the mud a little bit and you're smelling all of this shit and mud that's just Covering you at this point and you fire and you hit this dude as he's like laying on the ground John hit him He kind of fell over and you fire you hit him right in the torso and he kind of rolls over and he's facing you and you see at this point Asher little who is one of the parents of Aiden and Alice little who went missing a couple days ago and you see that he has Laser faded jeans that are bedazzled and he's wearing a long-sleeve shirt that is skin tight to his Crossfit body and the front of the shirt has a picture of his children Aiden and Alice who are twin nine-year-olds and he is wearing a fair amount of makeup and he is rocking some Yeezys and he is crying out in pain and You don't know if he's gonna be able to get back up, but he is not Unconscious yet. Was he one of the guys in one of the cars or trucks? That was the Impala that was coming after you guys that had a refrigerator Yeah, he was driving that longs to the littles and you recognize the two of them from driving it and they are members of the first Church of contention and now the first Creek family of contention from behind the fence the gun raises again just fires Aimlessly hitting the mud around you but asher little Mustering all this strength like like the end of that Keanu Reeves Patrick Shweezy movie But instead of moving to fire up into the air. He just fires directly at Keith Vigna and he hits him There's seven more damage. Oh Fuck Yeah, you're just out in the open yeah, I'm at 10 health at this point you're 24 total Yep, holy shit when you went from 17 down to 10 he hits you in the hip and you feel it hit the bone and You think it might have cracked as you begin like limping? Toward him in that direction and you you're just oh my you Real crunch, you know, you you don't feel good. It's pain I've never been shot by a gun, but my drugs helped me any with that pain. No, okay Okay, and an adrenaline doesn't help them with the pain. Oh, yeah. Okay. Yeah sure. Yeah You've been shot twice once in the ribs once in the hip and you're still standing. So yeah fucking helps There we go, okay Again, I'm just gonna continue limping as fast as I can at him Clark Bishop. You're up and as this round begins Clark Bishop, there is no tank here There are no fish here and John Lee Pettymore the body that is right next to you not there the only thing the two of you see on the ground is Is this metal door that is mostly buried Looks completely sealed and it says here lies the beans scientists beyond measure Saviors of the world god damn it if he's the fucking Savior Clark Bishop, what do you do seeing the fish tank disappear kind of throws me, but I'm yelling back at Keith Keith They're shooting at you get down and I would like to try and see if I could pry that door open Like that's the only thing I could find cover if I could get that door open I'm trying to write open as you try to find any sort of crease or anything. There's nothing There's no handle on this door. There's no hinges on this door It almost doesn't even look like a door other than the fact that that's how I've described it so far Like An impassable metal plate yeah, almost like Yeah, an impassable metal plate. I couldn't have said it better myself. I'll just edit out you saying it and then I'll say it perfect Listeners may not know but I've come up with the entire story and plot of Podcast as we go and I just generously let Zach edit that out. I Hope he doesn't accidentally leave this one in this time He's a promise and he would definitely knows exactly what's going on at all times 100% command of the story the characters the events as they have transpired thus far I'm all over it, baby Clark as you're trying to figure out how to open this door you look up and you see that there is no fish tank Whatsoever in front of you roll sanity Yeah, baby, it's a 70 that's a fail over my power Oh my god, Zach on the fucking webcam just started like Curling his fingers like a super when he heard that Joe had rolled over his power What do I lose you just lose one sanity, but you also lose your shit So Clark was going to hit the deck since he doesn't have any cover But now he's gonna stand up like nothing could hurt him and charge the person behind the fence Shooting the whole way as he runs so we'll go negative 20 for blinding anger on the firearms check as you make your way up out of the muddy basin that you have found yourself in a bowl of slop I pass a 52 on a 60 nice roll a d10 6 you fire in and you actually have knocked away enough of this fence at this point that You see a woman who is wearing a skin tight t-shirt that has two children's faces On it and you recognize these two children as Aiden and Alice little gonna sexualize a grieving mother. I wasn't going to What just happened skin tight t-shirt, oh, that's all that it takes for you They do CrossFit man, I don't know what to tell you I am aroused and offended Typical And you hit what is very likely in your mind Avery little and she falls backward and You just hear this moaning. How about that? Do you like that Thomas? From behind the fence that's been blown away John Lee Pettymore, it's your turn rule the body that was once there is no longer. I need you to roll sanity He's gonna freak out but that's also a huge relief to him 13 pass Okay, you don't need to freak out and you don't need to lose in the sanity you are extremely relieved that you didn't shoot What might have been a person is Asher still firing? Yeah, and he's a he's actually he's firing at Keith vignette and he's falling I fire at Asher go ahead and roll that firearms check 16 well d10 for damage to mmm As You fire it's not enough to take him down as blood splatters on the concrete behind him of this This little back deck that he's on but his eyes are wide open and his aim is still Directed at Keith vigna who is slowly trudging toward him and Keith vigna It is your turn and it is likely an important one Can I just say something guys say something that you're allowed to it's a podcast There's only four of us you got no, you know when Joe and I Farcically disappeared these children, you know a very a very light-hearted Goofy Almost whimsical. Yeah cartoonish disappearance Mary Poppins esque. I thought that'd be the last we heard of it. I didn't realize There would be these kind of consequences angry citizenry angry parents Didn't really think anybody would miss the kids while this shit was going down, but I yeah I just want to say admire here Just kidding, I'll probably amp it up Keith vigna. What are you doing? The pain is starting to get to me. So I am gonna like get down on my knees and Like Get down on my knees and aim at Asher and fire Adam shirtless he's covered in all sorts of Hey Luke yeah, what are you doing, man? I just tell you I'm on oh shit. I Shot him Tell you to roll firearms 69 Don't don't touch him. Don't move your hands. Don't move your hands. Don't move your hands put the other one up in the air Are you gonna run in there and check? Yes, I am Guys if he if he moves his hands, you tell me we're on him Luke move your hands Don't need to I did it don't have to lie to us. He's not in the room. Holy fucking shit. It's a goddamn 69 I was about to actually scream, but then I remember my girlfriend went to bed and was like, please don't scream But it was a 69, honey She can't argue with that, right She gets it what are we talking about? Just how I told my girlfriend I wouldn't scream during this session and I really wanted to win the girl Would you confirm that? Taylor's asleep. So I thought you're talking about me running through the house Saying I could be like, well, it's not as bad as what's act Exactly. Can you imagine being married to that monster? Okay, so Keith do you want to shoot this dude dead? Do you want to keep him alive or do you want to hit the propane tank? Okay. Yeah, I want to kill him. I want to hit him actually fuck it. I want to hit the propane tank These both have consequences. I'm sure Yeah, we stopped whose house is this stop getting shot It's season two you guys are just playing citizens in contention and then all of a sudden Okay, so I dropped down on my knees and I like have Asher in my sights But I just noticed the propane tank that's right next to him under the grill. I aim a little bit left Fire a couple rounds the propane tank explodes and I say soy beans puto That's actually dope that means I am beans bitch It's also a cross-lingual soybeans, but Okay, that was incredible take ten look back sweet, thanks Did you actually roll for any of that that was the 69 that was my 69 That's why he's allowed to do whatever he wants After it explodes I Look down into the pond and want to start heading towards those guys. Okay. Yeah for sure I just assumed that the fiery explosion killed him it did Tight, I knew that already though. I didn't even have to see it So Keith you don't even look behind you as this grill explodes throwing the body of Asher little through the backsliding glass door of this home as it glass shatters and Your eyes are set at the bottom of the pond but above that Clark Bishop is walking up the other side and Makes his way to the fence and as you're trying to look through where you've been shooting through the fence and these holes that you've made The person you've been aiming at seems to have crawled out of view. What do you do? Have I got my eyes out? Am I still under that over the power role? Have you got? Yaws out Thomas you into it No Don't like any of you needlessly sexualized sexualized in this And yes, you are you are done Clark with your yeah. Yes. I kind of want to just yell Stop stop shooting. I'll stop shooting. Stop shooting and I'll stop shooting. Do I get any you just hear? Prayer. Yes. Thank you Jesus. Oh god. Yes no, and there's times like these where retribution is the only necessary thing in the eyes of those who are light in the Lord and To pervade the evil of this world We must desecrate the bodies of those who are succumbing to the pleasures of this earth Can I strafe left and right around that hole to try and get an angle that I can see? Yeah, as you strafe through the hole and see her she is on the ground directly aimed up at you She'd readied in action with a successful firearms check and she fires Directly through the hole at you and rolled a nine For Damage For damage, yeah, what were you Alan hit point? I'm at 20 Okay, so you go down to a well, I'm sorry. I'm at 26. I was full goodness gracious So you go down to 15 quick math. That's uh, you do that's 11 yeah, I would be not that you go down to 17 and That's slow math. Well quick math isn't necessarily good First math First math Beth math. Oh, that's First math best math hard to say first math best math All right, so we've got a new math best math. Yeah, say it faster though first math best math first math best math Well, I shouldn't be in radio Clark you got hit We've it's a wall for the radio so Clark gets hit directly in the shoulder and you just feel the blow back through and It's your turn. I want to shoot her a return fire. I want to return fire. She just shot me. I wanna shoot her roll firearms I pass a 36 on an 8k roll damage Fuck a three. Yeah, that'll extinguish her life. So As you put out this fire of a human being John John Lee Pettymore comes up behind and surveys the scene and says Ashers to ashers dust to dust And Avery's to Avery's I think mine was better Kind of why I think I'm the savior I'm running over to him And I'm like guys did you hear what I said, did you hear what I said when I shot it I Got him. Yeah, you were said you were talking about soybeans. Yeah, it's Spanish. Did you hear my thing about Asher's to Asher's? Yeah, that was really good, too. Thanks So did you did you destroy the helmet Oh When you shot it Clark is looking puzzled at you But I never I'm there was never a helmet guys Right down there and I point when you look down you see no helmet and I need you to roll a sanity. Oh good 72 so over my power and Fail and how many and how many do I lose just one? Okay, I hit my breaking point I Look go ahead and roll a D 100 and for each time you roll it out of three times I will tell you what your option of a mania will be from the table 10 from Call of Cthulhu 7th edition called Sample mania is okay. First roll is a 14 14 is going to be a rhythm a Rith arith mania obsessive preoccupation with numbers Okay, second one's 29 29 is going to be color o mania obsession with a specific color and 57 and 57 is icon o mania obsession with icons or portraits. I'll go with that one Yeah, do you still have that picture? I do indeed. Yep, that'll that'll help. Okay, cool So As Keith Vigna looks at the helmet and Clark Bishop's like there's never a helmet there did One of you took when he took the helmet when he took the helmet who took Keith There was never a helmet there wouldn't help. I saw I saw John shoot the helmet Did did you guys take my picture too? Did you did you take that photo and I have to start searching my pockets? it's in my back pocket and I look at it and I like Hide it from him Keith. This is mine. This is mine Keith. Who's who's in the picture right now? It's still me still me milder grave gave us that picture. We couldn't have taken it. No, no I'm it like took it from me. Oh, I've still got it. What what's what's the door? Say fucking he's gonna find out just fucking show it says the beans thing. All right, it says the beans thing Here here lies the beans it's safe saviors plural of the world. I want to run down and read it for myself everybody roll power power Pass 31 on the city. I got another nine. I pass a 45 on a 60 the door failed Clark Bishop Keith Vigna and John Lee Pettymore you all won the power contest this time And you each feel a loosening of some external forces grip on your perception And the scene, you know and a single blink has changed completely beans pond is encircled entirely by the Six-story tall wall of water and the three of you on the inside of the foul-smelling floating moat Clark and John this unnatural feat of nonsense is right behind you and you can see ice forming on the water always broken immediately by one of the many fish hopping out sideways and plopping back in with the force of this horizontal gravity Keith begins running down into the muddy basin to see the engraving on this impassable metal plate careful not to slip and fall face first in the mud again But across the pond on the other bank is a whole situation Casey Kristoff the mullet rocking janitor of the first Church of contention holds a pistol to the back of Carrie Paige's head who is Blindfolded and on her knees and right next to them is Pastor Adam Cain Wearing the strange-looking motorcycle helmet red light lit and he is driving the four-wheeler About to drop into this former pond and he's aiming straight for Keith Strapped to the back of the four-wheeler you found an a-plus storage crashed in the woods and had drew fix up all nice Strapped in behind Big Daddy Cain is the radio with the odd glass tubes and its green light is lit And sitting atop this unnatural radio claws holding on for dear life is an extremely determined black cat Try Yeah", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 5.4, "text": " Welcome my human babies.
