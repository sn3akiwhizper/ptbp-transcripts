{"text": " Mike Smith here. Thank you again for joining us during our pledge drive this week. You've just heard Under the Mulberry Tree with Mary Ann Kellans and we're about to get into into a classic episode of our Smash It! Surprise, surprise Smash It! Not everyone around here was rooting for this show but by god it's it's really taken off. It's of course pretending to be people. An unlikely hit for 694.2 but but a hit nonetheless. I'm joined here today by Nyle Leota who... Nyle Leota Oda. Nyle Leota I'm not gonna say the last that can't be your... Nyle Leota Oda who who has come here and joined her. As you know me Mike Smith I've been at this station for 35 years ever since I graduated from community college here in contention and you know for a long time things were kind of done Mike's way but Nyle has come in with with his uh you know his big city ideas. Listeners may remember me from my show with my ex-wife over on KITI in the city. No one listens to city radio. And I'm back here in contention under some interesting circumstances but I've got a lot of great ideas to shake up the way things we do here at 694.2 PTBP. Now you're from here right Nyle? I am yes. And you were you had a you had a I understand a successful public radio career in the city. I did indeed. Until you were... until I came back to contention to bring my fantastic pieces to 694.2 PTBP. You didn't you didn't have a successful marriage advice show with your wife and then you got divorced. And then let's talk about how our listeners can support us during this pledge drive week Mike. As as you know Nyle has brought pretending to be people to our to our station and he's brought with it a something called a Patreon. Patreon.com slash pretending pod. Thanks Nyle. You're welcome Mike. You know Nyle public radio to me is it's responsible reporting twice a day you've got your morning edition and you're all things considered and then in between you know in a small town you got a lot of time for a traditional Celtic music for bluegrass for jazz we didn't have a lot of you know fancy gunplay cop shows going on in this town before you got here but then you brought us a little something called pretending to be people and people just love it. Yes Mike. Don't they Mike? I believe that grass should be green like the color of money speaking of which we've got a patreon at patreon.com slash pretending pod now I want to say some new things to bring to that patreon don't you I do there's currently a five dollar tier there and we've got some fantastic supporters at that five dollar tier currently called honorary police officers I'd like to give a quick shout out to three of those honorary police officers right now Sasha S Brian C and Jasmine J thank you all so much for listening and contributing to making sure that we can keep making PTBP at 694.2 with pretending to be people thank you very much to everyone who has supported the station and will continue to support it throughout this pledge drive so the changes let's get into those are right off the bat here first off that five dollar tier is no longer going to be called honorary police officers at five dollars you'll still get the bonus content on a monthly basis but the name has changed from honorary police officers to splashylvania fastpass holder so if I'm getting this right everyone who was currently an honorary police officer will be a splashylvania fastpass holder isn't that fun and I'm also here to introduce not only the $10 tier but also a $15 tier and a $30 tier but we're not stopping there we're also adding both a 50 and even a $100 tier to keep this sinking boat afloat you think people are gonna pay $100 for your shitty little again this is Nile Liotta Oda at 694.2 PTBP let's go ahead and introduce this first clip from an old classic episode of pretending to be people as you all know during pledge drives we like to play classic episodes of your favorite public radio content and then interrupt them incessantly to the point where they're essentially incoherent you just get a little bit and then ten minutes of two assholes talking maybe just one and now let's cut to a clip from an episode the listeners voted on as their favorite episode of pretending to be people Keith Vigna's first day the four of you the contention the four of you the contention police officers Clark Bishop John Lee Pettymore the fourth Barry Manstein and the fresh Keith Vigna are all standing in a vast empty field in front of this empty husk of a cow's corpse blood and internal organs completely missing just a future leather bag of bones and the farmer Jedediah Blechum pokes the pile of cattle skin with his cane say they've been around about there around about come down for a week now sir well someone's fucking with the cows again come down about a week what was that coming down about a week or so for about a week this is the only cow fatality that you've had or air now and he like points his cane out Vigna Vigna why don't you wait a couple days before you start asking questions yeah let the uh let the vets here take over the vets like Barry Manstein you look up and Jedediah is standing about 20 yards away from you at this point and he pokes another one you guys did you guys see these other cows see Keith if you hadn't been so busy yep and we would have noticed these other cows how many cows do we see at least a baker's dozen 13 no don't fucking say that number let's start podcast is not gonna get off the ground if you keep saying 13 and then the the farmer and his big overalls and straw hat walks back to you guys and points his cane up at the sky many lights we come down there in about two hey Victor Brown to this guy's overalls are almost as big as your pants am i right guys very very goddamn very you can always find a person's exact weakness and just hone right in on it and then pound him that's some rookie stuff you're gonna have to get used to it with Barry Manstein hanging around Keith Vigna he hikes his pants up just over his belly button well I just got I just got done with cop school in the city and uh we didn't have any bovine crime class so I'm gonna let you guys handle this what a way to make a great first impression as a matter of fact he that's that's brand new for us that's a thing we've had cow mutilations around well I mean I I usually dealt with like actual crimes in the city you know that's what actual actual crimes in the city not like you don't think animal abuse is a crime up there in the city vigna yeah it's a crime very bad doing me keep my business in charge if farm you're gonna go I've been ain't no light come down there that's goddamn right you hurt him I might as well just repeat it but I didn't because I think you heard him very clearly vigna are you taking notes on what this guy's saying this guy's smarter than you vigna fucking city cop I'm very smart and you gotta get your mam and my wife and food and whatnot as you're saying this I look at Clark and the look on my face is having no idea what this guy's saying and I look at you for help and I take a couple steps back this is on you guys maybe this is a learning situation you're fucking getting it everything's a goddamn learning situation you city slick and son of a bitch I just want to make sure that you're you're keeping your eyes on everything we do here if there's anything you can learn from us I want you to put it down in that notebook there how's your bigger understands what I'm saying you know you gotta get it over there right there that's right now sir how many of your cows lie mutilated in this field that baby doesn't jerk so yeah nile that's that's your new show that you've brought here obviously that is an hour of bluegrass we won't get each week that brings us down to approximately 12 hours of bluegrass a day which I personally think is the right amount of bluegrass for our listeners on all of the polls that we've done yeah you haven't gone down to to Joe's coffee and ask the people there what they're listening to in the morning the people at beans on beans know what I'm talking about shout out to everyone down at beans on beans and my new morning hotspot the donut hole is I haven't been downtown in 30 years since it was revitalized as are these contention businesses these are fantastic contention businesses with owners like Duncan Hole do you want a laugh line there Nile pretending to public radio is a damn I'm sorry folks public radio is a responsibility Nile it's not cheap entertainment it's not it's not cops you know it's not America's most wanted it's jazz and bluegrass damn it at least it isn't in this state it's okay intern if we could get some tissues in here for Mike I'm fine I'm fine why don't you tell us about your patreon tears absolutely I would be very excited to do that so let's wipe away some of those te ars tears and get hyped up for some new TI er s tears over on patreon.com slash pretending pod just to reiterate if you are currently pledged at $5 a month the only change is your name as a splashylvania fast pass holder you will still have access to the exclusive monthly bonus content in the form of an audio episode what happened to the title of honorary police officer you ask well we thought it was a better fit for the rewards offered in our brand-new $10 tier now patrons who pledged $10 a month become honorary police officers and will not only have access to the exclusive monthly bonus content but they will also have the opportunity to submit the name and description of an NPC and a location these submissions will be drawn at random and used in the show pretending to be people well now Nile normally we don't agree but it makes a lot of sense for the people who get to participate to be honorary police officers and for that to move to the $10 tier instead of the $5 tier thank you so much for saying that Mike it's maybe the one good idea you've ever had oh that brings joy to my heart and with joy I'd like to move on and tell you about the $15 tier at patreon.com slash pretending pod people who pledge $15 a month will join the den of sin that sounds inappropriate now Nile tell me what that is people who pledge at the $15 level will have access to a monthly live stream of the pretending to be people crew recording their patreon bonus content and that will include a hangout after for about an hour hour and a half who knows how long it could go and they'll be playing games answering questions it's going to be a bonafide uncanny hootenanny a binging shindig for those of you who want a behind-the-scenes look at the process or who'd want to kick it with the pretending to be people crew this tier is for you again that is the $15 a month tier the den of sin quick shout out to three more of our patrons who've been with us keeping this show going Jack M Garth H and will G thank you all so much for pledging yes thank you will G now back to the episode back to that episode that you all voted on is your favorite pretending to be people episode keys first day walking through this endless field of corn the four of you contention police officers Clark Bishop John Lee petty more the fourth Barry Manstein and the brand-spankin new Keith vigna you guys come across this semi truck trailer that's just sitting in the middle of this well-planned bald spot on the head that is Jedediah Blaschum's cornfield and he points his cane at it anybody dare to dig came down down he's no banger and fired I hear that I hear that buddy he kind of ribs you I rub him back vigna are you taking notes on what this guy's saying I don't understand a single goddamn word he's saying I ran down to me he looks at Clark Bishop man if we're gonna need you new guy fucking you're coming around here talking shit you see how Clark's taking perfect notes on everything he says I lean over to bury very I actually don't understand him either no idea what the fuck this guy's saying I just want vigna to feel like shit you hear a ting-tang-tang and Jedediah is just over at the back door of this semi truck trailer just like banging on it with his cane he's like guys it's not that hard to understand what this guy's saying you just look to worry banks I think we need to go in this trailer I I go up to the back of the semi truck I unlock it and before I open it up I hope it I open it up and then I step up into it and go inside Jedediah takes a minute but he likes slowly is starting to get up in and he looks back at you he's like I go over and give him a boost and I'm getting up in there also following mm-hmm so the four of you along with Jedediah blush and walk into this semi truck trailer and as soon as all of you are in there the door behind you slam shut and there's a red light that's coming from the opposite side of the trailer also this room that you're in is square it's not the size of this in my truck trailer that you saw hold on weren't we just in a oblong rectangle tractor trailer and now it's square what the fuck I never encountered this kind of weirdness vigna you show up at this goddamn job and suddenly everything goes funky well technically a ring tank a prank take a right hey let's start yeah keep thinking I'm talking about we got that long rectangular prism is still an oblong rectangular prism technically a rectangle is a square I don't know ready to get a magic Jeanette but you guys look up cool and it's completely dark in here except for the red light coming down on all of you and Oh right above your heads you see that there is what seems to be a gauge that is a red light slowly blinking and each time it blinks it is lowering so it's like a battery power pack or something that is lowering and lit in the room the only thing in this room is a pedestal with a big red button on top and the light above you with each blink is going okay I ripped the gauge out of the year you all remember gauging I was at a show one time and I was standing right behind this dude who had huge gauges and this kid just walked up with a padlock and just hooked it on this dude's ear and ran away and the guy just chased him I will fill you in on this they're not called gauges the gauge is the size of them yeah we all fucking know Keith Vigna pulls out his sidearm and shoots the thing that's beeping immediately all of your ears start ringing and nothing in the room lightwise has changed the meter is still lowering but none of you can hear anything as tinnitus takes over son of a bitch big no fuck don't fire your fucking service pistol in the closed space don't you know about goddamn Rick Shays you gave him fucking tonight I'm looking at what I just shot and I can't hear any of this I just press the button and as soon as you press the button the bar lights all the way back up and then continues to beep and is making its way back down I press the button again it goes right back up to the top and continues to go down anymore let me get onto this I push the button Barry Manstein contingent's most decorated officer my best friend and and our finest peer absolutely press that button thank you sir and best friend I'll remember you forever if you promise you'll remember me forever slap slap on that button and it goes right back up to the top continues beeping well what if hey guys what if we let the button go down to the bottom and instead of some of the bad happenings the door opens Jedidiah is at the back door just trying to open it back up and he's like Jedidiah is this not your trailer yeah so it is but you forgot okay well Clark is gonna go look at the gauge more closely is it is it demarcated in any way is it is that the right word demarcated does it have markings on it that indicate levels or numbers or anything that's a great word Joe no it is simply just like just let up the lights go back to the top and did you say it was coming out of the ceiling yes it's coming out of the ceiling can I follow it to the top and see if it runs to anything like a like a like a conduit go ahead and roll search it was it was coming out of the ceiling but then I chased it in a rant fail 81 on a 20 as you're like trying to find some sort of connection between the two you kind of trip backwards in the mostly darkness and press the button again attaboy Clark that's what I was just trying to make sure want to make sure we kept the button pressed that's all I was doing Keith Vigna looks around is there anything in this trailer no it is completely empty except for the big red button and five idiots Keith Keith you know it's your first day why don't you go ahead and press the button yeah we'll let you press this one but why don't you press that button press that button I stand there button and I grab his hand and start edging it towards I don't want to press the button but I do want to make a good impression on my new co-workers yeah so I go up to the button and I have my hand about like a couple inches away from it and I go and just press it a bunch of times each time it beeps and each time light goes right back to the top Keith we said you could press the button once can I see anything else in this room if I maybe go past the button as you pass the button you're not sure if you walking over there triggered this or if it just started but you feel your socks are wet and looking down you can't quite tell if it's the red from the light or whether the liquid is red that is slowly rising in this room and you're all stepping in a red viscous liquid no hell welcome back welcome back to six nine four point two PT BP why don't you think now Nile Liotta Oda I'm here with my co-host for the day Mike Smith and we're joining I'm your host you're you're my co-host this is that's right yeah and we're joined now by Floyd Grant our late night DJ here at six nine four point two PT BP you're listening to the pledge drive over on patreon.com slash pretending pod Floyd how's it going today thanks for having me Nile and Mike it's good to see ya obviously who Floyd now it's probably a little earlier than you're used to being here I reckon there's a whole bunch of your audience that don't even know who I am haha yeah hey you know they tend to they tend to they tend to hit the sack early it can get pretty lonely here being here that late I hear you guys pitter-pattering outside the door but nobody ever comes in to say hey we're not here when you're here I've literally never been here oh I hear you're no easy it's very anti public radio ethos the spirit of the effort we're all putting into this but Niles only here from nine to five well I guess it's the janitor crew or something the janitor crew I believe we had to cut due to costs so the trash is always empty every time I'm in here I'll just figure that's the janitor crew and the floors are all sopping wet and oh well you can tell they're brushing their mops against the walls there's scratches all over the walls I try and if I see him exterminators must have been slacking on the job or something I don't what do you mean like a creatures getting in at night or it's here all the time you're the only creature that gets in here at night buddy from the hours of seven to nine obviously they do call me the creature I think you should have gotten the memo that we do no longer have trash service you are supposed to be taking your own trash out each night I haven't I haven't been is but it's so well it's all family here so somebody's probably picking up your slack now why don't you tell us about your little program you got now thank you Mike the next tier I want to talk about is at the $30 level

patreon.com slash pretending pod I am so delighted to announce our next tier which is at the $50 level patrons who pledge $50 a month will join the first Church of contention youth group after six months of maintaining this pledge members of the first Church of contingent youth group will play in a homebrewed Delta green one shot handled by Zach from pretending to be people on roll 20 along with three other patrons now let's get to some shoutouts for some of our current patrons hello there to Torin Linus B and Sam T thank you all so much for pledging your support to PT BP 6 9 4.2 and pretending to be people yes thank you Sam T for supporting you know this new little show that's on our our radio station instead of every other thing we put out for you 24 hours a day that that's got a that's got a strong sound to it I like I like that fella now Floyd you were talking about something strange going on here in the station do you want to elaborate on that for our listeners here well it just seems to me we don't want Mike if you interrupt him for once do we want listeners knowing about I think that the listeners would be very glad to know that they are every dollar you donate to this station will go to an unhaunted radio station it's not haunted like people are saying well we might be able to afford a janitorial staff if we get enough money and some of these issues might be resolved you said the floors were wet it's it's told me for a loop here that you're telling me that the the janitors are not doing their jobs lately because they're gone there we we had to fire them because of no money but it's not haunted but everything is so it's like they spilled their mop buckets in some of the carpets here and there and the floors are shiny and bright like they've been picked clean you are a late-night DJ maybe some of your you know exuberant habits between the hours of seven and nine that's the tornado drill that's just the the local tornado drill sirens those happen randomly throughout the day at all times that did not sound like a no no no no now you see at 8 a.m. is it on top of the station they do the tornado siren drills at Wednesdays at 8 a.m. and then also just randomly throughout the week and now back to our classic fan favorite episode of pretending to be people entitled can I just say before before we get back to your nonsense it is unconscionable to suggest that the radio station is haunted by any kind of those kinds of assumptions might be your downfall Mike back to the episode Keith's first day Lindsay Manstein looks down the barrel of their gun at this little green man Ames pulls the trigger roll firearms hell yeah that's a crit success baby no way oh shit okay roll 2d 10 for damage the same thing you just rolled fuck off I got another another crit success 22 22 so actually we're poor damage is weirdly enough when you fire a bullet into this tiny little green man you just obliterate him but looking out all around the first Church of contention sanctuary you see you've got 45 more to go exactly I look over at Keith big na big na sack up let's do this as soon as I hear that I pull the shotgun off of my back you fight four times yeah okay into the crowd of alien okay have Keith roll firearms at a negative negative 40 I've got a 70 within that's a fail all right so you just blast in and they're all like literally like jumping and four of them that you aim at actually each time you aim at one they jump on to the top head of the one next to them and then like the next one you aim at jumps on top of the second one and they create this like wizard staff of small green alien man so I had stand I hit none of them and each time they jump on top of each other they're like and then when they're all on top they like pogo stick away I have unloaded my shotgun and hit no one and therefore it's no longer your turn and so yeah I take my time to put some more shotgun shells and not pay attention to where they're going John Lee Pettymore what are you doing John gets down on one knee oh yeah and he he takes his he takes his gun and he he aims his service pistol at each one of those four little fucking brains on that pogo stick and he's like die you alien scum and he pulls the trigger firearms baby that's a crit success holy shit okay that'll take out three of them so as they're like pogoing away from you you take out the top three and all of their like green splatter just like falls into the baptism pool at the top of the like sanctuary on the other side of the podium where every Sunday pastor Adam Kane gives his sermons and with that it is all of the aliens turn and they all start at the same time and it grows and grows and the power sends a sound wave like a shock through all of your bodies I need everyone to roll power I pass a 6 on a 60 oh nice I pass a 12 on a 50 well done I pass a 28 on a 65 rare I fail a 58 on a 50 medium rare you dumb dumb so in that exact moment Lindsey Manstein you feel your brain begin to compress and like pulse you lose let's roll of dice six damage as you feel liquid come out of your left and right ears and you feel up there you feel up your face and there's blood just dripping from your ears I look at Clark and I'm like Clark I don't feel so good Clark Bishop it's your turn I want to line up a shot that takes out as many of them in a row as I can straight through these squishy gringo I like that like they're still stacked on top of each other not all of the room is full of these guys yeah full of little fellas angles all right so roll intelligence to find the right angle to shoot at first I pass a 52 on a 55 all right now roll firearms straight up and down to take out as many of them as possible I don't know I think it kind of added to the whole podcast Zach that's a 22 oh my god he's not even lying about our special issue living in some sort of weird gravity in this room like okay roll 2d 10 a 9 and a 3 holy shit okay so 12 knock out three of them so you've got this lineup of three of them in your sights there's like one on a pew one on the lectern and then one hanging from a the Christian flag you know have you guys ever seen the Christian flag I've seen the methodist flag not the Christian flag every church that I like went to growing up had the American flag right next to the Christian flag a very very strange choice of idols so one is hanging down and the flag just bus and like it's almost like a like an ink package and ink cartridge from like a money bag that you would steal a robbing and it just banking bus this like green guck all over the flag and as soon as the flag has been tarnished you see the stained glass at the very front of the sanctuary just erupts into tiny tiny little particles of different colored glass all making up some fucked up white Jesus holding a lamb and it just dissipates into nothing as this massive version of these tiny little green men that you've seen all over here this one stands at least two stories tall and it lowers its head to crawl into the sanctuary of the first church of contention welcome back to the pledge drive here on six nine four point two
