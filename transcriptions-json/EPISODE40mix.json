{"text": " Listen here y'all, listen real close, closer, come on don't be scared, snuggle on up with your little wolfy boy, prepare to be comforted by the sounds of your favorite cuddle bug wolf the dog, broadcasting live from 694.2 PTBP the radio station of your dreams baby. This week's howlin with wolf comes from atj51ropa on twitter who tagged at pretending pod in one of them their tweets, wow what a thoughtful act of support on a social media platform that wolf definitely knows how to use without help, thanks my baby, they write, hey wolf my dog, been missing your dulcet tones since I moved from contention to the city, it was a real pleasant surprise to hear your pirate station up and running, can you give a shout out to my lady still living in contention, I haven't heard from her in a couple days so I think she must be mad at me, why else won't she return my calls, Bethany Ann Laberbarra if you're listening, I love you, now that I think about it, no one from contention has returned my calls, huh from JR pronounced JR not Jr from twitter slash the city, well JR not Jr I once had me a little wolfy guy who would never return my calls, the only thing that got her attention was when I threw a brick covered in crawdad grease through her window in the dead of night, she finally started talking to me though it may have been to scream at me that she was calling the police, so Bethany Ann return JR not Jr's calls won't you, if you don't we'll have to assume something bad is going down in contention that would prevent true love from blossoming, speaking of bad shit going down that prevents any of us from finding true happiness, this is the news, last time our intrepid former police officers entered the glass family compound and took a strange elevator meeting a nice old lady and her spell performing friends on the way down to some kind of massive dank aquatic interrogation chamber, on metal catwalks above murky green water they found Francis beans interrogating Kathy Piston while lowering George Piston into the foul aquarium, unsurprisingly a bit of a tussle ensued, also unsurprisingly Keith Vigna found his way into the water, but as he was climbing up George Piston's body to escape from an unknown creature in the depths that very beast swallowed the two of them and dove back into the hideous and opaque pool below, oh no y'all that can't be good can it, oh well I have a note here from my producer, seems like back in

patreon listeners you can subscribe for five dollars a month or up and you get to you get to vote him off as much as you want no that sucks we can't chibaka him without a uh is he hon or luke he'd be luke right it's fitting damn it you just wanted to be on solo but well i'm not on solo but john lee pettimore is compared to keith vigna well i'm not han solo i'm not i'm no han solo i'm not a hero i'm just a guy on a role-playing podcast don't call me a hero okay i'll keep that in my fine i'm a hero don't make me sing don't rub my face in it you know my heroic rugged face and you can see that heroic rugged face on our instagram at pretending pod woof let's dive into it while we on that jovial note yeah keith dived into it those murky black waters from which he'll never return clark bishop john lee pettimore and francis beans are standing on a recently made wet catwalk as the water begins to calm in front of them you guys see a couple bubbles rise to the top keith keith silence prisoner don't speak about your captors in such a familiar tone mr vigna that's that's better what is francis doing she is standing perfectly still staring at the water along with you guys and then she looks over at you i guess let's just fucking hang this guy up and we can torture him or you know interrogate him at like the same time yeah sure all right why don't you get that hook ready and i'll get him ready okay so she jumps and grabs on to the rope and swings across to the other side of the catwalk the chain yes sorry the chain she grabs on to this wet mossy covered chain and swings across to the other side and then walks toward you guys with the chain with the fish hook on the end of it and she begins walking toward you what do you do i walk around the other side away from her stop being so squirrely prisoner as she's approaching with the fish hook like she's stretching the chain out behind her right like hauling it i want to try to like sneak attack her and just shove the hook right into her face okay let's go ahead and i want to be like here let me let me see that pass it here and then i just want to shove it straight up through her brain all right let's do a melee contest go ahead and roll uh melee combat for me i have okay so we've got unarmed combat and melee weapons yes all right this would be a melee weapon yeah okay gotcha glad i didn't put any points in that yay ten yeah uh she rolled a 12. fuck yeah oh damn it so as you move to grab this and basically attack her with it she gets the jump on you and immediately turns it around and shoves it into your let's see what damage would this be let's call it a d8 i mean can i try to dodge no you failed the competition against her and she shoves it directly into your shoulder and the fish hook goes and you can feel it break into the metal underneath your skin and then push through the metal that is just on the other side of your skin as it goes into your shoulder what's that put your hit points at what did she roll six damage uh that puts me at 13. all righty and as she does that it is clark bishop's turn can i try and kick her and push her or shove her into the water that she's standing there absolutely hold on i'd like to persuade her again that'll be unarmed combat are we good no what are you doing what are you doing are you fucking with me right now no no you're not yet not yet so lick thought we called his name and so he came barging into the wow it was your scream i met uh when you get the hook yeah it was i didn't scream you just screamed the thing that hurt you it's a strange pronunciation but it got his attention i am unarmed combating her to push her into the water absolutely go ahead and roll it oh oh i did oh my god it's a crit success it's a 66 on a 70 okay i thought i could fail but i got a 70 in that unarmed all right so i gave luke a check for avoiding going into the water it was a dexterity check so i'm even though you crit succeeded i'm going to give her the same role but i'm going to give her a negative 40 to her dexterity which actually puts her dexterity which actually puts her dexterity at 30 so if she can roll why even roll why don't you a success on a 30 then she can avoid and i rolled a 44 thank fuck a crit fail fail so do you want to describe what happens as francis beans shoves this small girl shoves this big fish hook this big like rusty fish hook into more you come up and kick her off kick her center mass and just fling her into the water but for the failiness of it i want you to tell me what happens yeah no as as you as you kick her she is actually going to smack her head on the side of the catwalk as she falls in and her limp body immediately just like belly flops onto the water kathy piston starts hollering she's like oh fuck yeah baby that is what i like to see and the limp soon to be perhaps corpse of francis beans lies floating on top of the dark green murky water below we're gonna cut to luke oh what he's in a fish you mean i'd like to see him get out of this conundrum it's character creation that's all they're gonna do tonight it'd actually be amazing so yeah i think we decided that thomas either just yelled or mispronounced hook or yeah well i was all the way in the kitchen talking to taylor i just heard a loud yell with a k sound at the end so i was like oh i think they're calling me well i just miss you guys exactly that makes sense it's time for you now okay well i can't say that i'm excited about it but let's see where it goes it's extremely wet and dark and all you hear is as all of this viscous membrane and water is pouring in and you also hear the cries of george piston who is inside this creature with you first off i need you to roll sanity 16 on a nine you're gonna lose one sanity that puts me at my breaking point oh okay well then let's get you a mania from the call of cthulhu seventh edition rule book okay i'll roll three times three times on a d100 uh 67 all righty 21 all right and 84 84 67 21 84 all righty 67 is mellow mania which is an obsession with music or a specific tune okay 21 is kaka demon mania is a pathological belief that one is inhabited by an evil spirit okay i like that one what's the last one 84 is 84 is plutomania which is the obsessive desire for wealth i'm gonna go ahead and say the second one where i think what is it i'm possessed by a demon cacodemomania cacodemomania yeah c-a-c-o-d-e-m-o mania okay and so you pronounce it just as well as i could cacodemomania cacodemomania is a pathological belief that one is inhabited by an evil spirit so now keith vigna oh i like this you have both had the empathy taken from you correct and you also believe yourself to be inhabited by an evil spirit it's a very fun combination that is good and you are inside of a giant creature with george piston who cries out in the darkness you got my you got my leg you got you got my leg who is that who's who is am i grabbing onto his leg i believe you were still holding on to it from when you were holding on trying to climb up him i say nothing and i try to claw my way up george piston put my foot on his head and reach and try to get as close up to the mouth of this creature as i can absolutely so what i'm gonna need you to do as you are pushing your back against this disgusting membrane you actually feel the mucus and the the viscous sludge that is the inside of this creature perhaps burning what is that feeling it's it's not quite burning it's it smells terrible in here and you feel pain and you had no senses yeah so i'm gonna need you to roll constitution if i don't roll over this would be real mad what do you have in constitution god damn it 70 i rolled at 89 all righty you are going to take two damage okay not bad and you continue climbing up george piston starts screaming out and he's just like no no it fucking burns i punch him in the face to shut him up it's completely dark in here so go ahead and roll at a negative 40 you're unarmed i can't i can't roll that then okay so you don't do that you're swinging wildly at what you think might be george piston your fists are only getting more inside fish man creature okay uh i just continue crawling up as you begin climbing up this massive disgusting creature is going to attempt to swallow harder in order to digest you sooner okay as it moves and contracts its muscles it rolls a 19 and you begin moving down from where you were and it is clear that the muscle muscly walls on either side of you are pushing you further into this fish creature and you are exactly where you were last round go ahead and roll a constitution check as more juices flow over your skin the face the face that luke just made i roll a 90 well that sucks okay i'm getting even more new dice let's go ahead and roll some damage here god damn it six i have been rolling like bullshit tonight six yeah you're gonna take six more damage as these juices like literally start burning that puts me down to 17 and instead of crawling up i take out my very small very powerful pistol and fire off as many shots as i can around you know like a not in the same spot but around the same spot to try to put a hole in this creature all right go ahead and roll 2d 10 for damage for me 12 12 you begin shooting and you can feel the writhing and discomfort within this creature that you are within as it begins to freak out and it's swimming all or like the movement is uncanny compared to how smooth everything was before i mean your gun fires and you can feel the pressure that you've blown into the inside of this fish but there's no water gushing in from the side or anything yet and it decides to continue its plan of swallowing you further so it is going to roll again am i doing con again or and then i need you to roll con thank you that is a 44 on a 70 oh all right you are still gonna take damage just a lower dice but with a crit success you will take no damage from this mucus yeah and you are still in the same spot you're in what i want to do is i want to pull out a frag grenade stick it in the hole that i've made with my gun and then i want to push george up against that hole oh my god to protect myself oh that is rough fish holy shit okay i'm gonna have you roll an athletics check in order to move george piston into position it's 45 on a 50 45 on a 50 as hell yeah you do exactly what you described you pull out a frag grenade you knew exactly where they were on your belt or inside i'm sorry inside your massive in my in my trunks at this point these are doubling as swimming trunks and i've never seen cargo shorts used as swimming trunks that's a lie i live in southwest missouri i've definitely seen just technically swimming trunks now and you shove this frag grenade up into the hole that you've made with your small but powerful gun and then you grab the underneath the arms of george piston and move him directly over the position which he would usually i think he would win the medal of honor for jesus christ had he not been put there by me taking one for the team uh do you think that part of your action of doing this is caused by your new belief that there's an evil spirit inside of you absolutely and then are you just giving yourself a pass because well it's there's an evil spirit inside of me and i literally part of my brain that has empathy is missing oh yep i said it earlier and i already forgot the uh combination of the two i am i'm better than everybody i know and i don't give a fuck if you die for me to live all right well let's go ahead and i'm gonna roll some damage here actually i'll have you roll the damage okay what do you want me to roll i'm sure that there is a specific amount of damage taken from a frag grenade but i'm gonna say that you're gonna roll 46 because you are putting him literally right up against it that's six eleven eleven so you're gonna have that and you're gonna take half that damage rounding up so you take six more damage okay however you have successfully blown a hole in the side of this creature you immediately feel cold water rushing in whereas before you were just surrounded by warm wet mucus and guts but now there's this cold murky water coming in and you can kind of feel an opening that you can grip you know what i'm talking about yeah i want to ace ventura out of this fish can you describe that in physical detail for me i've never seen ace ventura the grenade explodes shrapnel pretty much blows george in half so that's the reason why water's rushing in instead of him being stuck up next to it is his body's blown in half he may still be alive for a minute but probably not i miss leo i stick my head with my hands right up against my like forehead uh-huh and i start ripping this fish open and i'm just wiggling my face out to where it's barely out and then i with all my strength push myself out into the water out of this is this did did it's always sunny do the exact same joke as ace ventura it was ace ventura putting his face out of a fake rhinos butthole oh okay i'll show it to you after this i think frank uh danny divido comes out of a couch yeah very similar all right well you are birthed out of this massive creature i pull a jonah except i think jonah was less violent i i don't know ninova was a pretty dirty place all right let's uh let's get the rest of the place into the room for this next part clark bishop john lee pettymore the two of you are standing on this wet catwalk looking down at the body of francis beans underneath the surface of the water deep down somewhere below you feel this massive quake and there's a rumbling of the entire catwalk and it shakes you violently back and forth you hold your footing but you see this burst of light from inside the murky water below and then you start to see bubbles coming up onto the surface of this disgusting water and looking at the body of francis beans you see right next to her the water break and popping up to the surface is keith vigna keith keith fuck i'm just flapping around like trying to stay above water catching my breath guys get me the fuck out of this water oh my god oh keith vigna is george is george alive kathy screams from her spot hanging from these chains get me out of here and i'll let you know what happened i go reaching down to try and grab keith with nothing really keeping you from doing so you're able to grab onto him and we grab each other and you pull me up out of the mucky slippery water i grab the edge and i hoist myself up you see that keith's skin is red and burned and kind of peeling a little bit am i able to first aid myself or does that need to happen by someone else you certainly don't have the materials that's to do that right now someone's gonna have to look you down pee on him i i get up i fall over the i fall over the railing i immediately start peeing with a penis that works i i get up i fall over the railing and i am just laying sprawled out on my back on the catwalk trying to catch my breath what the what the fuck keith where is he where's my george he didn't make it what do you what do you mean he didn't make it you made it was he not right he helped me get out in a way get out and then i kind of laughed in a way he helped me get out well what do you mean he helps you get out he uh he uh sacrificed himself in it for me if you will you heartless bastard what the fuck happened down there i just look up at the above me and just keep catching my breath keith are you teeth what yeah what happened are you with us what i saw you i saw you get eaten but i felt myself get eaten i was halfway digested by a fucking fish i had to shoot my way out i look at kathy and i'm like you know what i don't care you gotta know i shot my way out couldn't didn't really work so i stuck a grenade in the hole that i made i put george right up against that hole to shield and i blew my way out of that fish oh no you did what keith you're the worst cop i don't know if he had i hope he had a quick death but he was screaming as i as i squirmed my way out she doesn't need to know that why did you think she should know that there's something in me she's just crying there's something in me uh i want to i want to okay i hit him i hit him with the bottom of my gun in the head oh my god do you let that happen keith no i'm gonna roll against that yeah all right melee against dodge what are you doing he's coming at you with the butt of his gun uh look at me what do you do athletics no no not what role you do what do you do to get out of the way of his gun he's coming at you with the butt of his gun i roll over you roll over yeah so that's a dodge so okay you're gonna roll against his melee weapons i have a 56 on a 30 i also failed 64 on a 40 john lee petty more 30 you kind of like sideswipe his face but he's like literally covered in this disgusting mucusy goo that hasn't quite rinsed off completely and the butt of your gun just kind of slides right off the side of his head okay so i turn it around and i point it at his face and i say what the fuck do you mean there's something in you something i saw something in there i don't know if i'm gonna try to control it but there's something evil inside me can i look into keith's eyes do i see any difference is there a little man in there i see a little boy evil man strapping luke what does he see in your eyes they look past you when you look into him i look over keith's head at kevin john and um i do just kind of like a look oh you pull your collar while they do that i i slide myself up into a standing position left and i look down at francis and i'm like well looks like you guys got her taken care of should we head on well i mean she's sort of taken care of i don't know if she she's maybe not she's just knocked out down there she'll be she will be taken care of floating face down well i she's currently just floating down so she's she probably died a couple minutes ago i'm saying if we want to fish her out and talk to her that would be the time well how long since she's been in the water like a minute yeah now would be the time for sure if it's not too late but we can try to do we want do we want to do we want to keith you have experience in this water get her out i look at i look i'm like we can try to hook her out of there but oh she deserves that and i i like patting my shoulder is it which you notice is all fucked up from huh is it out of you i've just realized i don't know if we know there's a when you patted your shoulder there's still a giant rusty fish hook inside of it you may have noticed this giant rusty fish yeah you just you just have a lot of slack so you're able to keep doing stuff i think we if i think at this point if we want to i don't know if we can talk to her but she might have something on her we want to get out but otherwise i think we just continue on and it's your niece keith i mean well my niece put me in this position i wouldn't have died if it hadn't been for her so i could give a fuck about her is that well she offered me the terrible decision that i had made that you made yeah of course she presented you with the choice that you chose it's all her fault it is had it not been for her i wouldn't be in the position i am i i didn't never died i don't think that's one way to look at it certainly i'm either way on this we can keep going or if you want to fish her out she might have something on her but a minute face down and water doesn't sound too promising yeah maybe we should go through her pockets that bitch deserves anything that you fucking deem necessary now will you fucking let me down please well wait hold up hold on a minute i need to ask you something what what are you i'm john lee pettymore don't you recognize me and i shoot her a wink her eyes go wide and she's like no you're definitely not bubble gum tree and i thought you don't know what that means so i walk up behind kevin john and i look at kathy kathy's uh he's telling you the truth that's that's john i've kind of snapped out of it real quick and i look over and i'm like i know you don't want to talk to me after what i said but i can attest to it as well yeah we're we're better people for you generally then than she were but i don't actually want to get you off them chains until you ask that last question she had what did the circle of knowledge use them homeless people for her face wrinkles up and she's like no way no way that all you all are all connected in all sorts of this terrible nonsense we're trying to we're trying to peel back the terrible nonsense you saw we're not on francis's side i walk past kevin toward kathy and i turn and look back at kevin i uh i actually know what they were using the people for and i look at kathy i said kathy i i'm working with maggie now how does she react she just lost her husband and she is hanging grotesquely from mid forearms she is in just an insane amount of pain and emotional torment so that while coming to her as a surprise does not necessarily garner a massive reaction okay so i guess everyone in this whole fucking world is under some weird sort of unnatural bullshit but if you if you if you're working for her then you fucking tell them well i'm telling you but we're we're on your side now yeah we're trying to stop that weird supernatural bullshit is that what you want well then fucking let me down this hurts i go ahead and do that i go ahead and try and help her down i don't know how to do that can i do joe doesn't know how to do that because i'm not standing there but would i be able to pull her in some way do you have uh any sort of like mechanical engineering or she's a little bit too far away from me you'd have to like jump out to her i mean looking over there is a lever that you saw francis using to lower george piston in i look over at her and i tell her start swinging our way we'll grab you i've got a really high survival skill would that help me in some way i don't think that's necessarily what that is meant for but whoever has the highest intelligence could roll intelligence to to figure this one out i'd say that's not me it's me oh no i have a 75 i crit failed 77 okay you are absolutely positive that you know what you're doing kathy i think you live there now i've got this no i've got this i can get it out definitely without severing any major arteries or hurting you in any way as we get you off this chain assembly and you go over and do what you will to the mechanism that is holding her up and as soon as you start fiddling with it she drops fully into the water the chain releases and it moves all the way down and it continues to lower and lower and lower and now the top of the chain or the bottom that you can see of the chain right up against the water is dry and has no algae or rust on it so you know that this is in fully engaged all the way down position oh well okay easy enough i do the opposite of what i just did and reverse that with that crit fail you lock it into position oh damn it i'm sorry kathy can i go over and like kick the lever kathy piston is drowning currently i want to try and kick it back the other direction but i don't know if you'll allow that with a crit failure no i certainly won't okay no so you can kick it yeah yeah you can set you can definitely kick it it breaks off it breaks off completely yeah there you go and uh and there is no lever anymore god damn it i start fiddling with the other lever trying to swing the hook into uh francis to try to pull her up and see if we can't search her george pistons hook yeah you're trying to hook francis beans with george pistons hook is it's it's not is it still stuck in the fish no no it was hanging yeah it's hanging yeah is she on that side thomas what do you got i'm gonna dive into the water and try to save kathy piston there you go so keith goes over and is fiddling with the other lever and john lee pettymore is diving in john oh shit that was stupid well keithy you blew you blew up the fish thing right i mean he's he's gonna be okay right there's no fish thing right i don't know how many is in here this is a look how big this tank is oh fuck jaw get out of there i'm swimming straight down all right on the chain uh luke and joe i'm gonna need you guys to leave the room oh shit john lee pettymore you dive into this dark green murky water and it is pretty cold on your skin as you begin swimming down directly following the chain yeah so this is an interesting that's what the chain wants me to do you never break the chain so when you are going down there i'm imagining that your mind is just filling up with all of these thoughts about what was just said above the water how many of these creatures actually exist in this aquarium power is a stat in this game that is for mental fortitude what is your power 60 i'm gonna have you roll a power check and if you succeed you can continue without taking a sanity check okay 30 you push all of those thoughts those intrusive thoughts out of your mind as you begin to go hand over hand down this chain into the darkness of this water go ahead and roll an athletics check for me 93 on a 50 93 on a 50 as you go hand over hand you you keep slipping on all this algae that is all over this chain but you continue making your way down and you think you hear something your ears are completely filled up with water but something i think i hear something it's perfect god you're right here with me inside of your mind and as you're going down i need you to roll luck for me oh no what's your luck at my luck is at 20. oh six holy shit fuck yes all right so i was giving you one athletics check to get down there okay yeah so you can now make your way all the way down to where kathy is get the hook out of her arms and follow the chain back up to the surface don't say i never did anything for you kathy all right i'm gonna get the other boys okay clark bishop you're looking down into the dark water where john lee pettymore just dove in keith you're messing with this hook over over there go ahead and roll a dexterity check for me to see if you can uh wrap or yeah dexterity for me yes sir 15 on a 60 nice much like a nice much like a well-versed child in an arcade you know exactly how to hook onto the body of francis beans and you can drag her over to where you can and then i dump it onto the catwalk the body the body the body the body you dump the body onto the the catwalk and do you do anything or you just look at it oh uh well i want to go search uh her like pockets and stuff to see if she has like keys or any anything that we can use to continue our path into the glass compound while he's searching can i see if i get a pulse yeah absolutely roll first aid for me clark as he's doing that keith you're going through the pockets and really all you find is a uh a stun gun and a card that is a dirty dog grooming key fob okay i failed my first aid roll a 68 on a 30 yeah she's she's alive and well uh i will take the oh she's alive what that was my fail was that i found i can tell that she's alive yeah you feel a pulse oh well i'll take the stun gun and does the card have her name on it or is it just a yes yeah it's for it's a key fob for uh the loyalty program at dirty dog grooming to francis beans well i'll pocket that and then uh i'll take the taser is there any way to check and see if that works is there like a light that lights up or anything on it sure yeah the light lights up it does the crackly noise yeah when you click on yeah it's got two little uh metal tips at the end and a little uh static goes in between the two points i'll stick that into my pockets and then uh is she alive yeah i got a pulse oh shit do you know cpr i do uh first aid on her to to do cpr okay roll that first aid clark would probably know how to do cpr too but i got a pretty high it's a nine on a 60 yeah keith vigna actually passed that exam more recently than you did yeah so keith as you begin doing cpr you realize that you have broken the sternum of the corpse of your niece francis beans because she wasn't actually alive no not even remotely keep going keith keep going you're you're doing good i swear i got a pulse i uh i kick her body back into the the water whoa whoa oh i do it i did it and i as as you do that um breaking the water john lee pettymore as you rise up you get hit in the head i kicked her into the other side he did not dive in now he's got total corpse and you guys help john lee pettymore holding cathy piston get onto the catwalk that you guys have all been on for some time now but he's gag reflexing all over keith yeah well they climb onto francis's floating dead body to uh hoist themselves up so that we can grab them and then he throws up all over me you got her you got her him and i all it took was a little bit of luck and i turned and winked to the camera uh is cathy looking alive and is she conscious nope she is unconscious i know cpr i just rolled to do it yeah you're in a pretty good mental state and you just succeeded so let's have that roll roll on over to cathy piston so i do a very good nine out of whatever i said 60 staying alive staying alive and i think it's staying alive yeah clark knows first nice and so cathy piston becomes spitting up this dirty water right into my mouth right into keith's mouth that's usually what happens when you're rinsing away some of the vomit that john lee pettymore just put there and she starts screaming she's like you you you killed me you saved me thank you well we was only trying to save you but we accidentally dropped you in that water i'm gonna need a second to recover one mississippi all right let's go so keith why didn't why didn't you just do that with francis too because i think that you might have uh felt your own pulse on her neck instead of hers i don't think that she was actually alive when we fished her out of there i'm sorry oh i'm not actually sorry though she's a bitch so clark grabbed her wrist with one hand and touched his neck with his other hand no no no he just felt the heat of the moment man he's like you know what he didn't do it correctly and he felt the pulse of his own finger and not her pulse which is uh no i i did the neck thing which you can still feel your own finger pulse on so i think you might have just fucked it up but uh yeah i uh tried to resuscitate a dead woman i tried my best though but then you resuscitated a live woman yeah and it worked so made up for it so clark you might once we once we're done with this you might need to take another first aid class but i think that's the least of our concerns today on that cpr that's for sure i'm glad you're here though and i look at everybody i'm like i think i'm ready to uh go see what's down there i want to go fuck marvin up yeah i think we should go and get us one more recruit before we go though who do we got uh our boy back there man i i pissed him off around but yeah but joe gave him a wink so also we can just leave you here and if we show up with kathy if it's me and joe and kathy walking down there i mean i say hey who's joe i'm sorry the water really addled my brains i was under for quite a while if me and uh clark and kathy walk on down there and he sees that you know i'm i'm with the two alleged prisoners maybe you just hang back a little you can i'll walk down a little bit with you but i'll hold back so i'll be i'll be close enough that i can help it's crouched down i'll be outside of his view yeah crawl up well because he's probably looking one way i'll just be right behind him where he can't see me that's such a good idea that everybody should just do that and as you do that behind the person they're trying not to be seen by it's very stealthy it's the only way clark looks down at kathy kathy are you uh are you with us well i'm certainly not against you you want to you want to help us in this little mission of ours what's the mission i i just take down water and glass and save the world and i put on some sunglasses that just came out of my pocket she looks up and she's like if you tell me where leo is then i will absolutely join you leo my brother-in-law he went missing he didn't well we don't know where'd all the missing people go well we're trying we're trying if you really are john lee pettymore and you two are fucking who you are then you know that everyone in contention's been gone missing and where are they well you think we took them we're trying to figure out the same as you but listen uh leo we saw leo disappear he was disappear just apparate this uh you know uh he left this plane of existence but he was all already dead but whose fault it is and we know this for fact it's marvin it's marvin glasses fault this on the world who is mar who's you're in marvin glasses lair yeah right now she knows who marvin glasses i fucked up oh okay well just do it listen to get it together yeah kid fucking kathy you're a mess i forgot i forgot he's is a business partner technically so i just forgot about one of my biggest clients back to that he's a business partner well yeah i supply him with you know people yeah let's talk about that how you use a people supplier well we don't really need to hop on into all that as soon as i lose my husband and have my whole world turned upside down john we just need you to help us out right now should i have saved your life or is you just a miserable sack of human trading shit look those people were compensated very fairly they got a place to stay and they got you know they got food to eat and what'd you do to them no in return i just borrowed them you know out to different people right so like you know i guess clark you know maggie they're at the circle of knowledge she's been using them and i know how mag has been using them do you know how marvin's been using them i didn't know marvin was using well yeah marvin you know he's a little bit darker you know than uh than jim was for sure but you know he certainly i don't know you know he he uses them for fights which isn't great you know obviously but we he normally breeds them first and then you know they're not born into a world where they're really known to any sort of comfort so i guess it makes it slightly better but mostly i'm just getting that sweet sweet money and i you know i've been using all those people down there uh you know uh getting getting my clicks from my business you are an awful sack of human shit and everything wrong with capitalism in this world but uh what do you mean using them different than jim jim cook yeah jim cook yeah he used to run he used to run the circle of knowledge obviously and but what yeah but why did you compare him to marvin well just because i've been working with jim for years and i've been working with marvin for years and uh you know i always felt fine handing people over to they'd always come back and they'd you know keep staying with me for a while but i was confused i thought marvin had inherited some kind of thing from jim but i was i was simply confused that was the way i said it was confusing i well i do this does bring me back to another point uh before i i dived into that water don't call me a hero but but but clark what the hell what what is the circle of knowledge using these homeless folk folk yeah about that um human experimentation no you know remember that thing i told you i saw in that vision that big thing that scared the day of living daylights out of me well to keep it contained wherever the plan of existence it's in they need people in that plan at all times chanting to keep it there so they have a kind of continuous rotation of homeless people who kind of sort of volunteer for it like they they they they're glad to be keeping that thing they're well compensated all right well that's better that's better than death masses you are not off the hook kathy i am now clearly thank you for getting me off the hook all right hey kathy good pun but you still a human trafficker technically but you deal in lives technically but but nothing you a butt ass fucking slaver guys after after this you're going down right now i don't think we need to be arguing with each other right now i think we need to go get this guy off the hook get him to help us we got plenty of guns for all of us to go storm marvin's place i'm gonna help i'll take a gun i'm gonna help kathy to her feet and pull a pistol out of my waistband and hand it to her wait wait what if we use kathy more like a human shield no offense kathy but you are a slave and scum you said that super out loud and i'm saying i'm saying it to your face but like either we kill you here right now or i don't i don't want her armed here's the thing kevin john uh keith can attest to the fact that she's a crack shot she hit she hit me nailed her nailed his foot from yard she wasn't even trying to kill me she shot me right where it couldn't kill me she's a crack shot damn it i forgot you shot keith and that makes you at least half all right in my book and i look down for a second and i'm like well anything that what did i do to my friends anything that helps let's go get this guy off the hook and let's get our little army let's get let's get this this force let's go do it fox force five i do hand her that pistol she takes it and puts it in her butt no wow kathy come on she just puts it in her back back waistband back waistband thank you her butt i would like to go over to the agent and do the same exact thing i did to fish out wow i thought you were gonna say the same exact thing you did to him before no no it is awful to play with you no uh i want to go over and uh play with uh the uh mechanism and try to because he's not lowered down in i just want to move him back over to close to the catwalk and try to get him down okay roll intelligence for me keith if you're doing that by yourself does anyone want to roll hell to help me like we've done before yeah if i got an 11 a crit success okay yeah if john is over there helping you have a much better shot cool cool so you guys walk over to the body of agent trent shad with uh doug jacobs inside can i hang back and talk to kathy privately absolutely i don't know if you want to do it now or later but as they're walking ahead to get agent doug chad down i'm gonna kind of hold kathy's arm back a little bit i need to talk to you okay you guys i'll have thomas and luke leave the room okay all right so you see john lee pettymore and keith vigna begin to get doug jacobs off of his hook and kathy looks at you and she's like what do you want to talk about uh i i just wanted to pick your brain for a second here um do you trust maggie maggie yeah you've been providing bodies it sounds like to her and jim for a while now i just wonder what your thoughts on her are right now oh she's certainly a little bit more rough around the edges than her old man was that's for sure she's been fine to deal with on my end but you know she does have that fire in her eye in the last i don't know a couple years how long you've been how long you've been providing bodies to them homeless folks to them gosh 20 years is there any chance in the last year or two um they were coming back any different if the homeless people ever spoken to you about changes or things that have been different about their time there at the circle or now in the past what since the changeover happened you know about the changeover well i mean clearly maggie's in charge now and because her old man died right jim died yeah yeah i was i was wondering if there's been a change strangled in an alleyway in the city can you imagine god anyway uh yeah no he was a he was a fine man to deal with seemed like he had his head on his shoulders straight you know maybe a little bit of an alcohol problem but past that man who doesn't have a vice but come to think of it i i haven't seen any of the the people i've dropped off with her uh in the past uh week you know i typically you know she they'd normally keep them for a while so i haven't gotten any back from her i will say i used to get them back from jim you know we'd have a pretty daily rotation going in and out so it's unusual the amount of time it's been since you've seen your stock i suppose so but i've been in the hospital with george past couple days you know about a week now you know and uh we got dragged out there by these thugs so to clarify you're you're like an independent contractor are you you're not part of the circle are you no gotcha the circle no no god no i'm not part of any of that nonsense i'm just in it for the money baby baby i'm just in it for the money baby all right all right kathy thanks thanks for talking to me now he said leo disappeared what's that he disappeared like you don't know where he is or he said he saw him disappear and then he said disappear which i have no idea what the fuck that means well you you said it yourself people have been disappearing all over contention yeah but i didn't think actually disappearing like not existing anymore well we're not exactly sure that's exactly the case but that's what it looks like right now you saw my brother-in-law leo piston he was there in front of you and then all of a sudden he was not yeah kathy uh john wasn't lying he he was he was dead before he disappeared how do you remember uh that incident with the the maxwell girl oh yeah she she finally got her revenge julie or ashley julie i was gonna say if ashley got her revenge that would i mean you know not counting anything out of sorts these days with everything that's going on but julie julie killed leo julie killed leo but kathy i'm here to tell you i i killed julie some some modicum of justice was dealt she just throws her arms around you and starts sobbing into your shoulder i uh clark doesn't know how to react to that very well and i don't think he fully embraces her it's just kind of an awkward pat on the back what is a god due to a crying woman oh fuck yeah i have no idea there there my flock perfect yeah and the two of you go walking down the catwalk and you see that keith and john have gotten doug jacobs down in the body of agent in the body of agent trinchette nice and if we don't utilize it in its entirety it's a wasted opportunity and this podcast is illegitimate bullshit i've actually listened to every episode uh about five times and there's parts where like i feel like they don't even remember what they were doing all right thomas luke can you guys use your radio voices from here on out yeah i'll just use my voice you wanted us to sound sexy we can do a little bit of that lady i'm just thinking god kate kate kate vigna didn't die so that i don't have to like figure out a new character voice i don't give a fuck about keith i just don't want to have to do that what character voice exactly if i die and i have a new character i'll have to do one all right so clark bishop comes walking down the catwalk with kathy piston yeah i'm gonna read you all that okay clark bishop god damn it clark bishop and keith fuck you were nervous clark i thought you were gonna do it again asshole clark bishop let's do audio medium let's do three seconds and then go clark bishop and kathy piston are walking down the catwalk and they get there just in time for keith vigna and john lee pettymore to pull down doug jacobs in the body of agent and chad and the five of you are standing on the catwalk i reach out a hand for a handshake from doug chad glad to see you're still with us i i don't i don't and he looks extremely weak and dazed and he can't really string any sort of semblance of a thought together right now hey man how do you feel um about your own wishes versus our wishes vis-a-vis how you would carry your actions out let me put this another way slap yourself in the face he shakes his head that's smart yeah you shouldn't do that yeah that's a cop field examination for shock and you passed i look at uh both my fellow i guess former officers at this point but both my fellow officers and kathy and and trent chad and i like beckon behind us and i'm like we came here for a singular purpose i think we ought to
