Pettymore I've been wolf. That was the news. I could use something heavy and dripping in sin It's dragon in three with what kind of world are you living in? Bad girls on top of the water Mary and Caroline, I'm on the borderline Leaving my mind at your altar Crossing the double line, doing it every time Tell me what kind of world are you living in? What kind of world are you living in? So we had the same dare officer all through like middle school and then into junior high and then into high school He was like our police officer that worked at our school and then in high school freshman year He came to our health class to teach sex ed It was a in the time where you had those cell phones that were like flip phones and you could set them to a setting that was vibrate then ring and So his phone starts vibrating in class as he's teaching and he looks down and he goes Oh, it's just my wife and he clicks the button or he tries to and so he thinks he's turned it off But then the ringtone starts and it was like wow. You're a crazy bitch watch your fuck so good And buck cherry played and Nice, not sure I ever recovered buck cherry played here in Springfield and the guitarist shopped at our local music place Hoover and bought the exact guitar that my guitarist was saving up for He was in the store at the same time and watched him walk out with it Really sucked When you say you've never recovered from that like you mean that was the moment that set what you wanted to be in life or Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I was just like man. There's not there's not much that's better than that, huh? Yeah, I Don't know how we how we get back. Oh, I guess we just start the I guess we just start yeah For once we could just have an episode start with us playing Oh No, we kind of do the Dragon Ball Z thing where like you think it's gonna fill up the whole time slot but then it's like short and half of it is recap and then fucking around I Thought you meant that we were just dragging our balls same thing Well instead of dragging our balls, let's get some oopsies out of the way I've got some whoopsies to whoopsies to be exact to start out with First whoopsie what you guys woke up in the mausoleum and You've been through some shit Especially this time. You've definitely been around lots of unnatural learn lots about the unnatural and Every time that's happened so far We've changed the entire nature of the role-playing game that we're playing by having you guys roll to d20 for a natural And adding that to your skill point so I need Joe Thomas Luke to roll to d20 for a natural and Justin hi, I assume that on your character sheet your unnatural score is at a zero no It's it's quite high actually. Oh good. That is what did we talk about that? Mm-hmm Okay, good a rest of you might get some real high numbers here. So let's hear those 2d 20 rolls 29 total for me 29 total. Okay. So what does that put your total at? That's a good question That's why I asked it. I love asking good questions. Okay, I have 79 now Jesus fucking Christ Yeah, I'd smoke that guy's cum cool And Joe I Rolled back-to-back sevens, so that's that's a 14 added to my head 49. I think so. I'm at 63 No, that's really really high for an unnatural score and Thomas speaking of 14 I rolled a 14 and a 9 which is 23 added to my previous score that gives me 67 Nice, we're all good at unnatural Zach's like, why did I give them 2d 20? Nah, you know this is we're in the um, I know that you guys aren't fans of quality film But I believe they call this the end game. I Hate myself and so you guys are going to have a lot of Natural skill points Luke is a member of the moxie our local independent theater, which means that according to his contract He's not allowed to watch Marvel movies Hill's films have climaxes and dinner moves Badass shit like end games Luke likes to go to the cinema. We like to go to the right. Yeah Cinema yeah, okay. I enjoy kenel. I only watch movies where the women have armpit hair It's kind of my dating policy Oh, you guys have a lot of unnatural Yeah, we do at this point and you can use those whenever you want to do things that are unnatural Wasn't there a big downside to it if we if we oh, yeah. Yep, if you fail, it'll it'll be real bad No When you when you are dealing in the unnatural Things don't always Go the way you planned and when they go awry the true horror being involved with this This nature of items or beliefs or thoughts or words Can really come back and bite you in the little butt come in the butt cool So if you were wanting to do something that you didn't think was humanly possible we could roll that skill to see if it happens I want to eat a million sandwiches Natural doesn't seem humanly possible. I want to see sandwiches. Yeah Okay, so with all that Unnatural business out of the way. I need Justin Luke and Thomas to remove their headphones Hi, I thought this might be the other oopsie You almost got away with it almost snuck one right past yo dungeon master It's time for you to roll for a mania Cuz I hit my breaking point you remember what it was it made me hit it was when you saw a giant wave of black ooze that was about to pour down over the Vw bug or not bug the van that you were in 23 92 89 Oh 23 Michael Jordan Cardo koi card cart card a coif these hmm an uncontrollable Compulsion to see maps everywhere to see what the fuck does that mean a compulsion to see maps? So like you think everything is a map That means we have to go this way maybe I could be kind of fun that could be fun I just read it. I just read a Dan Brown book, so I'm kind of hip to seeing maps and shit Angels and demons Actually, it was the lost symbol is the one I read. Oh, I don't know Those are the only two things that I know about Dan Brown is that he wrote those two books and he's played by Tom Hanks in real life Rolled up 23. What else did you roll a 92 92 the year I was born technomania an obsession with new technology Okay, and finally 89 89 in the year someone else was born me yeah, that's what I thought oh Scribble o mania obsession with scribbling or doodling so maps everywhere Obsession with new technology or obsession with scribbling Doodling do I have anything on my person that I could scribble with at this point. Oh, you know Yeah, I think I've whipped out a notepad a few times. Oh, yeah Notepad pain I'm between maps and notepad. What do you what do you think? Do you do you have a narrative one that would help you? I think both would be excellent I will say two things one We have had a virus of sorts in this show before where? scribbling was Happened by the people who had it and I think that would be narratively interesting because if you start scribbling stuff constantly I think the other PCs will think there's something wrong with you, which could be interesting and Then I think the map could be narratively interesting as well because you are currently looking for a way out of this place So that would lead you very easily to play out that one. Fuck. They're both good Well, I can see how I could play both of them. I'm gonna go I'm gonna go I Think I'm gonna go fuck shit. I'm gonna go see maps. I'm gonna go see maps. Okay. Yeah that see maps on this on the shimmering silver see All right, let's get the boys back in here with Matt man My man Birdie birdie birdie birdie birdie birdie birdie birdie eagle albatross par birdie birdie birdie birdie birdie birdie birdie birdie bogey double bogey triple bogey, they really ran out of Ideas for bad golfing pretty quickly. They came up with such cool names for good golfing And then I've just remembered who I'm talking to but Zach. This is a great point. We know the golfing things We know those days. Yeah eagle. We just don't know what happens when you go to a golf course and like talk to the lady Yeah, for those of you who are not a citizen of contention over on patreon.com slash. Oh, yeah This didn't happen on the mainstream No It's not we recently had it at a game where these boys had to Had to meet for a delta green mission on a golf course and they didn't know what the fuck to do I I feel like I feel like in real life people would have been a lot more helpful than Zach was Yeah for some first-timers That's super fair. Alright, so let's start by Everyone, I want you to google real quick I know this is an audio podcast and you rely on me to tell you What you are seeing visually to think about in your head But I used a certain picture for inspiration Google red sands S-a-n-d-s red sands fort is a picture. I came across a while ago and it went in my Photos on my phone and an album that I've labeled inspiration Oh, okay The hell is which also has of a weird fish that has human teeth And it's all just shit I found on the internet and a picture of Dolly Parton Inspiration it's sort of like the saying the thing that could became Sealand It's very similar to the sea fort that became Sealand if you know what that is if you've ever watched a water world It's very very much probably the aesthetic that they based their movie off of it's the exact rusty aloft above an ocean Yeah dilapidated basically What I'm picturing as you guys are poking your heads out of this Door of this hatch that kind of opens out down you see a ladder looking down on this boat about 10 yards below This bay boat made out of this the same familiar inky black yet Unnaturally colorful material that also makes up the sky you see the two men standing on this craft One is a short stout man in his latter years a thick white beard Makes his round face look even rounder and the bags under his eyes are large and fluffy He's wearing a dark navy beanie and a wool plaid shirt under olive corduroy Overalls and the other man is John Lee Pettymore the fourth's uncle Don D. Pettymore as you all poke your heads out of this hatch We can see from the outside that you are in this kind of this Lofted room that is made out of the similar inky black yet colorful substance that is on stilts It is like a stilted room that the still legs then go down into this shimmering silver sea below you Everyone roll sanity Cuz you haven't rolled sanity since you arrived wherever you are now and I do think that that was a third whoopsie so we're Lost I don't know if that's a whoopsie cuz this just happened Your brain finally caught up to the situation and you're all like fuck What were we like? Zach I didn't I didn't roll a score that passed But it is the inverse of a passing score. It's 32 instead of 23. So does that get me anything? That would be an interesting luck mechanic like spend five luck to reverse the numbers on your dice But we don't use that currently so that is a fail. It's actually a very cool mechanic I I doesn't that fun d4 plus one. I bet we would remember. Yeah, we would remember it and use it And Luke I heard you say that you failed, right? I did so roll a d4 and add one and lose that much sanity three. I'm at 11 I a dangle crit failed. I'm still under my power I'm not freaking out, but I critically know you are cuz you lose five sanity ouch that puts me at 11 and Clark Bishop with losing five sanity all in one go at the sight of all this. I'm gonna need a fight Or freeze from yeah Go ahead and rank those please Honestly at this point freeze would be number one Standing. Yeah. Sure. So four five six, you'll freeze and then probably Flight, okay, so run away is number two and then yeah fight is my third and then fight is if you roll a one I don't know what the fight is gonna be if I fight probably fuck somebody up dude. Yeah Kill Leo piston again Julie did it once you can do it twice Go ahead and roll a d6 for me It's a two, okay, that's gonna be run away run away Clark Bishop has not yet made it down this ladder as you're all looking out this door and He is looking for a place to run. He looks down at the ladder He sees the boat down below with two men one of whom he vaguely Remembers from his time growing up in contention as being a petty more and The other he does not recognize at all. This is not running away going towards this boat. So he turns back He opens up the other hatch in the room across the room from the hatch that is currently open He slams the lever into the up position He flings it open and he runs through it closing the door behind him. None of you were able wait, let me get a quick Alertness or search from sorry Justin Okay, good, thank you I needed that Luke and Thomas give me a search or alertness and Thomas because you're looking at your uncle right now I'm gonna put you at a negative 20. No pass. Oh, no, actually I'm not gonna put you at a negative 20 because you really wanted to go through that door Yeah, I think I'm pretty stoked on what just happened because I really wanted to see was like Uncle Don It's cool to see you and all but weird things are happening all the time around here right now and Frankly, you know, I learned I could distrust as many elder members of my family as I could trust so who knows if you're just gonna try to rope me into some shitty con or You're gonna make me wait in the car for hours while you just get drunk in some bar a lot of bars. Yeah And it's hot in this fucking car and so I want to see What's through that other door? I really do no offense to Uncle Don I've got a personal theory that we're just gonna see Uncle Don and this other guy in that boat again. I Hope I didn't just give zacking out Wait, hold up But if that's true Then in John Lee Pettymore's mind did Clark Bishop just fall to the same fate as spud I haven't thought it all the way through Or even a second step to be honest the way that you describe it I pictured me wily coyoting my way out that door So Clark Bishop is gone Joe take off your headphones Keith Joe who the fuck is Joe John Keith John Justin looking down you see the two men I would also see Keith right because he slid down the ladder at the end of the last episode Oh, he did go down the ladder. Yes up above. I'm just like Keith Don Don Keith Don you'll do the plat thing and introduce Keith to that stranger I'm gonna go poke my head through this other door real quick just to be sure What's on the other side be careful? I will What if it's scary kind of think we're in purgatory or whatever. So, you know, do we need to be careful? I don't we'll probably just be in like, you know some kind of endless torture for the rest of you know Eternity, so I might as well see what's through this other door So I'm not wondering the whole time, you know For the next thousand lifetimes or whatever the fuck until we get back to here So I'm gonna poke my head through that door and I will be right back. Okay, be careful As you're walking back through Leo piston is still just in his in his own eternal junkyard Just squealing away in pain and you walk over to the other hatch Yes, open it up and walk on through take off your headphones. I don't walk on. I just want to peek through Okay, much like we did through this door or some of us did sure Go ahead and take off your headphones Who are you guys? Oh, right that man said that uh Your name was Keith, huh? What the hell? What why do you sound like that? Oh, my name is Jack Russell. Nice to meet you. He puts out his hand. I shake it Have you seen the door what door and he turns back and he looks at dawn He's of no use to us if he hadn't seen the door It just kind of walks back and starts messing with some some I've seen the door inky black on the back I saw the door Jack Russell turns around with his big Santa Claus eyebrows Raised real high and he looks real big-eyed over at dawn boy says he's seen the door Uh-huh. Can I tell if he's lying? Oh Are you lying? Mmm. Yes, I am. He says he's lying. No Yeah, go roll human, ooh Is this my first time rolling a character in? In the game, I don't think I ever had a character she did I Did you not for Donovan was something or other? Oh, wait. No, I don't think I think we just kind of winged it. Oh My god, we were so loosey-goosey. Yeah, this is Justin's first character sheet in the game Crazy to me. Okay, so I'm rolling human. He's rolling persuade. Is that what you said? It's correct Luke go ahead and roll persuade for Keith Vigna. I a crit succeeded I crit fail 88 What do you think? I'm gonna grab this man by the arm. Why are you lying boy? The door was a purple I kind of tighten my grip. Don't lie to this man orange the orange. I Saw it why are you here? Yeah, the talk about the door what brought you here. I've came then through a door that one Game a point up at the up there that one. How'd you is that how you got in here? What is this place? Immediately Jack Russell pulls the boat up to the ladder and starts tying off both the rope and the ladder itself are made out of this extremely colorful Very black dark substance is tying off a euphemism Jack are we gonna are we gonna go up here and search a little bit? Well, if you're looking for you're looking for I'm looking for what I'm looking for Let's explore sounds good I let go of him and start climbing up the ladder as you guys are all at the bottom of this ladder You can see that adjacent So basically the the room above you that is about 10 yards up its square it has four walls, uh, You are on one side of this square. So you would take the ladder up now on the adjacent wall There seems to be a bridge and you're just now seeing it for the first time as you look up There is sort of a rope bridge that is also Unsurprisingly made out of this flag we're colorful darkness and It leads across to a second Stilted room. So there's another Identical stilted room that is attached with a rope bridge. That's cool Yeah, nice Luke roll sanity Oh 12 and I have 11 Okay, you just lose one. So now you have 10 as you realize the other hatch in the room above you is across from the hatch the two hatches are on opposite sides of the room and yet the rope bridge is Coming from the adjacent wall not the wall that is parallel It is the wall that is perpendicular that has the rope bridge attached to it. What are you looking at? So we had son You got something wrong with you boy, I don't Whoo, it's hard to look at that. I don't really know I can't even comprehend I'll trust you on my boat by yourself and we're going up there. So you go up first. I'll go after you I don't know who you want to go in the middle or you want to go first in the middle. Okay? Jack Russell begins climbing. I start climbing after him Nice view All right, don I assume you're going up I'm so take the boat and dip No, I'm continuing along Birded me back in Yeah, butter did me Is it just me coming back or is Thomas need to be bad Thomas Thomas? and Justin and Luke bye. Bye. What kind of come are you? Smoking Get it. No. Yeah, I do not be there for you When you come starts to fall All right, you guys ready? Yeah, yeah A crazed Clark Bishop sprints through the door Wile E. Coyote style and you are suddenly in Another one of these similar rooms except this one does not have nearly as much junk in it as the last and as you bust In really the only things you see in here are a hatch in front of you and Two figures Oh, dr. Marie Jacobs is an older plump woman with mascara smeared all over her entire face Her hair is a disaster and she is wearing white coveralls and long Neoprene gloves she is in the exact same State that you saw her when she was locked up in the contention police department except for the last time you saw her in the contention police department was on tape when you saw her body being lifted and then slammed repeatedly into the ground so you do notice the matted blood caked all over the back of her head and She is laying on the ground next to the body of Doug Jacobs With dried blood all filling his broken nose He's still wearing that same pair of novelty boxer briefs Featuring Pepe Le Pew and he has a black collar around his neck. He too has bruises all over him and blood coming out the back of His head they are cuddling while laying on the ground Looking straight up into the sky above you there is no Ceiling in this room the only thing above you. Oh, wait. No, is that the ceiling? You wouldn't even fucking know because it's the same inky black darkness that is so colorful shining down on you and Giving you peace while you sleep man Maybe you know that the Lord loves you very very much and you bust in here and they really don't even fucking notice Are they literally the only two things in here? Yes How crazed is Clark does he just keep running past them doubt the next door? Yes, I a hundred percent and as you run through the next door as You run through the next door you slam it open and as you run through it You actually bump into the back of John Lee Kevin Moore the third from behind somehow and the two of you fall Kind of into the same room that has nothing in it except for dr. Marie Jacobs and Doug Jacobs Clark I thought you were in front of me Let's try that next hatch What do I see when I look behind me first you see a junkyard of a room with and you can hear the cries of? Yeah, go go go to that door that door that door and I'm kind of pushing you along to go out the next door and as You go through it. You run through the same room again. Both of you are all sanity Hey 17 Nice hey 10 I passed I do a 10 on an 11 lose 10 lose 10 I need one of you Lose any as you realize nope this is exactly how this room works. Oh, okay, so it's just like a loop through that door It's just a loop thing a loop Loopy loop. Oh, it's like it's a lag. Yeah, damn it. So it's just the boat in this Fucking dawn. I think I owe money or something. It's been a while He's one of these one of those ones where it's like oh you're spending the day with Uncle Don and then it's like spending the Day with Uncle Don was four hours in a hot car and then Uncle Don driving you home drunk. I Mean yeah, he financed my racing career, but also, you know, fuck that dude Isn't that the that the doctor isn't that the doctor and the the cat man body right there who? Right there on the floor there. Yes. I see them those those people on the on the ground remind me. Dr Marie Jacobs and that's Doug Jacobs her husband and he He's actually Salem her cat remember the radio switch that the Doug Jacobs and the cat You and she's like caressing his hair Doug Jacobs his head as it lays upon her breast and They're just staring up into the endless ness above them and you as she kind of looks over and catches your eye Oh fuck Now see Clark, that was a very succinct a very succinct summation as a war I was just asking for the benefit of folks who might not have ever heard any kind of recap about this sort of story you absolute total fucking pieces of garbage Sorry doctor police officers my ass. You're gonna lock us up when we're in love And that's why we're here oh wait, okay, so If we wouldn't have been locked up we wouldn't be here Hey fair enough, but you weren't locked up because you were in love But if you are admitting right now to being in love with your cat Even though he's in the body of that man. That is a crime. I am so sorry You cannot what part of it is a crime loving your animal. You said we're in love that that replies that implies romance You see I love my friends. I love my partner Clark here, but we're not in love. I love you too, John Yeah, thanks, man Thank you, I Think I think we actually we yeah, we we kind of went over this but when we first There I we don't know that there's a crime here, but it doesn't feel like it's Doesn't feel like it's not a crime. Yeah, I am getting a real sense of deja vu with this conversation But ma'am once again like while I understand the appeal of having a cat Will you just leave us in a person-sized body and just like rolling around on the floor with that? When you start to say like I'm in we're in love that implies a level of NFC being reached with that body that I don't think is appropriate Either for the original owner of that body the cat's mind. That's now in it Or God frankly or God. Yeah, that's not what Asian on this relationship without knowing anything about us Hmm. Well, then maybe just be more careful with your words, you know, no, it's like a cat mine in a human body That's that. Yeah, I don't know the the context and we see you rolling around on the floor there. I'm not trying Yeah, I guess I am trying to yuck your yum This this is yucky And she kisses Doug Jacobs on the head and goes and looks directly in your eyes and says yummy You know, there was nothing inherently gross about you kissing your cat man on the head until you said yummy again It's just the way you're approaching all of this. That is very It just seems like it's coming from the wrong angle. It's not making me comfortable at all good Go away what doctor help? How long have you been here? She looks up into the stars above that don't exist. I've been here forever. I Was born here. I Will die here and when I die, I will remain here Well, I don't I don't think that's the case because we had you in a jail cell. We just talked about that So you weren't yeah, you're literally talking about yeah your memories with us Outside of here, so you won't remain here. Oh Sorry you cut out on the discord call of little faith, oh you just didn't finish your sentence In a normal time you Michael borrowed it Really just sounded like you got cut right off. So Is it clear that my? Intention Is to annoy you Yeah, you know ma'am personally, you know, I don't she begins licking the hair of Doug Jacobs, oh Yeah, again, that doesn't bug me cuz that just seems like if she's being a cat like I don't know We're all cats down here. What bugs me is when she implies that she fucks the cat. I'm with you I'm with you on that and she's like Why do you think I'm applying that and then she implies it more and I don't care about rolling around with your big cat, man That sounds enjoyable and adorable. I Just don't don't fuck the cat man. Don't I Just cross a line from time to time every now and then she does imply that there's a line being crossed Yeah, it seems like a cat man's getting fucked Scratch his ears, you know lick his hair. All right, whatever Rub his whiskers, but he does both don't please don't fucking have whiskers anymore Please I was being I was being you know imaginative I was being playful like the spirit being very imaginative when you keep talking about me fucking this cat when It seems like that's all you want to think about to be fair Yeah, exactly I knew it I'm not gonna engage with you because you know exactly what you're doing So I'm not just gonna get in little word games with you where you're like Oh, you're the one who wants to fuck cat cuz you're the one fucking this cat apparently It's good to know that setting doesn't change the show at all On That note I think I'm gonna switch back over She's getting to a point where we could Yep, this is about the right time to switch But could we real quick just ask her some questions? Like I literally just want to be like if she can engage with me on a real level I want to just be like, what are your impressions having been here? Okay fucking do it Maybe you fuck that cat. Maybe you don't let us put that aside for a moment Petty more. I didn't know you were from here. Now. What do you mean by that? Bishop look at his face. I look at his face Clark You can clearly see just the the booze that's pouring out of his eyes and his ears and his nose and his mouth Is the same inky dark substance that is extremely colorful at the same time. It's like dripping down from my eyes Oh, yeah, do I look really fucking goth and badass? You look so Cool, you're also in like Kevin's body Which is like scarred up and you're in all black tactical gear like and I think canonically he was described As Sam Elliott in Roadhouse Oh my god he was So Sam Elliott in Roadhouse but in like an amazing and possibly like multi-fluorescent goth makeup just like Streaming down his face Clark recoils John John your face It's like you didn't even notice it Clark before but you knew like it was there But you didn't know and it wasn't there at all because when you look into someone's face you see What you know their face to be right you don't really see what they look like, you know, you see who they are John you're you're you've got to you got something under your eye It's it. I don't know. It's maybe it's maybe it's all maybe it's always been there. I don't I just never noticed that You know this stuff around us It's on you pass me your pocket mirror Here's my compact I open Clark's compact and I take a look do I see yeah you see Does it does it hurt?
