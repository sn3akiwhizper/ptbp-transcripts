1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,920
What's up? What's up? What's up? What's up? It's Zach. I'm Zach and I'm popping in here real quick

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:12,240
with a very fun announcement. But first a quick story. You know when me and Joe and Justin,

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,440
Luke and Thomas decided to make this show we had a silly little conversation about our pipe dreams

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:26,320
for PTBP and my deepest sincerest hope was that someone out there would draw a character or scene

5
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:33,920
that came from our brains. And well now there are more of you listening than I ever thought

6
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:40,160
would happen and the illustrations and the sketches that y'all have posted have not only

7
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:45,440
blown us away but they've helped us see these stories we've told through your perspectives which

8
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,800
is absolutely one of the coolest parts of this whole wild wonder of a situation that we're all

9
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:58,480
in together. So with all that being said we're gonna do a fan art contest drawing here in season

10
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:04,640
two. It's a contest because we're gonna pick a contest winner and it's a drawing because every

11
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:15,920
entry has an equal shot to win the drawing and it's a drawing because of the the the drawing and

12
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:22,720
I'm sorry for that what I just did so to make it up for you we'll do two drawings and each of the

13
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:29,280
two winners from the drawing drawings will receive any one item from the Pretending to be People

14
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,880
merch store. You want a shirt, a hat, a fanny pack, even a beach towel? Take your pick if you win and

15
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:42,000
you can win maybe if you give it a go. Speaking of winning the contest winner will receive any

16
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,800
three items from the Pretending to be People merch store. You want a shirt, a hat,

17

46
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:25,760
frequencies and vibrations it can produce certain effects certain behaviors

59
00:06:54,080 --> 00:07:01,760
similar to the futuristic tech the can crew saw in Godel's gorge to finish up the job Beck got

60
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:09,680
another top up while it was around Stevie shared some reddit articles showing unnaturally smooth

61
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:18,160
holes popping up or down rather all over the world unable to piece together the puzzle they decided

62
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:24,960
to wait for the reddit nerds to figure out where God will strike next and after hearing about Dr

63
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:31,360
Murray's wild night at the zeitgeist the gang is planning on checking out the scene before calling

oh good one cal thanks thanks still got it even late at night as each of you is starting to feel

135
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:59,040
the wear and tear of exhaustion and uh we got that energy drink baby multiple days the energy

136
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,840
drink is keeping you going and it is the only thing currently keeping you from rolling at a

137
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:10,400
disadvantage it may make it more difficult to sleep tonight uh julius do you have any more of

138
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:18,480
that that one i passed over to you he hands it back three sips is enough for cal colorado's

139
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,560
delicate ecosystem

140
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:27,120
do you remember that show parks and recreation with the life of man chris trigger

141
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,280
seldom ever related to a character more on tv

142
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:39,200
i like that show it was just nice julius pulls his gun out and is gonna like

143
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:46,000
swat style enter this building uh this is the first time that beck and cal have seen you

144
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:54,960
in this mode and stevie too is kind of in a worrisome confused excitement as uh they look

145
00:16:54,960 --> 00:17:00,080
over at you yeah cal's cows kind of freaked and he's like uh don't don't don't worry viewers at

146
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:05,280
home uh julius is our segment producer as you know he's he's relying on some training he had

147
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:11,120
before he came to uh to can and and we're really you know sorry to say strange things are happening

148
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:16,800
we've got to put the action and city action news we're gonna follow him inside the zeitgeist

149
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,640
julius clears the first room and starts up the stairs

150
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:30,720
as cal falls behind him he kind of like glances over at this uh like abandoned um reception desk

151
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:38,560
and the colors go like pink and electric blue and uh and you see a very a much younger cal

152
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:47,200
colorado like arguing with this this host he's like no i i specifically said i specifically

153
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:53,680
said 6 30 for friday evening cal colorado you must have it you bet yeah so i am not sure we

154
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:59,920
currently have that no but i made this weeks ago it's it's dreadfully important you said your name

155
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:11,360
was colorado yes colorado colorado cal colorado i'm sorry i don't usually yell but oh i'm i'm

156
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:16,720
going to ask the woman i love very dearly to marry me tonight what is that worth to you sir

157
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:24,160
everything i'm willing to spend my life with her he kind of holds at his hand expectingly oh

158
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:33,280
oh oh okay cal pulls out his wallet and gives you like 150 bucks in 1987 dollars

159
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:43,600
just make sure it's a good table she'll be here any minute and cal kind of like chuckles to

160
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:51,040
himself in the present walks back up the stairs he's going up the stairs bic uh has a big flood

161
00:18:51,040 --> 00:19:00,560
light on top of the camera at this point and you are showing the raggedy ass like paint chipped

162
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:07,920
walls of the stairway as you make your way up to the very top uh yeah each floor even has like a

163
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:14,240
number on it and some of the numbers are like peeling off julius on the way up points out

164
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:22,960
julius summers uh like scratched into the wall um but he knows that he did that a few days ago

165
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,880
but kind of pointing it out like look hey i've been here before

166
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,440
you were here a few days ago he doesn't say that out loud

167
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:38,320
julius this looks like it was scratched into these walls just a few days ago super fresh

168
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:43,840
julius like motions like because he's uh doing combat business

169
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,960
yeah cal quiet he's doing combat business you're you're right you're right

170
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,240
and uh julius proceeds to clear the front of the staircase

171
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:03,280
is it is it all all clear it's all clear it's all clear julius this looks pretty fresh just a few

172
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:10,000
days old why were you here recently it's from a long time ago what do you think beck it's dated

173
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:18,160
it's three days ago yeah uh just one of those crazy coincidence i wrote the first date i could

174
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:25,520
think of way back when that's wild that i'm here very close to that date not exactly on that date

175
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:33,200
though uh julius i don't think we believe you i mean i guess you guys are in this now i might

176
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:40,000
as well not lie yeah i was here this is where me and x meet up to uh talk business did you

177
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:47,120
know about what happened here no i i was here three days ago this happened last night still

178
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:53,040
it's a troubling connection i must say it is weird that like this is your secret place but

179
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:57,120
like a lot of not very secret stuff you think everywhere i go just has dead bodies

180
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:07,040
a lot of the places i've been with you it wasn't me i cut i don't mutilate the bodies it's not

181
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:18,400
about that oh jesus it's not about that what's it about i didn't do it i i believe you but did

182
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:24,640
you have any hand in setting it up i don't know anything about it i'm genuinely want to know i'm

183
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:31,040
trying to find out same thing you guys are do you remember if you picked this as your meeting place

184
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:35,840
or did x pick this as your meeting place we always meet at the tallest point wherever we are

185
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:43,200
impractical hey for everybody else it's impractical too so there's not a lot of people

186
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:52,240
there aren't any uh eight-story buildings in this neighborhood in the city those are on the other

187
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:59,920
side of the river that's right where we are is real heavy i get it you're your general locale

188
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:05,040
right your immediate it's tall it's the tallest thing around sure and it looks cool it's got

189
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:10,240
zeitgeist is the name you know it worked out well i guess also if you're like if you're not as close

190
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:14,800
as you thought you were maybe and you're at the top of the zeitgeist and x is at the top of the

191
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:18,880
next nearest building in her vicinity you could probably like shout it out or at least wave to

192
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,280
each other i hadn't thought about that but yeah if it ever doesn't work out that way you know you

193
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:28,320
could you could keep that in mind yeah or you guys could just talk at home well no that because who

194
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:34,160
knows you know you guys only talk in like your attic the high or on the roof no we don't i mean

195
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:39,680
we don't really interact too much i i don't really know her that well i just met her on this

196
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:51,440
assignment did you say online i mean i met her online when i was introduced by our boss but

197
00:22:52,080 --> 00:23:01,680
who's your boss x you know for now who introduced you it doesn't matter and he looks super sad and

198
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:09,920
he kind of just walks away and is gonna look around back did you get a sadness i saw that

199
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:16,160
did you did you was it framed well oh yeah okay we'll have to ask him about that you guys are

200
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:23,280
whispering to each other in this dilapidated room that cal still sees through his eyes here and there

201
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:33,680
here and there and it's former glory but now is as we've seen before you know windows are busted

202
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:43,440
out and the bar is just like overrun with like moss and age has clearly taken its toll even more

203
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:51,680
intensely now that nature has made its way into this abandoned structure i need you guys to roll

204
00:23:51,680 --> 00:24:06,160
sig into pass a 77 on a 60 well hold on i have a zero but you still roll for crits right yeah

205
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:13,520
i got a 69 holy fucking and i passed always a success yeah we've got a big crit we've got

206
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:20,320
a crit fail and then we've got a pass yeah cal's eyes are darting across this room and he hasn't

207
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:27,920
he hasn't been here like since it shut down and his memory of it is so vivid this day was so

208
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:32,720
important to him he can easily see like all these these things he remembers and they're you know

209
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:40,160
broken and turned over and you walk over to the like beautiful window booth that you sat in the

210
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:46,880
best seat in the house and as you approach it when you look down you're standing next to julia

211
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:52,160
summers and the two of you are looking down directly into the spot where there are holes

212
00:24:53,280 --> 00:25:00,560
covering the ground that have been excavated and refilled and each of you is familiar with braille

213
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:08,000
for one reason or another and you quickly surmise the code punched into the ground

214
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:15,840
number sign h c f which you know means

215
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:23,280
i have literally no idea you don't because you just passed you you put it together you're like

216
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:32,160
number hcf huh and cal with the 69 you know that braille num numerical values the numbers

217
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:38,560
eight three six three six beck's over on the opposite side of the room filming a dripping pipe

218
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,480
i'm getting some good footage over here guys beck uh beck come over here a moment

219
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,720
no hang on i want to get some more of this hang on no you've got to see these holes you got to

220
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:56,560
see this pipe it is dripping becketh come film this all right okay if i could feel that with

221
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:02,800
my thumb i would know what it said no no uh julius i i did a three-part series where i

222
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:07,520
lived as a blind homeless man on the streets of the city i remember that yeah i learned braille

223
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:14,720
it says hcf i gave you money at some point when you did that i didn't know it was you well i'm

224
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,720
glad you were one of the ones who gave me money instead of beating me up and taking that makes

225
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:25,760
really hard to see if he which money did but uh look julius it's it's the letters hcf but there's

226
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:30,800
a pound sign a number sign in front of it eight three six it says eight three six how'd you do

227
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:38,400
that so fast i i can read braille i know but i just have to feel it but how'd you convert it

228
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:47,920
out numerically so quickly what you don't know everything about me clearly i guess not you you

229
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:58,640
contain great depths maria summers cow and the other two real grip cow and the rest uh pass but

230
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:09,360
why uh i do not pass a crit fail begets a crit success it's an 11. hey nice i didn't pass uh

231
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:17,840
okay uh julius you're gonna lose one as this number has shown up once more in your lives

232
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:26,320
and you are having a harder and harder time keeping a grip on reality when there's clearly

233
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:35,440
some sort of numerical value that is like following you beck this only strengthens your

234
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:43,520
resolve once again i think you should feel good gain one grip and cal you recognize it

235
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:49,360
how is this number continuing to show up it's pretty straightforward it's a gottel

236
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:58,080
corp conspiracy the number is significant to them in some way perhaps it's stevie yeah

237
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,880
the number is eight three six mean anything to you uh

238
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,360
no what was your grandfather's birthday august 36th

239
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,480
that's that's it

240
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,480
why is that weird was that a real answer

241
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:31,120
no i was doing it i was doing a joke did you yeah that's a pretty good joke stevie thanks

242
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:40,320
julius is gonna google 836 do it and then 836 conspiracy and then google do it again

243
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,560
do you know what the first thing that comes up is

244
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:53,920
is it the transcripts oh my god is that what's happening

245
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,040
that is not the first thing that comes up when i google it

246
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:08,720
for me it's thompson rudder's practical law it says 5a836 conspiracy to murder

247
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:17,360
well that's my third one so uh julius does that and it puts his phone back in his pocket

248
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:24,880
uh it was a leap year is that anything what was no i don't think so 836 like i meant maybe like

249
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:32,400
august 1936 oh yeah no i i don't even know my grandpa's birthday like do you know your

let me let me get a search role while you guys are up here since you're since you're up here

255
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:15,040
oh yeah looking down around the beautiful sights below yeah so cal spots whatever it is with these

with a 21 on a 60. fuck yeah what do we got i did not pass a 58 on a 40 once again back

257
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:27,600
just distracted by the drip a mouse just went by i am chasing it in a crazy outfit

258
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:42,240
oh the drip i get it and uh how did joyus 13 on 70 the two of you see a a glint in the moonlight

259
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:49,680
hidden under some brush a little bit into kind of the thick of the tree line

260
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:57,200
past where people would hang out there uh you know they're like picnic tables and stuff about

261
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:03,600
of course those are gross and old too but a little bit further in where one might get

262
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:10,960
ticks i'm not stalling you see something shiny julius do you see do you see that shining out

263
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:16,000
there yeah i thought it was just like tricking me but i've seen it like five or six times it kind of

264
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:22,400

just a quick reminder from your local luck council zach thank you you're welcome he shouts to the

320

322
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,280
yo she took my breath away and he covers

323
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:48,560
he leaves enough money on the table to cover the bill and then they go downstairs

324
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:53,920
julius kicks open the door at the bottom of the zeitgeist

325
00:37:53,920 --> 00:38:03,200
back back did you get that that one i got hell yeah and as you do so the four of you walk

326
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:12,720
confidently as a team across the grounds of the zeitgeist here on this misty dark heavy summer

327
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:21,120
night eight three six punched into the ground to the left of you and in your direct path in

328
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:29,840
your future now lies whatever it was that caught your eye and as you continue approaching the edge

329
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:43,200
of the woods you see the glint of the tip of a very pristine and sharp shovel

330
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:57,120
the scariest gardening tool because it's a horror podcast yeah oh my god it's a shovel

331
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:06,880
no no anything but that anything but a shovel is it like just stuck in the ground or it's just

332
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:15,280
laying on the ground and it looks like it's been covered purposely by some randomly assorted

333
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:20,160
shrubbery and foliage i could use a disguise roll to see that

334
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:30,800
the earth is disguised around the shovel yeah it very much is you can just uh very clear uh i mean

335
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:35,200
you can roll for that if you want but you can very clearly tell that yes it was disguised it was uh

336
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:39,840
hidden it was it was purposefully yeah and therefore the most obvious and clever way to

337
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:49,760
unhide or disguise it to remove the stuff on top of it the shovel now uh with the foliage removed

338
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:56,320
uh you can just see it is an extremely clean pristine clean and sharp shovel look as i

339
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:02,240
undisguised the shovel a shovel like that looks really valuable maybe someone carved their name

340
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:12,640
into it it's a thought and he chucks it at julius take a look grabs the shovel and really

341
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:18,000
thoroughly inspects that shovel well let's see uh what would you like to roll to see if there's

342
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:32,160
a name on this shovel how about alertness i'll give you a search pass 40 on the 70. okay

343
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:39,840
absolutely as you search around uh this shovel you see that uh it's actually got a um like a cover

344
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:47,680
like a tip on the end of it for nice gripping on that side but as you peel it back a little bit

345
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:57,120
you see etched into the wood the name dr brock hargrave do you guys uh you know who brock

346
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:04,480
hargrave is dr park park hargar son of a bitch dr brock hargrave i've interviewed him a dozen times

347
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:10,400

354
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:49,040

355
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:53,520

and julius pulls out his readers but they don't help

370
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:58,000
uh and julius has trained himself to see in the dark aka looking over beck's shoulder in the

371
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:05,280
viewfinder all right the two of you notice wait what's that

372
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:15,520

373
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:26,240
underfoot and has made its way into the ground becoming one with kind of the the grass and the

374
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:31,600
and the flowers and the weeds that surround it but it doesn't look like it's been here for a

375
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:39,280
long time just that it got stepped on a few times and is it's now stuck and obscured from

376
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:45,040
most people's sight hey steve you were always you're picking up my trash there's trash see

377
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:52,080

378
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:56,880
like trash they're looking out for the environment but that's no way to talk about your junior

379
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:01,920
segment producer yeah oh hey this is not the kind of workplace we're trying to foster here

381
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:11,120
files julius julius kind of that's not gonna fly and picks up the piece of trash

387
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:56,880

388
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:02,400
am scared of how it works they don't tell you how you gotta just go figure it out

389

probably nothing's wrong with you oh i can keep telling myself that if i don't go

391
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:21,920
what happens when i when julius picks this ziploc bag up dude the smell is overwhelming

392
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:26,800
you pick up just the slightest hint of some sort of saline

393
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:36,160
salty oceany and then all of a sudden it's overwhelming and it's all you can

394
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:44,000
smell and you're just back in that moment seeing that entity that thing that

395
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:47,520
wet energy

396
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:56,640

399
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:17,040

406
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:19,680
night in the thick heavy fog surrounding everyone with this blood curdling scream something tingles

407
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:28,560
in the back of your necks you have a weird feeling like you're um in a graveyard at night

408
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:35,200
it's probably all the mist and holes beck whips the camera around to julius that bag's got

409
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:42,000
something bags got gone and it's got something to do with god hey back i smelled god back

410
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:47,120
we're on a mission from god the blues brothers yeah yeah we were just listening to it yeah

411
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:53,840
julius what what did you see in there it's the same smell i smelled in grover's gorge

412
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:02,720
it's just it's what god smells like and i as soon as i touched it i just that's all i could

413
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:16,960
even feel what does god smell like like salt water like just it's like just fucking

414
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:25,760
nasty seawater and it just takes over you can't think about anything except the smell

415
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:30,080
beck zooms in on the bag are you holding it still or is it on the ground

416
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:38,080
up to you he let go of it as soon as he could beck zooms in on it on the ground does he see

417
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:48,720
anything there's a little dark waxy substance as you zoom in closer it's it's like on it's

418
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:54,560
on the outside of the bag and you see that the ziploc is like turned inside out i think it got

419
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:59,120
turned inside out took it eaten does it look like somebody took a bite out of it

420
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:04,960
julius if you're saying that smells like god whatever the fuck that means i don't think we

421
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:10,240
should touch it the last guy that we saw come in contact with the god thing is now ripping

422
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:15,840
holes throughout the world i mean that's the clue we should probably bag it up somehow safe

423
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:24,000
stevie pulls a uh another ziploc bag stevie god is in your brother and i smelled god maybe if you

424
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:30,480

425
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:35,120
you against that but he's your brother so no their eyes are huge and they're just looking at

426
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:40,400
you and you say advice against that they're just like yes like not like absolutely nodding like

427
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:45,920
you're right no no he's your brother and i don't want to get between family but sure sure yeah

428
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:49,280
all right so i guess you don't want to find your brother

429
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:53,280
can i roll persuade

430
00:50:56,160 --> 00:51:04,320
they take the bag that's inside out and put it inside a clean ziploc they kind of take a

431
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:13,840
quick smell and their face just like goes somewhere else for a second and then they close it

432
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:20,560
yeah you all right you still with us they're looking at julius do you smell it yeah

433
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:29,040
whoa julius like eyeballs the bag again well now i want to see what god smells like give it here

434
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:39,040
beck hold on don't be so rash you've got to film me fill it at first

435
00:51:43,840 --> 00:52:03,040
and it's all my fault

436
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:11,680
suddenly cal's little hearing aid is it's discreet you've not noticed it before

437
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:18,720
he's a vain man but it starts ringing like crazy and he he hones in on the source of this this

438
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:23,360
signal or are you trying to get us to decipher a code that is deciphering a code for sure

439
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:36,880
the same thing happens to his eye implant

440
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:42,820
