0	5920	What's up? What's up? What's up? What's up? It's Zach. I'm Zach and I'm popping in here real quick
5920	12240	with a very fun announcement. But first a quick story. You know when me and Joe and Justin,
12240	17440	Luke and Thomas decided to make this show we had a silly little conversation about our pipe dreams
17440	26320	for PTBP and my deepest sincerest hope was that someone out there would draw a character or scene
26320	33920	that came from our brains. And well now there are more of you listening than I ever thought
34480	40160	would happen and the illustrations and the sketches that y'all have posted have not only
40160	45440	blown us away but they've helped us see these stories we've told through your perspectives which
45440	50800	is absolutely one of the coolest parts of this whole wild wonder of a situation that we're all
50800	58480	in together. So with all that being said we're gonna do a fan art contest drawing here in season
58480	64640	two. It's a contest because we're gonna pick a contest winner and it's a drawing because every
64640	75920	entry has an equal shot to win the drawing and it's a drawing because of the the the drawing and
75920	82720	I'm sorry for that what I just did so to make it up for you we'll do two drawings and each of the
82720	89280	two winners from the drawing drawings will receive any one item from the Pretending to be People
89280	94880	merch store. You want a shirt, a hat, a fanny pack, even a beach towel? Take your pick if you win and
94880	102000	you can win maybe if you give it a go. Speaking of winning the contest winner will receive any
102640	106800	three items from the Pretending to be People merch store. You want a shirt, a hat,
106800	113680	and a beach towel? You want three fanny packs? Do whatever you want! Okay also for this year contest
113680	119440	slash drawing we're gonna go ahead and say let's keep it to stuff created by your brain and your
119440	125520	hands without the use of AIs. Pretty wild times that we're specifying that right? Yeah but uh
125520	130960	you know also go buck wild on the medium itself if you want I don't know. Draw and illustrate
130960	136240	of course we fucking love that shit but feel free to write some fanfic or do a sculpture
136240	141440	or choreograph and produce and film a flash mob or whatever your heart desires we're super stoked to

406000	414080	it is time for the news last time Dr Murray sewed up Julius's shoulder and then whipped out a device
414080	421760	similar to the futuristic tech the can crew saw in Godel's gorge to finish up the job Beck got
421760	429680	another top up while it was around Stevie shared some reddit articles showing unnaturally smooth
429680	438160	holes popping up or down rather all over the world unable to piece together the puzzle they decided
438160	444960	to wait for the reddit nerds to figure out where God will strike next and after hearing about Dr
444960	451360	Murray's wild night at the zeitgeist the gang is planning on checking out the scene before calling

1020080	1025280	home uh julius is our segment producer as you know he's he's relying on some training he had

1031120	1036800	we've got to put the action and city action news we're gonna follow him inside the zeitgeist
1037680	1040640	julius clears the first room and starts up the stairs
1044800	1050720	as cal falls behind him he kind of like glances over at this uh like abandoned um reception desk
1051280	1058560	and the colors go like pink and electric blue and uh and you see a very a much younger cal
1058560	1067200	colorado like arguing with this this host he's like no i i specifically said i specifically

1104240	1113280	oh oh okay cal pulls out his wallet and gives you like 150 bucks in 1987 dollars
1117200	1123600	just make sure it's a good table she'll be here any minute and cal kind of like chuckles to
1123600	1131040	himself in the present walks back up the stairs he's going up the stairs bic uh has a big flood
1131040	1140560	light on top of the camera at this point and you are showing the raggedy ass like paint chipped
1140560	1147920	walls of the stairway as you make your way up to the very top uh yeah each floor even has like a
1147920	1154240	number on it and some of the numbers are like peeling off julius on the way up points out
1154240	1162960	julius summers uh like scratched into the wall um but he knows that he did that a few days ago
1163760	1166880	but kind of pointing it out like look hey i've been here before
1168720	1171440	you were here a few days ago he doesn't say that out loud
1173520	1178320	julius this looks like it was scratched into these walls just a few days ago super fresh
1178640	1183840	julius like motions like because he's uh doing combat business
1186960	1190960	yeah cal quiet he's doing combat business you're you're right you're right
1190960	1194240	and uh julius proceeds to clear the front of the staircase
1196240	1203280	is it is it all all clear it's all clear it's all clear julius this looks pretty fresh just a few
1203280	1210000	days old why were you here recently it's from a long time ago what do you think beck it's dated
1210000	1218160	it's three days ago yeah uh just one of those crazy coincidence i wrote the first date i could
1218160	1225520	think of way back when that's wild that i'm here very close to that date not exactly on that date
1225520	1233200	though uh julius i don't think we believe you i mean i guess you guys are in this now i might
1233200	1240000	as well not lie yeah i was here this is where me and x meet up to uh talk business did you
1240000	1247120	know about what happened here no i i was here three days ago this happened last night still
1247120	1253040	it's a troubling connection i must say it is weird that like this is your secret place but
1253040	1257120	like a lot of not very secret stuff you think everywhere i go just has dead bodies
1257360	1267040	a lot of the places i've been with you it wasn't me i cut i don't mutilate the bodies it's not
1267040	1278400	about that oh jesus it's not about that what's it about i didn't do it i i believe you but did
1278400	1284640	you have any hand in setting it up i don't know anything about it i'm genuinely want to know i'm
1284640	1291040	trying to find out same thing you guys are do you remember if you picked this as your meeting place
1291040	1295840	or did x pick this as your meeting place we always meet at the tallest point wherever we are
1296880	1303200	impractical hey for everybody else it's impractical too so there's not a lot of people
1304720	1312240	there aren't any uh eight-story buildings in this neighborhood in the city those are on the other
1312240	1319920	side of the river that's right where we are is real heavy i get it you're your general locale
1319920	1325040	right your immediate it's tall it's the tallest thing around sure and it looks cool it's got
1325040	1330240	zeitgeist is the name you know it worked out well i guess also if you're like if you're not as close
1330240	1334800	as you thought you were maybe and you're at the top of the zeitgeist and x is at the top of the
1334800	1338880	next nearest building in her vicinity you could probably like shout it out or at least wave to
1338880	1343280	each other i hadn't thought about that but yeah if it ever doesn't work out that way you know you
1343280	1348320	could you could keep that in mind yeah or you guys could just talk at home well no that because who
1348320	1354160	knows you know you guys only talk in like your attic the high or on the roof no we don't i mean
1354160	1359680	we don't really interact too much i i don't really know her that well i just met her on this
1359680	1371440	assignment did you say online i mean i met her online when i was introduced by our boss but
1372080	1381680	who's your boss x you know for now who introduced you it doesn't matter and he looks super sad and
1381680	1389920	he kind of just walks away and is gonna look around back did you get a sadness i saw that
1389920	1396160	did you did you was it framed well oh yeah okay we'll have to ask him about that you guys are
1396160	1403280	whispering to each other in this dilapidated room that cal still sees through his eyes here and there
1403680	1413680	here and there and it's former glory but now is as we've seen before you know windows are busted
1413680	1423440	out and the bar is just like overrun with like moss and age has clearly taken its toll even more
1423440	1431680	intensely now that nature has made its way into this abandoned structure i need you guys to roll
1431680	1446160	sig into pass a 77 on a 60 well hold on i have a zero but you still roll for crits right yeah
1446160	1453520	i got a 69 holy fucking and i passed always a success yeah we've got a big crit we've got
1453520	1460320	a crit fail and then we've got a pass yeah cal's eyes are darting across this room and he hasn't
1460320	1467920	he hasn't been here like since it shut down and his memory of it is so vivid this day was so
1467920	1472720	important to him he can easily see like all these these things he remembers and they're you know
1472720	1480160	broken and turned over and you walk over to the like beautiful window booth that you sat in the
1480160	1486880	best seat in the house and as you approach it when you look down you're standing next to julia
1486880	1492160	summers and the two of you are looking down directly into the spot where there are holes
1493280	1500560	covering the ground that have been excavated and refilled and each of you is familiar with braille
1501600	1508000	for one reason or another and you quickly surmise the code punched into the ground
1508880	1515840	number sign h c f which you know means
1517760	1523280	i have literally no idea you don't because you just passed you you put it together you're like
1523280	1532160	number hcf huh and cal with the 69 you know that braille num numerical values the numbers
1532960	1538560	eight three six three six beck's over on the opposite side of the room filming a dripping pipe
1540640	1544480	i'm getting some good footage over here guys beck uh beck come over here a moment
1544480	1548720	no hang on i want to get some more of this hang on no you've got to see these holes you got to
1548720	1556560	see this pipe it is dripping becketh come film this all right okay if i could feel that with
1556560	1562800	my thumb i would know what it said no no uh julius i i did a three-part series where i
1562800	1567520	lived as a blind homeless man on the streets of the city i remember that yeah i learned braille
1568800	1574720	it says hcf i gave you money at some point when you did that i didn't know it was you well i'm
1574720	1578720	glad you were one of the ones who gave me money instead of beating me up and taking that makes
1578720	1585760	really hard to see if he which money did but uh look julius it's it's the letters hcf but there's
1585760	1590800	a pound sign a number sign in front of it eight three six it says eight three six how'd you do
1590800	1598400	that so fast i i can read braille i know but i just have to feel it but how'd you convert it
1598400	1607920	out numerically so quickly what you don't know everything about me clearly i guess not you you
1607920	1618640	contain great depths maria summers cow and the other two real grip cow and the rest uh pass but
1619600	1629360	why uh i do not pass a crit fail begets a crit success it's an 11. hey nice i didn't pass uh
1629360	1637840	okay uh julius you're gonna lose one as this number has shown up once more in your lives
1638720	1646320	and you are having a harder and harder time keeping a grip on reality when there's clearly
1646320	1655440	some sort of numerical value that is like following you beck this only strengthens your
1655440	1663520	resolve once again i think you should feel good gain one grip and cal you recognize it
1664720	1669360	how is this number continuing to show up it's pretty straightforward it's a gottel
1669360	1678080	corp conspiracy the number is significant to them in some way perhaps it's stevie yeah
1678160	1680880	the number is eight three six mean anything to you uh

1857200	1863600	of course those are gross and old too but a little bit further in where one might get
1863600	1870960	ticks i'm not stalling you see something shiny julius do you see do you see that shining out
1870960	1876000	there yeah i thought it was just like tricking me but i've seen it like five or six times it kind of
1876560	1882400	comes in between the trees it looks like there's ticks out there i wish we had jeremy with us
1882400	1892240	do you have his number right oh yeah cal sites texting jeremy get him out here tell him to bring
1892240	1902480	off meet at zeitgeist immediately or asap with off it uh as you go to text it says jeremy the

1907680	1913920	notifications are currently turned off notify anyway hey if i call him you can click notify
1913920	1924640	anyway oh i click notify anyway cal what do you bet i could get this uh this stuffed bigfoot
1924640	1934080	into one of those holes uh 50 dollars julius positions the bigfoot on his on his foot
1934880	1940160	and like kind of eyes it and gives it a little kick trying to get it right into the hole this
1940160	1948720	is peak role playing role athletics or if you have like a carnival skill no that's a 90.
1948720	1952880	well that isn't gonna do it you did a lot of practice rolling before do you think that
1952880	1960560	helped i hurt damn can i push the push the rule uh in order to push the rule you would have to
1960560	1967920	risk like falling out the window oh don't for the that's a pass
1970240	1971280	fucking idiot
1973600	1978800	this would have been like so much of the story depends on your roommate i would have killed you
1978800	1983360	right now i wouldn't even for doing that shit i would have killed you right now i've been happy
1983360	1992160	with it uh 86 is what you would roll fortunately i pass uh and so he flicks it off his foot and
1992160	1998800	it's not aimed correctly nope and so at the very end he re he like leans out the window and flicks
1998800	2004320	it and it goes into the hole do you uh you think that means something uh well that's one of the
2004320	2008960	damnedest things i've ever seen beck were you filming that uh please please please tell me
2009280	2014080	beck is in another corner and it's a bunch of tables and he's kind of poking at him with his
2014080	2019520	foot and they all slide i got a really good one over here there's a table sliding like there was
2019520	2023600	something behind him or something kind of spooky like it's a good shot guys beck you gotta be
2023600	2029760	careful to not make the news you know what i mean oh yeah no i just thought we'd like spice it up a
2029760	2035200	little like nothing's really doing anything so far cal is looking at you like in astonishment
2035200	2041840	and pride he's like you've really learned a thing or two in your time here i mean i learned it all
2041840	2049920	from you guys so you sounded like a producer he gets a little bit sad but he he's like no no no
2049920	2057600	that's that's cal let's go see the shiny thing julius you know if i'm the head boss if x makes

2082080	2089280	is going on here okay hold up i i might be am i not following this way you could have
2089280	2097760	because tife i and she kind of looks at julius and grimace isn't um well you'll be the like
2098400	2107040	lead producer so like wouldn't julius's role still just be what i am or we could bump you
2107040	2111520	up one and you essentially do the same thing but stevie also does that too whoa would you
2111520	2115920	like to be a segment producer stevie by being confused that's amazing is that what you were
2115920	2122240	asking for yes that is what i was asking for wow and beck you're good where you are yeah okay let's

2139040	2145760	okay and he starts clearing the stairwell do the news yeah and as as everybody walks down cow
2145760	2153280	lingers at the top and he sees he sees himself down on one knee the air has like a fine mist
2153280	2161440	like a white haze in it um from all the coke and you and you see yeah and and cow you you do
2161440	2167040	believe has not done any cocaine but it's in its system and with the courage he's never known he's

2173920	2181120	you make me the happiest newsman in the world would you be my wife and she bursts into tears
2181120	2186000	and gives him a big hug and she says yes cal yes i never thought you'd ask you were so hesitant
2186720	2190800	virginia when i think about the rest of our life nothing makes me want to hesitate i want to start
2190800	2196400	it right fucking now and he like picks her up and walks her out of the restaurant and the whole
2196400	2203360	place is fucking cheering and you see cal like looking back and smiling on that uh and he uh
2206080	2210160	he sniffs asks he shouts julius do you have
2210160	2213520	any more of that energy drink uh and heads on down the stairs
2215680	2220720	oh man i don't want to be too weird but like that was cool man thanks
2221280	2228480	good shit do you have luck uh i should have used it if you already have it because you got it
2228480	2234240	again again again i actually have two scratches written down so i don't know if that's happened
2234240	2242400	before i should probably spend my luck if you fail a roll guys luck can help if it's appropriate
2242400	2248640	just a quick reminder from your local luck council zach thank you you're welcome he shouts to the
2248640	2254800	restaurant i've got some news everybody we're getting married and take my breath away
2255440	2257040	swells like fucking crazy
2261360	2263280	yo she took my breath away and he covers
2265120	2268560	he leaves enough money on the table to cover the bill and then they go downstairs
2270160	2273920	julius kicks open the door at the bottom of the zeitgeist
2273920	2283200	back back did you get that that one i got hell yeah and as you do so the four of you walk
2283200	2292720	confidently as a team across the grounds of the zeitgeist here on this misty dark heavy summer
2292720	2301120	night eight three six punched into the ground to the left of you and in your direct path in
2301120	2309840	your future now lies whatever it was that caught your eye and as you continue approaching the edge
2309840	2323200	of the woods you see the glint of the tip of a very pristine and sharp shovel
2323200	2337120	the scariest gardening tool because it's a horror podcast yeah oh my god it's a shovel
2338160	2346880	no no anything but that anything but a shovel is it like just stuck in the ground or it's just
2346880	2355280	laying on the ground and it looks like it's been covered purposely by some randomly assorted
2356560	2360160	shrubbery and foliage i could use a disguise roll to see that
2362640	2370800	the earth is disguised around the shovel yeah it very much is you can just uh very clear uh i mean
2370800	2375200	you can roll for that if you want but you can very clearly tell that yes it was disguised it was uh
2375200	2379840	hidden it was it was purposefully yeah and therefore the most obvious and clever way to
2379840	2389760	unhide or disguise it to remove the stuff on top of it the shovel now uh with the foliage removed
2389760	2396320	uh you can just see it is an extremely clean pristine clean and sharp shovel look as i
2396320	2402240	undisguised the shovel a shovel like that looks really valuable maybe someone carved their name
2402240	2412640	into it it's a thought and he chucks it at julius take a look grabs the shovel and really
2412640	2418000	thoroughly inspects that shovel well let's see uh what would you like to roll to see if there's
2418000	2432160	a name on this shovel how about alertness i'll give you a search pass 40 on the 70. okay
2432160	2439840	absolutely as you search around uh this shovel you see that uh it's actually got a um like a cover
2439840	2447680	like a tip on the end of it for nice gripping on that side but as you peel it back a little bit
2447680	2457120	you see etched into the wood the name dr brock hargrave do you guys uh you know who brock
2457120	2464480	hargrave is dr park park hargar son of a bitch dr brock hargrave i've interviewed him a dozen times

2619200	2626720	and julius pulls out his readers but they don't help
2629520	2638000	uh and julius has trained himself to see in the dark aka looking over beck's shoulder in the
2638000	2645280	viewfinder all right the two of you notice wait what's that
2647840	2655520	a little ziploc bag it looks like a little ziploc bag it's been like for ham sandwiches trampled
2656240	2666240	underfoot and has made its way into the ground becoming one with kind of the the grass and the
2666240	2671600	and the flowers and the weeds that surround it but it doesn't look like it's been here for a
2671600	2679280	long time just that it got stepped on a few times and is it's now stuck and obscured from
2679280	2685040	most people's sight hey steve you were always you're picking up my trash there's trash see
2685040	2692080	what it is whoa yeah julius man they're always picking up my energy drinks i figured they just
2692080	2696880	like trash they're looking out for the environment but that's no way to talk about your junior
2696880	2701920	segment producer yeah oh hey this is not the kind of workplace we're trying to foster here
2701920	2705760	yeah this could be a learning moment for you yeah i don't know how you do things in the x
2705760	2711120	files julius julius kind of that's not gonna fly and picks up the piece of trash
2712400	2717760	uh well when you go and pick up the piece of trash i need you to roll uh grip
2717760	2721920	uh not pass fail

2756880	2762400	am scared of how it works they don't tell you how you gotta just go figure it out
2763440	2768240	seems like a nightmare and i'm scared about it and i uh busy i'm too busy plus nothing
2768240	2771360	probably nothing's wrong with you oh i can keep telling myself that if i don't go
2772080	2781920	what happens when i when julius picks this ziploc bag up dude the smell is overwhelming
2781920	2786800	you pick up just the slightest hint of some sort of saline
2789280	2796160	salty oceany and then all of a sudden it's overwhelming and it's all you can
2796160	2804000	smell and you're just back in that moment seeing that entity that thing that
2806640	2807520	wet energy

2889520	2899680	night in the thick heavy fog surrounding everyone with this blood curdling scream something tingles
2899760	2908560	in the back of your necks you have a weird feeling like you're um in a graveyard at night
2909440	2915200	it's probably all the mist and holes beck whips the camera around to julius that bag's got
2915200	2922000	something bags got gone and it's got something to do with god hey back i smelled god back
2922000	2927120	we're on a mission from god the blues brothers yeah yeah we were just listening to it yeah
2927920	2933840	julius what what did you see in there it's the same smell i smelled in grover's gorge
2936480	2942720	it's just it's what god smells like and i as soon as i touched it i just that's all i could
