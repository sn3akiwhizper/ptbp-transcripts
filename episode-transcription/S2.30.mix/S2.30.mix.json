{"text": " What's up? What's up? What's up? What's up? It's Zach. I'm Zach and I'm popping in here real quick with a very fun announcement. But first a quick story. You know when me and Joe and Justin, Luke and Thomas decided to make this show we had a silly little conversation about our pipe dreams for PTBP and my deepest sincerest hope was that someone out there would draw a character or scene that came from our brains. And well now there are more of you listening than I ever thought would happen and the illustrations and the sketches that y'all have posted have not only blown us away but they've helped us see these stories we've told through your perspectives which is absolutely one of the coolest parts of this whole wild wonder of a situation that we're all in together. So with all that being said we're gonna do a fan art contest drawing here in season two. It's a contest because we're gonna pick a contest winner and it's a drawing because every entry has an equal shot to win the drawing and it's a drawing because of the the the drawing and I'm sorry for that what I just did so to make it up for you we'll do two drawings and each of the two winners from the drawing drawings will receive any one item from the Pretending to be People merch store. You want a shirt, a hat, a fanny pack, even a beach towel? Take your pick if you win and you can win maybe if you give it a go. Speaking of winning the contest winner will receive any three items from the Pretending to be People merch store. You want a shirt, a hat, and a beach towel? You want three fanny packs? Do whatever you want! Okay also for this year contest slash drawing we're gonna go ahead and say let's keep it to stuff created by your brain and your hands without the use of AIs. Pretty wild times that we're specifying that right? Yeah but uh you know also go buck wild on the medium itself if you want I don't know. Draw and illustrate of course we fucking love that shit but feel free to write some fanfic or do a sculpture or choreograph and produce and film a flash mob or whatever your heart desires we're super stoked to see whatever you come up with and when you're ready to enter the contest slash drawing head on over to reddit.com slash pretending to be people and find the pin thread at the top.

other messy freaks like yourself in the discord and subreddit the links to all these delightful destinations and more well my nasty friends the links are in the show notes turning now from informing to selling it is time for the news last time Dr Murray sewed up Julius's shoulder and then whipped out a device similar to the futuristic tech the can crew saw in Godel's gorge to finish up the job Beck got another top up while it was around Stevie shared some reddit articles showing unnaturally smooth holes popping up or down rather all over the world unable to piece together the puzzle they decided to wait for the reddit nerds to figure out where God will strike next and after hearing about Dr Murray's wild night at the zeitgeist the gang is planning on checking out the scene before calling in the night it's been a long day and a long night and it could get longer at any moment taking us now to the 30th episode here in season two of pretending to be people it's altar girl with my life is great and it's all my fault because my life is great 30 seconds of silence please the Luke Ginniman story it sounded like I said 30 seconds of silence please and then you said he said gop but I was thinking if I see a cop I kill him the Luke Ginnigan story the Luke Gigigan over and over Luke loves quagmire we call him the Giggity man I do like 30 seconds of silence please that's yeah that's what you're gonna call your memoir about raising your kids someday I hope it sells well I did too Thomas thinks you're gonna have loud kids probably no I just think you're gonna write hack comedy about them it's unfortunately it's take my wife please back in my day that's how all the jokes start every single one you used to be able to yep you fill the last part in call someone on a pay phone yeah that's a good one true yeah it's hard to do now c-o-l-l-e-c-t dial down the middle bob she had a baby it's a boy bob she had a baby it's a boy um didn't alph do collect calls I'm alph and calling collect is out of this world and I think he eats cats or something I believe so it was uh Paul Reiser too I remember the Paul Reiser 1-800-C-O-L-E-C-T I'm mad about calling collect yup is that really what it was I maybe I was young enough that I knew him from that show so maybe I'm just filling in those blanks I don't know who Paul Reiser is he's the guy from mad about you I don't know what mad about you is and a bunch of other stuff he's actually Paul Reiser's in it Helen Hunt was mad about you weren't you I don't think you can say that I'm Cal Colorado and I'm standing outside the zeitgeist once the city's pride enjoyed our sparkling spire now a decrepit needle of shame poking our skyline in the eye and popping our civic pride last night we're told something very strange happened here the gops won't look into it so we will follow me and we're out dude good one cal thanks back and uh cal gets kind of a distant look in his eyes and uh take my breath away starts playing as the camera pans up from the parking lot to the restaurant level of the zeitgeist and text over the screen says august 1987 everyone's on coke except for cal color but he doesn't notice because he only has eyes for um Virginia uh his fiance whose last name I haven't made up wolf Virginia wolf wait Virginia wolf the dog whoa dude because that's from our podcast it is from our podcast what about Virginia wolf the dog the bounty hunter he's he's sitting across Virginia wolf the dog the bounty hunter Biden oh oh so you're sitting there with Virginia wolf the dog the bounty hunter Biden and cal's sitting across from the love of his life Virginia McIntyre she's wearing a uh a tan like power suit and her hair is fucking huge and so are our peoples because she's on coke too cal is sweating fucking bullets because he's coming down from coke because he's about to ask her to marry him and he's about to say Virginia do you remember our first date here uh when something catches his eye in the parking lot and we flash back down to the present day and uh cal kind of like shakes himself out of it and he says uh yeah thanks back uh let's kind of do this one you know loose and live almost like we're investigative war reporters you know what I mean yeah like on cops yeah like we're like we're cops I don't know if I have the stamina as like one of those guys but yeah I'll keep up have one of those energy drinks give me one of those energy drinks too whoa cal are you sure he kind of like sniffs and his eyes get a hazy far away look and he's like yeah something about this place just it's late I need a I need a pet me up a little kick sure here you go the sound of the can opening uh like Pavlov reaction in Julius and he just reaches his hand out for an energy drink I pass him one chugs it throws it over his shoulder and takes a look cal takes like two careful sips out of his and then passes the rest to you julius julius is double fisting energy drink single fist and you just threw the other one over your shoulder yeah stevie already picked it up and tossed it in the recycling okay he's sipping on this one and you all see um or we see Beck Wilder cal colorado julius summers stevie gottel approaching the zeitgeist up from where they did the spot in the parking lot with the zeitgeist up in the background cal colorado strong in the foreground it's a hazy night late late heavy humid summer night the air is thick with the humidity and the presence of what happened here as you walk up Beck directs his camera at some holes that have been dug in the ground recently as of last night seemingly looks like it's been covered Beck Beck are you getting this it's it's holes yes they're they're they're not they're not all that smooth what's that in there disturbed get the camera on that zooms in julius julius pick that up yeah julius hops and grabs there's a bigfoot stuffy julius what you've got it's uh like a carnival toy it's a goddamn bigfoot you see another one strewn on the ground nearby there's a small one julius like you do like x-files type stuff is is this a clue are these real i'd say it's probably a clue have you seen a bigfoot julius julius shrugs holy shit you seen a bigfoot julius have you seen a fucking bigfoot uh don't no but i heard about him okay okay never mind never mind that look it looks like the door has been forced open recently can i get a second roll actually sorry real quick i i'm gonna ignore what i just said and so are you sorry you were saying the door was a jar the door is a jar so we better find a lid for it oh good one cal thanks thanks still got it even late at night as each of you is starting to feel the wear and tear of exhaustion and uh we got that energy drink baby multiple days the energy drink is keeping you going and it is the only thing currently keeping you from rolling at a disadvantage it may make it more difficult to sleep tonight uh julius do you have any more of that that one i passed over to you he hands it back three sips is enough for cal colorado's delicate ecosystem do you remember that show parks and recreation with the life of man chris trigger seldom ever related to a character more on tv i like that show it was just nice julius pulls his gun out and is gonna like swat style enter this building uh this is the first time that beck and cal have seen you in this mode and stevie too is kind of in a worrisome confused excitement as uh they look over at you yeah cal's cows kind of freaked and he's like uh don't don't don't worry viewers at home uh julius is our segment producer as you know he's he's relying on some training he had before he came to uh to can and and we're really you know sorry to say strange things are happening we've got to put the action and city action news we're gonna follow him inside the zeitgeist julius clears the first room and starts up the stairs as cal falls behind him he kind of like glances over at this uh like abandoned um reception desk and the colors go like pink and electric blue and uh and you see a very a much younger cal colorado like arguing with this this host he's like no i i specifically said i specifically said 6 30 for friday evening cal colorado you must have it you bet yeah so i am not sure we currently have that no but i made this weeks ago it's it's dreadfully important you said your name was colorado yes colorado colorado cal colorado i'm sorry i don't usually yell but oh i'm i'm going to ask the woman i love very dearly to marry me tonight what is that worth to you sir everything i'm willing to spend my life with her he kind of holds at his hand expectingly oh oh oh okay cal pulls out his wallet and gives you like 150 bucks in 1987 dollars just make sure it's a good table she'll be here any minute and cal kind of like chuckles to himself in the present walks back up the stairs he's going up the stairs bic uh has a big flood light on top of the camera at this point and you are showing the raggedy ass like paint chipped walls of the stairway as you make your way up to the very top uh yeah each floor even has like a number on it and some of the numbers are like peeling off julius on the way up points out julius summers uh like scratched into the wall um but he knows that he did that a few days ago but kind of pointing it out like look hey i've been here before you were here a few days ago he doesn't say that out loud julius this looks like it was scratched into these walls just a few days ago super fresh julius like motions like because he's uh doing combat business yeah cal quiet he's doing combat business you're you're right you're right and uh julius proceeds to clear the front of the staircase is it is it all all clear it's all clear it's all clear julius this looks pretty fresh just a few days old why were you here recently it's from a long time ago what do you think beck it's dated it's three days ago yeah uh just one of those crazy coincidence i wrote the first date i could think of way back when that's wild that i'm here very close to that date not exactly on that date though uh julius i don't think we believe you i mean i guess you guys are in this now i might as well not lie yeah i was here this is where me and x meet up to uh talk business did you know about what happened here no i i was here three days ago this happened last night still it's a troubling connection i must say it is weird that like this is your secret place but like a lot of not very secret stuff you think everywhere i go just has dead bodies a lot of the places i've been with you it wasn't me i cut i don't mutilate the bodies it's not about that oh jesus it's not about that what's it about i didn't do it i i believe you but did you have any hand in setting it up i don't know anything about it i'm genuinely want to know i'm trying to find out same thing you guys are do you remember if you picked this as your meeting place or did x pick this as your meeting place we always meet at the tallest point wherever we are impractical hey for everybody else it's impractical too so there's not a lot of people there aren't any uh eight-story buildings in this neighborhood in the city those are on the other side of the river that's right where we are is real heavy i get it you're your general locale right your immediate it's tall it's the tallest thing around sure and it looks cool it's got zeitgeist is the name you know it worked out well i guess also if you're like if you're not as close as you thought you were maybe and you're at the top of the zeitgeist and x is at the top of the next nearest building in her vicinity you could probably like shout it out or at least wave to each other i hadn't thought about that but yeah if it ever doesn't work out that way you know you could you could keep that in mind yeah or you guys could just talk at home well no that because who knows you know you guys only talk in like your attic the high or on the roof no we don't i mean we don't really interact too much i i don't really know her that well i just met her on this assignment did you say online i mean i met her online when i was introduced by our boss but who's your boss x you know for now who introduced you it doesn't matter and he looks super sad and he kind of just walks away and is gonna look around back did you get a sadness i saw that did you did you was it framed well oh yeah okay we'll have to ask him about that you guys are whispering to each other in this dilapidated room that cal still sees through his eyes here and there here and there and it's former glory but now is as we've seen before you know windows are busted out and the bar is just like overrun with like moss and age has clearly taken its toll even more intensely now that nature has made its way into this abandoned structure i need you guys to roll sig into pass a 77 on a 60 well hold on i have a zero but you still roll for crits right yeah i got a 69 holy fucking and i passed always a success yeah we've got a big crit we've got a crit fail and then we've got a pass yeah cal's eyes are darting across this room and he hasn't he hasn't been here like since it shut down and his memory of it is so vivid this day was so important to him he can easily see like all these these things he remembers and they're you know broken and turned over and you walk over to the like beautiful window booth that you sat in the best seat in the house and as you approach it when you look down you're standing next to julia summers and the two of you are looking down directly into the spot where there are holes covering the ground that have been excavated and refilled and each of you is familiar with braille for one reason or another and you quickly surmise the code punched into the ground number sign h c f which you know means i have literally no idea you don't because you just passed you you put it together you're like number hcf huh and cal with the 69 you know that braille num numerical values the numbers eight three six three six beck's over on the opposite side of the room filming a dripping pipe i'm getting some good footage over here guys beck uh beck come over here a moment no hang on i want to get some more of this hang on no you've got to see these holes you got to see this pipe it is dripping becketh come film this all right okay if i could feel that with my thumb i would know what it said no no uh julius i i did a three-part series where i lived as a blind homeless man on the streets of the city i remember that yeah i learned braille it says hcf i gave you money at some point when you did that i didn't know it was you well i'm glad you were one of the ones who gave me money instead of beating me up and taking that makes really hard to see if he which money did but uh look julius it's it's the letters hcf but there's a pound sign a number sign in front of it eight three six it says eight three six how'd you do that so fast i i can read braille i know but i just have to feel it but how'd you convert it out numerically so quickly what you don't know everything about me clearly i guess not you you contain great depths maria summers cow and the other two real grip cow and the rest uh pass but why uh i do not pass a crit fail begets a crit success it's an 11. hey nice i didn't pass uh okay uh julius you're gonna lose one as this number has shown up once more in your lives and you are having a harder and harder time keeping a grip on reality when there's clearly some sort of numerical value that is like following you beck this only strengthens your resolve once again i think you should feel good gain one grip and cal you recognize it how is this number continuing to show up it's pretty straightforward it's a gottel corp conspiracy the number is significant to them in some way perhaps it's stevie yeah the number is eight three six mean anything to you uh no what was your grandfather's birthday august 36th that's that's it why is that weird was that a real answer no i was doing it i was doing a joke did you yeah that's a pretty good joke stevie thanks julius is gonna google 836 do it and then 836 conspiracy and then google do it again do you know what the first thing that comes up is is it the transcripts oh my god is that what's happening that is not the first thing that comes up when i google it for me it's thompson rudder's practical law it says 5a836 conspiracy to murder well that's my third one so uh julius does that and it puts his phone back in his pocket uh it was a leap year is that anything what was no i don't think so 836 like i meant maybe like august 1936 oh yeah no i i don't even know my grandpa's birthday like do you know your grandpa's birthday yes july 4th 1905 wow okay i mean i i just don't i guess i i know i know my dad's birthday what's your dad's birthday august 36th august 36th julius text x 836 mean anything it's a good text good text game let me let me get a search role while you guys are up here since you're since you're up here oh yeah looking down around the beautiful sights below yeah so cal spots whatever it is with these with a 21 on a 60. fuck yeah what do we got i did not pass a 58 on a 40 once again back just distracted by the drip a mouse just went by i am chasing it in a crazy outfit oh the drip i get it and uh how did joyus 13 on 70 the two of you see a a glint in the moonlight hidden under some brush a little bit into kind of the thick of the tree line past where people would hang out there uh you know they're like picnic tables and stuff about of course those are gross and old too but a little bit further in where one might get ticks i'm not stalling you see something shiny julius do you see do you see that shining out there yeah i thought it was just like tricking me but i've seen it like five or six times it kind of comes in between the trees it looks like there's ticks out there i wish we had jeremy with us do you have his number right oh yeah cal sites texting jeremy get him out here tell him to bring off meet at zeitgeist immediately or asap with off it uh as you go to text it says jeremy the intern which i assume is what it is in your phone uh is notification it just says the enter notifications are currently turned off notify anyway hey if i call him you can click notify anyway oh i click notify anyway cal what do you bet i could get this uh this stuffed bigfoot into one of those holes uh 50 dollars julius positions the bigfoot on his on his foot and like kind of eyes it and gives it a little kick trying to get it right into the hole this is peak role playing role athletics or if you have like a carnival skill no that's a 90. well that isn't gonna do it you did a lot of practice rolling before do you think that helped i hurt damn can i push the push the rule uh in order to push the rule you would have to risk like falling out the window oh don't for the that's a pass fucking idiot this would have been like so much of the story depends on your roommate i would have killed you right now i wouldn't even for doing that shit i would have killed you right now i've been happy with it uh 86 is what you would roll fortunately i pass uh and so he flicks it off his foot and it's not aimed correctly nope and so at the very end he re he like leans out the window and flicks it and it goes into the hole do you uh you think that means something uh well that's one of the damnedest things i've ever seen beck were you filming that uh please please please tell me beck is in another corner and it's a bunch of tables and he's kind of poking at him with his foot and they all slide i got a really good one over here there's a table sliding like there was something behind him or something kind of spooky like it's a good shot guys beck you gotta be careful to not make the news you know what i mean oh yeah no i just thought we'd like spice it up a little like nothing's really doing anything so far cal is looking at you like in astonishment and pride he's like you've really learned a thing or two in your time here i mean i learned it all from you guys so you sounded like a producer he gets a little bit sad but he he's like no no no that's that's cal let's go see the shiny thing julius you know if i'm the head boss if x makes me that i can fire myself and hire you or we could be cohead bosses i'm really reigniting my passion for news here doing this kind of stuff and well wouldn't you rather be with us than whoever the fuck they are oh yeah i don't know the how that really works uh never tried to like leave but that's i mean that's good news that's we can talk about it after we figure out whatever is going on here okay hold up i i might be am i not following this way you could have because tife i and she kind of looks at julius and grimace isn't um well you'll be the like lead producer so like wouldn't julius's role still just be what i am or we could bump you up one and you essentially do the same thing but stevie also does that too whoa would you like to be a segment producer stevie by being confused that's amazing is that what you were asking for yes that is what i was asking for wow and beck you're good where you are yeah okay let's go cow's just like giving you a thumbs up and nodding when he says that he's like all right all right well we've got a hey we've got ourselves a news organization people let's go do the news okay and he starts clearing the stairwell do the news yeah and as as everybody walks down cow lingers at the top and he sees he sees himself down on one knee the air has like a fine mist like a white haze in it um from all the coke and you and you see yeah and and cow you you do believe has not done any cocaine but it's in its system and with the courage he's never known he's down on one knee right in front of uh virginia macintyre that's right virginia macintyre would you make me the happiest newsman in the world would you be my wife and she bursts into tears and gives him a big hug and she says yes cal yes i never thought you'd ask you were so hesitant virginia when i think about the rest of our life nothing makes me want to hesitate i want to start it right fucking now and he like picks her up and walks her out of the restaurant and the whole place is fucking cheering and you see cal like looking back and smiling on that uh and he uh he sniffs asks he shouts julius do you have any more of that energy drink uh and heads on down the stairs oh man i don't want to be too weird but like that was cool man thanks good shit do you have luck uh i should have used it if you already have it because you got it again again again i actually have two scratches written down so i don't know if that's happened before i should probably spend my luck if you fail a roll guys luck can help if it's appropriate just a quick reminder from your local luck council zach thank you you're welcome he shouts to the restaurant i've got some news everybody we're getting married and take my breath away swells like fucking crazy yo she took my breath away and he covers he leaves enough money on the table to cover the bill and then they go downstairs julius kicks open the door at the bottom of the zeitgeist back back did you get that that one i got hell yeah and as you do so the four of you walk confidently as a team across the grounds of the zeitgeist here on this misty dark heavy summer night eight three six punched into the ground to the left of you and in your direct path in your future now lies whatever it was that caught your eye and as you continue approaching the edge of the woods you see the glint of the tip of a very pristine and sharp shovel the scariest gardening tool because it's a horror podcast yeah oh my god it's a shovel no no anything but that anything but a shovel is it like just stuck in the ground or it's just laying on the ground and it looks like it's been covered purposely by some randomly assorted shrubbery and foliage i could use a disguise roll to see that the earth is disguised around the shovel yeah it very much is you can just uh very clear uh i mean you can roll for that if you want but you can very clearly tell that yes it was disguised it was uh hidden it was it was purposefully yeah and therefore the most obvious and clever way to unhide or disguise it to remove the stuff on top of it the shovel now uh with the foliage removed uh you can just see it is an extremely clean pristine clean and sharp shovel look as i undisguised the shovel a shovel like that looks really valuable maybe someone carved their name into it it's a thought and he chucks it at julius take a look grabs the shovel and really thoroughly inspects that shovel well let's see uh what would you like to roll to see if there's a name on this shovel how about alertness i'll give you a search pass 40 on the 70. okay absolutely as you search around uh this shovel you see that uh it's actually got a um like a cover like a tip on the end of it for nice gripping on that side but as you peel it back a little bit you see etched into the wood the name dr brock hargrave do you guys uh you know who brock hargrave is dr park park hargar son of a bitch dr brock hargrave i've interviewed him a dozen times what kind of doctor is he surgeon he's uh no uh of i don't really like doctors archaeology or or anthropology oh like uh one of those doctors yeah but he's like a real you know he's not like one of those boring dinosaur nerds he's like a real indiana jones type i've watched all his youtubes he he makes for some good news we should try to get him on the is he from here yeah i believe he's from the city originally but um he's been globetrotting for the last wait 30 years if he was he's an archaeologist he's digging around here what is there dinosaurs dinosaur bones no again like i said he's not that kind of archaeologist but indiana okay yeah but he's digging for something but this is a good lead this is a really good we could follow up on this julius is onto something there that that indiana jones should totally do dinos a dino movie so if he's not digging for dinosaurs what else a treasure a rock could it just be a rock he likes weird rocks hmm well anyway i'll text him maybe i can set up an interview tomorrow and count count like uh thanks out hey doc been a while meet at the foundry for lunch tomorrow oh cool facts like worlds collide but they're my own this is getting a little uh weird i mean we haven't done this before because like all of our side stuff has always been very side stuff and this is like your girlfriend taylor that's your ex-girlfriend whoa whoa rip scott ockerman oh he died so old oh fuck i'm the best all right the live show is when jason keeps joking about him being like 64 and he's like it's it's too close that it hurts well you guys are still out here so i guess uh roll another shirt roll another what search sorry i got a little slurry with it and it's a piece i passed also 12 on a 40 cal fails 61 on a 60 i flipped on the night vision nice and julius pulls out his readers but they don't help uh and julius has trained himself to see in the dark aka looking over beck's shoulder in the viewfinder all right the two of you notice wait what's that a little ziploc bag it looks like a little ziploc bag it's been like for ham sandwiches trampled underfoot and has made its way into the ground becoming one with kind of the the grass and the and the flowers and the weeds that surround it but it doesn't look like it's been here for a long time just that it got stepped on a few times and is it's now stuck and obscured from most people's sight hey steve you were always you're picking up my trash there's trash see what it is whoa yeah julius man they're always picking up my energy drinks i figured they just like trash they're looking out for the environment but that's no way to talk about your junior segment producer yeah oh hey this is not the kind of workplace we're trying to foster here yeah this could be a learning moment for you yeah i don't know how you do things in the x files julius julius kind of that's not gonna fly and picks up the piece of trash uh well when you go and pick up the piece of trash i need you to roll uh grip uh not pass fail i guess uh if you guys thomas and joe could leave the room for una memento that would be good dude i had blood drawn and there's a big old bruise oh snap why'd you have blood drawn i just had a doctor's appointment oh physical thing i don't do that i should do that i paid 15 bucks with my insurance i finally have insurance and i'm afraid to use it because i am scared of how it works they don't tell you how you gotta just go figure it out seems like a nightmare and i'm scared about it and i uh busy i'm too busy plus nothing probably nothing's wrong with you oh i can keep telling myself that if i don't go what happens when i when julius picks this ziploc bag up dude the smell is overwhelming you pick up just the slightest hint of some sort of saline salty oceany and then all of a sudden it's overwhelming and it's all you can smell and you're just back in that moment seeing that entity that thing that wet energy oh boy come back yeah lose one grip why why would you do cold water i just flipped it on man i was trying to get it done i only wash my hands with warm water i wasn't paying enough attention to until then to realize what you're talking about and i thought you meant like heated water in the toilet bowl hell yeah dude we have the height of luxury just in case our splash our splash back is warm if you drop a deuce in there that's real heavy and it splashes up splashes right into your asshole not gonna be unpleasantly cool it's gonna be soothingly warm whoa i did have a little bit of water that's wild yeah and he's back back again joey's back tell a friend hey luke joe's back you took my friend yes joe hey joe you're back nice yeah julius summers lets out a rip roaring scream in the night in the thick heavy fog surrounding everyone with this blood curdling scream something tingles in the back of your necks you have a weird feeling like you're um in a graveyard at night it's probably all the mist and holes beck whips the camera around to julius that bag's got something bags got gone and it's got something to do with god hey back i smelled god back we're on a mission from god the blues brothers yeah yeah we were just listening to it yeah julius what what did you see in there it's the same smell i smelled in grover's gorge it's just it's what god smells like and i as soon as i touched it i just that's all i could even feel what does god smell like like salt water like just it's like just fucking nasty seawater and it just takes over you can't think about anything except the smell beck zooms in on the bag are you holding it still or is it on the ground up to you he let go of it as soon as he could beck zooms in on it on the ground does he see anything there's a little dark waxy substance as you zoom in closer it's it's like on it's on the outside of the bag and you see that the ziploc is like turned inside out i think it got turned inside out took it eaten does it look like somebody took a bite out of it julius if you're saying that smells like god whatever the fuck that means i don't think we should touch it the last guy that we saw come in contact with the god thing is now ripping holes throughout the world i mean that's the clue we should probably bag it up somehow safe stevie pulls a uh another ziploc bag stevie god is in your brother and i smelled god maybe if you touch it you'll talk to him or you got a better relationship than i do uh stevie i'm gonna advise you against that but he's your brother so no their eyes are huge and they're just looking at you and you say advice against that they're just like yes like not like absolutely nodding like you're right no no he's your brother and i don't want to get between family but sure sure yeah all right so i guess you don't want to find your brother can i roll persuade they take the bag that's inside out and put it inside a clean ziploc they kind of take a quick smell and their face just like goes somewhere else for a second and then they close it yeah you all right you still with us they're looking at julius do you smell it yeah whoa julius like eyeballs the bag again well now i want to see what god smells like give it here beck hold on don't be so rash you've got to film me fill it at first and it's all my fault suddenly cal's little hearing aid is it's discreet you've not noticed it before he's a vain man but it starts ringing like crazy and he he hones in on the source of this this signal or are you
