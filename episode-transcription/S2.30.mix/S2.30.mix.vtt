00:00.000 --> 00:05.920
What's up? What's up? What's up? What's up? It's Zach. I'm Zach and I'm popping in here real quick

00:05.920 --> 00:12.240
with a very fun announcement. But first a quick story. You know when me and Joe and Justin,

00:12.240 --> 00:17.440
Luke and Thomas decided to make this show we had a silly little conversation about our pipe dreams

00:17.440 --> 00:26.320
for PTBP and my deepest sincerest hope was that someone out there would draw a character or scene

00:26.320 --> 00:33.920
that came from our brains. And well now there are more of you listening than I ever thought

00:34.480 --> 00:40.160
would happen and the illustrations and the sketches that y'all have posted have not only

00:40.160 --> 00:45.440
blown us away but they've helped us see these stories we've told through your perspectives which

00:45.440 --> 00:50.800
is absolutely one of the coolest parts of this whole wild wonder of a situation that we're all

00:50.800 --> 00:58.480
in together. So with all that being said we're gonna do a fan art contest drawing here in season

00:58.480 --> 01:04.640
two. It's a contest because we're gonna pick a contest winner and it's a drawing because every

01:04.640 --> 01:15.920
entry has an equal shot to win the drawing and it's a drawing because of the the the drawing and

01:15.920 --> 01:22.720
I'm sorry for that what I just did so to make it up for you we'll do two drawings and each of the

01:22.720 --> 01:29.280
two winners from the drawing drawings will receive any one item from the Pretending to be People

01:29.280 --> 01:34.880
merch store. You want a shirt, a hat, a fanny pack, even a beach towel? Take your pick if you win and

01:34.880 --> 01:42.000
you can win maybe if you give it a go. Speaking of winning the contest winner will receive any

01:42.640 --> 01:46.800
three items from the Pretending to be People merch store. You want a shirt, a hat,

01:46.800 --> 01:53.680
and a beach towel? You want three fanny packs? Do whatever you want! Okay also for this year contest

01:53.680 --> 01:59.440
slash drawing we're gonna go ahead and say let's keep it to stuff created by your brain and your

01:59.440 --> 02:05.520
hands without the use of AIs. Pretty wild times that we're specifying that right? Yeah but uh

02:05.520 --> 02:10.960
you know also go buck wild on the medium itself if you want I don't know. Draw and illustrate

02:10.960 --> 02:16.240
of course we fucking love that shit but feel free to write some fanfic or do a sculpture

02:16.240 --> 02:21.440
or choreograph and produce and film a flash mob or whatever your heart desires we're super stoked to

02:21.440 --> 02:26.480

05:08.480 --> 05:16.240
mind manipulation of some sort listen I just know that sometimes when my voice reaches certain

05:16.320 --> 05:25.760
frequencies and vibrations it can produce certain effects certain behaviors

it is time for the news last time Dr Murray sewed up Julius's shoulder and then whipped out a device

06:54.080 --> 07:01.760
similar to the futuristic tech the can crew saw in Godel's gorge to finish up the job Beck got

07:01.760 --> 07:09.680
another top up while it was around Stevie shared some reddit articles showing unnaturally smooth

07:09.680 --> 07:18.160
holes popping up or down rather all over the world unable to piece together the puzzle they decided

07:18.160 --> 07:24.960
to wait for the reddit nerds to figure out where God will strike next and after hearing about Dr

07:24.960 --> 07:31.360
Murray's wild night at the zeitgeist the gang is planning on checking out the scene before calling

07:31.360 --> 07:37.920

19:38.640 --> 19:43.840
julius like motions like because he's uh doing combat business

19:46.960 --> 19:50.960
yeah cal quiet he's doing combat business you're you're right you're right

19:50.960 --> 19:54.240
and uh julius proceeds to clear the front of the staircase

19:56.240 --> 20:03.280
is it is it all all clear it's all clear it's all clear julius this looks pretty fresh just a few

20:03.280 --> 20:10.000
days old why were you here recently it's from a long time ago what do you think beck it's dated

20:10.000 --> 20:18.160
it's three days ago yeah uh just one of those crazy coincidence i wrote the first date i could

20:18.160 --> 20:25.520
think of way back when that's wild that i'm here very close to that date not exactly on that date

20:25.520 --> 20:33.200
though uh julius i don't think we believe you i mean i guess you guys are in this now i might

20:33.200 --> 20:40.000
as well not lie yeah i was here this is where me and x meet up to uh talk business did you

20:40.000 --> 20:47.120
know about what happened here no i i was here three days ago this happened last night still

20:47.120 --> 20:53.040
it's a troubling connection i must say it is weird that like this is your secret place but

20:53.040 --> 20:57.120
like a lot of not very secret stuff you think everywhere i go just has dead bodies

20:57.360 --> 21:07.040
a lot of the places i've been with you it wasn't me i cut i don't mutilate the bodies it's not

21:07.040 --> 21:18.400
about that oh jesus it's not about that what's it about i didn't do it i i believe you but did

21:18.400 --> 21:24.640
you have any hand in setting it up i don't know anything about it i'm genuinely want to know i'm

21:24.640 --> 21:31.040
trying to find out same thing you guys are do you remember if you picked this as your meeting place

21:31.040 --> 21:35.840
or did x pick this as your meeting place we always meet at the tallest point wherever we are

21:36.880 --> 21:43.200
impractical hey for everybody else it's impractical too so there's not a lot of people

21:44.720 --> 21:52.240
there aren't any uh eight-story buildings in this neighborhood in the city those are on the other

21:52.240 --> 21:59.920
side of the river that's right where we are is real heavy i get it you're your general locale

21:59.920 --> 22:05.040
right your immediate it's tall it's the tallest thing around sure and it looks cool it's got

22:05.040 --> 22:10.240
zeitgeist is the name you know it worked out well i guess also if you're like if you're not as close

22:10.240 --> 22:14.800
as you thought you were maybe and you're at the top of the zeitgeist and x is at the top of the

22:14.800 --> 22:18.880
next nearest building in her vicinity you could probably like shout it out or at least wave to

22:18.880 --> 22:23.280
each other i hadn't thought about that but yeah if it ever doesn't work out that way you know you

22:23.280 --> 22:28.320
could you could keep that in mind yeah or you guys could just talk at home well no that because who

22:28.320 --> 22:34.160
knows you know you guys only talk in like your attic the high or on the roof no we don't i mean

22:34.160 --> 22:39.680
we don't really interact too much i i don't really know her that well i just met her on this

22:39.680 --> 22:51.440
assignment did you say online i mean i met her online when i was introduced by our boss but

22:52.080 --> 23:01.680
who's your boss x you know for now who introduced you it doesn't matter and he looks super sad and

23:01.680 --> 23:09.920
he kind of just walks away and is gonna look around back did you get a sadness i saw that

23:09.920 --> 23:16.160
did you did you was it framed well oh yeah okay we'll have to ask him about that you guys are

23:16.160 --> 23:23.280
whispering to each other in this dilapidated room that cal still sees through his eyes here and there

23:23.680 --> 23:33.680
here and there and it's former glory but now is as we've seen before you know windows are busted

23:33.680 --> 23:43.440
out and the bar is just like overrun with like moss and age has clearly taken its toll even more

23:43.440 --> 23:51.680
intensely now that nature has made its way into this abandoned structure i need you guys to roll

23:51.680 --> 24:06.160
sig into pass a 77 on a 60 well hold on i have a zero but you still roll for crits right yeah

24:06.160 --> 24:13.520
i got a 69 holy fucking and i passed always a success yeah we've got a big crit we've got

24:13.520 --> 24:20.320
a crit fail and then we've got a pass yeah cal's eyes are darting across this room and he hasn't

24:20.320 --> 24:27.920
he hasn't been here like since it shut down and his memory of it is so vivid this day was so

24:27.920 --> 24:32.720
important to him he can easily see like all these these things he remembers and they're you know

24:32.720 --> 24:40.160
broken and turned over and you walk over to the like beautiful window booth that you sat in the

24:40.160 --> 24:46.880
best seat in the house and as you approach it when you look down you're standing next to julia

24:46.880 --> 24:52.160
summers and the two of you are looking down directly into the spot where there are holes

24:53.280 --> 25:00.560
covering the ground that have been excavated and refilled and each of you is familiar with braille

25:01.600 --> 25:08.000
for one reason or another and you quickly surmise the code punched into the ground

25:08.880 --> 25:15.840
number sign h c f which you know means

25:17.760 --> 25:23.280
i have literally no idea you don't because you just passed you you put it together you're like

25:23.280 --> 25:32.160
number hcf huh and cal with the 69 you know that braille num numerical values the numbers

25:32.960 --> 25:38.560
eight three six three six beck's over on the opposite side of the room filming a dripping pipe

25:40.640 --> 25:44.480
i'm getting some good footage over here guys beck uh beck come over here a moment

25:44.480 --> 25:48.720
no hang on i want to get some more of this hang on no you've got to see these holes you got to

25:48.720 --> 25:56.560
see this pipe it is dripping becketh come film this all right okay if i could feel that with

25:56.560 --> 26:02.800
my thumb i would know what it said no no uh julius i i did a three-part series where i

26:02.800 --> 26:07.520
lived as a blind homeless man on the streets of the city i remember that yeah i learned braille

26:08.800 --> 26:14.720
it says hcf i gave you money at some point when you did that i didn't know it was you well i'm

26:14.720 --> 26:18.720
glad you were one of the ones who gave me money instead of beating me up and taking that makes

26:18.720 --> 26:25.760
really hard to see if he which money did but uh look julius it's it's the letters hcf but there's

26:25.760 --> 26:30.800
a pound sign a number sign in front of it eight three six it says eight three six how'd you do

26:30.800 --> 26:38.400
that so fast i i can read braille i know but i just have to feel it but how'd you convert it

26:38.400 --> 26:47.920
out numerically so quickly what you don't know everything about me clearly i guess not you you

26:47.920 --> 26:58.640
contain great depths maria summers cow and the other two real grip cow and the rest uh pass but

26:59.600 --> 27:09.360
why uh i do not pass a crit fail begets a crit success it's an 11. hey nice i didn't pass uh

27:09.360 --> 27:17.840
okay uh julius you're gonna lose one as this number has shown up once more in your lives

27:18.720 --> 27:26.320
and you are having a harder and harder time keeping a grip on reality when there's clearly

27:26.320 --> 27:35.440
some sort of numerical value that is like following you beck this only strengthens your

27:35.440 --> 27:43.520
resolve once again i think you should feel good gain one grip and cal you recognize it

27:44.720 --> 27:49.360
how is this number continuing to show up it's pretty straightforward it's a gottel

27:49.360 --> 27:58.080
corp conspiracy the number is significant to them in some way perhaps it's stevie yeah

27:58.160 --> 28:00.880
the number is eight three six mean anything to you uh

28:03.840 --> 28:07.360
no what was your grandfather's birthday august 36th

28:15.600 --> 28:16.480
that's that's it

28:19.520 --> 28:22.480
why is that weird was that a real answer

28:22.800 --> 28:31.120
no i was doing it i was doing a joke did you yeah that's a pretty good joke stevie thanks

28:31.120 --> 28:40.320
julius is gonna google 836 do it and then 836 conspiracy and then google do it again

28:44.720 --> 28:46.560
do you know what the first thing that comes up is

28:47.520 --> 28:53.920
is it the transcripts oh my god is that what's happening

28:56.480 --> 28:59.040
that is not the first thing that comes up when i google it

29:01.440 --> 29:08.720
for me it's thompson rudder's practical law it says 5a836 conspiracy to murder

29:08.800 --> 29:17.360
well that's my third one so uh julius does that and it puts his phone back in his pocket

29:17.360 --> 29:24.880
uh it was a leap year is that anything what was no i don't think so 836 like i meant maybe like

29:24.880 --> 29:32.400
august 1936 oh yeah no i i don't even know my grandpa's birthday like do you know your

29:32.400 --> 29:35.520

30:02.880 --> 30:07.040
let me let me get a search role while you guys are up here since you're since you're up here

30:08.080 --> 30:15.040
oh yeah looking down around the beautiful sights below yeah so cal spots whatever it is with these

30:15.040 --> 30:21.520
with a 21 on a 60. fuck yeah what do we got i did not pass a 58 on a 40 once again back

30:21.520 --> 30:27.600
just distracted by the drip a mouse just went by i am chasing it in a crazy outfit

30:27.680 --> 30:42.240
oh the drip i get it and uh how did joyus 13 on 70 the two of you see a a glint in the moonlight

30:43.600 --> 30:49.680
hidden under some brush a little bit into kind of the thick of the tree line

30:50.800 --> 30:57.200
past where people would hang out there uh you know they're like picnic tables and stuff about

30:57.200 --> 31:03.600
of course those are gross and old too but a little bit further in where one might get

31:03.600 --> 31:10.960
ticks i'm not stalling you see something shiny julius do you see do you see that shining out

31:10.960 --> 31:16.000
there yeah i thought it was just like tricking me but i've seen it like five or six times it kind of

31:16.560 --> 31:22.400
comes in between the trees it looks like there's ticks out there i wish we had jeremy with us

31:22.400 --> 31:32.240
do you have his number right oh yeah cal sites texting jeremy get him out here tell him to bring

31:32.240 --> 31:42.480
off meet at zeitgeist immediately or asap with off it uh as you go to text it says jeremy the

31:42.480 --> 31:47.680
intern which i assume is what it is in your phone uh is notification it just says the enter

31:47.680 --> 31:53.920
notifications are currently turned off notify anyway hey if i call him you can click notify

31:53.920 --> 32:04.640
anyway oh i click notify anyway cal what do you bet i could get this uh this stuffed bigfoot

32:04.640 --> 32:14.080
into one of those holes uh 50 dollars julius positions the bigfoot on his on his foot

32:14.880 --> 32:20.160
and like kind of eyes it and gives it a little kick trying to get it right into the hole this

32:20.160 --> 32:28.720
is peak role playing role athletics or if you have like a carnival skill no that's a 90.

32:28.720 --> 32:32.880
well that isn't gonna do it you did a lot of practice rolling before do you think that

32:32.880 --> 32:40.560
helped i hurt damn can i push the push the rule uh in order to push the rule you would have to

32:40.560 --> 32:47.920
risk like falling out the window oh don't for the that's a pass

32:50.240 --> 32:51.280
fucking idiot

32:53.600 --> 32:58.800
this would have been like so much of the story depends on your roommate i would have killed you

32:58.800 --> 33:03.360
right now i wouldn't even for doing that shit i would have killed you right now i've been happy

33:03.360 --> 33:12.160
with it uh 86 is what you would roll fortunately i pass uh and so he flicks it off his foot and

33:12.160 --> 33:18.800
it's not aimed correctly nope and so at the very end he re he like leans out the window and flicks

33:18.800 --> 33:24.320
it and it goes into the hole do you uh you think that means something uh well that's one of the

33:24.320 --> 33:28.960
damnedest things i've ever seen beck were you filming that uh please please please tell me

33:29.280 --> 33:34.080
beck is in another corner and it's a bunch of tables and he's kind of poking at him with his

33:34.080 --> 33:39.520
foot and they all slide i got a really good one over here there's a table sliding like there was

33:39.520 --> 33:43.600

33:43.600 --> 33:49.760
careful to not make the news you know what i mean oh yeah no i just thought we'd like spice it up a

33:49.760 --> 33:55.200
little like nothing's really doing anything so far cal is looking at you like in astonishment

33:55.200 --> 34:01.840
and pride he's like you've really learned a thing or two in your time here i mean i learned it all

34:01.840 --> 34:09.920
from you guys so you sounded like a producer he gets a little bit sad but he he's like no no no

34:09.920 --> 34:17.600
that's that's cal let's go see the shiny thing julius you know if i'm the head boss if x makes

34:17.600 --> 34:24.160

34:37.680 --> 34:42.080
that's i mean that's good news that's we can talk about it after we figure out whatever

34:42.080 --> 34:49.280
is going on here okay hold up i i might be am i not following this way you could have

34:49.280 --> 34:57.760
because tife i and she kind of looks at julius and grimace isn't um well you'll be the like

34:58.400 --> 35:07.040
lead producer so like wouldn't julius's role still just be what i am or we could bump you

35:07.040 --> 35:11.520
up one and you essentially do the same thing but stevie also does that too whoa would you

35:11.520 --> 35:15.920
like to be a segment producer stevie by being confused that's amazing is that what you were

35:15.920 --> 35:22.240
asking for yes that is what i was asking for wow and beck you're good where you are yeah okay let's

35:22.240 --> 35:31.440

all right well we've got a hey we've got ourselves a news organization people let's go do the news

35:39.040 --> 35:45.760
okay and he starts clearing the stairwell do the news yeah and as as everybody walks down cow

35:45.760 --> 35:53.280
lingers at the top and he sees he sees himself down on one knee the air has like a fine mist

35:53.280 --> 36:01.440
like a white haze in it um from all the coke and you and you see yeah and and cow you you do

36:01.440 --> 36:07.040
believe has not done any cocaine but it's in its system and with the courage he's never known he's

36:07.040 --> 36:13.920
down on one knee right in front of uh virginia macintyre that's right virginia macintyre would

36:13.920 --> 36:21.120
you make me the happiest newsman in the world would you be my wife and she bursts into tears

36:21.120 --> 36:26.000
and gives him a big hug and she says yes cal yes i never thought you'd ask you were so hesitant

36:26.720 --> 36:30.800
virginia when i think about the rest of our life nothing makes me want to hesitate i want to start

36:30.800 --> 36:36.400
it right fucking now and he like picks her up and walks her out of the restaurant and the whole

36:36.400 --> 36:43.360
place is fucking cheering and you see cal like looking back and smiling on that uh and he uh

36:46.080 --> 36:50.160
he sniffs asks he shouts julius do you have

36:50.160 --> 36:53.520
any more of that energy drink uh and heads on down the stairs

36:55.680 --> 37:00.720
oh man i don't want to be too weird but like that was cool man thanks

37:01.280 --> 37:08.480
good shit do you have luck uh i should have used it if you already have it because you got it

37:08.480 --> 37:14.240
again again again i actually have two scratches written down so i don't know if that's happened

37:14.240 --> 37:22.400
before i should probably spend my luck if you fail a roll guys luck can help if it's appropriate

37:22.400 --> 37:28.640
just a quick reminder from your local luck council zach thank you you're welcome he shouts to the

37:28.640 --> 37:34.800
restaurant i've got some news everybody we're getting married and take my breath away

37:35.440 --> 37:37.040
swells like fucking crazy

37:41.360 --> 37:43.280
yo she took my breath away and he covers

37:45.120 --> 37:48.560
he leaves enough money on the table to cover the bill and then they go downstairs

37:50.160 --> 37:53.920
julius kicks open the door at the bottom of the zeitgeist

37:53.920 --> 38:03.200
back back did you get that that one i got hell yeah and as you do so the four of you walk

38:03.200 --> 38:12.720
confidently as a team across the grounds of the zeitgeist here on this misty dark heavy summer

38:12.720 --> 38:21.120
night eight three six punched into the ground to the left of you and in your direct path in

38:21.120 --> 38:29.840
your future now lies whatever it was that caught your eye and as you continue approaching the edge

38:29.840 --> 38:43.200
of the woods you see the glint of the tip of a very pristine and sharp shovel

38:43.200 --> 38:57.120
the scariest gardening tool because it's a horror podcast yeah oh my god it's a shovel

38:58.160 --> 39:06.880
no no anything but that anything but a shovel is it like just stuck in the ground or it's just

39:06.880 --> 39:15.280
laying on the ground and it looks like it's been covered purposely by some randomly assorted

39:16.560 --> 39:20.160
shrubbery and foliage i could use a disguise roll to see that

39:22.640 --> 39:30.800
the earth is disguised around the shovel yeah it very much is you can just uh very clear uh i mean

39:30.800 --> 39:35.200
you can roll for that if you want but you can very clearly tell that yes it was disguised it was uh

39:35.200 --> 39:39.840
hidden it was it was purposefully yeah and therefore the most obvious and clever way to

39:39.840 --> 39:49.760
unhide or disguise it to remove the stuff on top of it the shovel now uh with the foliage removed

39:49.760 --> 39:56.320
uh you can just see it is an extremely clean pristine clean and sharp shovel look as i

39:56.320 --> 40:02.240
undisguised the shovel a shovel like that looks really valuable maybe someone carved their name

40:02.240 --> 40:12.640
into it it's a thought and he chucks it at julius take a look grabs the shovel and really

40:12.640 --> 40:18.000
thoroughly inspects that shovel well let's see uh what would you like to roll to see if there's

40:18.000 --> 40:32.160
a name on this shovel how about alertness i'll give you a search pass 40 on the 70. okay

40:32.160 --> 40:39.840
absolutely as you search around uh this shovel you see that uh it's actually got a um like a cover

40:39.840 --> 40:47.680
like a tip on the end of it for nice gripping on that side but as you peel it back a little bit

40:47.680 --> 40:57.120
you see etched into the wood the name dr brock hargrave do you guys uh you know who brock

40:57.120 --> 41:04.480
hargrave is dr park park hargar son of a bitch dr brock hargrave i've interviewed him a dozen times

41:04.480 --> 41:10.400
what kind of doctor is he surgeon he's uh no uh of i don't really like doctors archaeology or

41:10.400 --> 41:16.160
or anthropology oh like uh one of those doctors yeah but he's like a real you know he's not like

41:16.160 --> 41:21.520
one of those boring dinosaur nerds he's like a real indiana jones type i've watched all his

41:21.520 --> 41:26.800

41:27.520 --> 41:31.440
yeah i believe he's from the city originally but um he's been globetrotting for the last

41:31.440 --> 41:38.400
wait 30 years if he was he's an archaeologist he's digging around here what is there dinosaurs

41:38.400 --> 41:45.600
dinosaur bones no again like i said he's not that kind of archaeologist but indiana okay yeah

41:45.600 --> 41:49.040
but he's digging for something but this is a good lead this is a really good we could

41:49.040 --> 41:53.520
follow up on this julius is onto something there that that indiana jones should totally do

41:54.160 --> 42:03.600

facts like worlds collide but they're my own this is getting a little uh weird

42:45.360 --> 42:50.400
i mean we haven't done this before because like all of our side stuff has always been

42:51.360 --> 42:55.040
very side stuff and this is like your girlfriend

42:57.440 --> 43:04.240
taylor that's your ex-girlfriend whoa whoa rip scott ockerman oh he died so old

43:08.800 --> 43:14.720
oh fuck i'm the best all right the live show is when jason keeps joking about him being like 64

43:15.360 --> 43:18.160
and he's like it's it's too close that it hurts

43:21.200 --> 43:24.320
well you guys are still out here so i guess uh roll another shirt

43:25.360 --> 43:30.000

43:31.680 --> 43:39.200
i passed also 12 on a 40 cal fails 61 on a 60 i flipped on the night vision nice

43:39.200 --> 43:46.720
and julius pulls out his readers but they don't help

43:49.520 --> 43:58.000
uh and julius has trained himself to see in the dark aka looking over beck's shoulder in the

43:58.000 --> 44:05.280
viewfinder all right the two of you notice wait what's that

44:07.840 --> 44:15.520
a little ziploc bag it looks like a little ziploc bag it's been like for ham sandwiches trampled

44:16.240 --> 44:26.240
underfoot and has made its way into the ground becoming one with kind of the the grass and the

44:26.240 --> 44:31.600
and the flowers and the weeds that surround it but it doesn't look like it's been here for a

44:31.600 --> 44:39.280
long time just that it got stepped on a few times and is it's now stuck and obscured from

44:39.280 --> 44:45.040
most people's sight hey steve you were always you're picking up my trash there's trash see

44:45.040 --> 44:52.080
what it is whoa yeah julius man they're always picking up my energy drinks i figured they just

44:52.080 --> 44:56.880
like trash they're looking out for the environment but that's no way to talk about your junior

44:56.880 --> 45:01.920
segment producer yeah oh hey this is not the kind of workplace we're trying to foster here

45:01.920 --> 45:05.760
yeah this could be a learning moment for you yeah i don't know how you do things in the x

45:05.760 --> 45:11.120
files julius julius kind of that's not gonna fly and picks up the piece of trash

45:12.400 --> 45:17.760
uh well when you go and pick up the piece of trash i need you to roll uh grip

45:17.760 --> 45:21.920
uh not pass fail

45:26.720 --> 45:33.200
i guess uh if you guys thomas and joe could leave the room for una memento

45:35.200 --> 45:43.120
that would be good dude i had blood drawn and there's a big old bruise oh snap why'd you have

45:43.120 --> 45:50.160
blood drawn i just had a doctor's appointment oh physical thing i don't do that i should do that

45:51.280 --> 45:56.880
i paid 15 bucks with my insurance i finally have insurance and i'm afraid to use it because i

45:56.880 --> 46:02.400
am scared of how it works they don't tell you how you gotta just go figure it out

46:03.440 --> 46:08.240
seems like a nightmare and i'm scared about it and i uh busy i'm too busy plus nothing

46:08.240 --> 46:11.360
probably nothing's wrong with you oh i can keep telling myself that if i don't go

46:12.080 --> 46:21.920
what happens when i when julius picks this ziploc bag up dude the smell is overwhelming

46:21.920 --> 46:26.800
you pick up just the slightest hint of some sort of saline

46:29.280 --> 46:36.160
salty oceany and then all of a sudden it's overwhelming and it's all you can

46:36.160 --> 46:44.000
smell and you're just back in that moment seeing that entity that thing that

46:46.640 --> 46:47.520
wet energy

46:54.080 --> 46:56.640
oh boy come back yeah lose one grip

47:00.480 --> 47:05.200
why why would you do cold water i just flipped it on man i was trying to get it done

47:06.480 --> 47:11.840
i only wash my hands with warm water i wasn't paying enough attention to until then to realize

47:11.840 --> 47:17.040
what you're talking about and i thought you meant like heated water in the toilet bowl hell yeah

47:17.040 --> 47:26.880
dude we have the height of luxury just in case our splash our splash back is warm if you drop

47:26.880 --> 47:32.240
a deuce in there that's real heavy and it splashes up splashes right into your asshole not gonna be

47:32.240 --> 47:42.800
unpleasantly cool it's gonna be soothingly warm whoa i did have a little bit of water that's wild

47:43.680 --> 47:52.320
yeah and he's back back again joey's back tell a friend hey luke joe's back

47:55.280 --> 47:56.160
you took my friend

47:57.120 --> 48:09.520
yes joe hey joe you're back nice yeah julius summers lets out a rip roaring scream in the

48:09.520 --> 48:19.680
night in the thick heavy fog surrounding everyone with this blood curdling scream something tingles

48:19.760 --> 48:28.560
in the back of your necks you have a weird feeling like you're um in a graveyard at night

48:29.440 --> 48:35.200
it's probably all the mist and holes beck whips the camera around to julius that bag's got

48:35.200 --> 48:42.000
something bags got gone and it's got something to do with god hey back i smelled god back

48:42.000 --> 48:47.120
we're on a mission from god the blues brothers yeah yeah we were just listening to it yeah

48:47.920 --> 48:53.840
julius what what did you see in there it's the same smell i smelled in grover's gorge

48:56.480 --> 49:02.720
it's just it's what god smells like and i as soon as i touched it i just that's all i could

49:03.360 --> 49:16.960
even feel what does god smell like like salt water like just it's like just fucking

49:16.960 --> 49:25.760
nasty seawater and it just takes over you can't think about anything except the smell

49:26.880 --> 49:30.080
beck zooms in on the bag are you holding it still or is it on the ground

49:30.800 --> 49:38.080
up to you he let go of it as soon as he could beck zooms in on it on the ground does he see

49:38.080 --> 49:48.720
anything there's a little dark waxy substance as you zoom in closer it's it's like on it's

49:48.720 --> 49:54.560
on the outside of the bag and you see that the ziploc is like turned inside out i think it got

49:54.560 --> 49:59.120
turned inside out took it eaten does it look like somebody took a bite out of it

49:59.920 --> 50:04.960
julius if you're saying that smells like god whatever the fuck that means i don't think we

50:04.960 --> 50:10.240
should touch it the last guy that we saw come in contact with the god thing is now ripping

50:10.240 --> 50:15.840
holes throughout the world i mean that's the clue we should probably bag it up somehow safe

50:16.480 --> 50:24.000
stevie pulls a uh another ziploc bag stevie god is in your brother and i smelled god maybe if you

50:24.000 --> 50:30.480
touch it you'll talk to him or you got a better relationship than i do uh stevie i'm gonna advise

50:30.480 --> 50:35.120
you against that but he's your brother so no their eyes are huge and they're just looking at

50:35.120 --> 50:40.400
you and you say advice against that they're just like yes like not like absolutely nodding like

50:40.400 --> 50:45.920
you're right no no he's your brother and i don't want to get between family but sure sure yeah

50:46.320 --> 50:49.280
all right so i guess you don't want to find your brother

50:52.080 --> 50:53.280
can i roll persuade

50:56.160 --> 51:04.320
they take the bag that's inside out and put it inside a clean ziploc they kind of take a

51:04.320 --> 51:13.840
quick smell and their face just like goes somewhere else for a second and then they close it

51:14.640 --> 51:20.560
yeah you all right you still with us they're looking at julius do you smell it yeah

51:22.240 --> 51:29.040
whoa julius like eyeballs the bag again well now i want to see what god smells like give it here

51:30.400 --> 51:39.040
beck hold on don't be so rash you've got to film me fill it at first

51:43.840 --> 52:03.040
and it's all my fault

52:06.880 --> 52:11.680
suddenly cal's little hearing aid is it's discreet you've not noticed it before

52:12.480 --> 52:18.720
he's a vain man but it starts ringing like crazy and he he hones in on the source of this this

52:18.720 --> 52:23.360
signal or are you trying to get us to decipher a code that is deciphering a code for sure

52:24.560 --> 52:36.880
the same thing happens to his eye implant

52:41.680 --> 52:42.820
you
