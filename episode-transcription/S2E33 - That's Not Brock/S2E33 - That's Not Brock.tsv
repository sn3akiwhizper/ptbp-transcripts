0	3800	Introductions are bound to confound.
3800	8700	Using wet sounds to turn frowns upside down.
8700	13060	It is me, Wolf the Dog, DJ Extraordinaire.
13060	18200	Hoppin' on the sound waves, leavin' my soul exposed bare.

27360	28860	The- the- the end.
28860	33060	I hope y'all enjoyed that poem that I composed.
33060	38100	I spent almost as much time as I do on the show notes with that one.
38100	44160	And speaking of show notes, someone done went and sent a note to the show.
44160	49460	This Howlin' with Wolf is from Zach from the show that comes on after this.
49460	55700	He sent in this message and said it's some sort of contest drawing announcement of winners.
55700	62800	I guess he finally got around to tagging at Pretending Pod on his personal Instagram story.
62800	66300	Wow, get a load of this fuckin' guy, huh?
66300	69200	Alright, here he is, I- I guess.

311200	314900	Thank you, Zach, for whatever it is you do around here.
314900	316400	I'm sure it's important.
316400	322300	Are you caught up to this episode, but you're not yet getting that sweet exclusive,
322300	327500	Sklussy for short, b-b-b-b-b-b-bonus content
327500	333200	to satiate your earhole needs in between fresh episode drops?
333200	338400	Before you respond, keep in mind that I can see the numbers,
338400	341400	and the numbers just keep going up.
341400	347000	We recently dropped the two-part finale of the seven-part campaign
347000	353200	that Thomas wrote, ran, and entitled The Lost Treasure of John Lee Pettymore,
353200	357600	and then their Patreon numbers shot up with folks aching
357600	362700	to listen to this wild continuation of the story of contention
362700	365700	after the events of season one.
365700	369700	Now, you probably already know it's only five bucks
369700	375600	to gain clearance to the RSS feed we call Contention Confidential,
375600	380000	where you can listen to that Oops All Pettymore's campaign,
380000	386400	along with grease loads more bonus episodes for your cochlear pleasures.
386400	390200	That's at patreon.com slash pretending pod.
390200	392700	And if you'd rather just click something,
392700	396500	that link in the other links are in the show notes.
396500	399900	Now, how about some more boring facts and figures?
399900	402100	It's the news.
402100	406200	Last time, waffles were had at the home of Cal Colorado
406200	409800	before the canned crew made their way downtown to the hole
409800	412900	in the bridge that crosses the city river.
412900	417400	In a nearby alley, they met Kurt, aka Daddy,
417400	422100	who busted out one of those fancy new air-to-underwater drones
422100	425700	and flew that sucker right on through the unguarded,
425700	428400	unnaturally smooth hole.
428400	431900	And then he plunged it into the city river below.
431900	437100	The aquatic drone dove down into and through a tugboat,
437100	439700	which was, and also still is,
439700	444400	partially stuck in an enormous cartoon hole in the riverbed.
444400	449200	And when the drone went through the tugboat and came out the other side,
449200	453100	it flew into an old-timey school gymnasium
453100	456500	with a bloody throne under one of the basketball hoops
456500	461300	and a small humanoid creature with round ears atop its head,
461300	464300	wearing a blood-soaked school uniform.
464300	468400	And that thing skittered on all fours towards the drone camera,
468400	470600	which nimbly dodged the grab.
470600	473400	But then Cal knocked the shit out of Kurt,
473400	476000	kicked in the screen on the drone remote,
476000	480300	and punted it to the metaphorical and very real curb,
480300	483600	taking us now to whatever's next.
483600	489600	It's Alter Girl with My Life is Great and It's All My Fault.
507000	515000	Cause my life is great and it's all my fault.
525000	529000	I'll let you braid their hair if that's what you're into.
529000	533000	I am gonna think probably of the three movies,
533000	535000	it's gonna be maybe the best one.
535000	536000	The best one.
536000	537000	For sure the best one.
537000	540000	The three movies, you mean Oppenheimer, Barbie, and Wonka?
540000	541000	Yeah.
541000	544000	The trilogy.
544000	546000	Reserved my seats for Barbie today.
546000	548000	Wonka and barber.
548000	551000	Wow, they really got you, huh?
551000	555000	I'm gonna wait until it's not the night it comes out and then go see it at the IMAX.
555000	556000	Oh nice.
556000	557000	Oh wait, are we recording?
557000	558000	Sure.
558000	559000	Beep.
559000	560000	Are we?
560000	561000	Yeah.
561000	562000	Action.
562000	563000	Do it though.
563000	564000	I am.
564000	566000	The light didn't come on, you didn't go like click.
566000	567000	We should get it on air.
567000	568000	We need it on air.
568000	569000	We should get it on air.
569000	570000	Why not?
570000	572000	Cause we're not on air.
574000	577000	We're on tape baby and it's not even that anymore.
577000	579000	Direct to digital.
579000	581000	That just doesn't have it.
581000	582000	Ron Zach's laptop.
582000	587000	Direct to digital is even worse in some circles.
587000	588000	Are we recording?
588000	589000	Yeah.
589000	590000	Luke, how was Taylor Swift?
590000	591000	Yeah.
591000	593000	It was so fucking good dude.
593000	595000	Tell us about your era's experience.
595000	597000	Well, I went and-
597000	599000	So far so good.
599000	600000	Got there.
600000	601000	Whoa.
601000	604000	And I sat down and then Muna played and they were pretty good.
604000	609000	Gracie Abrams played and I had never heard her music but she's pretty good.
609000	612000	And then the real show started.
612000	615000	And it went on for three hours and 50 minutes.
615000	616000	Jesus Christ.
616000	618000	Three hours and 50 minutes?
618000	620000	Just shy of four hours long.
620000	621000	Oh my god.
621000	622000	With two openers.
622000	623000	Oh my god.
623000	625000	No, just Taylor's set was-
625000	626000	Right.
626000	627000	When did it start?
627000	632000	The openers played maybe 20 minutes at eight o'clock and was done by basically midnight.
632000	633000	Wow.
633000	635000	It was fucking amazing dude.
635000	640000	So the day that I went was the day she released her Speak Now re-release.
640000	641000	Don't speak.
641000	642000	She like played-
642000	644000	I know just what you're thinking.
644000	645000	That's my favorite one.
645000	646000	Played extra songs from that.
646000	647000	I don't know.
648000	652000	Because on her re-release record she does like from the vault song.
652000	655000	So basically B-sides that didn't make it on the record.
655000	661000	So she premiered a music video for one of those songs that hadn't been shown before.
661000	665000	That had Taylor Lautner and Chloe King I think is her name.
665000	667000	An actress in it.
667000	669000	And then she showed it and she's like, what'd you guys think?
669000	670000	And everybody screams.
670000	675000	And she's like, well in a normal film premiere they have the actors there.
676000	679000	And then brought out everybody in it.
679000	683000	And then Taylor Lautner comes out and does like a backflip on the stage and shit.
683000	684000	Attaboy.
684000	686000	And they like talk for a little bit.
686000	689000	And dude all the fucking music was so good dude.
689000	690000	It was-
690000	691000	Hell yeah.
691000	693000	At like two hours in I was like, damn my feet hurt.
693000	697000	And as I watch her like fucking dancing around on stage.
697000	699000	For the Nth night in a row.
699000	702000	Do you know if she's doing four hours a night every night?
702000	708000	I think ours was slightly longer by maybe 10 or 15 minutes.
708000	709000	Wow.
709000	711000	That's still a wildly long set.
711000	712000	That's crazy.
712000	713000	Yeah dude it's nuts.
713000	716000	I mean cause it's like songs from every single album that she has.
716000	718000	Would you say like every era?
718000	720000	Every era dude.
720000	725000	But the last tour she did was four albums ago.
725000	726000	Oh wow.
726000	728000	Oh I don't think I realized that.
728000	729000	Yeah COVID happened.
729000	732000	She released two albums like in the height of COVID.
732000	735000	One right before that she didn't get to tour on.
735000	737000	And then one just recently.
737000	738000	This is her first tour since COVID?
738000	739000	Yeah.
739000	740000	Wow.
740000	741000	Shit okay.
741000	745000	So usually the times I've seen her in the past it's like here's the album that I just
745000	746000	came out with.
746000	747000	We'll play all the songs on it.
747000	750000	And then you know a few of the hits.
750000	754000	So this time it was like the hits from every single album.
754000	756000	And then most of the songs on the new album.
756000	758000	It was fucking nuts.
758000	761000	So a good $200,000 well spent?
761000	762000	Yeah.
762000	767000	No I at work I sat at work on Ticketmaster for about six hours.
767000	770000	Do you want to include that in the pod for?
770000	777000	I was doing it right next to my boss who was also on Ticketmaster for about six hours trying
777000	778000	to get tickets.
778000	782000	So we got them day of so I paid I mean they were like 300 something dollars but I didn't
782000	783000	pay.
783000	785000	I mean people were paying like thousands for it.
785000	786000	That sounds reasonable.
786000	787000	For what it was yeah.
787000	790000	For about a hundred less than a hundred bucks an hour.
790000	792000	For a four hour stadium show.
792000	793000	Wow.
793000	794000	Exactly.
794000	795000	That's not that at all.
795000	797000	And my seats were fucking good and dude it was just nuts.
797000	800000	Like I'll show you guys like some videos I took later but like.
800000	801000	He's talking to you audience.
801000	806000	Yeah I'll share them on in the discord.
806000	809000	But dude the whole setup like the stage and everything was just nuts.
809000	813000	Like the whole stage was also video.
813000	814000	Oh come on.
814000	820000	Yeah and so dude at one point like the stage turns into water and she like finishes a song
820000	825000	and just you can't even like see it but the stage like barely opens up and she just dives
825000	830000	into the stage and then like it's a like a video of her like swimming under the stage
830000	832000	all the way.
832000	835000	And then like she pops up and like plays another song.
835000	836000	It was.
836000	841000	Do you think she runs or is she jumping down to a little area where there's like a little
841000	843000	go kart that takes her to the next spot?
843000	844000	No dude.
844000	845000	She hits the segue.
845000	849000	It's like assistance next to her with like little fans and some bottled water.
849000	854000	Dude the choreography of all of it though to like hit all of that like exactly when
854000	859000	they need to and like running from I mean the stage was as basically as long as Arrowheads
859000	860000	Field is like.
860000	862000	Like as big as this room?
862000	863000	Almost.
863000	864000	It's huge.
864000	868000	But dude it was it was fun as shit and it was great.
868000	872000	I had a great time and she sang all the songs that I wanted to hear.
872000	875000	Do you feel like she had fun though?
875000	881000	I looked it up and she is taking like this is not what each show makes but what she's
881000	885000	taking home from each show is around four to five million dollars.
885000	891000	So it doesn't matter if she's having fun.
891000	895000	I would assume probably a little bit but you know even if it's work it's a pretty good
895000	898000	job.
898000	902000	Yeah last thing that was cool she had a guitar on her original Speak.
902000	903000	What?
903000	907000	She had a guitar on her Speak Now tour that's been in like the Music Hall of Fame.
907000	908000	I read about this.
908000	912000	And they like took it out and she played it for that show.
912000	921000	Somebody say it's like when Captain America goes to get his shield from the museum.
921000	924000	My dad today was like do you like Taylor Swift?
924000	927000	I was like yeah I'm not like a huge fan or anything but I like some of her songs.
927000	928000	He's like I think I do too.
928000	932000	Like I just all of a sudden been hearing a lot about her like all these videos keep popping
932000	935000	up on my like reels.
935000	939000	And he like then he got into some pretty like weird drama about her.
939000	941000	Like reels drama?
941000	942000	Yeah.
942000	948000	I'm imagining your dad commenting like not that good.
948000	952000	I saw a tweet today it was like something like that and then somebody just said dinosaur
952000	954000	junior better.
954000	959000	It was like man she wrote this song about a breakup like 15 years ago and she was she
959000	960000	really blamed the woman.
960000	964000	I wonder if when she re-releases it she might write it to be like a little chiller.
964000	968000	And then the very next video is like then I watched a video where these guys laughed
968000	972000	about the women's soccer team playing the men's soccer team and like pointed to why
972000	974000	that's like why they make less money and stuff.
974000	976000	Do you think that was like a right wing thing?
976000	979000	I was like yeah dad it was.
979000	983000	And it was like I'll send it to you so you can see it was literally fucking The Daily
983000	984000	Wire.
984000	985000	Yeah.
985000	987000	And I was like yeah you got sent right into the algorithm.
987000	988000	Straight into it.
988000	989000	Straight there.
989000	990000	Just back out.
990000	992000	Maybe stop watching all these little reels.
992000	994000	They do have the targeting down pretty well.
994000	998000	Not that your dad is like that but he is in the demographic for.
998000	999000	Oh yeah.
999000	1000000	Easily flipped.
1000000	1002000	Light and old.
1002000	1008000	Not easily but just the kind that watches maybe all day so you could eventually weasel
1008000	1009000	your way in there.
1009000	1011000	I've heard that it's all old people do now.
1012000	1013000	My mom's watching reels.
1013000	1015000	My dad's watching reels.
1015000	1017000	Reels is specifically Facebook is that right?
1017000	1018000	Yeah.
1018000	1019000	Instagram.
1019000	1020000	Meta properties.
1020000	1021000	Gotcha gotcha.
1021000	1025000	Which I just joined the third wing of.
1025000	1028000	That sounds like some Hitler shit.
1028000	1032000	I didn't say I just joined the third Reich of Meta.
1032000	1035000	It sounds like you joined Meta's like Zucker Youth.
1035000	1036000	It's Threads.
1036000	1037000	It basically is.
1037000	1039000	Oh the third one.
1039000	1040000	That's what you meant.
1040000	1041000	Okay.
1041000	1042000	Yeah.
1042000	1043000	I mean like there's three of them.
1043000	1047000	Luke works in marketing so I thought he joined some Meta like secret society.
1047000	1048000	No.
1048000	1050000	There's Facebook, Instagram and now there's Threads.
1050000	1051000	Professional organization.
1051000	1052000	So I joined the third one.
1052000	1054000	I joined the third wing of Meta.
1054000	1055000	You know?
1055000	1059000	If it's between Musk and Zuck I'll kill myself.
1059000	1060000	Yeah.
1060000	1061000	Exactly.
1061000	1068000	People are like rooting for Zuck because Musk has been so annoying but they forget how Zuck
1068000	1069000	got where he is.
1069000	1074000	They didn't personally destabilize with democracy but like deliberately stood by while it happened
1074000	1075000	because it made him a lot of money.
1075000	1077000	He smiled weird too.
1077000	1078000	Like globally.
1078000	1083000	On that note dude I'm stoked to see DJT back up on stage debating.
1083000	1084000	You know?
1084000	1085000	Oh man I.
1085000	1088000	You been watching the reels?
1088000	1093000	When you said on that note I was like nice Luke's gonna turn us into playing the game.
1093000	1094000	That's the game.
1095000	1099000	I just looked at my notes to get ready and didn't even really catch what you said.
1099000	1100000	On that note.
1103000	1104000	Where we at?
1104000	1105000	We're beating Kurt up.
1105000	1107000	We all lost our goddamn minds.
1107000	1108000	Yeah.
1108000	1109000	Cal kicked Kurt's ass.
1109000	1111000	And his drone controller.
1111000	1115000	And broke his drone and threw some money at him for that.
1115000	1119000	And then if he stuck around for the post credit scene the very last thing that happened is
1119000	1122000	Cal sniffed the bag with the goo.
1122000	1123000	Do we need to leave?
1123000	1124000	The wax.
1124000	1127000	And he screams I'm gonna smell god goddamnit.
1127000	1129000	Don't sniff his ear wax finger.
1129000	1131000	That grosses me out.
1132000	1133000	His eyes went together.
1133000	1134000	He's coming.
1134000	1135000	Oh a Kimbo.
1135000	1139000	Yeah Cal really wants to do anything he has to to induce the sight of god from this.
1139000	1140000	Man.
1140000	1144000	I don't know what does Cal do to induce the sight of god?
1144000	1145000	It's a big world.
1145000	1146000	What are you gonna do?
1146000	1151000	Yeah I don't know I think he rubs his face in it real hard and he's just got this gross
1151000	1153000	black smudge on his nose.
1153000	1156000	Julius is like seeing it happen and like nudging.
1156000	1157000	Dude.
1157000	1158000	Dude.
1158000	1159000	Cal what are you doing?
1159000	1162000	I don't fucking know and he throws the bag on the ground and he just kind of storms off.
1162000	1163000	Are you alright?
1163000	1165000	Are you feeling anything?
1165000	1166000	He's walking away.
1166000	1168000	He took like a massive dose dude.
1168000	1169000	Oh shit.
1169000	1172000	Stevie reaches down and looks at the bag and they're like.
1172000	1178000	I think he like got some of it like on him maybe we should be careful with this I don't
1178000	1179000	know.
1179000	1182000	He stopped working like maybe it's been out in the air too long.
1182000	1183000	Sniff it.
1183000	1187000	They hold it up to their nose and look at you kind of.
1187000	1191000	Is this going to be the first time that all three of us have to leave the room so you
1191000	1193000	can talk to yourself?
1193000	1194000	Okay Stevie.
1194000	1195000	Here's what happens.
1195000	1196000	No this actually has already happened.
1196000	1200000	Stevie you remember while they're holding the bag up to their nose that you've seen
1200000	1205000	this before and they do kind of the same thing where their eyes go blank for just like a
1205000	1208000	quarter of a second and then.
1208000	1209000	Yeah.
1209000	1210000	Yeah.
1210000	1211000	No.
1211000	1215000	What did you see?
1215000	1218000	It still works.
1218000	1220000	And they.
1220000	1223000	You saw how the steel works?
1223000	1224000	Start shuddering.
1224000	1225000	Slowly.
1225000	1229000	Stevie you've got to talk to us maybe that will help.
1229000	1231000	Just tell us like.
1231000	1232000	Free associate right now.
1232000	1238000	Just tell us all the things that came to mind.
1238000	1243000	I saw Fred.
1243000	1247000	I saw Fred.
1247000	1250000	I saw Fred stacking bodies.
1250000	1255000	Just stacking bodies one after another and they weren't real.
1255000	1256000	They weren't real.
1256000	1257000	They weren't real.
1257000	1258000	They weren't real.
1258000	1259000	They weren't human.
1259000	1260000	They weren't.
1260000	1261000	I wasn't real.
1261000	1262000	I wasn't real.
1262000	1263000	Stevie.
1263000	1264000	Stevie.
1264000	1268000	Kyle's come back and he's like put a hand on their shoulder and he's trying to calm
1268000	1269000	them down.
1269000	1270000	Stevie just.
1270000	1272000	I told you that he's not a good guy.
1272000	1273000	I told you.
1273000	1274000	Okay.
1274000	1275000	Okay.
1275000	1276000	They are like sweating.
1276000	1281240	Like you can see just like sweat just like pouring down their face and it's it's coming
1281240	1287840	down past their hair in front of their face and they use their hair to kind of wipe away
1287840	1290200	some of the tears and the sweat.
1290200	1291480	Beck whips out a bandana.
1291480	1292480	He's always got one.
1292480	1293480	Hands it to them.
1293480	1294480	Thanks Beck.
1294480	1295480	Thanks.
1295480	1296480	Hey Stevie.
1296480	1301480	You like grew up around those animal human hybrid things like did you recognize where
1301480	1302480	that drone was?
1302480	1304960	Oh those are new man.
1304960	1310840	Those are fucking new and those are from after we locked down.
1310840	1312240	Okay.
1313240	1318800	He got Sandro on his side I guess he figured out how to change something he learned how
1318800	1319800	to do.
1319800	1320800	Yeah Fred.
1320800	1327200	He learned how to do something with Sandro and he I mean he taught me a little bit right.
1327200	1332120	The thing that I showed you and they kind of pull like a flask almost out of their pocket
1332120	1336680	kind of flash it at you and put it back in their pocket and you saw earlier when they
1336680	1341040	were spilling blood outside of the Mercedes.
1341040	1344040	That's what they were using just spilled the blood around.
1344040	1351620	He taught me a little bit of how to manipulate people and the world but he must have figured
1351620	1360800	out something even bigger because I mean that something happened and I mean Godels Gorge
1360800	1368040	like it like changed it like there's something there was a shimmer about it and that's when
1368040	1373640	people started showing up and animals of all sorts and the you know the in-betweeners
1373640	1376380	and that.
1376380	1380080	The in-betweeners is that the is that what we just saw?
1380080	1384720	Yeah yeah I think so I hadn't seen anything like that that world that you asked about
1384720	1391680	that that place I don't know I don't I don't know I guess that's where they came from but
1391680	1397620	like we saw them when we were going across back across to leave Grover's Gorge across
1397620	1403180	I mean those things were there and they they came from the church they were alive though
1403180	1408020	but like that's I think that's where he was stacking the you said you saw the bodies right
1408020	1413140	I think that's where I just saw those bodies I saw the bodies with the blood moat and the
1413140	1418500	train over the blood tracks and on why does this guy have so many bodies I think it's
1418500	1425300	because they're appearing in Godels Gorge and so he was using them to fill up the moat
1425300	1430540	Jesus get it together see can I back up real fast you said that Fred got Sandro on his
1430540	1438620	side wasn't Sandro a turtle yeah but you know God did he communicate with the turtle yeah
1438620	1443340	was it with the turtle or the thing inside the turtle I mean it was the thing inside
1443340	1447960	the turtle is the thing that's inside Greg so what did Sandra think about that I'm just
1447960	1454220	trying to lighten the mood Sandra was a prisoner I think where was that thing before it was
1454220	1464040	in Sandro Frank put it in Sandro or like maybe the mayor before Sandro I mean obviously there's
1464040	1469180	something to do with the mayor right like who was the mayor before Sandro it's in your
1469180	1476700	notes you're the only one who saw his grave oh I fell on top of his grave that's right
1476700	1482520	I think you mentioned something he had a name it's so much has happened since then he's
1482520	1491400	buried behind a fox's house Greg did I make Fox up no that's the name that I think Fred
1491400	1496520	like made him have after he changed him well it was behind his house but it doesn't matter
1496520	1509880	I wonder if hmm I wish you wouldn't have let your brother go Wow me too but also like I had
1509880	1521200	to why did you have to he's my brother like not not anymore really yeah I know I get it
1521200	1528120	I get it what if we got the mayor to go into like a little worm or something now he's like
1528120	1534440	out there right we gotta find him before we can do anything if we paint a hole on the side of the
1534440	1540000	wall like Wile E. Coyote and he just smacks his fucking dome against it don't do you think he's
1540000	1545040	drawn to the holes or is he making them I think he's thinking he's making them but you know I
1545040	1550600	don't spitball it here I mean it's yeah I mean do you have a better solution than a giant hole
1551240	1564640	because I'd like to hear it everybody roll alertness at a negative 20 fail you're caught
1564640	1572000	up in this conversation pass fail but even while caught up in this conversation Julius you notice
1572000	1581520	that daddy is collecting the broken drone screen like monitor out of the trash that Cal kicked it
1581520	1590800	into and putting it back into his bowling bag hey daddy I'm sorry I don't daddy recoils when you
1590800	1598520	call out to him did that thing did that thing not freak you out course it freaked me out made me feel
1598520	1603960	all sorts of bad things did it make you want to punch yourself cuz that's what made me feel like
1603960	1613520	doing to you I don't want I don't want to be a part of any more okay you don't have to be throws
1613520	1621360	the memory stick and leave your broken drone here his eyes get really big and he takes off running
1621520	1637920	after him boys dexterity Cal fails you want on a 45 Beck fails 97 on a 50 I got a 19 on a 70 I got
1637920	1647880	a 30 on this guy can't do that dextrous probably like a 40 Julius why does he get away as everyone
1647880	1654240	falls behind the two of you are sprinting off taking around corners and running around the
1654240	1660000	streets of downtown you've left Cal Colorado and Beck Wilder in the dust it takes a while but as
1660000	1667160	soon as Julius starts to feel you know that heat you get from running as soon as he starts to feel
1667160	1674280	that he just it's like his body almost goes limp and he just kind of loses balance and falls to
1674280	1680040	the ground don't worry Cal Julius is after him he's got those thighs he's gonna catch him no
1680040	1685360	problem I probably will but let's let's swing around in the Mercedes and and cut him off we
1685360	1692000	gotta go all the way back to your place for it what we came here in the van whatever get the
1692960	1710040	fucking car from quite a distance you just hear do this guys I I can't do it you're like you're
1710040	1717760	looking back you're looking back at where he came from but then the the can van pulls up right next
1717880	1723920	to you Julius kind of like crawls over to it and like I help you in kind of just yeah throws
1723920	1728200	himself into the back way to go dude you're totally noodled what's going on does anyone have
1728200	1735520	navigation Julius tries to point where he went but it's just kind of his arm kind of hops 10% I'll
1735520	1747160	give Stevie a 30 if somebody wants to roll for them that's a critical failure in 88 you're going
1747160	1755240	right for the hole they spot a little bit of drone down the distance and they plug in his home
1755240	1763080	address on their phone and Cal slaps it out the window oh and as it we don't need that newfangled
1763080	1771160	technology to catch a creep and you both see it as it lands just lands on one corner and you see
1771160	1778080	it just kind of like pops in the screen shatters off of the side of it and it just falls into a
1778080	1785760	few different pieces as the canned van continues to drive and Stevie's like what do I we're off the
1785760	1794680	grid now Stevie everybody throw your phones out the window do we have to Julius does not throw
1795520	1801960	cows cows like driving like a madman he's not really it's not really paying attention to those
1801960	1812040	demands okay but doesn't back I want you to find anything in this man made after I don't know 1996
1812040	1821840	okay get it at the fuck out of here Julius quickly thinks about what Yuri was born and then
1824680	1833720	yeah dude okay no problem and he throws one mic cable out the window Oh Stevie all right
1833720	1840880	oh I just I'm gonna miss that mic cable I need to piss okay
1840880	1861320	it'll do where were we not we rent we are going the wrong way we got in the van to try to chase
1861320	1868480	down daddy daddy daddy are we just kind of aimlessly driving at this point or where are we
1868480	1874560	going haven't we met him at his house as Cal dry do that once am I going fucking insane here
1874560	1879920	I think maybe a little bit you did just attack him out of nowhere seemingly that was wild do
1879920	1889160	you want to speak on that drone brought the thing to us um you know is it so is it so crazy to be
1889160	1896120	afraid of that fucking thing Cali John was it the drone was in that play that that that thing the
1896120	1899680	drone was gonna lead that thing right to us it went through the hole that thing could come through
1899680	1907040	the hole to Cal I never realized that you like had to get rid of an accent to be on TV it was
1907040	1917520	really coming out there I don't know what you're talking about good with me where is it Julie is
1917520	1925480	Cal driving yeah yeah in the rearview mirror yeah it's a POV shot from Julius's perspective and he's
1925480	1933560	like huh so what are we doing what's well you know I was thinking like every time we sniff the bag
1933560	1940240	we're seeing the bodies we're seeing the church and then we flew the drone down into a hole and
1940240	1947400	we saw the animal with the last time we saw the animal guys was by the church going with this
1947400	1953520	Julius I'm thinking maybe we got to get back to the gorge and back to that church and maybe I saw
1953560	1959880	some tracks maybe take that train Julius we we can't do shit there he saw we need to come back
1959880	1965400	with the fucking Air Force what does X say about all this I mean that's we need to fucking new
1965400	1972680	Godel's Gorge okay if Godel's Gorge is out for now I guess the only other person who's experienced
1972680	1979160	that I mean we could go talk to Kaylee silver the doctor was talking about climbing into stomachs
1979160	1984240	that seems I mean if it's not related that would be weird we were definitely gonna do that was that
1984240	1988440	supposed to be today or well there was also tentatively a meeting with Brock Hargrave but
1988440	1993080	we all kind of came to the conclusion that he's probably not with us anymore yes we need to try
1993080	1997000	to make it though just in case I mean should we should we just maybe just be there just in case
1997000	2001520	maybe if somebody's monitoring his communications we could get the drop on them I mean we could go
2001520	2006600	and wait for like 15 minutes and then scope it out then go talk to Kaylee go talk to Kaylee after
2006600	2014000	that yeah yeah I mean I think we could all use a drink it is it is I'm gonna say we were supposed

2378480	2384240	well maintained but clearly been here for a substantial amount of time sitting on the train
2384240	2394320	tracks here in the city sun is beating down it's july 7th after all about 11 10 11 11 somewhere
2394320	2404800	in there oh guys make a wish I wish yeah and yeah there's a couple people sitting on the patio
2404800	2412000	outside having a drink together and as you guys walk in the sun coming in through the windows
2412000	2418960	feels almost out of place here at the foundry you're used to this being an after work sort of
2418960	2426800	location but there's some regulars sitting around the bar and maggie is bartending as always
2428000	2434320	you see the televisions are on various news media outlets and julius checks to make sure at least
2434320	2440960	a couple of them are can oh yeah at least a couple are for sure any news about julius's uncle no
2440960	2449360	strangely no coverage of the death of ty frayland and no coverage of the death of some city
2449360	2456400	pd and no deaths are being reported on taking place at the zeitgeist only two nights ago
2456400	2462560	hey maggie have you been watching the news yeah are they talking about anything other than the
2462560	2468800	hole no mostly just whole talk no like so smooth they just keep trying to get those cameras on the
2468800	2474320	smooth edge it's wild but you never see anything like it cal kind of turns back to you guys and
2474320	2481520	like grins and he's like we're gonna have an exclusive voice yeah the thing is though like
2481520	2489600	you know the x files isn't super into like airing out their dirty laundry so i don't know if uh
2490640	2496560	that's such a good idea whoa whoa julius my dude but no we're not talking about your uncle
2497200	2501040	they just aren't talking about any of the things we're going through which is what we're reporting
2501040	2505680	on julius is saying that he doesn't want to put the footage out of the cut in half bodies
2506240	2512400	definitely not the type stuff there's type stuff no just i mean we make we report the news and
2512400	2517360	we know the news it doesn't have to have a video anyway that it doesn't matter we're not going to
2517360	2525280	do it yeah maggie maggie holes yeah good on the holes we'll take a round hey beck maybe we should
2525280	2532560	report on the type stuff i mean he's right i don't have any footage of it weird i mean at the
2532560	2537120	end of the day that's just a murder the stuff that we've got going is yeah a lot bigger and like
2537120	2542320	pretty sure it's cool if we like put it out there did you think we were going to no you know what i
2542320	2549280	don't it's been a rough time for me i don't know i trust you guys but like well you know get it
2549280	2557680	together depression's not real julius on on that note a round for everybody yeah yeah yeah i know
2557680	2563040	it's right here and uh yeah i heard everything you said but uh you know everything's off the record
2563040	2573600	here in the foundry julius shushes her jokingly like like oh it's like a funny joke julius sure
2573600	2578960	thinks it is cow's jaws like dropped and he legitimately doesn't know it's like the fucking
2579520	2585360	bad and the ugly even the dust has stopped moving in the sun rays that are floating in
2587200	2590560	and then julie maggie starts laughing
2595840	2602240	okay run it or start good good one julius i think well uh maybe just run it we're we're waiting for
2602240	2607760	proc or grief you haven't seen a dude in here who looks like an archaeologist he's all dirty all
2607760	2614320	the time no and has a shovel i've not seen a dirty man with a shovel in the foundry today now
2614320	2620240	well what about a clean man with a shovel no and any number of legs uh what doesn't matter it's
2620240	2626720	for the news this world's getting stranger and stranger as she goes to clean a pint glass you
2626720	2631280	should give him a call am i imagining that when you first contacted him did you say something like
2631280	2636160	our usual booth or something like that or did that not happen no but i mean of course there's
2636160	2640720	our can booth that we sit in with all our pictures above let's go sit over there i mean i'm sure that
2640720	2646880	he'll he'll head that way julius just make sure to like have a line of sight to the entrance
2646880	2654480	and once again the can crew goes the can booth where the picture of a much younger cow colorado
2654480	2664960	is on the wall right behind the now shaken downtrodden sad cows like actively shaking
2664960	2672640	his voice against the like shaking his head at the voice in his head it's like one of those
2672640	2678160	things max i'm i'm not sad i'm not downtrodden i'm angry as hell and i'm gonna get to the bottom
2678160	2684640	of this shit and he like screams that in the bar julius kind of looks like what the fuck and he's
2684640	2690400	like yeah man yeah uh does anybody have a sharpie i want to sign this and it's a picture of julius

2697920	2702160	of his pocket and like scribbles big all across the cow colorado
2708560	2710640	i mean that's it's probably worth more now
2713200	2720160	are we all gonna sign it cool julius signs it like right above his own head an ambling over
2720880	2729360	to the table as you're all going through and citing these framed pictures an emaciated woman
2730560	2737920	in a tank top and loose shorts so loose that i could probably fit one of my thighs through
2737920	2745760	the entire waist maybe maybe be tight but these tiny shorts are loose did that make any sense
2745760	2748960	yeah cal's staring he's like dr bar carver
2752160	2758720	she has a broken nose and her two eyes are looking at two of you
2759520	2767040	at the exact same time right it's one of the chameleon hybrids and she's sort of sort of
2767040	2772560	shaking kind of herky-jerky and kind of grits her mouth

3428560	3435280	i listened to 25 or six to four this morning and it has been sucking my head all day what's that
3435280	3442320	what's what 25 or six to four it's chicago song you brought that up because just today at work
3442320	3447440	my boss was saying that the best uh live show he's ever saw was chicago okay the reason i listened
3447440	3454240	to it is because i hung out with ian this weekend and we were watching just like live music videos
3454240	3461280	of old rock bands and one of them we watched was that song and they speed it up live and it's even
3461280	3470640	better than the way i'm super dangerous i saw chicago recently good with me it's one that
3470640	3477040	didn't make it into the show i played 25 or six to four in my middle school band what what
3477040	3482960	instrument did you play trombone so i got to do wow that's awesome is that why you played
3483040	3484240	trombone did you get to do some
3500480	3505200	did you still have your trombone uh i might have an old one i sold a really nice one
3505200	3508960	for a lot of money when i was in middle school it was like as i got out of middle school said
3508960	3513440	i'm not playing this shit no more and i sold it on ebay and it was like they're expensive as hell
3513440	3516880	i mean i think it was like maybe five hundred dollars but that was five hundred dollars to
3516880	3522880	middle school yeah wait why did you get the money this is so confusing uh because it was i stole it
3522880	3527440	i stole it from the kid in the first place so like i beat up a i beat up a sixth grader and
3527440	3534160	took his trombone it was uh it was gifted to me it wasn't nobody had paid for it oh love that i
3534160	3539120	feel a little bad that i've sold a gifted thing but i played it for three years and decided it
3539120	3544160	wasn't once it's gifted what'd you buy with the money i don't remember yeah cocaine a shittier
3544160	3551280	trombone um when when ian and i were watching that video though we were both you know had smoked
3551280	3557680	weed and just like halfway through halfway through ian just looked at me and goes what do you think
3557680	3565280	it means so we looked it up and it was talking about his favorite time to write songs was between
3565280	3572480	30 and 25 minutes to four o'clock in the morning and the thing it's either 25 minutes or six to
3572480	3578800	four oh wow okay yeah so there you go it's about writing music late at night or early in the
3578800	3583040	morning but for him probably late at night you just imagine him at a fucking 345 going like
3583040	3589520	this is awesome all of his neighbors it makes all the all the lyrics make more sense the first
3589520	3597520	thing waiting for the break of day i just assumed his neighbors would come in and kill him and then
3597520	3604720	be like he had it coming he had it coming oh we have um we have good reason to believe that
3604720	3609920	zach might try to the menu us tonight so this might be the last episode of the podcast
