1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,800
Introductions are bound to confound.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:08,700
Using wet sounds to turn frowns upside down.

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:13,060
It is me, Wolf the Dog, DJ Extraordinaire.

4
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:18,200
Hoppin' on the sound waves, leavin' my soul exposed bare.

5
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:23,260
Radio show is 694.2 PTBP.

6
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:27,360
And now, excuse me for I have to go pee-pee.

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,860
The- the- the end.

8
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:33,060
I hope y'all enjoyed that poem that I composed.

9
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:38,100
I spent almost as much time as I do on the show notes with that one.

10
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:44,160
And speaking of show notes, someone done went and sent a note to the show.

11
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:49,460
This Howlin' with Wolf is from Zach from the show that comes on after this.

12
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:55,700
He sent in this message and said it's some sort of contest drawing announcement of winners.

13
00:00:55,700 --> 00:01:02,800
I guess he finally got around to tagging at Pretending Pod on his personal Instagram story.

14
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,300
Wow, get a load of this fuckin' guy, huh?

15
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:09,200
Alright, here he is, I- I guess.

16
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,300
What's up, I'm Zach. Thanks for that incredible introduction, Mr. Wolf the Dog.

17
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:18,900
And right you are, I'm here to announce the winners of the drawing slash contest.

18
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,200
And, first off...

19
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,900
Mwahahahahaha!

20
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:30,600
The season's fan art contest slash drawing had some buckwild entries in all sorts of different mediums.

21
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:36,300
We were- we were all completely blown away by all of your creativity and your talent.

22
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:39,400
So, each and every one of you, thank you so much for entering.

23
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,900
This is so incredible.

24
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:44,300
Now, let's get to the winners of merch stuff.

25
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,800
We're gonna start with the drawing, which is random.

26
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:53,900
So, I'm pulling these names out of a digital hat, and the first winner is...

27
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,300
Storm Clouds.

28
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,600
Storm Clouds, you are the first winner.

29
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,700
And the second winner is...

30
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,400
GrimlinDude420.

31
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:12,100
So, big ol' congrats to Storm Clouds and GrimlinDude420 for your luck and your sweet, sweet victory.

32
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,200
You each get one merch thing.

33
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:19,700
And now, for the contest portion of the drawing slash contest.

34
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,600
We've got a little surprise for ya.

35
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:27,800
There were just too many- there were too many jaw-dropping entries this time.

36
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,200
Like, a bunch of wildly weird and cool shit.

37
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,700
So, we're gonna name a couple runners-up.

38
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,400
And you'll both also get one merch thing.

39
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,900
So, in no particular order, the runners-up are...

40
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:54,000
Antique__Resident__124 for a piece of physical art titled Play Ball, which they made out of clay.

41
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:02,300
It's like a hand that reaches out for a ball that's in a squeamish situation, and it is fantastic.

42
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,700
Go check it out if you haven't seen it yet.

43
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,500
And the other runner-up is...

44
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:19,600
Oxum__Live for a cross-stitch that we actually requested in episode 49 at 17 minutes and 50 seconds in or so.

45
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,700
I don't- didn't remember it, went back and listened to it.

46
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:32,400
The Pettymore family cross-stitch portrays Jeremy Pettymore on a riding lawnmower and a drunk Don D. Pettymore tied to a tree.

47
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,700
And it says, mow the lawn and tie up Don.

48
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,700
Fucking aces and really well done both of you.

49
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,100
Thank you so much for entering.

50
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,500
You each get one thing.

51
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,000
And now...

52
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,500
Is that good?

53
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,000
That drum roll on the mic?

54
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,300
Do you like that?

55
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,000
The winner of the contest.

56
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,800
The winner of three merch things.

57
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,600
It's...

58
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:04,200
SlideWhistle, who did a discombobulating illustration of a psychedelically holy cow.

59
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,100
And the whole gang from our Holy Cow Farm short story.

60
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:12,600
Jimmy Corrigan, Shelly St. Blythe, Vincente Bowery, and Meat Hook.

61
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,700
So go check it out if you haven't seen it.

62
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,800
SlideWhistle, truly top-notch work.

63
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:20,300
Thank you so much and huge shout out to everyone.

64
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:23,700
All of our winners, all the folks who submitted entries.

65
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,700
That's right, I'm talking to you.

66
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:31,000
Ziggy Elinasto, ItWasAllASnowGrow, Brie the Banshee, Dismal Underscore Dependent7515,

67
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,100
Demir 2019, Nestria, Surplus Turtles, God's Gift Card to Women, Jars of Olivers,

68
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:42,700
DJ Intslut, Chewing Brie, Super5ish, Choco Underscore Crayon, Turkey Ham, Soren Ash,

69
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:46,600
Pretending Underscore Cyrus, and UiguiGoodness.

70
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,200
And of course, once again to our winners, Stormclouds, GremlinDude420,

71
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:55,400
Antique Underscore Resident Underscore, 124, and Oxum Underscore Live,

72
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:01,700
as well as our grand finale contest winner, SlideWhistle.

73
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,000
Thank you to everyone.

74
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,400
Now, back to you, Wolf.

75
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,600
I love you.

76
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:11,200
Wow, I sure do enjoy the nice things that Zach said to and about me.

77
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,900
Thank you, Zach, for whatever it is you do around here.

78
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,400
I'm sure it's important.

79
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:22,300
Are you caught up to this episode, but you're not yet getting that sweet exclusive,

80
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:27,500
Sklussy for short, b-b-b-b-b-b-bonus content

81
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:33,200
to satiate your earhole needs in between fresh episode drops?

82
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:38,400
Before you respond, keep in mind that I can see the numbers,

83
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,400
and the numbers just keep going up.

84
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:47,000
We recently dropped the two-part finale of the seven-part campaign

85
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,200
that Thomas wrote, ran, and entitled The Lost Treasure of John Lee Pettymore,

86
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:57,600
and then their Patreon numbers shot up with folks aching

87
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,700
to listen to this wild continuation of the story of contention

88
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,700
after the events of season one.

89
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:09,700
Now, you probably already know it's only five bucks

90
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:15,600
to gain clearance to the RSS feed we call Contention Confidential,

91
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,000
where you can listen to that Oops All Pettymore's campaign,

92
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,400
along with grease loads more bonus episodes for your cochlear pleasures.

93
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,200
That's at patreon.com slash pretending pod.

94
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,700
And if you'd rather just click something,

95
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:36,500
that link in the other links are in the show notes.

96
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,900
Now, how about some more boring facts and figures?

97
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,100
It's the news.

98
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:46,200
Last time, waffles were had at the home of Cal Colorado

99
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,800
before the canned crew made their way downtown to the hole

100
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,900
in the bridge that crosses the city river.

101
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:57,400
In a nearby alley, they met Kurt, aka Daddy,

102
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:02,100
who busted out one of those fancy new air-to-underwater drones

103
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,700
and flew that sucker right on through the unguarded,

104
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:08,400
unnaturally smooth hole.

105
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,900
And then he plunged it into the city river below.

106
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:17,100
The aquatic drone dove down into and through a tugboat,

107
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,700
which was, and also still is,

108
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:24,400
partially stuck in an enormous cartoon hole in the riverbed.

109
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:29,200
And when the drone went through the tugboat and came out the other side,

110
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:33,100
it flew into an old-timey school gymnasium

111
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:36,500
with a bloody throne under one of the basketball hoops

112
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:41,300
and a small humanoid creature with round ears atop its head,

113
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:44,300
wearing a blood-soaked school uniform.

114
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:48,400
And that thing skittered on all fours towards the drone camera,

115
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,600
which nimbly dodged the grab.

116
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,400
But then Cal knocked the shit out of Kurt,

117
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,000
kicked in the screen on the drone remote,

118
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,300
and punted it to the metaphorical and very real curb,

119
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:03,600
taking us now to whatever's next.

120
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:09,600
It's Alter Girl with My Life is Great and It's All My Fault.

121
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Cause my life is great and it's all my fault.

122
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I'll let you braid their hair if that's what you're into.

123
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I am gonna think probably of the three movies,

124
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
it's gonna be maybe the best one.

125
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
The best one.

126
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
For sure the best one.

127
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
The three movies, you mean Oppenheimer, Barbie, and Wonka?

128
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Yeah.

129
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
The trilogy.

130
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Reserved my seats for Barbie today.

131
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Wonka and barber.

132
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Wow, they really got you, huh?

133
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I'm gonna wait until it's not the night it comes out and then go see it at the IMAX.

134
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Oh nice.

135
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Oh wait, are we recording?

136
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Sure.

137
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Beep.

138
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Are we?

139
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Yeah.

140
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Action.

141
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Do it though.

142
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I am.

143
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
The light didn't come on, you didn't go like click.

144
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
We should get it on air.

145
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
We need it on air.

146
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
We should get it on air.

147
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Why not?

148
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Cause we're not on air.

149
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
We're on tape baby and it's not even that anymore.

150
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Direct to digital.

151
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
That just doesn't have it.

152
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Ron Zach's laptop.

153
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Direct to digital is even worse in some circles.

154
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Are we recording?

155
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Yeah.

156
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Luke, how was Taylor Swift?

157
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Yeah.

158
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
It was so fucking good dude.

159
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Tell us about your era's experience.

160
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Well, I went and-

161
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
So far so good.

162
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Got there.

163
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Whoa.

164
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
And I sat down and then Muna played and they were pretty good.

165
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Gracie Abrams played and I had never heard her music but she's pretty good.

166
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
And then the real show started.

167
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
And it went on for three hours and 50 minutes.

168
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Jesus Christ.

169
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Three hours and 50 minutes?

170
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Just shy of four hours long.

171
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Oh my god.

172
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
With two openers.

173
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Oh my god.

174
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
No, just Taylor's set was-

175
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Right.

176
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
When did it start?

177
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
The openers played maybe 20 minutes at eight o'clock and was done by basically midnight.

178
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Wow.

179
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
It was fucking amazing dude.

180
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
So the day that I went was the day she released her Speak Now re-release.

181
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Don't speak.

182
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
She like played-

183
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I know just what you're thinking.

184
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
That's my favorite one.

185
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Played extra songs from that.

186
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I don't know.

187
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Because on her re-release record she does like from the vault song.

188
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
So basically B-sides that didn't make it on the record.

189
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:01,000
So she premiered a music video for one of those songs that hadn't been shown before.

190
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
That had Taylor Lautner and Chloe King I think is her name.

191
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
An actress in it.

192
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
And then she showed it and she's like, what'd you guys think?

193
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
And everybody screams.

194
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
And she's like, well in a normal film premiere they have the actors there.

195
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
And then brought out everybody in it.

196
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
And then Taylor Lautner comes out and does like a backflip on the stage and shit.

197
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Attaboy.

198
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
And they like talk for a little bit.

199
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
And dude all the fucking music was so good dude.

200
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
It was-

201
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Hell yeah.

202
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
At like two hours in I was like, damn my feet hurt.

203
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
And as I watch her like fucking dancing around on stage.

204
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
For the Nth night in a row.

205
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Do you know if she's doing four hours a night every night?

206
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I think ours was slightly longer by maybe 10 or 15 minutes.

207
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Wow.

208
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
That's still a wildly long set.

209
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
That's crazy.

210
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Yeah dude it's nuts.

211
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I mean cause it's like songs from every single album that she has.

212
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Would you say like every era?

213
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Every era dude.

214
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
But the last tour she did was four albums ago.

215
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Oh wow.

216
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Oh I don't think I realized that.

217
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Yeah COVID happened.

218
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
She released two albums like in the height of COVID.

219
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
One right before that she didn't get to tour on.

220
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
And then one just recently.

221
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
This is her first tour since COVID?

222
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Yeah.

223
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Wow.

224
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Shit okay.

225
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
So usually the times I've seen her in the past it's like here's the album that I just

226
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
came out with.

227
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
We'll play all the songs on it.

228
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
And then you know a few of the hits.

229
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
So this time it was like the hits from every single album.

230
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
And then most of the songs on the new album.

231
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It was fucking nuts.

232
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
So a good $200,000 well spent?

233
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Yeah.

234
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
No I at work I sat at work on Ticketmaster for about six hours.

235
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Do you want to include that in the pod for?

236
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I was doing it right next to my boss who was also on Ticketmaster for about six hours trying

237
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
to get tickets.

238
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
So we got them day of so I paid I mean they were like 300 something dollars but I didn't

239
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
pay.

240
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I mean people were paying like thousands for it.

241
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
That sounds reasonable.

242
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
For what it was yeah.

243
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
For about a hundred less than a hundred bucks an hour.

244
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
For a four hour stadium show.

245
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Wow.

246
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Exactly.

247
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
That's not that at all.

248
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
And my seats were fucking good and dude it was just nuts.

249
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Like I'll show you guys like some videos I took later but like.

250
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
He's talking to you audience.

251
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Yeah I'll share them on in the discord.

252
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
But dude the whole setup like the stage and everything was just nuts.

253
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Like the whole stage was also video.

254
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Oh come on.

255
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Yeah and so dude at one point like the stage turns into water and she like finishes a song

256
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
and just you can't even like see it but the stage like barely opens up and she just dives

257
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,000
into the stage and then like it's a like a video of her like swimming under the stage

258
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
all the way.

259
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
And then like she pops up and like plays another song.

260
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
It was.

261
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Do you think she runs or is she jumping down to a little area where there's like a little

262
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
go kart that takes her to the next spot?

263
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
No dude.

264
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
She hits the segue.

265
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
It's like assistance next to her with like little fans and some bottled water.

266
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Dude the choreography of all of it though to like hit all of that like exactly when

267
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
they need to and like running from I mean the stage was as basically as long as Arrowheads

268
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Field is like.

269
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Like as big as this room?

270
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Almost.

271
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
It's huge.

272
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
But dude it was it was fun as shit and it was great.

273
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I had a great time and she sang all the songs that I wanted to hear.

274
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Do you feel like she had fun though?

275
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I looked it up and she is taking like this is not what each show makes but what she's

276
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
taking home from each show is around four to five million dollars.

277
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:51,000
So it doesn't matter if she's having fun.

278
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I would assume probably a little bit but you know even if it's work it's a pretty good

279
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
job.

280
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Yeah last thing that was cool she had a guitar on her original Speak.

281
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
What?

282
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
She had a guitar on her Speak Now tour that's been in like the Music Hall of Fame.

283
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I read about this.

284
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
And they like took it out and she played it for that show.

285
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Somebody say it's like when Captain America goes to get his shield from the museum.

286
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
My dad today was like do you like Taylor Swift?

287
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I was like yeah I'm not like a huge fan or anything but I like some of her songs.

288
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
He's like I think I do too.

289
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Like I just all of a sudden been hearing a lot about her like all these videos keep popping

290
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
up on my like reels.

291
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
And he like then he got into some pretty like weird drama about her.

292
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Like reels drama?

293
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Yeah.

294
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I'm imagining your dad commenting like not that good.

295
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I saw a tweet today it was like something like that and then somebody just said dinosaur

296
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
junior better.

297
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
It was like man she wrote this song about a breakup like 15 years ago and she was she

298
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
really blamed the woman.

299
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I wonder if when she re-releases it she might write it to be like a little chiller.

300
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
And then the very next video is like then I watched a video where these guys laughed

301
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
about the women's soccer team playing the men's soccer team and like pointed to why

302
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
that's like why they make less money and stuff.

303
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Do you think that was like a right wing thing?

304
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I was like yeah dad it was.

305
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
And it was like I'll send it to you so you can see it was literally fucking The Daily

306
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Wire.

307
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Yeah.

308
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
And I was like yeah you got sent right into the algorithm.

309
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Straight into it.

310
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Straight there.

311
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Just back out.

312
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Maybe stop watching all these little reels.

313
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
They do have the targeting down pretty well.

314
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Not that your dad is like that but he is in the demographic for.

315
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Oh yeah.

316
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Easily flipped.

317
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Light and old.

318
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Not easily but just the kind that watches maybe all day so you could eventually weasel

319
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
your way in there.

320
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I've heard that it's all old people do now.

321
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
My mom's watching reels.

322
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
My dad's watching reels.

323
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Reels is specifically Facebook is that right?

324
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Yeah.

325
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Instagram.

326
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Meta properties.

327
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Gotcha gotcha.

328
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Which I just joined the third wing of.

329
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
That sounds like some Hitler shit.

330
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I didn't say I just joined the third Reich of Meta.

331
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
It sounds like you joined Meta's like Zucker Youth.

332
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
It's Threads.

333
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
It basically is.

334
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Oh the third one.

335
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
That's what you meant.

336
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Okay.

337
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Yeah.

338
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I mean like there's three of them.

339
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Luke works in marketing so I thought he joined some Meta like secret society.

340
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
No.

341
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
There's Facebook, Instagram and now there's Threads.

342
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Professional organization.

343
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
So I joined the third one.

344
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I joined the third wing of Meta.

345
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
You know?

346
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
If it's between Musk and Zuck I'll kill myself.

347
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Yeah.

348
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Exactly.

349
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:48,000
People are like rooting for Zuck because Musk has been so annoying but they forget how Zuck

350
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
got where he is.

351
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,000
They didn't personally destabilize with democracy but like deliberately stood by while it happened

352
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
because it made him a lot of money.

353
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
He smiled weird too.

354
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Like globally.

355
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,000
On that note dude I'm stoked to see DJT back up on stage debating.

356
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
You know?

357
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Oh man I.

358
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
You been watching the reels?

359
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,000
When you said on that note I was like nice Luke's gonna turn us into playing the game.

360
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
That's the game.

361
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I just looked at my notes to get ready and didn't even really catch what you said.

362
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
On that note.

363
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Where we at?

364
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
We're beating Kurt up.

365
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
We all lost our goddamn minds.

366
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Yeah.

367
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Cal kicked Kurt's ass.

368
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
And his drone controller.

369
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
And broke his drone and threw some money at him for that.

370
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
And then if he stuck around for the post credit scene the very last thing that happened is

371
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Cal sniffed the bag with the goo.

372
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Do we need to leave?

373
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
The wax.

374
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
And he screams I'm gonna smell god goddamnit.

375
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Don't sniff his ear wax finger.

376
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
That grosses me out.

377
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
His eyes went together.

378
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
He's coming.

379
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Oh a Kimbo.

380
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Yeah Cal really wants to do anything he has to to induce the sight of god from this.

381
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Man.

382
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I don't know what does Cal do to induce the sight of god?

383
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
It's a big world.

384
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
What are you gonna do?

385
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Yeah I don't know I think he rubs his face in it real hard and he's just got this gross

386
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
black smudge on his nose.

387
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Julius is like seeing it happen and like nudging.

388
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Dude.

389
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Dude.

390
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Cal what are you doing?

391
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I don't fucking know and he throws the bag on the ground and he just kind of storms off.

392
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Are you alright?

393
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Are you feeling anything?

394
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
He's walking away.

395
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
He took like a massive dose dude.

396
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Oh shit.

397
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Stevie reaches down and looks at the bag and they're like.

398
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I think he like got some of it like on him maybe we should be careful with this I don't

399
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
know.

400
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
He stopped working like maybe it's been out in the air too long.

401
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Sniff it.

402
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
They hold it up to their nose and look at you kind of.

403
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Is this going to be the first time that all three of us have to leave the room so you

404
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
can talk to yourself?

405
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Okay Stevie.

406
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Here's what happens.

407
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
No this actually has already happened.

408
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Stevie you remember while they're holding the bag up to their nose that you've seen

409
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,000
this before and they do kind of the same thing where their eyes go blank for just like a

410
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
quarter of a second and then.

411
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Yeah.

412
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Yeah.

413
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
No.

414
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
What did you see?

415
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
It still works.

416
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
And they.

417
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
You saw how the steel works?

418
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Start shuddering.

419
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Slowly.

420
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Stevie you've got to talk to us maybe that will help.

421
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Just tell us like.

422
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Free associate right now.

423
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Just tell us all the things that came to mind.

424
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I saw Fred.

425
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I saw Fred.

426
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I saw Fred stacking bodies.

427
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Just stacking bodies one after another and they weren't real.

428
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
They weren't real.

429
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
They weren't real.

430
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
They weren't real.

431
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
They weren't human.

432
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
They weren't.

433
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I wasn't real.

434
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I wasn't real.

435
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Stevie.

436
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Stevie.

437
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Kyle's come back and he's like put a hand on their shoulder and he's trying to calm

438
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
them down.

439
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Stevie just.

440
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I told you that he's not a good guy.

441
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I told you.

442
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Okay.

443
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Okay.

444
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
They are like sweating.

445
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,240
Like you can see just like sweat just like pouring down their face and it's it's coming

446
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:27,840
down past their hair in front of their face and they use their hair to kind of wipe away

447
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,200
some of the tears and the sweat.

448
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,480
Beck whips out a bandana.

449
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,480
He's always got one.

450
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,480
Hands it to them.

451
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,480
Thanks Beck.

452
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,480
Thanks.

453
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,480
Hey Stevie.

454
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:41,480
You like grew up around those animal human hybrid things like did you recognize where

455
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,480
that drone was?

456
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,960
Oh those are new man.

457
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:50,840
Those are fucking new and those are from after we locked down.

458
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,240
Okay.

459
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:58,800
He got Sandro on his side I guess he figured out how to change something he learned how

460
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,800
to do.

461
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,800
Yeah Fred.

462
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:07,200
He learned how to do something with Sandro and he I mean he taught me a little bit right.

463
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:12,120
The thing that I showed you and they kind of pull like a flask almost out of their pocket

464
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:16,680
kind of flash it at you and put it back in their pocket and you saw earlier when they

465
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:21,040
were spilling blood outside of the Mercedes.

466
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:24,040
That's what they were using just spilled the blood around.

467
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:31,620
He taught me a little bit of how to manipulate people and the world but he must have figured

468
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:40,800
out something even bigger because I mean that something happened and I mean Godels Gorge

469
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:48,040
like it like changed it like there's something there was a shimmer about it and that's when

470
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:53,640
people started showing up and animals of all sorts and the you know the in-betweeners

471
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,380
and that.

472
00:22:56,380 --> 00:23:00,080
The in-betweeners is that the is that what we just saw?

473
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:04,720
Yeah yeah I think so I hadn't seen anything like that that world that you asked about

474
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:11,680
that that place I don't know I don't I don't know I guess that's where they came from but

475
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:17,620
like we saw them when we were going across back across to leave Grover's Gorge across

476
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:23,180
I mean those things were there and they they came from the church they were alive though

477
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:28,020
but like that's I think that's where he was stacking the you said you saw the bodies right

478
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:33,140
I think that's where I just saw those bodies I saw the bodies with the blood moat and the

479
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:38,500
train over the blood tracks and on why does this guy have so many bodies I think it's

480
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:45,300
because they're appearing in Godels Gorge and so he was using them to fill up the moat

481
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:50,540
Jesus get it together see can I back up real fast you said that Fred got Sandro on his

482
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:58,620
side wasn't Sandro a turtle yeah but you know God did he communicate with the turtle yeah

483
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:03,340
was it with the turtle or the thing inside the turtle I mean it was the thing inside

484
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:07,960
the turtle is the thing that's inside Greg so what did Sandra think about that I'm just

485
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:14,220
trying to lighten the mood Sandra was a prisoner I think where was that thing before it was

486
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:24,040
in Sandro Frank put it in Sandro or like maybe the mayor before Sandro I mean obviously there's

487
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:29,180
something to do with the mayor right like who was the mayor before Sandro it's in your

488
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:36,700
notes you're the only one who saw his grave oh I fell on top of his grave that's right

489
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:42,520
I think you mentioned something he had a name it's so much has happened since then he's

490
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:51,400
buried behind a fox's house Greg did I make Fox up no that's the name that I think Fred

491
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:56,520
like made him have after he changed him well it was behind his house but it doesn't matter

492
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:09,880
I wonder if hmm I wish you wouldn't have let your brother go Wow me too but also like I had

493
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:21,200
to why did you have to he's my brother like not not anymore really yeah I know I get it

494
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:28,120
I get it what if we got the mayor to go into like a little worm or something now he's like

495
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:34,440
out there right we gotta find him before we can do anything if we paint a hole on the side of the

496
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:40,000
wall like Wile E. Coyote and he just smacks his fucking dome against it don't do you think he's

497
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,040
drawn to the holes or is he making them I think he's thinking he's making them but you know I

498
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:50,600
don't spitball it here I mean it's yeah I mean do you have a better solution than a giant hole

499
00:25:51,240 --> 00:26:04,640
because I'd like to hear it everybody roll alertness at a negative 20 fail you're caught

500
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:12,000
up in this conversation pass fail but even while caught up in this conversation Julius you notice

501
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:21,520
that daddy is collecting the broken drone screen like monitor out of the trash that Cal kicked it

502
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:30,800
into and putting it back into his bowling bag hey daddy I'm sorry I don't daddy recoils when you

503

504
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:43,960

505
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:53,520
doing to you I don't want I don't want to be a part of any more okay you don't have to be throws

506
00:26:53,520 --> 00:27:01,360
the memory stick and leave your broken drone here his eyes get really big and he takes off running

507
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:17,920
after him boys dexterity Cal fails you want on a 45 Beck fails 97 on a 50 I got a 19 on a 70 I got

508
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:27,880
a 30 on this guy can't do that dextrous probably like a 40 Julius why does he get away as everyone

509
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:34,240
falls behind the two of you are sprinting off taking around corners and running around the

510
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:40,000
streets of downtown you've left Cal Colorado and Beck Wilder in the dust it takes a while but as

511
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:47,160
soon as Julius starts to feel you know that heat you get from running as soon as he starts to feel

512
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:54,280
that he just it's like his body almost goes limp and he just kind of loses balance and falls to

513
00:27:54,280 --> 00:28:00,040
the ground don't worry Cal Julius is after him he's got those thighs he's gonna catch him no

514
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:05,360
problem I probably will but let's let's swing around in the Mercedes and and cut him off we

515
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:12,000
gotta go all the way back to your place for it what we came here in the van whatever get the

516
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:30,040
fucking car from quite a distance you just hear do this guys I I can't do it you're like you're

517
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:37,760
looking back you're looking back at where he came from but then the the can van pulls up right next

518
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:43,920
to you Julius kind of like crawls over to it and like I help you in kind of just yeah throws

519
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:48,200
himself into the back way to go dude you're totally noodled what's going on does anyone have

520
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:55,520
navigation Julius tries to point where he went but it's just kind of his arm kind of hops 10% I'll

521
00:28:55,520 --> 00:29:07,160
give Stevie a 30 if somebody wants to roll for them that's a critical failure in 88 you're going

522
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:15,240
right for the hole they spot a little bit of drone down the distance and they plug in his home

523
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:23,080
address on their phone and Cal slaps it out the window oh and as it we don't need that newfangled

524
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:31,160
technology to catch a creep and you both see it as it lands just lands on one corner and you see

525
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:38,080
it just kind of like pops in the screen shatters off of the side of it and it just falls into a

526
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:45,760
few different pieces as the canned van continues to drive and Stevie's like what do I we're off the

527
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:54,680
grid now Stevie everybody throw your phones out the window do we have to Julius does not throw

528
00:29:55,520 --> 00:30:01,960
cows cows like driving like a madman he's not really it's not really paying attention to those

529
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:12,040
demands okay but doesn't back I want you to find anything in this man made after I don't know 1996

530
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:21,840
okay get it at the fuck out of here Julius quickly thinks about what Yuri was born and then

531
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:33,720
yeah dude okay no problem and he throws one mic cable out the window Oh Stevie all right

532
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:40,880

533
00:30:40,880 --> 00:31:01,320
it'll do where were we not we rent we are going the wrong way we got in the van to try to chase

534
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:08,480
down daddy daddy daddy are we just kind of aimlessly driving at this point or where are we

535
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:14,560
going haven't we met him at his house as Cal dry do that once am I going fucking insane here

536
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:19,920
I think maybe a little bit you did just attack him out of nowhere seemingly that was wild do

537
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:29,160
you want to speak on that drone brought the thing to us um you know is it so is it so crazy to be

538
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:36,120
afraid of that fucking thing Cali John was it the drone was in that play that that that thing the

539
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:39,680
drone was gonna lead that thing right to us it went through the hole that thing could come through

540
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:47,040
the hole to Cal I never realized that you like had to get rid of an accent to be on TV it was

541
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:57,520
really coming out there I don't know what you're talking about good with me where is it Julie is

542
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:05,480
Cal driving yeah yeah in the rearview mirror yeah it's a POV shot from Julius's perspective and he's

543
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:13,560
like huh so what are we doing what's well you know I was thinking like every time we sniff the bag

544
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:20,240
we're seeing the bodies we're seeing the church and then we flew the drone down into a hole and

545
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:27,400
we saw the animal with the last time we saw the animal guys was by the church going with this

546
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:33,520
Julius I'm thinking maybe we got to get back to the gorge and back to that church and maybe I saw

547
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:39,880
some tracks maybe take that train Julius we we can't do shit there he saw we need to come back

548
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:45,400
with the fucking Air Force what does X say about all this I mean that's we need to fucking new

549
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:52,680
Godel's Gorge okay if Godel's Gorge is out for now I guess the only other person who's experienced

550
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:59,160
that I mean we could go talk to Kaylee silver the doctor was talking about climbing into stomachs

551
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:04,240
that seems I mean if it's not related that would be weird we were definitely gonna do that was that

552
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,440
supposed to be today or well there was also tentatively a meeting with Brock Hargrave but

553
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:13,080
we all kind of came to the conclusion that he's probably not with us anymore yes we need to try

554
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:17,000
to make it though just in case I mean should we should we just maybe just be there just in case

555
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,520
maybe if somebody's monitoring his communications we could get the drop on them I mean we could go

556
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:26,600
and wait for like 15 minutes and then scope it out then go talk to Kaylee go talk to Kaylee after

557
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:34,000
that yeah yeah I mean I think we could all use a drink it is it is I'm gonna say we were supposed

558
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:40,240
to meet him at noon though right yes it's 11 a.m. on Thursday July 7th we can just scope it out

559
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:47,200
until like 1215 and then if he's not there then yeah that's let's do that and on the way when we

560
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:54,720
get there and we're parked I gotta I gotta show you guys something why did it sound like like

561

00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:12,000
outside having a drink together and as you guys walk in the sun coming in through the windows

610
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:18,960
feels almost out of place here at the foundry you're used to this being an after work sort of

611
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:26,800
location but there's some regulars sitting around the bar and maggie is bartending as always

612
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:34,320
you see the televisions are on various news media outlets and julius checks to make sure at least

613
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:40,960
a couple of them are can oh yeah at least a couple are for sure any news about julius's uncle no

614
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:49,360
strangely no coverage of the death of ty frayland and no coverage of the death of some city

615
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:56,400
pd and no deaths are being reported on taking place at the zeitgeist only two nights ago

616
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:02,560
hey maggie have you been watching the news yeah are they talking about anything other than the

617
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:08,800
hole no mostly just whole talk no like so smooth they just keep trying to get those cameras on the

618
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:14,320
smooth edge it's wild but you never see anything like it cal kind of turns back to you guys and

619
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:21,520
like grins and he's like we're gonna have an exclusive voice yeah the thing is though like

620
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:29,600
you know the x files isn't super into like airing out their dirty laundry so i don't know if uh

621
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:36,560
that's such a good idea whoa whoa julius my dude but no we're not talking about your uncle

622
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:41,040
they just aren't talking about any of the things we're going through which is what we're reporting

623
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:45,680
on julius is saying that he doesn't want to put the footage out of the cut in half bodies

624
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:52,400

625
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:57,360
we know the news it doesn't have to have a video anyway that it doesn't matter we're not going to

628
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:17,120
end of the day that's just a murder the stuff that we've got going is yeah a lot bigger and like

629
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:22,320
pretty sure it's cool if we like put it out there did you think we were going to no you know what i

630
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:29,280

633
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:53,600
here in the foundry julius shushes her jokingly like like oh it's like a funny joke julius sure

634
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:58,960
thinks it is cow's jaws like dropped and he legitimately doesn't know it's like the fucking

635
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:05,360
bad and the ugly even the dust has stopped moving in the sun rays that are floating in

636
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:10,560
and then julie maggie starts laughing

637
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:22,240
okay run it or start good good one julius i think well uh maybe just run it we're we're waiting for

638
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:27,760
proc or grief you haven't seen a dude in here who looks like an archaeologist he's all dirty all

639
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:34,320
the time no and has a shovel i've not seen a dirty man with a shovel in the foundry today now

640
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:40,240
well what about a clean man with a shovel no and any number of legs uh what doesn't matter it's

641
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:46,720
for the news this world's getting stranger and stranger as she goes to clean a pint glass you

642
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:51,280
should give him a call am i imagining that when you first contacted him did you say something like

643
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:56,160
our usual booth or something like that or did that not happen no but i mean of course there's

644
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:00,720
our can booth that we sit in with all our pictures above let's go sit over there i mean i'm sure that

645
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:06,880

646
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:14,480
and once again the can crew goes the can booth where the picture of a much younger cow colorado

647
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:24,960
is on the wall right behind the now shaken downtrodden sad cows like actively shaking

648
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:32,640
his voice against the like shaking his head at the voice in his head it's like one of those

649
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:38,160
things max i'm i'm not sad i'm not downtrodden i'm angry as hell and i'm gonna get to the bottom

650
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:44,640
of this shit and he like screams that in the bar julius kind of looks like what the fuck and he's

651
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:50,400
like yeah man yeah uh does anybody have a sharpie i want to sign this and it's a picture of julius

652
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:57,920
doing the printing press like on at the booth cow yeah cow like absentmindedly pulls one out

653
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:02,160
of his pocket and like scribbles big all across the cow colorado

654
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,640
i mean that's it's probably worth more now

655
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:20,160
are we all gonna sign it cool julius signs it like right above his own head an ambling over

656
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:29,360
to the table as you're all going through and citing these framed pictures an emaciated woman

657
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:37,920
in a tank top and loose shorts so loose that i could probably fit one of my thighs through

658
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:45,760
the entire waist maybe maybe be tight but these tiny shorts are loose did that make any sense

659
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:48,960
yeah cal's staring he's like dr bar carver

660

at the exact same time right it's one of the chameleon hybrids and she's sort of sort of

662
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:12,560
shaking kind of herky-jerky and kind of grits her mouth

753
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:22,320
what's what 25 or six to four it's chicago song you brought that up because just today at work

754
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:27,440
my boss was saying that the best uh live show he's ever saw was chicago okay the reason i listened

755
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:34,240
to it is because i hung out with ian this weekend and we were watching just like live music videos

756
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:41,280
of old rock bands and one of them we watched was that song and they speed it up live and it's even

757
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:50,640
better than the way i'm super dangerous i saw chicago recently good with me it's one that

758
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:57,040
didn't make it into the show i played 25 or six to four in my middle school band what what

759
00:57:57,040 --> 00:58:02,960
instrument did you play trombone so i got to do wow that's awesome is that why you played

760
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:04,240
trombone did you get to do some

761
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:25,200
did you still have your trombone uh i might have an old one i sold a really nice one

762
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:28,960
for a lot of money when i was in middle school it was like as i got out of middle school said

763
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:33,440
i'm not playing this shit no more and i sold it on ebay and it was like they're expensive as hell

764
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:36,880
i mean i think it was like maybe five hundred dollars but that was five hundred dollars to

765
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:42,880
middle school yeah wait why did you get the money this is so confusing uh because it was i stole it

766
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:47,440
i stole it from the kid in the first place so like i beat up a i beat up a sixth grader and

767
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:54,160
took his trombone it was uh it was gifted to me it wasn't nobody had paid for it oh love that i

768
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:59,120
feel a little bad that i've sold a gifted thing but i played it for three years and decided it

769
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:04,160
wasn't once it's gifted what'd you buy with the money i don't remember yeah cocaine a shittier

770
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:11,280
trombone um when when ian and i were watching that video though we were both you know had smoked

771
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:17,680
weed and just like halfway through halfway through ian just looked at me and goes what do you think

772
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:25,280
it means so we looked it up and it was talking about his favorite time to write songs was between

773
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:32,480
30 and 25 minutes to four o'clock in the morning and the thing it's either 25 minutes or six to

774
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:38,800
four oh wow okay yeah so there you go it's about writing music late at night or early in the

775
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:43,040
morning but for him probably late at night you just imagine him at a fucking 345 going like

776
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:49,520
this is awesome all of his neighbors it makes all the all the lyrics make more sense the first

777
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:57,520
thing waiting for the break of day i just assumed his neighbors would come in and kill him and then

778
00:59:57,520 --> 01:00:04,720
be like he had it coming he had it coming oh we have um we have good reason to believe that

779
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:09,920
zach might try to the menu us tonight so this might be the last episode of the podcast

780
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:15,200
