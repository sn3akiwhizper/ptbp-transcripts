{"text": " Introductions are bound to confound. Using wet sounds to turn frowns upside down. It is me, Wolf the Dog, DJ Extraordinaire. Hoppin' on the sound waves, leavin' my soul exposed bare. Radio show is 694.2 PTBP. And now, excuse me for I have to go pee-pee. The- the- the end. I hope y'all enjoyed that poem that I composed. I spent almost as much time as I do on the show notes with that one. And speaking of show notes, someone done went and sent a note to the show. This Howlin' with Wolf is from Zach from the show that comes on after this. He sent in this message and said it's some sort of contest drawing announcement of winners. I guess he finally got around to tagging at Pretending Pod on his personal Instagram story. Wow, get a load of this fuckin' guy, huh? Alright, here he is, I- I guess. What's up, I'm Zach. Thanks for that incredible introduction, Mr. Wolf the Dog. And right you are, I'm here to announce the winners of the drawing slash contest. And, first off... Mwahahahahaha! The season's fan art contest slash drawing had some buckwild entries in all sorts of different mediums. We were- we were all completely blown away by all of your creativity and your talent. So, each and every one of you, thank you so much for entering. This is so incredible. Now, let's get to the winners of merch stuff. We're gonna start with the drawing, which is random. So, I'm pulling these names out of a digital hat, and the first winner is... Storm Clouds. Storm Clouds, you are the first winner. And the second winner is... GrimlinDude420. So, big ol' congrats to Storm Clouds and GrimlinDude420 for your luck and your sweet, sweet victory. You each get one merch thing. And now, for the contest portion of the drawing slash contest. We've got a little surprise for ya. There were just too many- there were too many jaw-dropping entries this time. Like, a bunch of wildly weird and cool shit. So, we're gonna name a couple runners-up. And you'll both also get one merch thing. So, in no particular order, the runners-up are... Antique__Resident__124 for a piece of physical art titled Play Ball, which they made out of clay. It's like a hand that reaches out for a ball that's in a squeamish situation, and it is fantastic. Go check it out if you haven't seen it yet. And the other runner-up is... Oxum__Live for a cross-stitch that we actually requested in episode 49 at 17 minutes and 50 seconds in or so. I don't- didn't remember it, went back and listened to it. The Pettymore family cross-stitch portrays Jeremy Pettymore on a riding lawnmower and a drunk Don D. Pettymore tied to a tree. And it says, mow the lawn and tie up Don. Fucking aces and really well done both of you. Thank you so much for entering. You each get one thing. And now... Is that good? That drum roll on the mic?

I'm sure it's important. Are you caught up to this episode, but you're not yet getting that sweet exclusive, Sklussy for short, b-b-b-b-b-b-bonus content to satiate your earhole needs in between fresh episode drops? Before you respond, keep in mind that I can see the numbers, and the numbers just keep going up. We recently dropped the two-part finale of the seven-part campaign that Thomas wrote, ran, and entitled The Lost Treasure of John Lee Pettymore, and then their Patreon numbers shot up with folks aching to listen to this wild continuation of the story of contention after the events of season one. Now, you probably already know it's only five bucks to gain clearance to the RSS feed we call Contention Confidential, where you can listen to that Oops All Pettymore's campaign, along with grease loads more bonus episodes for your cochlear pleasures. That's at patreon.com slash pretending pod. And if you'd rather just click something, that link in the other links are in the show notes. Now, how about some more boring facts and figures? It's the news. Last time, waffles were had at the home of Cal Colorado before the canned crew made their way downtown to the hole in the bridge that crosses the city river. In a nearby alley, they met Kurt, aka Daddy, who busted out one of those fancy new air-to-underwater drones and flew that sucker right on through the unguarded, unnaturally smooth hole. And then he plunged it into the city river below. The aquatic drone dove down into and through a tugboat, which was, and also still is, partially stuck in an enormous cartoon hole in the riverbed. And when the drone went through the tugboat and came out the other side, it flew into an old-timey school gymnasium with a bloody throne under one of the basketball hoops and a small humanoid creature with round ears atop its head, wearing a blood-soaked school uniform. And that thing skittered on all fours towards the drone camera, which nimbly dodged the grab. But then Cal knocked the shit out of Kurt, kicked in the screen on the drone remote, and punted it to the metaphorical and very real curb, taking us now to whatever's next. It's Alter Girl with My Life is Great and It's All My Fault. Cause my life is great and it's all my fault. I'll let you braid their hair if that's what you're into. I am gonna think probably of the three movies, it's gonna be maybe the best one. The best one. For sure the best one. The three movies, you mean Oppenheimer, Barbie, and Wonka? Yeah. The trilogy. Reserved my seats for Barbie today. Wonka and barber. Wow, they really got you, huh? I'm gonna wait until it's not the night it comes out and then go see it at the IMAX. Oh nice. Oh wait, are we recording? Sure. Beep. Are we? Yeah. Action. Do it though. I am. The light didn't come on, you didn't go like click. We should get it on air. We need it on air. We should get it on air. Why not? Cause we're not on air. We're on tape baby and it's not even that anymore. Direct to digital. That just doesn't have it. Ron Zach's laptop. Direct to digital is even worse in some circles. Are we recording? Yeah. Luke, how was Taylor Swift? Yeah. It was so fucking good dude. Tell us about your era's experience. Well, I went and- So far so good. Got there. Whoa. And I sat down and then Muna played and they were pretty good. Gracie Abrams played and I had never heard her music but she's pretty good. And then the real show started. And it went on for three hours and 50 minutes. Jesus Christ. Three hours and 50 minutes? Just shy of four hours long. Oh my god. With two openers. Oh my god. No, just Taylor's set was- Right. When did it start? The openers played maybe 20 minutes at eight o'clock and was done by basically midnight. Wow. It was fucking amazing dude. So the day that I went was the day she released her Speak Now re-release. Don't speak. She like played- I know just what you're thinking. That's my favorite one. Played extra songs from that. I don't know. Because on her re-release record she does like from the vault song. So basically B-sides that didn't make it on the record. So she premiered a music video for one of those songs that hadn't been shown before. That had Taylor Lautner and Chloe King I think is her name. An actress in it. And then she showed it and she's like, what'd you guys think? And everybody screams. And she's like, well in a normal film premiere they have the actors there. And then brought out everybody in it. And then Taylor Lautner comes out and does like a backflip on the stage and shit. Attaboy. And they like talk for a little bit. And dude all the fucking music was so good dude. It was- Hell yeah. At like two hours in I was like, damn my feet hurt. And as I watch her like fucking dancing around on stage. For the Nth night in a row. Do you know if she's doing four hours a night every night? I think ours was slightly longer by maybe 10 or 15 minutes. Wow. That's still a wildly long set. That's crazy. Yeah dude it's nuts. I mean cause it's like songs from every single album that she has. Would you say like every era? Every era dude. But the last tour she did was four albums ago. Oh wow. Oh I don't think I realized that. Yeah COVID happened. She released two albums like in the height of COVID. One right before that she didn't get to tour on. And then one just recently. This is her first tour since COVID? Yeah. Wow. Shit okay. So usually the times I've seen her in the past it's like here's the album that I just came out with. We'll play all the songs on it. And then you know a few of the hits. So this time it was like the hits from every single album. And then most of the songs on the new album. It was fucking nuts. So a good $200,000 well spent? Yeah. No I at work I sat at work on Ticketmaster for about six hours. Do you want to include that in the pod for? I was doing it right next to my boss who was also on Ticketmaster for about six hours trying to get tickets. So we got them day of so I paid I mean they were like 300 something dollars but I didn't pay. I mean people were paying like thousands for it. That sounds reasonable. For what it was yeah. For about a hundred less than a hundred bucks an hour. For a four hour stadium show. Wow. Exactly. That's not that at all. And my seats were fucking good and dude it was just nuts. Like I'll show you guys like some videos I took later but like. He's talking to you audience. Yeah I'll share them on in the discord. But dude the whole setup like the stage and everything was just nuts. Like the whole stage was also video. Oh come on. Yeah and so dude at one point like the stage turns into water and she like finishes a song and just you can't even like see it but the stage like barely opens up and she just dives into the stage and then like it's a like a video of her like swimming under the stage all the way. And then like she pops up and like plays another song. It was. Do you think she runs or is she jumping down to a little area where there's like a little go kart that takes her to the next spot? No dude. She hits the segue. It's like assistance next to her with like little fans and some bottled water. Dude the choreography of all of it though to like hit all of that like exactly when they need to and like running from I mean the stage was as basically as long as Arrowheads Field is like. Like as big as this room? Almost. It's huge. But dude it was it was fun as shit and it was great. I had a great time and she sang all the songs that I wanted to hear. Do you feel like she had fun though? I looked it up and she is taking like this is not what each show makes but what she's taking home from each show is around four to five million dollars. So it doesn't matter if she's having fun. I would assume probably a little bit but you know even if it's work it's a pretty good job. Yeah last thing that was cool she had a guitar on her original Speak. What? She had a guitar on her Speak Now tour that's been in like the Music Hall of Fame. I read about this. And they like took it out and she played it for that show. Somebody say it's like when Captain America goes to get his shield from the museum. My dad today was like do you like Taylor Swift? I was like yeah I'm not like a huge fan or anything but I like some of her songs. He's like I think I do too. Like I just all of a sudden been hearing a lot about her like all these videos keep popping up on my like reels. And he like then he got into some pretty like weird drama about her. Like reels drama? Yeah. I'm imagining your dad commenting like not that good. I saw a tweet today it was like something like that and then somebody just said dinosaur junior better. It was like man she wrote this song about a breakup like 15 years ago and she was she really blamed the woman. I wonder if when she re-releases it she might write it to be like a little chiller. And then the very next video is like then I watched a video where these guys laughed about the women's soccer team playing the men's soccer team and like pointed to why that's like why they make less money and stuff. Do you think that was like a right wing thing? I was like yeah dad it was. And it was like I'll send it to you so you can see it was literally fucking The Daily Wire. Yeah. And I was like yeah you got sent right into the algorithm. Straight into it. Straight there. Just back out. Maybe stop watching all these little reels. They do have the targeting down pretty well. Not that your dad is like that but he is in the demographic for. Oh yeah. Easily flipped. Light and old. Not easily but just the kind that watches maybe all day so you could eventually weasel your way in there. I've heard that it's all old people do now. My mom's watching reels. My dad's watching reels. Reels is specifically Facebook is that right? Yeah. Instagram. Meta properties. Gotcha gotcha. Which I just joined the third wing of. That sounds like some Hitler shit. I didn't say I just joined the third Reich of Meta. It sounds like you joined Meta's like Zucker Youth. It's Threads. It basically is. Oh the third one. That's what you meant. Okay. Yeah. I mean like there's three of them. Luke works in marketing so I thought he joined some Meta like secret society. No. There's Facebook, Instagram and now there's Threads. Professional organization. So I joined the third one. I joined the third wing of Meta. You know? If it's between Musk and Zuck I'll kill myself. Yeah. Exactly. People are like rooting for Zuck because Musk has been so annoying but they forget how Zuck got where he is. They didn't personally destabilize with democracy but like deliberately stood by while it happened because it made him a lot of money. He smiled weird too. Like globally. On that note dude I'm stoked to see DJT back up on stage debating. You know? Oh man I. You been watching the reels? When you said on that note I was like nice Luke's gonna turn us into playing the game. That's the game. I just looked at my notes to get ready and didn't even really catch what you said. On that note. Where we at? We're beating Kurt up. We all lost our goddamn minds. Yeah. Cal kicked Kurt's ass. And his drone controller. And broke his drone and threw some money at him for that. And then if he stuck around for the post credit scene the very last thing that happened is Cal sniffed the bag with the goo. Do we need to leave? The wax. And he screams I'm gonna smell god goddamnit. Don't sniff his ear wax finger. That grosses me out. His eyes went together. He's coming. Oh a Kimbo. Yeah Cal really wants to do anything he has to to induce the sight of god from this. Man. I don't know what does Cal do to induce the sight of god? It's a big world. What are you gonna do? Yeah I don't know I think he rubs his face in it real hard and he's just got this gross black smudge on his nose. Julius is like seeing it happen and like nudging. Dude. Dude. Cal what are you doing? I don't fucking know and he throws the bag on the ground and he just kind of storms off. Are you alright? Are you feeling anything? He's walking away. He took like a massive dose dude. Oh shit. Stevie reaches down and looks at the bag and they're like. I think he like got some of it like on him maybe we should be careful with this I don't know. He stopped working like maybe it's been out in the air too long. Sniff it. They hold it up to their nose and look at you kind of. Is this going to be the first time that all three of us have to leave the room so you can talk to yourself? Okay Stevie. Here's what happens. No this actually has already happened. Stevie you remember while they're holding the bag up to their nose that you've seen this before and they do kind of the same thing where their eyes go blank for just like a quarter of a second and then. Yeah. Yeah. No. What did you see? It still works. And they. You saw how the steel works? Start shuddering. Slowly. Stevie you've got to talk to us maybe that will help. Just tell us like. Free associate right now. Just tell us all the things that came to mind. I saw Fred. I saw Fred. I saw Fred stacking bodies. Just stacking bodies one after another and they weren't real. They weren't real. They weren't real. They weren't real. They weren't human. They weren't. I wasn't real. I wasn't real. Stevie. Stevie. Kyle's come back and he's like put a hand on their shoulder and he's trying to calm them down. Stevie just. I told you that he's not a good guy. I told you. Okay. Okay. They are like sweating. Like you can see just like sweat just like pouring down their face and it's it's coming down past their hair in front of their face and they use their hair to kind of wipe away some of the tears and the sweat. Beck whips out a bandana. He's always got one. Hands it to them. Thanks Beck. Thanks. Hey Stevie. You like grew up around those animal human hybrid things like did you recognize where that drone was? Oh those are new man. Those are fucking new and those are from after we locked down. Okay. He got Sandro on his side I guess he figured out how to change something he learned how to do. Yeah Fred. He learned how to do something with Sandro and he I mean he taught me a little bit right. The thing that I showed you and they kind of pull like a flask almost out of their pocket kind of flash it at you and put it back in their pocket and you saw earlier when they were spilling blood outside of the Mercedes. That's what they were using just spilled the blood around. He taught me a little bit of how to manipulate people and the world but he must have figured out something even bigger because I mean that something happened and I mean Godels Gorge like it like changed it like there's something there was a shimmer about it and that's when people started showing up and animals of all sorts and the you know the in-betweeners and that. The in-betweeners is that the is that what we just saw? Yeah yeah I think so I hadn't seen anything like that that world that you asked about that that place I don't know I don't I don't know I guess that's where they came from but like we saw them when we were going across back across to leave Grover's Gorge across I mean those things were there and they they came from the church they were alive though but like that's I think that's where he was stacking the you said you saw the bodies right I think that's where I just saw those bodies I saw the bodies with the blood moat and the train over the blood tracks and on why does this guy have so many bodies I think it's because they're appearing in Godels Gorge and so he was using them to fill up the moat Jesus get it together see can I back up real fast you said that Fred got Sandro on his side wasn't Sandro a turtle yeah but you know God did he communicate with the turtle yeah was it with the turtle or the thing inside the turtle I mean it was the thing inside the turtle is the thing that's inside Greg so what did Sandra think about that I'm just trying to lighten the mood Sandra was a prisoner I think where was that thing before it was in Sandro Frank put it in Sandro or like maybe the mayor before Sandro I mean obviously there's something to do with the mayor right like who was the mayor before Sandro it's in your notes you're the only one who saw his grave oh I fell on top of his grave that's right I think you mentioned something he had a name it's so much has happened since then he's buried behind a fox's house Greg did I make Fox up no that's the name that I think Fred like made him have after he changed him well it was behind his house but it doesn't matter I wonder if hmm I wish you wouldn't have let your brother go Wow me too but also like I had to why did you have to he's my brother like not not anymore really yeah I know I get it I get it what if we got the mayor to go into like a little worm or something now he's like out there right we gotta find him before we can do anything if we paint a hole on the side of the wall like Wile E. Coyote and he just smacks his fucking dome against it don't do you think he's drawn to the holes or is he making them I think he's thinking he's making them but you know I don't spitball it here I mean it's yeah I mean do you have a better solution than a giant hole because I'd like to hear it everybody roll alertness at a negative 20 fail you're caught up in this conversation pass fail but even while caught up in this conversation Julius you notice that daddy is collecting the broken drone screen like monitor out of the trash that Cal kicked it into and putting it back into his bowling bag hey daddy I'm sorry I don't daddy recoils when you call out to him did that thing did that thing not freak you out course it freaked me out made me feel all sorts of bad things did it make you want to punch yourself cuz that's what made me feel like doing to you I don't want I don't want to be a part of any more okay you don't have to be throws the memory stick and leave your broken drone here his eyes get really big and he takes off running after him boys dexterity Cal fails you want on a 45 Beck fails 97 on a 50 I got a 19 on a 70 I got a 30 on this guy can't do that dextrous probably like a 40 Julius why does he get away as everyone falls behind the two of you are sprinting off taking around corners and running around the streets of downtown you've left Cal Colorado and Beck Wilder in the dust it takes a while but as soon as Julius starts to feel you know that heat you get from running as soon as he starts to feel that he just it's like his body almost goes limp and he just kind of loses balance and falls to the ground don't worry Cal Julius is after him he's got those thighs he's gonna catch him no problem I probably will but let's let's swing around in the Mercedes and and cut him off we gotta go all the way back to your place for it what we came here in the van whatever get the fucking car from quite a distance you just hear do this guys I I can't do it you're like you're looking back you're looking back at where he came from but then the the can van pulls up right next to you Julius kind of like crawls over to it and like I help you in kind of just yeah throws himself into the back way to go dude you're totally noodled what's going on does anyone have navigation Julius tries to point where he went but it's just kind of his arm kind of hops 10% I'll give Stevie a 30 if somebody wants to roll for them that's a critical failure in 88 you're going right for the hole they spot a little bit of drone down the distance and they plug in his home address on their phone and Cal slaps it out the window oh and as it we don't need that newfangled technology to catch a creep and you both see it as it lands just lands on one corner and you see it just kind of like pops in the screen shatters off of the side of it and it just falls into a few different pieces as the canned van continues to drive and Stevie's like what do I we're off the grid now Stevie everybody throw your phones out the window do we have to Julius does not throw cows cows like driving like a madman he's not really it's not really paying attention to those demands okay but doesn't back I want you to find anything in this man made after I don't know 1996 okay get it at the fuck out of here Julius quickly thinks about what Yuri was born and then yeah dude okay no problem and he throws one mic cable out the window Oh Stevie all right oh I just I'm gonna miss that mic cable I need to piss okay it'll do where were we not we rent we are going the wrong way we got in the van to try to chase down daddy daddy daddy are we just kind of aimlessly driving at this point or where are we going haven't we met him at his house as Cal dry do that once am I going fucking insane here I think maybe a little bit you did just attack him out of nowhere seemingly that was wild do you want to speak on that drone brought the thing to us um you know is it so is it so crazy to be afraid of that fucking thing Cali John was it the drone was in that play that that that thing the drone was gonna lead that thing right to us it went through the hole that thing could come through the hole to Cal I never realized that you like had to get rid of an accent to be on TV it was really coming out there I don't know what you're talking about good with me where is it Julie is Cal driving yeah yeah in the rearview mirror yeah it's a POV shot from Julius's perspective and he's like huh so what are we doing what's well you know I was thinking like every time we sniff the bag we're seeing the bodies we're seeing the church and then we flew the drone down into a hole and we saw the animal with the last time we saw the animal guys was by the church going with this Julius I'm thinking maybe we got to get back to the gorge and back to that church and maybe I saw some tracks maybe take that train Julius we we can't do shit there he saw we need to come back with the fucking Air Force what does X say about all this I mean that's we need to fucking new Godel's Gorge okay if Godel's Gorge is out for now I guess the only other person who's experienced that I mean we could go talk to Kaylee silver the doctor was talking about climbing into stomachs that seems I mean if it's not related that would be weird we were definitely gonna do that was that supposed to be today or well there was also tentatively a meeting with Brock Hargrave but we all kind of came to the conclusion that he's probably not with us anymore yes we need to try to make it though just in case I mean should we should we just maybe just be there just in case maybe if somebody's monitoring his communications we could get the drop on them I mean we could go and wait for like 15 minutes and then scope it out then go talk to Kaylee go talk to Kaylee after that yeah yeah I mean I think we could all use a drink it is it is I'm gonna say we were supposed to meet him at noon though right yes it's 11 a.m. on Thursday July 7th we can just scope it out until like 1215 and then if he's not there then yeah that's let's do that and on the way when we get there and we're parked I gotta I gotta show you guys something why did it sound like like you're gonna show us your penis oh no that's weird yeah I didn't think that for like everybody's thinking everybody's thinking this why do you guys all want to see it I don't you brought it up no you guys you guys heard it though yeah cuz you said it cuz you wanted to hear it I won't speak in riddles with you Beckett let's uh let's just get to the foundry

where did those holes come from fuck are you saying that we got like drone ourselves down into a hole to get there cows stops the vehicle slams on the brakes and says Julius don't ever say those words around me again we just any of them drone and drone ourselves okay drone ourselves into a hole I guess I'm like we got a swim into that hole that's how my grandma would have done it the smile and the glint in Cal's eye she looks off into the distance which is still just in the back of the can van can you clarify the lockdown thing yeah like kovat no like um when my dad when Fred took over from

yeah yeah i know it's right here and uh yeah i heard everything you said but uh you know everything's off the record here in the foundry julius shushes her jokingly like like oh it's like a funny joke julius sure thinks it is cow's jaws like dropped and he legitimately doesn't know it's like the fucking bad and the ugly even the dust has stopped moving in the sun rays that are floating in and then julie maggie starts laughing okay run it or start good good one julius i think well uh maybe just run it we're we're waiting for proc or grief you haven't seen a dude in here who looks like an archaeologist he's all dirty all the time no and has a shovel i've not seen a dirty man with a shovel in the foundry today now well what about a clean man with a shovel no and any number of legs uh what doesn't matter it's for the news this world's getting stranger and stranger as she goes to clean a pint glass you should give him a call am i imagining that when you first contacted him did you say something like our usual booth or something like that or did that not happen no but i mean of course there's our can booth that we sit in with all our pictures above let's go sit over there i mean i'm sure that he'll he'll head that way julius just make sure to like have a line of sight to the entrance and once again the can crew goes the can booth where the picture of a much younger cow colorado is on the wall right behind the now shaken downtrodden sad cows like actively shaking his voice against the like shaking his head at the voice in his head it's like one of those things max i'm i'm not sad i'm not downtrodden i'm angry as hell and i'm gonna get to the bottom of this shit and he like screams that in the bar julius kind of looks like what the fuck and he's like yeah man yeah uh does anybody have a sharpie i want to sign this and it's a picture of julius doing the printing press like on at the booth cow yeah cow like absentmindedly pulls one out of his pocket and like scribbles big all across the cow colorado i mean that's it's probably worth more now are we all gonna sign it cool julius signs it like right above his own head an ambling over to the table as you're all going through and citing these framed pictures an emaciated woman in a tank top and loose shorts so loose that i could probably fit one of my thighs through the entire waist maybe maybe be tight but these tiny shorts are loose did that make any sense yeah cal's staring he's like dr bar carver she has a broken nose and her two eyes are looking at two of you at the exact same time right it's one of the chameleon hybrids and she's sort of sort of shaking kind of herky-jerky and kind of grits her mouth hey can we help you yeah maybe yeah um well it depends what brings you what brings you in

bark hargrave right to her face she might have she could have extrapolated from that yeah i mean let's just go with it and i mean worst case we leave do we play ignorant or do we tell her that we were here beating him okay she said eight three six she starts ambling back to the table slowly wait she stops in their tracks eyes akimbo uh beck i think you take the lead on this one fuck you're showing a lot of like leadership very appointed a lot of gumption okay give me a sec and he pulls out the camera and just sits it on the table and tries to be inconspicuous by leaning on it all right come on

reaches across the table does she stop me at the very last second she slaps your hand how do we know that's his phone well do you want to call it do we have to bring smartphones into this he passes he

i did okay okay okay where it uh his dead body which was in the bottom of a dirt pit was there this whole dirt pit was it his whole body it was at the zeitgeist um there was a hole and his body was in there he stabbed open his entrails were spilling out stomach just you're the one who saw the crawling in the crawling trying to get into somebody's stomach no wait hold on sorry talk about that that's nothing when were you at the zeitgeist two nights ago when were we at the zeitgeist last night too late the doctor said something about entrails and crawling in she she didn't seem to know about it she wanted to plug us for information on that i think we don't know nothing about that what brought you to the zeitgeist i was checking in on dr hargrave how did you know dr hargrave i worked um on similar sorts of projects like digging when necessary yeah yeah um digging for sure but um what exactly is it you do she kind of smiles and uh like way too many of her teeth show because it's just like skin stretched across a skeleton's face what's that a skull a skeleton's face what's that called you know like a halloween man you joe's wearing a skully's shirt that's why you're thinking of it you're telling me that there's bone men inside of me how many so like what is it that you do i i'm curious why are you reaching out to dr hargrave now this time he wasn't he weren't doing anything so much in the in the public eye as much you wouldn't want him for an interview i don't think so why did you why did you reach why did you reach well you thought wrong we're actually quite interested in exactly what he was doing out there and it sounds like you might know could you set some light on it we found a shovel on that and we figured we'd uh try to get it back to him maybe who killed him i don't know there was a half a body and a pair of legs of pretty sure a man that i know and then his body as well and so i and there's who's the other man you knew out cold unconscious fainted still alive but rock was whole who was still alive some lady was still some girl still alive out there but then i saw you know there's a an old friend dr murray showed up so i had to get the fuck out of there you know dr murray you know dr murray that's what i was just about to say we should do you know x i don't know anyone called x how do you know dr murray oh well dr murray dr murray used to be a good cowboy you know she's being burned from the seventh so there's no no cowboy no more you're uh you're and her lack of discretion and her lack of loyalty led to her being banned and therefore scorned and therefore burned sorry oh my god oh my god beck this is what i was talking about julius are you with the you're with the rogue group you're working with dr murray wait first you're working with who i'm working for me and god what are you working for city action news i'm i'm beck we're the cowboys or americans are you the rogue ones ain't been rogue since 92 julius kind of is doing like a cut it out motion to the cow she's looking she's looking at julius with both eyes and one of them's just kind of going up and down your body while the other one stares you in the eye looking at them thighs uh julius kind of like goes to show off his thighs but like lifts his shirt up a little bit to like show that he has his gun on i just think i can smoke in here yeah for a little while you can smoke at least she she pulls a glass pipe out and puts it on the table what the fuck oh like that oh yeah i don't know about that kind of smoking she grabs it and stands up and walks away i'll be right back stevie you're gen c right just give her an adderall oh yeah do you just want how fast will it work i mean it's like instant release so quick yeah okay did you know brock because like she puts the pipe back in her pocket well if he like points at where the pipe was like because of like rocks so i listened to 25 or six to four this morning and it has been sucking my head all day what's that what's what 25 or six to four it's chicago song you brought that up because just today at work my boss was saying that the best uh live show he's ever saw was chicago okay the reason i listened to it is because i hung out with ian this weekend and we were watching just like live music videos of old rock bands and one of them we watched was that song and they speed it up live and it's even better than the way i'm super dangerous i saw chicago recently good with me it's one that didn't make it into the show i played 25 or six to four in my middle school band what what instrument did you play trombone so i got to do wow that's awesome is that why you played trombone did you get to do some did you still have your trombone uh i might have an old one i sold a really nice one for a lot of money when i was in middle school it was like as i got out of middle school said i'm not playing this shit no more and i sold it on ebay and it was like they're expensive as hell i mean i think it was like maybe five hundred dollars but that was five hundred dollars to middle school yeah wait why did you get the money this is so confusing uh because it was i stole it i stole it from the kid in the first place so like i beat up a i beat up a sixth grader and took his trombone it was uh it was gifted to me it wasn't nobody had paid for it oh love that i feel a little bad that i've sold a gifted thing but i played it for three years and decided it wasn't once it's gifted what'd you buy with the money i don't remember yeah cocaine a shittier trombone um when when ian and i were watching that video though we were both you know had smoked weed and just like halfway through halfway through ian just looked at me and goes what do you think it means so we looked it up and it was talking about his favorite time to write songs was between 30 and 25 minutes to four o'clock in the morning and the thing it's either 25 minutes or six to four oh wow okay yeah so there you go it's about writing music late at night or early in the morning but for him probably late at night you just imagine him at a fucking 345 going like this is awesome all of his neighbors it makes all the all the lyrics make more sense the first thing waiting for the break of day i just assumed his neighbors would come in and kill him and then be like he had it coming he had it coming oh we have um we have good reason to believe that zach might try to the menu us tonight so this might be the last episode of the podcast he and taylor will be like being real cagey about whether or not they were going to the menu us which character do you want to be uh when it gets away yeah hey zach no spoilers serve me a simple role-playing podcast i actually am very fascinated by the techniques that he uses uh while we role play right luke that was you're going to be the gm for the rest of the um i guess uh role um do you have any character sheets i could use i love skins me too i haven't i've watched it all the way through once and i don't want to go back and watch it because there's no way it's as good never never never yeah i watched it when i was like i was in like eighth grade probably oh i was gonna say like 19 we probably watched it the same year probably yeah oh wait yeah that does kind of add up shit well here it hit netflix you're not even 30 yet literally as soon as it came on netflix oh my god me too it's interesting that you watched it right before you went into high school i watched it coming right out of high school and i was like was i supposed to be trying to do this in high school i was like is this what this was supposed to be about i think now that i think about it i was watching it at my friend josh's house and i knew him in high school so i was probably a sophomore in high school and then did you do a lot more drugs and no we were all straight edge and we were like this is wild dude and then there's a these kids are idiots there is a scene where there's like a biker gang and they're all straight edge and we're like yeah the heroes are finally here oh my god we were like dude they made them assholes and looking back on it it's like well it's much fun i forgot i haven't told him happy birthday yet it's today it's today it is calling yeah let's go on should we call him yeah speaker phone speaker there's a speaker speaking really this call is being recorded zoom joke i don't think he's gonna answer it's i don't think he's gonna answer should we leave a voicemail for him oh yeah if we just talk into the mic and then he won't hear it puts it we talk and you say what we say headphones leave it a message and i'll get back to you love it please record your message when you finished recording you may hang up or press one for more options hey justin hey
