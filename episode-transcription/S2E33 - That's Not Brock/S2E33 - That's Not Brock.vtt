00:00.000 --> 00:03.800
Introductions are bound to confound.

00:03.800 --> 00:08.700
Using wet sounds to turn frowns upside down.

00:08.700 --> 00:13.060
It is me, Wolf the Dog, DJ Extraordinaire.

00:13.060 --> 00:18.200
Hoppin' on the sound waves, leavin' my soul exposed bare.

00:18.200 --> 00:23.260
Radio show is 694.2 PTBP.

00:23.260 --> 00:27.360
And now, excuse me for I have to go pee-pee.

00:27.360 --> 00:28.860
The- the- the end.

00:28.860 --> 00:33.060
I hope y'all enjoyed that poem that I composed.

00:33.060 --> 00:38.100
I spent almost as much time as I do on the show notes with that one.

00:38.100 --> 00:44.160
And speaking of show notes, someone done went and sent a note to the show.

00:44.160 --> 00:49.460
This Howlin' with Wolf is from Zach from the show that comes on after this.

00:49.460 --> 00:55.700
He sent in this message and said it's some sort of contest drawing announcement of winners.

00:55.700 --> 01:02.800
I guess he finally got around to tagging at Pretending Pod on his personal Instagram story.

01:02.800 --> 01:06.300
Wow, get a load of this fuckin' guy, huh?

01:06.300 --> 01:09.200
Alright, here he is, I- I guess.

01:09.200 --> 01:14.300
What's up, I'm Zach. Thanks for that incredible introduction, Mr. Wolf the Dog.

01:14.300 --> 01:18.900
And right you are, I'm here to announce the winners of the drawing slash contest.

01:18.900 --> 01:21.200
And, first off...

01:21.700 --> 01:24.900
Mwahahahahaha!

01:24.900 --> 01:30.600
The season's fan art contest slash drawing had some buckwild entries in all sorts of different mediums.

01:30.600 --> 01:36.300
We were- we were all completely blown away by all of your creativity and your talent.

01:36.300 --> 01:39.400
So, each and every one of you, thank you so much for entering.

01:39.400 --> 01:40.900
This is so incredible.

01:40.900 --> 01:44.300
Now, let's get to the winners of merch stuff.

01:44.300 --> 01:47.800
We're gonna start with the drawing, which is random.

01:47.800 --> 01:53.900
So, I'm pulling these names out of a digital hat, and the first winner is...

01:53.900 --> 01:55.300
Storm Clouds.

01:55.300 --> 01:57.600
Storm Clouds, you are the first winner.

01:57.600 --> 01:59.700
And the second winner is...

01:59.700 --> 02:02.400
GrimlinDude420.

02:02.400 --> 02:12.100
So, big ol' congrats to Storm Clouds and GrimlinDude420 for your luck and your sweet, sweet victory.

02:12.100 --> 02:14.200
You each get one merch thing.

02:14.200 --> 02:19.700
And now, for the contest portion of the drawing slash contest.

02:19.700 --> 02:22.600
We've got a little surprise for ya.

02:22.600 --> 02:27.800
There were just too many- there were too many jaw-dropping entries this time.

02:27.800 --> 02:31.200
Like, a bunch of wildly weird and cool shit.

02:31.200 --> 02:35.700
So, we're gonna name a couple runners-up.

02:35.700 --> 02:38.400
And you'll both also get one merch thing.

02:38.400 --> 02:43.900
So, in no particular order, the runners-up are...

02:43.900 --> 02:54.000
Antique__Resident__124 for a piece of physical art titled Play Ball, which they made out of clay.

02:54.000 --> 03:02.300
It's like a hand that reaches out for a ball that's in a squeamish situation, and it is fantastic.

03:02.300 --> 03:04.700
Go check it out if you haven't seen it yet.

03:04.700 --> 03:07.500
And the other runner-up is...

03:07.500 --> 03:19.600
Oxum__Live for a cross-stitch that we actually requested in episode 49 at 17 minutes and 50 seconds in or so.

03:19.600 --> 03:22.700
I don't- didn't remember it, went back and listened to it.

03:22.700 --> 03:32.400
The Pettymore family cross-stitch portrays Jeremy Pettymore on a riding lawnmower and a drunk Don D. Pettymore tied to a tree.

03:32.400 --> 03:36.700
And it says, mow the lawn and tie up Don.

03:36.700 --> 03:39.700
Fucking aces and really well done both of you.

03:39.700 --> 03:42.100
Thank you so much for entering.

03:42.100 --> 03:43.500
You each get one thing.

03:43.500 --> 03:46.000
And now...

03:46.000 --> 03:47.500
Is that good?

03:47.500 --> 03:49.000
That drum roll on the mic?

03:49.000 --> 03:50.300
Do you like that?

03:50.300 --> 03:52.000
The winner of the contest.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.800
The winner of three merch things.

03:54.800 --> 03:56.600
It's...

03:56.600 --> 04:04.200
SlideWhistle, who did a discombobulating illustration of a psychedelically holy cow.

04:04.200 --> 04:07.100
And the whole gang from our Holy Cow Farm short story.

04:07.100 --> 04:12.600
Jimmy Corrigan, Shelly St. Blythe, Vincente Bowery, and Meat Hook.

04:12.600 --> 04:14.700
So go check it out if you haven't seen it.

04:14.700 --> 04:16.800
SlideWhistle, truly top-notch work.

04:16.800 --> 04:20.300
Thank you so much and huge shout out to everyone.

04:20.300 --> 04:23.700
All of our winners, all the folks who submitted entries.

04:23.700 --> 04:25.700
That's right, I'm talking to you.

04:25.700 --> 04:31.000
Ziggy Elinasto, ItWasAllASnowGrow, Brie the Banshee, Dismal Underscore Dependent7515,

04:31.000 --> 04:37.100
Demir 2019, Nestria, Surplus Turtles, God's Gift Card to Women, Jars of Olivers,

04:37.100 --> 04:42.700
DJ Intslut, Chewing Brie, Super5ish, Choco Underscore Crayon, Turkey Ham, Soren Ash,

04:42.700 --> 04:46.600
Pretending Underscore Cyrus, and UiguiGoodness.

04:46.600 --> 04:51.200
And of course, once again to our winners, Stormclouds, GremlinDude420,

04:51.200 --> 04:55.400
Antique Underscore Resident Underscore, 124, and Oxum Underscore Live,

04:55.400 --> 05:01.700
as well as our grand finale contest winner, SlideWhistle.

05:01.700 --> 05:03.000
Thank you to everyone.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.400
Now, back to you, Wolf.

05:04.400 --> 05:05.600
I love you.

05:05.600 --> 05:11.200
Wow, I sure do enjoy the nice things that Zach said to and about me.

05:11.200 --> 05:14.900
Thank you, Zach, for whatever it is you do around here.

05:14.900 --> 05:16.400
I'm sure it's important.

05:16.400 --> 05:22.300
Are you caught up to this episode, but you're not yet getting that sweet exclusive,

05:22.300 --> 05:27.500
Sklussy for short, b-b-b-b-b-b-bonus content

05:27.500 --> 05:33.200
to satiate your earhole needs in between fresh episode drops?

05:33.200 --> 05:38.400
Before you respond, keep in mind that I can see the numbers,

05:38.400 --> 05:41.400
and the numbers just keep going up.

05:41.400 --> 05:47.000
We recently dropped the two-part finale of the seven-part campaign

05:47.000 --> 05:53.200
that Thomas wrote, ran, and entitled The Lost Treasure of John Lee Pettymore,

05:53.200 --> 05:57.600
and then their Patreon numbers shot up with folks aching

05:57.600 --> 06:02.700
to listen to this wild continuation of the story of contention

06:02.700 --> 06:05.700
after the events of season one.

06:05.700 --> 06:09.700
Now, you probably already know it's only five bucks

06:09.700 --> 06:15.600
to gain clearance to the RSS feed we call Contention Confidential,

06:15.600 --> 06:20.000
where you can listen to that Oops All Pettymore's campaign,

06:20.000 --> 06:26.400
along with grease loads more bonus episodes for your cochlear pleasures.

06:26.400 --> 06:30.200
That's at patreon.com slash pretending pod.

06:30.200 --> 06:32.700
And if you'd rather just click something,

06:32.700 --> 06:36.500
that link in the other links are in the show notes.

06:36.500 --> 06:39.900
Now, how about some more boring facts and figures?

06:39.900 --> 06:42.100
It's the news.

06:42.100 --> 06:46.200
Last time, waffles were had at the home of Cal Colorado

06:46.200 --> 06:49.800
before the canned crew made their way downtown to the hole

06:49.800 --> 06:52.900
in the bridge that crosses the city river.

06:52.900 --> 06:57.400
In a nearby alley, they met Kurt, aka Daddy,

06:57.400 --> 07:02.100
who busted out one of those fancy new air-to-underwater drones

07:02.100 --> 07:05.700
and flew that sucker right on through the unguarded,

07:05.700 --> 07:08.400
unnaturally smooth hole.

07:08.400 --> 07:11.900
And then he plunged it into the city river below.

07:11.900 --> 07:17.100
The aquatic drone dove down into and through a tugboat,

07:17.100 --> 07:19.700
which was, and also still is,

07:19.700 --> 07:24.400
partially stuck in an enormous cartoon hole in the riverbed.

07:24.400 --> 07:29.200
And when the drone went through the tugboat and came out the other side,

07:29.200 --> 07:33.100
it flew into an old-timey school gymnasium

07:33.100 --> 07:36.500
with a bloody throne under one of the basketball hoops

07:36.500 --> 07:41.300
and a small humanoid creature with round ears atop its head,

07:41.300 --> 07:44.300
wearing a blood-soaked school uniform.

07:44.300 --> 07:48.400
And that thing skittered on all fours towards the drone camera,

07:48.400 --> 07:50.600
which nimbly dodged the grab.

07:50.600 --> 07:53.400
But then Cal knocked the shit out of Kurt,

07:53.400 --> 07:56.000
kicked in the screen on the drone remote,

07:56.000 --> 08:00.300
and punted it to the metaphorical and very real curb,

08:00.300 --> 08:03.600
taking us now to whatever's next.

08:03.600 --> 08:09.600
It's Alter Girl with My Life is Great and It's All My Fault.

08:27.000 --> 08:35.000
Cause my life is great and it's all my fault.

08:45.000 --> 08:49.000
I'll let you braid their hair if that's what you're into.

08:49.000 --> 08:53.000
I am gonna think probably of the three movies,

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
it's gonna be maybe the best one.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
The best one.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
For sure the best one.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
The three movies, you mean Oppenheimer, Barbie, and Wonka?

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
Yeah.

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
The trilogy.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
Reserved my seats for Barbie today.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
Wonka and barber.

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
Wow, they really got you, huh?

09:11.000 --> 09:15.000
I'm gonna wait until it's not the night it comes out and then go see it at the IMAX.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
Oh nice.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
Oh wait, are we recording?

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
Sure.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
Beep.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
Are we?

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
Yeah.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
Action.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
Do it though.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
I am.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
The light didn't come on, you didn't go like click.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
We should get it on air.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
We need it on air.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
We should get it on air.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
Why not?

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
Cause we're not on air.

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
We're on tape baby and it's not even that anymore.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
Direct to digital.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
That just doesn't have it.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
Ron Zach's laptop.

09:42.000 --> 09:47.000
Direct to digital is even worse in some circles.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
Are we recording?

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
Yeah.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
Luke, how was Taylor Swift?

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
Yeah.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
It was so fucking good dude.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
Tell us about your era's experience.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
Well, I went and-

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
So far so good.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
Got there.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
Whoa.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
And I sat down and then Muna played and they were pretty good.

10:04.000 --> 10:09.000
Gracie Abrams played and I had never heard her music but she's pretty good.

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
And then the real show started.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
And it went on for three hours and 50 minutes.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
Jesus Christ.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
Three hours and 50 minutes?

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
Just shy of four hours long.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
Oh my god.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
With two openers.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
Oh my god.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
No, just Taylor's set was-

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
Right.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
When did it start?

10:27.000 --> 10:32.000
The openers played maybe 20 minutes at eight o'clock and was done by basically midnight.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
Wow.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
It was fucking amazing dude.

10:35.000 --> 10:40.000
So the day that I went was the day she released her Speak Now re-release.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
Don't speak.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
She like played-

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
I know just what you're thinking.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
That's my favorite one.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
Played extra songs from that.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
I don't know.

10:48.000 --> 10:52.000
Because on her re-release record she does like from the vault song.

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
So basically B-sides that didn't make it on the record.

10:55.000 --> 11:01.000
So she premiered a music video for one of those songs that hadn't been shown before.

11:01.000 --> 11:05.000
That had Taylor Lautner and Chloe King I think is her name.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
An actress in it.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
And then she showed it and she's like, what'd you guys think?

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
And everybody screams.

11:10.000 --> 11:15.000
And she's like, well in a normal film premiere they have the actors there.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
And then brought out everybody in it.

11:19.000 --> 11:23.000
And then Taylor Lautner comes out and does like a backflip on the stage and shit.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
Attaboy.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
And they like talk for a little bit.

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
And dude all the fucking music was so good dude.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
It was-

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
Hell yeah.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
At like two hours in I was like, damn my feet hurt.

11:33.000 --> 11:37.000
And as I watch her like fucking dancing around on stage.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
For the Nth night in a row.

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
Do you know if she's doing four hours a night every night?

11:42.000 --> 11:48.000
I think ours was slightly longer by maybe 10 or 15 minutes.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
Wow.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
That's still a wildly long set.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
That's crazy.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
Yeah dude it's nuts.

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
I mean cause it's like songs from every single album that she has.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
Would you say like every era?

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
Every era dude.

12:00.000 --> 12:05.000
But the last tour she did was four albums ago.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
Oh wow.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
Oh I don't think I realized that.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
Yeah COVID happened.

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
She released two albums like in the height of COVID.

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
One right before that she didn't get to tour on.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
And then one just recently.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
This is her first tour since COVID?

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
Yeah.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
Wow.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
Shit okay.

12:21.000 --> 12:25.000
So usually the times I've seen her in the past it's like here's the album that I just

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
came out with.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
We'll play all the songs on it.

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
And then you know a few of the hits.

12:30.000 --> 12:34.000
So this time it was like the hits from every single album.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
And then most of the songs on the new album.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
It was fucking nuts.

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
So a good $200,000 well spent?

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
Yeah.

12:42.000 --> 12:47.000
No I at work I sat at work on Ticketmaster for about six hours.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
Do you want to include that in the pod for?

12:50.000 --> 12:57.000
I was doing it right next to my boss who was also on Ticketmaster for about six hours trying

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
to get tickets.

12:58.000 --> 13:02.000
So we got them day of so I paid I mean they were like 300 something dollars but I didn't

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
pay.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
I mean people were paying like thousands for it.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
That sounds reasonable.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
For what it was yeah.

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
For about a hundred less than a hundred bucks an hour.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
For a four hour stadium show.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
Wow.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
Exactly.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
That's not that at all.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
And my seats were fucking good and dude it was just nuts.

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
Like I'll show you guys like some videos I took later but like.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
He's talking to you audience.

13:21.000 --> 13:26.000
Yeah I'll share them on in the discord.

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
But dude the whole setup like the stage and everything was just nuts.

13:29.000 --> 13:33.000
Like the whole stage was also video.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
Oh come on.

13:34.000 --> 13:40.000
Yeah and so dude at one point like the stage turns into water and she like finishes a song

13:40.000 --> 13:45.000
and just you can't even like see it but the stage like barely opens up and she just dives

13:45.000 --> 13:50.000
into the stage and then like it's a like a video of her like swimming under the stage

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
all the way.

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
And then like she pops up and like plays another song.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
It was.

13:56.000 --> 14:01.000
Do you think she runs or is she jumping down to a little area where there's like a little

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
go kart that takes her to the next spot?

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
No dude.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
She hits the segue.

14:05.000 --> 14:09.000
It's like assistance next to her with like little fans and some bottled water.

14:09.000 --> 14:14.000
Dude the choreography of all of it though to like hit all of that like exactly when

14:14.000 --> 14:19.000
they need to and like running from I mean the stage was as basically as long as Arrowheads

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
Field is like.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
Like as big as this room?

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
Almost.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
It's huge.

14:24.000 --> 14:28.000
But dude it was it was fun as shit and it was great.

14:28.000 --> 14:32.000
I had a great time and she sang all the songs that I wanted to hear.

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
Do you feel like she had fun though?

14:35.000 --> 14:41.000
I looked it up and she is taking like this is not what each show makes but what she's

14:41.000 --> 14:45.000
taking home from each show is around four to five million dollars.

14:45.000 --> 14:51.000
So it doesn't matter if she's having fun.

14:51.000 --> 14:55.000
I would assume probably a little bit but you know even if it's work it's a pretty good

14:55.000 --> 14:58.000
job.

14:58.000 --> 15:02.000
Yeah last thing that was cool she had a guitar on her original Speak.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
What?

15:03.000 --> 15:07.000
She had a guitar on her Speak Now tour that's been in like the Music Hall of Fame.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
I read about this.

15:08.000 --> 15:12.000
And they like took it out and she played it for that show.

15:12.000 --> 15:21.000
Somebody say it's like when Captain America goes to get his shield from the museum.

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
My dad today was like do you like Taylor Swift?

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
I was like yeah I'm not like a huge fan or anything but I like some of her songs.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
He's like I think I do too.

15:28.000 --> 15:32.000
Like I just all of a sudden been hearing a lot about her like all these videos keep popping

15:32.000 --> 15:35.000
up on my like reels.

15:35.000 --> 15:39.000
And he like then he got into some pretty like weird drama about her.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
Like reels drama?

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
Yeah.

15:42.000 --> 15:48.000
I'm imagining your dad commenting like not that good.

15:48.000 --> 15:52.000
I saw a tweet today it was like something like that and then somebody just said dinosaur

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
junior better.

15:54.000 --> 15:59.000
It was like man she wrote this song about a breakup like 15 years ago and she was she

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
really blamed the woman.

16:00.000 --> 16:04.000
I wonder if when she re-releases it she might write it to be like a little chiller.

16:04.000 --> 16:08.000
And then the very next video is like then I watched a video where these guys laughed

16:08.000 --> 16:12.000
about the women's soccer team playing the men's soccer team and like pointed to why

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
that's like why they make less money and stuff.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
Do you think that was like a right wing thing?

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
I was like yeah dad it was.

16:19.000 --> 16:23.000
And it was like I'll send it to you so you can see it was literally fucking The Daily

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
Wire.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
Yeah.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
And I was like yeah you got sent right into the algorithm.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
Straight into it.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
Straight there.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
Just back out.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
Maybe stop watching all these little reels.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
They do have the targeting down pretty well.

16:34.000 --> 16:38.000
Not that your dad is like that but he is in the demographic for.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
Oh yeah.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
Easily flipped.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
Light and old.

16:42.000 --> 16:48.000
Not easily but just the kind that watches maybe all day so you could eventually weasel

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
your way in there.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
I've heard that it's all old people do now.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
My mom's watching reels.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
My dad's watching reels.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
Reels is specifically Facebook is that right?

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
Yeah.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
Instagram.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
Meta properties.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
Gotcha gotcha.

17:01.000 --> 17:05.000
Which I just joined the third wing of.

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
That sounds like some Hitler shit.

17:08.000 --> 17:12.000
I didn't say I just joined the third Reich of Meta.

17:12.000 --> 17:15.000
It sounds like you joined Meta's like Zucker Youth.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
It's Threads.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
It basically is.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
Oh the third one.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
That's what you meant.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
Okay.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
Yeah.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
I mean like there's three of them.

17:23.000 --> 17:27.000
Luke works in marketing so I thought he joined some Meta like secret society.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
No.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
There's Facebook, Instagram and now there's Threads.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
Professional organization.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
So I joined the third one.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
I joined the third wing of Meta.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
You know?

17:35.000 --> 17:39.000
If it's between Musk and Zuck I'll kill myself.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
Yeah.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
Exactly.

17:41.000 --> 17:48.000
People are like rooting for Zuck because Musk has been so annoying but they forget how Zuck

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
got where he is.

17:49.000 --> 17:54.000
They didn't personally destabilize with democracy but like deliberately stood by while it happened

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
because it made him a lot of money.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
He smiled weird too.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
Like globally.

17:58.000 --> 18:03.000
On that note dude I'm stoked to see DJT back up on stage debating.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
You know?

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
Oh man I.

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
You been watching the reels?

18:08.000 --> 18:13.000
When you said on that note I was like nice Luke's gonna turn us into playing the game.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
That's the game.

18:15.000 --> 18:19.000
I just looked at my notes to get ready and didn't even really catch what you said.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
On that note.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
Where we at?

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
We're beating Kurt up.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
We all lost our goddamn minds.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
Yeah.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
Cal kicked Kurt's ass.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
And his drone controller.

18:31.000 --> 18:35.000
And broke his drone and threw some money at him for that.

18:35.000 --> 18:39.000
And then if he stuck around for the post credit scene the very last thing that happened is

18:39.000 --> 18:42.000
Cal sniffed the bag with the goo.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
Do we need to leave?

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
The wax.

18:44.000 --> 18:47.000
And he screams I'm gonna smell god goddamnit.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
Don't sniff his ear wax finger.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
That grosses me out.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
His eyes went together.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
He's coming.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
Oh a Kimbo.

18:55.000 --> 18:59.000
Yeah Cal really wants to do anything he has to to induce the sight of god from this.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
Man.

19:00.000 --> 19:04.000
I don't know what does Cal do to induce the sight of god?

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
It's a big world.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
What are you gonna do?

19:06.000 --> 19:11.000
Yeah I don't know I think he rubs his face in it real hard and he's just got this gross

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
black smudge on his nose.

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
Julius is like seeing it happen and like nudging.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
Dude.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
Dude.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
Cal what are you doing?

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
I don't fucking know and he throws the bag on the ground and he just kind of storms off.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
Are you alright?

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
Are you feeling anything?

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
He's walking away.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
He took like a massive dose dude.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
Oh shit.

19:29.000 --> 19:32.000
Stevie reaches down and looks at the bag and they're like.

19:32.000 --> 19:38.000
I think he like got some of it like on him maybe we should be careful with this I don't

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
know.

19:39.000 --> 19:42.000
He stopped working like maybe it's been out in the air too long.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
Sniff it.

19:43.000 --> 19:47.000
They hold it up to their nose and look at you kind of.

19:47.000 --> 19:51.000
Is this going to be the first time that all three of us have to leave the room so you

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
can talk to yourself?

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
Okay Stevie.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
Here's what happens.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
No this actually has already happened.

19:56.000 --> 20:00.000
Stevie you remember while they're holding the bag up to their nose that you've seen

20:00.000 --> 20:05.000
this before and they do kind of the same thing where their eyes go blank for just like a

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
quarter of a second and then.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
Yeah.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
Yeah.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
No.

20:11.000 --> 20:15.000
What did you see?

20:15.000 --> 20:18.000
It still works.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
And they.

20:20.000 --> 20:23.000
You saw how the steel works?

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
Start shuddering.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
Slowly.

20:25.000 --> 20:29.000
Stevie you've got to talk to us maybe that will help.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
Just tell us like.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
Free associate right now.

20:32.000 --> 20:38.000
Just tell us all the things that came to mind.

20:38.000 --> 20:43.000
I saw Fred.

20:43.000 --> 20:47.000
I saw Fred.

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
I saw Fred stacking bodies.

20:50.000 --> 20:55.000
Just stacking bodies one after another and they weren't real.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.000
They weren't real.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.000
They weren't real.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
They weren't real.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
They weren't human.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
They weren't.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
I wasn't real.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
I wasn't real.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
Stevie.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
Stevie.

21:04.000 --> 21:08.000
Kyle's come back and he's like put a hand on their shoulder and he's trying to calm

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
them down.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
Stevie just.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
I told you that he's not a good guy.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
I told you.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
Okay.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
Okay.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
They are like sweating.

21:16.000 --> 21:21.240
Like you can see just like sweat just like pouring down their face and it's it's coming

21:21.240 --> 21:27.840
down past their hair in front of their face and they use their hair to kind of wipe away

21:27.840 --> 21:30.200
some of the tears and the sweat.

21:30.200 --> 21:31.480
Beck whips out a bandana.

21:31.480 --> 21:32.480
He's always got one.

21:32.480 --> 21:33.480
Hands it to them.

21:33.480 --> 21:34.480
Thanks Beck.

21:34.480 --> 21:35.480
Thanks.

21:35.480 --> 21:36.480
Hey Stevie.

21:36.480 --> 21:41.480
You like grew up around those animal human hybrid things like did you recognize where

21:41.480 --> 21:42.480
that drone was?

21:42.480 --> 21:44.960
Oh those are new man.

21:44.960 --> 21:50.840
Those are fucking new and those are from after we locked down.

21:50.840 --> 21:52.240
Okay.

21:53.240 --> 21:58.800
He got Sandro on his side I guess he figured out how to change something he learned how

21:58.800 --> 21:59.800
to do.

21:59.800 --> 22:00.800
Yeah Fred.

22:00.800 --> 22:07.200
He learned how to do something with Sandro and he I mean he taught me a little bit right.

22:07.200 --> 22:12.120
The thing that I showed you and they kind of pull like a flask almost out of their pocket

22:12.120 --> 22:16.680
kind of flash it at you and put it back in their pocket and you saw earlier when they

22:16.680 --> 22:21.040
were spilling blood outside of the Mercedes.

22:21.040 --> 22:24.040
That's what they were using just spilled the blood around.

22:24.040 --> 22:31.620
He taught me a little bit of how to manipulate people and the world but he must have figured

22:31.620 --> 22:40.800
out something even bigger because I mean that something happened and I mean Godels Gorge

22:40.800 --> 22:48.040
like it like changed it like there's something there was a shimmer about it and that's when

22:48.040 --> 22:53.640
people started showing up and animals of all sorts and the you know the in-betweeners

22:53.640 --> 22:56.380
and that.

22:56.380 --> 23:00.080
The in-betweeners is that the is that what we just saw?

23:00.080 --> 23:04.720
Yeah yeah I think so I hadn't seen anything like that that world that you asked about

23:04.720 --> 23:11.680
that that place I don't know I don't I don't know I guess that's where they came from but

23:11.680 --> 23:17.620
like we saw them when we were going across back across to leave Grover's Gorge across

23:17.620 --> 23:23.180
I mean those things were there and they they came from the church they were alive though

23:23.180 --> 23:28.020
but like that's I think that's where he was stacking the you said you saw the bodies right

23:28.020 --> 23:33.140
I think that's where I just saw those bodies I saw the bodies with the blood moat and the

23:33.140 --> 23:38.500
train over the blood tracks and on why does this guy have so many bodies I think it's

23:38.500 --> 23:45.300
because they're appearing in Godels Gorge and so he was using them to fill up the moat

23:45.300 --> 23:50.540
Jesus get it together see can I back up real fast you said that Fred got Sandro on his

23:50.540 --> 23:58.620
side wasn't Sandro a turtle yeah but you know God did he communicate with the turtle yeah

23:58.620 --> 24:03.340
was it with the turtle or the thing inside the turtle I mean it was the thing inside

24:03.340 --> 24:07.960
the turtle is the thing that's inside Greg so what did Sandra think about that I'm just

24:07.960 --> 24:14.220
trying to lighten the mood Sandra was a prisoner I think where was that thing before it was

24:14.220 --> 24:24.040
in Sandro Frank put it in Sandro or like maybe the mayor before Sandro I mean obviously there's

24:24.040 --> 24:29.180
something to do with the mayor right like who was the mayor before Sandro it's in your

24:29.180 --> 24:36.700
notes you're the only one who saw his grave oh I fell on top of his grave that's right

24:36.700 --> 24:42.520
I think you mentioned something he had a name it's so much has happened since then he's

24:42.520 --> 24:51.400
buried behind a fox's house Greg did I make Fox up no that's the name that I think Fred

24:51.400 --> 24:56.520
like made him have after he changed him well it was behind his house but it doesn't matter

24:56.520 --> 25:09.880
I wonder if hmm I wish you wouldn't have let your brother go Wow me too but also like I had

25:09.880 --> 25:21.200
to why did you have to he's my brother like not not anymore really yeah I know I get it

25:21.200 --> 25:28.120
I get it what if we got the mayor to go into like a little worm or something now he's like

25:28.120 --> 25:34.440
out there right we gotta find him before we can do anything if we paint a hole on the side of the

25:34.440 --> 25:40.000
wall like Wile E. Coyote and he just smacks his fucking dome against it don't do you think he's

25:40.000 --> 25:45.040
drawn to the holes or is he making them I think he's thinking he's making them but you know I

25:45.040 --> 25:50.600
don't spitball it here I mean it's yeah I mean do you have a better solution than a giant hole

25:51.240 --> 26:04.640
because I'd like to hear it everybody roll alertness at a negative 20 fail you're caught

26:04.640 --> 26:12.000
up in this conversation pass fail but even while caught up in this conversation Julius you notice

26:12.000 --> 26:21.520
that daddy is collecting the broken drone screen like monitor out of the trash that Cal kicked it

26:21.520 --> 26:30.800
into and putting it back into his bowling bag hey daddy I'm sorry I don't daddy recoils when you

26:30.800 --> 26:38.520
call out to him did that thing did that thing not freak you out course it freaked me out made me feel

26:38.520 --> 26:43.960
all sorts of bad things did it make you want to punch yourself cuz that's what made me feel like

26:43.960 --> 26:53.520
doing to you I don't want I don't want to be a part of any more okay you don't have to be throws

26:53.520 --> 27:01.360
the memory stick and leave your broken drone here his eyes get really big and he takes off running

27:01.520 --> 27:17.920
after him boys dexterity Cal fails you want on a 45 Beck fails 97 on a 50 I got a 19 on a 70 I got

27:17.920 --> 27:27.880
a 30 on this guy can't do that dextrous probably like a 40 Julius why does he get away as everyone

27:27.880 --> 27:34.240
falls behind the two of you are sprinting off taking around corners and running around the

27:34.240 --> 27:40.000
streets of downtown you've left Cal Colorado and Beck Wilder in the dust it takes a while but as

27:40.000 --> 27:47.160
soon as Julius starts to feel you know that heat you get from running as soon as he starts to feel

27:47.160 --> 27:54.280
that he just it's like his body almost goes limp and he just kind of loses balance and falls to

27:54.280 --> 28:00.040
the ground don't worry Cal Julius is after him he's got those thighs he's gonna catch him no

28:00.040 --> 28:05.360
problem I probably will but let's let's swing around in the Mercedes and and cut him off we

28:05.360 --> 28:12.000
gotta go all the way back to your place for it what we came here in the van whatever get the

28:12.960 --> 28:30.040
fucking car from quite a distance you just hear do this guys I I can't do it you're like you're

28:30.040 --> 28:37.760
looking back you're looking back at where he came from but then the the can van pulls up right next

28:37.880 --> 28:43.920
to you Julius kind of like crawls over to it and like I help you in kind of just yeah throws

28:43.920 --> 28:48.200
himself into the back way to go dude you're totally noodled what's going on does anyone have

28:48.200 --> 28:55.520
navigation Julius tries to point where he went but it's just kind of his arm kind of hops 10% I'll

28:55.520 --> 29:07.160
give Stevie a 30 if somebody wants to roll for them that's a critical failure in 88 you're going

29:07.160 --> 29:15.240
right for the hole they spot a little bit of drone down the distance and they plug in his home

29:15.240 --> 29:23.080
address on their phone and Cal slaps it out the window oh and as it we don't need that newfangled

29:23.080 --> 29:31.160
technology to catch a creep and you both see it as it lands just lands on one corner and you see

29:31.160 --> 29:38.080
it just kind of like pops in the screen shatters off of the side of it and it just falls into a

29:38.080 --> 29:45.760
few different pieces as the canned van continues to drive and Stevie's like what do I we're off the

29:45.760 --> 29:54.680
grid now Stevie everybody throw your phones out the window do we have to Julius does not throw

29:55.520 --> 30:01.960
cows cows like driving like a madman he's not really it's not really paying attention to those

30:01.960 --> 30:12.040
demands okay but doesn't back I want you to find anything in this man made after I don't know 1996

30:12.040 --> 30:21.840
okay get it at the fuck out of here Julius quickly thinks about what Yuri was born and then

30:24.680 --> 30:33.720
yeah dude okay no problem and he throws one mic cable out the window Oh Stevie all right

30:33.720 --> 30:40.880
oh I just I'm gonna miss that mic cable I need to piss okay

30:40.880 --> 31:01.320
it'll do where were we not we rent we are going the wrong way we got in the van to try to chase

31:01.320 --> 31:08.480
down daddy daddy daddy are we just kind of aimlessly driving at this point or where are we

31:08.480 --> 31:14.560
going haven't we met him at his house as Cal dry do that once am I going fucking insane here

31:14.560 --> 31:19.920
I think maybe a little bit you did just attack him out of nowhere seemingly that was wild do

31:19.920 --> 31:29.160
you want to speak on that drone brought the thing to us um you know is it so is it so crazy to be

31:29.160 --> 31:36.120
afraid of that fucking thing Cali John was it the drone was in that play that that that thing the

31:36.120 --> 31:39.680
drone was gonna lead that thing right to us it went through the hole that thing could come through

31:39.680 --> 31:47.040
the hole to Cal I never realized that you like had to get rid of an accent to be on TV it was

31:47.040 --> 31:57.520
really coming out there I don't know what you're talking about good with me where is it Julie is

31:57.520 --> 32:05.480
Cal driving yeah yeah in the rearview mirror yeah it's a POV shot from Julius's perspective and he's

32:05.480 --> 32:13.560
like huh so what are we doing what's well you know I was thinking like every time we sniff the bag

32:13.560 --> 32:20.240
we're seeing the bodies we're seeing the church and then we flew the drone down into a hole and

32:20.240 --> 32:27.400
we saw the animal with the last time we saw the animal guys was by the church going with this

32:27.400 --> 32:33.520
Julius I'm thinking maybe we got to get back to the gorge and back to that church and maybe I saw

32:33.560 --> 32:39.880
some tracks maybe take that train Julius we we can't do shit there he saw we need to come back

32:39.880 --> 32:45.400
with the fucking Air Force what does X say about all this I mean that's we need to fucking new

32:45.400 --> 32:52.680
Godel's Gorge okay if Godel's Gorge is out for now I guess the only other person who's experienced

32:52.680 --> 32:59.160
that I mean we could go talk to Kaylee silver the doctor was talking about climbing into stomachs

32:59.160 --> 33:04.240
that seems I mean if it's not related that would be weird we were definitely gonna do that was that

33:04.240 --> 33:08.440
supposed to be today or well there was also tentatively a meeting with Brock Hargrave but

33:08.440 --> 33:13.080
we all kind of came to the conclusion that he's probably not with us anymore yes we need to try

33:13.080 --> 33:17.000
to make it though just in case I mean should we should we just maybe just be there just in case

33:17.000 --> 33:21.520
maybe if somebody's monitoring his communications we could get the drop on them I mean we could go

33:21.520 --> 33:26.600
and wait for like 15 minutes and then scope it out then go talk to Kaylee go talk to Kaylee after

33:26.600 --> 33:34.000
that yeah yeah I mean I think we could all use a drink it is it is I'm gonna say we were supposed

33:34.000 --> 33:40.240
to meet him at noon though right yes it's 11 a.m. on Thursday July 7th we can just scope it out

33:40.240 --> 33:47.200
until like 1215 and then if he's not there then yeah that's let's do that and on the way when we

33:47.200 --> 33:54.720
get there and we're parked I gotta I gotta show you guys something why did it sound like like

33:54.720 --> 34:06.440
you're gonna show us your penis oh no that's weird yeah I didn't think that for like everybody's

34:06.440 --> 34:11.440

38:27.520 --> 38:36.560

he was gonna show us his penis but that still hasn't happened yet but yeah so and then we did

39:16.480 --> 39:21.760
the animals the whole thing I gotta show you one more thing no back nobody we don't want to see

39:21.760 --> 39:27.120
your penis or you know regardless of whether or not we want to see your penis it's not professional

39:28.640 --> 39:38.480
not the time back let's go talk in there and he points to the foundry you guys see uh older bar

39:38.480 --> 39:44.240
well maintained but clearly been here for a substantial amount of time sitting on the train

39:44.240 --> 39:54.320
tracks here in the city sun is beating down it's july 7th after all about 11 10 11 11 somewhere

39:54.320 --> 40:04.800
in there oh guys make a wish I wish yeah and yeah there's a couple people sitting on the patio

40:04.800 --> 40:12.000
outside having a drink together and as you guys walk in the sun coming in through the windows

40:12.000 --> 40:18.960
feels almost out of place here at the foundry you're used to this being an after work sort of

40:18.960 --> 40:26.800
location but there's some regulars sitting around the bar and maggie is bartending as always

40:28.000 --> 40:34.320
you see the televisions are on various news media outlets and julius checks to make sure at least

40:34.320 --> 40:40.960
a couple of them are can oh yeah at least a couple are for sure any news about julius's uncle no

40:40.960 --> 40:49.360
strangely no coverage of the death of ty frayland and no coverage of the death of some city

40:49.360 --> 40:56.400
pd and no deaths are being reported on taking place at the zeitgeist only two nights ago

40:56.400 --> 41:02.560
hey maggie have you been watching the news yeah are they talking about anything other than the

41:02.560 --> 41:08.800
hole no mostly just whole talk no like so smooth they just keep trying to get those cameras on the

41:08.800 --> 41:14.320
smooth edge it's wild but you never see anything like it cal kind of turns back to you guys and

41:14.320 --> 41:21.520
like grins and he's like we're gonna have an exclusive voice yeah the thing is though like

41:21.520 --> 41:29.600
you know the x files isn't super into like airing out their dirty laundry so i don't know if uh

41:30.640 --> 41:36.560
that's such a good idea whoa whoa julius my dude but no we're not talking about your uncle

41:37.200 --> 41:41.040
they just aren't talking about any of the things we're going through which is what we're reporting

41:41.040 --> 41:45.680
on julius is saying that he doesn't want to put the footage out of the cut in half bodies

41:46.240 --> 41:52.400
definitely not the type stuff there's type stuff no just i mean we make we report the news and

41:52.400 --> 41:57.360
we know the news it doesn't have to have a video anyway that it doesn't matter we're not going to

41:57.360 --> 42:05.280
do it yeah maggie maggie holes yeah good on the holes we'll take a round hey beck maybe we should

42:05.280 --> 42:12.560
report on the type stuff i mean he's right i don't have any footage of it weird i mean at the

42:12.560 --> 42:17.120
end of the day that's just a murder the stuff that we've got going is yeah a lot bigger and like

42:17.120 --> 42:22.320
pretty sure it's cool if we like put it out there did you think we were going to no you know what i

42:22.320 --> 42:29.280
don't it's been a rough time for me i don't know i trust you guys but like well you know get it

42:29.280 --> 42:37.680
together depression's not real julius on on that note a round for everybody yeah yeah yeah i know

42:37.680 --> 42:43.040
it's right here and uh yeah i heard everything you said but uh you know everything's off the record

42:43.040 --> 42:53.600
here in the foundry julius shushes her jokingly like like oh it's like a funny joke julius sure

42:53.600 --> 42:58.960
thinks it is cow's jaws like dropped and he legitimately doesn't know it's like the fucking

42:59.520 --> 43:05.360
bad and the ugly even the dust has stopped moving in the sun rays that are floating in

43:07.200 --> 43:10.560
and then julie maggie starts laughing

43:15.840 --> 43:22.240
okay run it or start good good one julius i think well uh maybe just run it we're we're waiting for

43:22.240 --> 43:27.760
proc or grief you haven't seen a dude in here who looks like an archaeologist he's all dirty all

43:27.760 --> 43:34.320
the time no and has a shovel i've not seen a dirty man with a shovel in the foundry today now

43:34.320 --> 43:40.240
well what about a clean man with a shovel no and any number of legs uh what doesn't matter it's

43:40.240 --> 43:46.720
for the news this world's getting stranger and stranger as she goes to clean a pint glass you

43:46.720 --> 43:51.280
should give him a call am i imagining that when you first contacted him did you say something like

43:51.280 --> 43:56.160
our usual booth or something like that or did that not happen no but i mean of course there's

43:56.160 --> 44:00.720
our can booth that we sit in with all our pictures above let's go sit over there i mean i'm sure that

44:00.720 --> 44:06.880
he'll he'll head that way julius just make sure to like have a line of sight to the entrance

44:06.880 --> 44:14.480
and once again the can crew goes the can booth where the picture of a much younger cow colorado

44:14.480 --> 44:24.960
is on the wall right behind the now shaken downtrodden sad cows like actively shaking

44:24.960 --> 44:32.640
his voice against the like shaking his head at the voice in his head it's like one of those

44:32.640 --> 44:38.160
things max i'm i'm not sad i'm not downtrodden i'm angry as hell and i'm gonna get to the bottom

44:38.160 --> 44:44.640
of this shit and he like screams that in the bar julius kind of looks like what the fuck and he's

44:44.640 --> 44:50.400
like yeah man yeah uh does anybody have a sharpie i want to sign this and it's a picture of julius

44:50.400 --> 44:57.920
doing the printing press like on at the booth cow yeah cow like absentmindedly pulls one out

44:57.920 --> 45:02.160
of his pocket and like scribbles big all across the cow colorado

45:08.560 --> 45:10.640
i mean that's it's probably worth more now

45:13.200 --> 45:20.160
are we all gonna sign it cool julius signs it like right above his own head an ambling over

45:20.880 --> 45:29.360
to the table as you're all going through and citing these framed pictures an emaciated woman

45:30.560 --> 45:37.920
in a tank top and loose shorts so loose that i could probably fit one of my thighs through

45:37.920 --> 45:45.760
the entire waist maybe maybe be tight but these tiny shorts are loose did that make any sense

45:45.760 --> 45:48.960
yeah cal's staring he's like dr bar carver

45:52.160 --> 45:58.720
she has a broken nose and her two eyes are looking at two of you

45:59.520 --> 46:07.040
at the exact same time right it's one of the chameleon hybrids and she's sort of sort of

46:07.040 --> 46:12.560
shaking kind of herky-jerky and kind of grits her mouth

46:15.280 --> 46:16.640

my boss was saying that the best uh live show he's ever saw was chicago okay the reason i listened

57:27.440 --> 57:34.240
to it is because i hung out with ian this weekend and we were watching just like live music videos

57:34.240 --> 57:41.280
of old rock bands and one of them we watched was that song and they speed it up live and it's even

58:28.960 --> 58:33.440
i'm not playing this shit no more and i sold it on ebay and it was like they're expensive as hell

58:33.440 --> 58:36.880
i mean i think it was like maybe five hundred dollars but that was five hundred dollars to

58:36.880 --> 58:42.880
middle school yeah wait why did you get the money this is so confusing uh because it was i stole it

58:42.880 --> 58:47.440
i stole it from the kid in the first place so like i beat up a i beat up a sixth grader and

58:47.440 --> 58:54.160
took his trombone it was uh it was gifted to me it wasn't nobody had paid for it oh love that i

58:54.160 --> 58:59.120
feel a little bad that i've sold a gifted thing but i played it for three years and decided it

58:59.120 --> 59:04.160
wasn't once it's gifted what'd you buy with the money i don't remember yeah cocaine a shittier

59:04.160 --> 59:11.280
trombone um when when ian and i were watching that video though we were both you know had smoked

59:11.280 --> 59:17.680
weed and just like halfway through halfway through ian just looked at me and goes what do you think

59:17.680 --> 59:25.280
it means so we looked it up and it was talking about his favorite time to write songs was between

59:25.280 --> 59:32.480
30 and 25 minutes to four o'clock in the morning and the thing it's either 25 minutes or six to

59:32.480 --> 59:38.800
four oh wow okay yeah so there you go it's about writing music late at night or early in the

59:38.800 --> 59:43.040
morning but for him probably late at night you just imagine him at a fucking 345 going like

59:43.040 --> 59:49.520
this is awesome all of his neighbors it makes all the all the lyrics make more sense the first

59:49.520 --> 59:57.520
thing waiting for the break of day i just assumed his neighbors would come in and kill him and then

59:57.520 --> 01:00:04.720
be like he had it coming he had it coming oh we have um we have good reason to believe that

01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:09.920
zach might try to the menu us tonight so this might be the last episode of the podcast

01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:15.200
