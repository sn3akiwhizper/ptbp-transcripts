1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
Yesterday, I ate a whole bucket of long-deceased crab.

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:11,500
Now y'all know I like to dive right into a slop bucket, putrid or otherwise, but something

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:16,120
about these weird ocean spiders got me feeling nasty.

4
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:22,400
But not Wolf the dog nasty, just regular diarrhea nasty.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:32,600
What does not make me feel nasty is broadcasting live from 694.2 PTBP, the only radio station

6
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:40,120
that is also in the past and the present and the future at all times, but also sometimes

7
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,740
none of them.

8
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:44,520
This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Daisy.

9
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,240
If you want to write up something for y'all wolfy to howl, tag the show at Pretending

10
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:55,800
Pod on Instagram or Twitter, or write up a 5-star review on Apple Podcasts and email

11
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,320
us at PretendingPod at Gmail dot com.

12
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,640
That way you can be like Daisy here.

13
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:06,600
They write, Hello to everyone in contention and beyond.

14
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:12,440
Thanks to the weird time stuff going on in contention, Texas has gotten a signal to y'all's

15
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:18,400
best and only radio station, 694.2 PTBP.

16
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,840
I've been listening for a month or has it only been a few days?

17
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,200
Contention is so weird with its time.

18
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:32,780
Well, I would just like to take this time to say thank you to Wolf the dog, his producer

19
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:36,840
and all the people who make this radio segment possible.

20
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,480
Sincerely, Daisy, sending all the love and trash in Texas.

21
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,440
Well, damn, thanks Daisy.

22
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:49,980
Well, uh, you can keep the love, but I will gladly take your trash offering with glee.

23
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:55,500
Also remember, we've got a new project for our citizens of contention over on the subreddit.

24
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,520
We are going to write a Delta Green scenario as a community.

25
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,640
Over the next few months, we'll be having prompted writing contests to find the best

26
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,760
meaty chunks y'all can muster.

27
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:12,280
We'll use each round's winner to inform the next prompt until we have enough juicy morsels

28
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,740
to make ourselves a narrative feast.

29
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:20,660
To get in on this tub of greasy love, head on down to reddit.com all slash pretending

30
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:21,920
to be people.

31
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,660
The deadline for submissions here in round one is August 22nd.

32
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:31,680
Show us what you've got and vote for your favorites to help us choose the winners.

33
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,820
Hey lovers, did you enjoy that bonus episode we released a couple weeks ago?

34
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:42,480
The one where the boys played Lover in the Ice, the infamously mad fucked up Delta Green

35
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,180
scenario written by Caleb Stokes?

36
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:49,240
Well, that was just part one of a three part series.

37
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:54,940
You can find parts two and three over at patreon.com slash pretending pod.

38
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,700
There's a link in the show notes.

39
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:02,300
As you become a Splashylvania Fastpass holder, you'll have access to our entire playthrough

40
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:07,380
of Lover in the Ice as well as 10 other bonus episodes.

41
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:13,740
Wherein we play everyone is John the End of the World, Magnum Vice, Fury Force, more Delta

42
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:18,460
Green, and Kala Cthulhu's original scenario, The Haunting.

43
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:24,260
You can also listen to the session zero for season one, during which the boys create the

44
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:28,200
town of contention and discuss character ideas.

45
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:34,240
And uh, next up on the Patreon docket, some fucking human named Justin is running roll

46
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:40,280
for shoes in the Den of Sin, August 29th at 7pm central time.

47
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,620
Again, hit that link in the damn show notes, why don't ya?

48
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:49,700
Speaking of notes, mine here in front of me are all dusty, but I'm pretty sure they say

49
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,900
it's time for the news.

50
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:57,720
Last time we learned a little about all the good Silas and Mary Cole are doing as the

51
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:05,080
head honchos here in contention in 1880 something, and then we met four fresh faces of four fine

52
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:09,400
folks whose lives are about to be turned completely upside down.

53
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:15,560
Everett Pace, a wily old coot, was lurking around his homestead when he heard a noise

54
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,880
out by his late wife's grave.

55
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:23,320
Hollering, he ran off the missing Miss Kitty, who was digging with her hands over the burial

56
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,800
site while mumbling to herself.

57
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:33,640
Jack Pearlman, oh, after overhearing some folks at the saloon spilling tea about Silas

58
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:39,040
having a teenage girl out on the property of the new mine, trotted home to find one

59
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:44,960
of his steeds on the edge of the river Styx while a slight humanoid figure bolted toward

60
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,760
the tree line like a wild animal.

61
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:53,960
Professor Horace Green tried to get some shut eye, but the drunken miner's conversation

62
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,200
next door bled through the walls like lace.

63
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:02,480
He couldn't help but overhear the slurring about the missing gambler being last seen

64
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:08,560
having a bit of a shouting match with Silas Cole after finding something unusual down

65
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,000
in the mine which he referred to as living oil.

66
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,640
And finally, Judge Ephraim Courtland, after finally spilling out into the world, recalled

67
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:26,320
a peculiar statement made by a recent inmate wherein the madman claimed Mary Cole to be

68
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,240
inhuman.

69
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,200
Judge Courtland then headed to the courthouse, which had been stripped of its copper wire

70
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:38,520
in the night, leaving the building without electricity to the judge's bewilderment.

71
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:44,880
Tartally, he loped to the church for the town hall meeting about the recent disappearances.

72
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:50,880
But staying right here forever is my ungodly ability to keep bringing the heat week after

73
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,600
week until you're weak from these sweet, sweet elite beats.

74
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,800
It's the Creek Rocks with Can't You Hear Them Wolves Howlin'

75
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:22,800
Can't you hear them wolves howlin' All around my poor little darlin'

76
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:28,800
All around my poor little darlin' I'm afraid they'll get my darlin'

77
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:42,800
Can't you hear them wolves howlin' All around my poor little darlin'

78
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,760
All around my poor little darlin' I'm afraid they'll get my darlin'

79
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:52,720
Can't you hear them wolves howlin' All around my poor little darlin'

80
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:58,720
All around my poor little darlin' I'm afraid they'll get my darlin'

81
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,400
Justin, what do you think you would do for money if you existed before 1900?

82
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,160
Oh, before 1900?

83
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,640
Yeah, like roughly in the 1880s somethings.

84
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,160
Shit.

85
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,560
Shovel up shit I guess.

86
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,720
Because I'd be worthless.

87
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,280
Aww.

88
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,520
I don't know, I'm a big dude. I guess I'd be like some kind of manual laborer or something.

89
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,440
Yeah, we would be in charge.

90
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,400
Oh yeah, I'm strong so I'd beat people into submission.

91
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,640
You could do like bare knuckle boxing.

92
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,680
Yeah, we'd box.

93
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,360
I would be the foreman and Luke would be the person I am mean to all the time.

94
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,480
I would be the boss because I can't do manual labor.

95
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,240
Is that how that works immediately?

96
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,560
No, I'd be a grifter for sure.

97
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,040
Just like flouting from town to town, changing your name.

98
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:55,840
Quick, what's your name?

99
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:56,880
John.

100
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,040
Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt.

101
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,160
Wait wait wait, what is it now though?

102
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,800
That guy's like holy shit, that name is my name too.

103
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,240
Oh, nice to meet you Casey.

104
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,000
Luke Shelton here, nice to meet you.

105
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,640
Ooh, no, can I change my answer?

106
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,000
I can't, can I? It's too late.

107
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,480
Too late?

108
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,160
Never mind, go on, go on.

109
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:16,880
Terrible, man.

110
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,840
Joe, what would you do before 1900?

111
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,560
Would you be a barber?

112
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,840
Oh, could you be a barber?

113
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,680
No, I don't know how to cut hair.

114
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,320
I mean, I could.

115
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,320
I don't know how to be a foreman, but I'm going to.

116
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,760
It's the 1900s, dog.

117
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,480
There's no rules.

118
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,840
It's the 1800s.

119
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,280
The 1800s.

120
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,240
I could learn how to cut hair.

121
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,080
I was going to say, I mean, like a bartender or like a...

122
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,320
Well, the three of us would literally be giants.

123
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,680
Because we're tall?

124
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,360
They weren't, they were short back then?

125
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:43,600
Yeah.

126
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,160
They were, they were like four foot tall back then.

127
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:47,680
Hobbits.

128
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,480
I'm almost positive.

129
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,680
When was football invented?

130
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,520
Would we all just be on a football team and like decimate everyone in our pads?

131
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,960
Ooh, can I change my answer?

132
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,520
I want to play baseball in the late 1800s.

133
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,800
I'll teach them how to play if it's...

134
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,680
Oh, nice.

135
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,560
Was it 1870 something?

136
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,880
We're going to teach them how to play baseball.

137
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,360
And it's called Joe ball.

138
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,360
Yep, Joe ball.

139
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,320
After Joe mama.

140
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,000
Are you a first Joe's man or a second Joe's man?

141
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,880
Or do you play third?

142
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,080
Third.

143
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,560
Joe.

144
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,360
I'm a Joe stop.

145
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:15,680
Home Joe.

146
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,720
Home Joe's man.

147
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:27,040
If you, if like you were sent back now to like 1880, what could you actually invent?

148
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:27,760
And like...

149
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,720
Oh, like everything.

150
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,360
Oh, nothing.

151
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,240
Nothing for sure.

152
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,960
I was looking up recliners.

153
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:40,720
Recliners did not exist in the 1880s, so I think I could invent a recliner.

154
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,160
You could probably figure that out.

155
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,200
I would just do all sorts of music.

156
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,400
I would, for some reason, the first song on my mind is Higher by Creed.

157
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,520
I think they would love that.

158
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:59,680
You know what I think would legitimately probably go over pretty well is like any stomping music,

159
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,520
like Little Lion Man.

160
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,480
By Stomp?

161
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,000
No, like what, what's, who does Little Lion Man?

162
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,440
Trash can fellas?

163
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:07,940
No.

164
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,480
Oh, you're talking about Mumford and Sons?

165
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,040
Yeah.

166
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,240
Stomp, stomping music.

167
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,000
Stomping music?

168
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,240
Yeah.

169
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,480
They stomp their feet along with all the songs.

170
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,480
They didn't have a drummer, Thomas.

171
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,920
The lead singer just had a kick drum and that's it.

172
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,880
Is that a true story?

173
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,320
Is that part of their origin story?

174
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,680
Who did that song?

175
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,880
The Ho Hey song with stomping and clapping.

176
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,080
The Ho Hey?

177
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,480
What is that song or what is that band?

178
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,000
You know, like, Hey, they do that a lot throughout the song.

179
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,160
Isn't that Mumford and Sons?

180
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:40,960
I don't think it is.

181
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,920
The Lumineers.

182
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,520
I was a freshman in college in 2010.

183
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,160
I remember this time very well.

184
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,840
I had the Lumineers album on my iPod for sure.

185
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,560
Hell yeah, dude.

186
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,680
iPod touch?

187
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,800
No, iPod, the big one that held the most.

188
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,280
I don't know.

189
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,240
With the big roundy?

190
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,360
Though with the big roundy, yeah.

191
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,840
Could it play videos that were real tiny?

192
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,400
Like pornographies?

193
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,360
I didn't have any videos.

194
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,080
Did you put any dirty films on your big iPod?

195
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,360
I had explicit music on there.

196
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,680
When were you guys allowed to listen to explicit music?

197
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,800
I was never like not allowed to.

198
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,600
Did you have to hide it?

199
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,560
I just like wouldn't.

200
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,880
By the time that was a problem, I was just downloading everything I wanted.

201
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,240
I listened to a lot of classic rock until

202
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,880
LimeWire and then that's when I got all my stuff.

203
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:37,200
My parents bought me the Coolio album that had Gangster's Paradise on it on cassette tape.

204
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,760
We were listening to it and it's one of those rap albums that has a lot of skits

205
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,680
and they cuss up a storm in the skits.

206
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,640
I do remember my mom saying something like,

207
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,440
I wish we would have just gotten the soundtrack to Dead Man Walking,

208
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,400
which is where that song is from, instead of this whole Coolio album.

209
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,160
Holy shit, that's so good.

210
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,400
I had a three CD disc changer.

211
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:06,320
I specifically remember at one point in time, it had Mercy Me,

212
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,880
which was the Christian band who did I Can Only Imagine.

213
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:18,000
It had that album, it had Linkin Park reanimation remix,

214
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,840
and it had The Bends by Radiohead.

215
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,760
Ooh, good mix.

216
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,400
Interesting.

217
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,880
That's a mix, eclectic.

218
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,400
What year do you think that would have been?

219
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,920
2004?

220
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,040
2004?

221
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,200
Mine would have been just classic rock.

222
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,400
Oh, you're one of those people?

223
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,460
Yeah.

224
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,600
In 2004, for sure, mine would have been,

225
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,360
I think I was still, that would have been the tail end of my Zeppelin phase.

226
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:51,440
I would have been Led Zeppelin, AC DC, and just one that changes.

227
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,240
My dad's a big John Denver fan,

228
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,120
so I didn't get into classic rock until School of Rock came out.

229
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:03,360
I was in the only good music is weird, heady, underground rap

230
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,200
that I no longer listen to,

231
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,720
because it's not always the most fun thing to listen to.

232
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,920
Like Eminem?

233
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,320
No, like borderline fucking spoken word sometimes.

234
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,920
Like late Jay-Z.

235
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,000
Or like Tupac, are you going really underground?

236
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,760
Holy shit.

237
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,880
Oh, Joe.

238
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,440
I didn't mean it that way.

239
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,480
I didn't mean it that way.

240
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,280
I was trying to think of another big rapper.

241
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,360
He is alive.

242
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,560
I don't know if you know that.

243
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,840
Joe couldn't have meant it that way,

244
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:41,520
because he has sheltered Tupac for a few months in his loft.

245
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,280
He's like, I know Tupac's fucked.

246
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,840
That's why we're not allowed over there.

247
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,040
I try and bang the door down,

248
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,840
and Joe started hammering up barricades over.

249
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,160
Quick, Tupac, run!

250
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,720
What's he saying?

251
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,000
Does he have an E.T. in there?

252
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,080
Joe, you got E.T. in there?

253
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:06,800
Is that E.T.?

254
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,400
Joe's like, yeah!

255
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,640
It's definitely not.

256
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,280
It's an E.T.!

257
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,720
It's an E.T.!

258
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,800
It's not anything else.

259
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,040
It's not Mr. Shakur.

260
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,680
Oh my God.

261
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,960
It's Biggie!

262
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,920
Fine, it's Biggie!

263
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,000
It's 3Pac!

264
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,440
We're gonna have to cut all this, I'm sorry.

265
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,400
Just those last two.

266
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,560
Really ramped ourselves up for the Old West mood here.

267
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:45,920
So today is the day that is taking place currently.

268
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:50,800
So this will be the day after Everett's interesting evening,

269
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,160
after Horace Green's attempt at sleep,

270
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,960
and after Jack Perlman's night of fun.

271
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:03,840
So, Judge Ephraim, Courtland's day that we dove into.

272
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,320
Who's gonna be at the town hall meeting on time?

273
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:09,440
Not me.

274
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,880
Yeah, I don't think I would either.

275
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,400
I think Everett would be there on time with the night that he had.

276
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,360
Was it mandatory?

277
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,440
Oh right, the disappearances.

278
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,520
Yeah, Horace goes.

279
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,760
I'll be there but not on time, for sure.

280
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,320
Okay.

281
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:24,800
Rough night.

282
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,080
Sorry, I'm still thinking about how Joe harbored Tupac from,

283
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,840
you know, the Illuminati or whatever.

284
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:35,920
Or whatever.

285
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,640
Myriad.

286
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,120
There it is.

287
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:41,040
Luke and Justin, take your headphones off.

288
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,160
Okie dokie.

289
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,680
Oh my god, are you drinking a Coke?

290
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,640
Like a straight Coke?

291
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,640
Yeah, it's Coke Zero.

292
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,200
Nice, no calories.

293
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,200
Dr. Pepper 10.

294
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,560
It's only for men.

295
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,320
That was so fucking weird.

296
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,000
That was a terrible, terrible marketing campaign.

297
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,200
Thank god it backfired.

298
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,720
No joke.

299
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,480
Am I headphones off?

300
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,840
No, keep them on, please.

301
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,320
Okay, bye bye.

302
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:21,520
The dusty church's pews are full and the air is thick on this humid summer day.

303
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:25,600
Sweat is dripping down the skin of all in attendance.

304
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,960
And the smell in here?

305
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,280
Foul.

306
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:32,880
Thankfully, this is a lunch meeting, so the sun isn't shining directly through the windows,

307
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:37,520
but the shade just lends itself to the wetness of the air.

308
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:44,400
Bobby Custard takes his place at the pulpit and begins speaking before the unruly crowd

309
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,120
simmers down.

310
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,720
Alrighty there folks, settle down, settle down.

311
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:54,400
As you all well know, we're here today to discuss the recent happenings regarding the

312
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,880
disappearances of all them saloon folk.

313
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,480
First off, does anyone have any information here to bring forward?

314
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:08,080
Everett from the back, he's still kind of tottering his way in and he hears the tail

315
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:08,560
end of that.

316
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,280
Yeah, I reckon I could shed some light on something that's going on.

317
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,200
I got some information.

318
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,280
Oh, Mr. Pace, yes, of course.

319
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:21,760
Round last night, I reckon the moon was high up there.

320
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,160
It must have been two in the morning or something.

321
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,960
There was a ruckus out there by the tree line.

322
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,840
There's something that means a lot to me out there.

323
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,840
It's where I buried my wife.

324
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,600
There's a gasp through the crowd.

325
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:42,560
Everyone's, there was somebody out there digging and it bothered me.

326
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:46,160
I walked up on and it was Miss Kitty.

327
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:52,160
And I was trying to tell her that they were looking for her.

328
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,440
And then she looked at me and then she just took off running in the woods.

329
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,400
I hollered after, but you know, I can't keep up with anybody these days.

330
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,200
And I don't know what happened after that.

331
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,080
Y'all have a good day.

332
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,200
And he starts walking out.

333
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,320
Oh, no, no, no.

334
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,400
Hey there, uh, Mr. Pace, please, please stay.

335
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,760
If you clearly have some sort of information.

336
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:18,720
And as Bobby is trying to trying to keep you in here, you see Thuro Sexton, who you know

337
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:26,880
as the night watch at the cemetery stands up, hat in hand.

338
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:36,320
Um, I, Everett, I thought I was crazy, but the fact that you said that makes me feel

339
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:41,920
okay saying this here now today here in front of everyone and go.

340
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:52,640
Last night, I scared off that Miss Kitty from digging up bodies in their own cemetery.

341
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:59,920
And when she ran off, I swear to God, I mean, sorry, preach.

342
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:04,080
I, I promise I Bible swear.

343
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:04,800
I swear.

344
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,360
I don't know.

345
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,000
I, I, I'm telling truth.

346
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:16,000
She had three corpses on her back and she ran off with them heading down south.

347
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,640
Miss Kitty's a grave robber.

348
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,760
Is that what you're trying to?

349
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:30,720
I don't know why she was going for so many bodies, but she clearly needed more than three

350
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,280
and must have headed down to your property there, sir.

351
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,960
I'm deeply sorry.

352
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,240
Thank goodness.

353
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,880
She didn't, she didn't get down in that hole deep enough.

354
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,920
I was able to put some earth wrap back on there.

355
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,680
She didn't get deep enough.

356
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,680
You must, you got her.

357
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,400
I would have never expected Miss Kitty.

358
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,400
Was she on hard times or something?

359
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,240
I think she's been gone.

360
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,920
She, she always had the money to live her life.

361
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I often will go to the, and then he looks down and you see his wife looking back up

362
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:12,080
at him with huge eyes and he's like, I mean, I, she, I don't know.

363
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,520
Oh my goodness.

364
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:20,400
I did not expect this much information to come out so soon.

365
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,800
Like much appreciated from the both of you speaking up like this.

366
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,520
Jack, what horse are you riding on your way in?

367
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,520
Same old, same old Jeremiah.

368
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:47,200
So these two fucking gorgeous steeds are taking these two men of very opposing distinctive

369
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:52,480
features toward the church house at the exact same time.

370
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:59,360
And Jack Pearlman and Judge Ephraim Courtland arrive almost simultaneously.

371
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,960
I kind of look over Ephraim and kind of nod to him.

372
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,440
God damn it.

373
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,840
Ephraim gets off his horse and just looks at him and starts walking towards the meeting.

374
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,640
I like tie up my, do you tie up a horse?

375
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,360
We'll say yeah.

376
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,480
You tie, tie up my horse.

377
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,000
You got to tie up that horse.

378
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,400
Otherwise any old random groundhogs can come up and they're scaring off around there and

379
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,560
take off without a horse driving around.

380
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,040
Exactly the words I would have also used.

381
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:25,540
Same.

382
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,760
I give Jeremiah a good little pet and head on in following the nasty man.

383
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,440
Spits on the ground.

384
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:50,720
The doors bust wide open to the church and you see the towering six foot ten, 300 pound

385
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,080
of disgusting flesh falling from itself.

386
00:21:54,160 --> 00:22:03,600
Presence of Judge Ephraim Courtland spit on the ground as he walks in to the church with

387
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:10,480
Jack Pearlman, a much different hotter figure, following right behind.

388
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,600
This man's sexy.

389
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:22,320
All the men and women in the audience, the congregation, the town congregation, we're

390
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,640
in a church, it's not a service, whatever.

391
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:32,640
They all become green with the sight of Judge Courtland and then immediately blood rushes

392
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:39,440
to certain spots and especially cheeks when Jack Pearlman walks into the church.

393
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:45,120
Okay, so you're saying, you're saying that we got Miss Kitty just living around here.

394
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,800
Oh, hello there Judge.

395
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:53,600
Um, I was just asking to see if there's anyone who had any sort of information to bring forward

396
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,320
about the disappearances recently of the saloon.

397
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,080
My copper wire got stolen.

398
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,480
Can't turn the lights on.

399
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,480
That's why I'm here.

400
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:07,440
And the judge is just standing in the aisle and everyone's just kind of looking at him.

401
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,720
Uh, okay.

402
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:16,080
Is that, I'm sure, do you want me as like Sheriff, you want me to take care of that?

403
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,280
Get it.

404
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,800
I can't turn my lights on.

405
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:20,480
Okay.

406
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,680
That'll be the first thing that we take care of after this.

407
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:27,200
Yeah, no, what the hell else are you talking about here?

408
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:32,000
That my secretary told me to come here because of my wires.

409
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,480
Thought that was what this meeting was about.

410
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,800
About the disappearances currently.

411
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,560
Well, and he sits down.

412
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,080
There's like the pew.

413
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:44,320
He just like scoots someone over and sits like right next to the aisle.

414
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,080
Rhubarb, rhubarb.

415
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:51,360
Jack Pearlman, I'm assuming was kind of like with him upon entering, but whenever he started

416
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,600
mouthing off and yelling, he kind of just like scooted sideways kind of a way to the,

417
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:02,800
the back of the, the church to kind of listen and not be associated with him at all.

418
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,760
Yeah, makes sense.

419
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,880
Professor Horace Green, any, uh, just like what's running through your head?

420
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,560
Horace Green is just reading a book.

421
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,280
And that, uh, yes, no, we'll definitely take care of that.

422
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:13,600
Sure.

423
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:19,040
As, as soon as we're done here, first thing that I look into for sure, but we're talking

424
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:25,920
about these disappearances and that is what we need to discuss now that we've got, uh,

425
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,840
Satan's last night of Ms.

426
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,280
Kitty out and about.

427
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,040
Grave Robin.

428
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,840
Kitty was grave Robin.

429
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,160
I seen her with my own two eyes.

430
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:37,920
Uh, yes.

431
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:44,640
And, and, and I too says thorough Sexton who's the nightwatch, the cemetery.

432
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,800
What'd you ever, what'd you dig up?

433
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,000
What'd you see her dig up?

434
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,720
It was three old, old bodies.

435
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,280
I run her off before she could get anything of mine.

436
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:53,840
Who was it?

437
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,360
Who'd you dig up?

438
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:55,840
Yeah.

439
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,560
Who, who'd you get from the cemetery over there?

440
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:06,400
It was, uh, Sally Jensen who, as we all know, pass God 30 years ago now.

441
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:12,000
Mitzi Frankenship, who unfortunately left us 34 years ago.

442
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:21,920
And Rebecca Feinsteem, Feinsteem, Rebecca Feinsteem, Steem.

443
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,400
I can't pronounce it.

444
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,520
It's a lot of consonants all in a row.

445
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:38,960
It's S T E I N F P F I E M P Z F.

446
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:45,600
I don't know how to say that, but she died 37 years ago.

447
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,840
She, she taught me in school.

448
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,560
I remember I had to spell her name.

449
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,600
It had every letter of the alphabet.

450
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:01,760
I'm sorry for your loss.

451
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:08,240
I tried to get to her, but, um, I'm a heavy sleeper.

452
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,880
So some of his kitty disappeared him or what?

453
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,640
Uh, yes, just seemingly.

454
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:22,240
So Ms. Kitty did come around and, uh, and it was taken by, she took three before she

455
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:27,200
headed off three from the cemetery for she headed off up to the pace place.

456
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,680
She must've dropped off them bodies somewhere along the way.

457
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,480
Cause she didn't have them.

458
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,440
When she came up to my place, what was she doing there?

459
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,920
She's trying to dig up Claire's grave.

460
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,160
Okay.

461
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:38,880
Let's go get her.

462
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,080
Go get her.

463
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:40,560
What?

464
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,920
You know where she is?

465
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,280
I figured you might.

466
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,400
What are we even here for?

467
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,640
If you don't know where she is, pardon, pardon, pardon me, judge.

468
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,320
But what do you mean by let's?

469
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:56,800
I mean, us, it doesn't really look like you're in much shape to get

470
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:00,160
anybody much less join a horse riding posse.

471
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:03,360
Ephraim stands up and points his gun at, at Horace.

472
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:07,360
Oh my God.

473
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,160
Speaking, I'm speaking as a biologist, sir.

474
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,000
You've seen me ride my horse.

475
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,280
You know, I can ride around.

476
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,600
I don't believe I have seen that, sir.

477
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,400
My mistake.

478
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,440
Shut the fuck up.

479
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,440
Let's go get her.

480
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:31,600
Shut the fuck up.

481
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,840
When judge says, shut the fuck up.

482
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:39,200
You see that, um, Bobby custard just puts both of his hands in the air.

483
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,000
Well, you guilty.

484
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,680
Oh, holy shit.

485
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,640
Oh my God.

486
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,480
It's going to kill everyone.

487
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:57,760
He's got mad monster.

488
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:02,960
It's just, it's the baddie.

489
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,040
Fuck.

490
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:16,880
And I holster my gun, get my flask out, take a drink of it, put it back and just sit down.

491
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,080
And the whole crowd goes.

492
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:23,360
And Jack Pearlman lets off of his pistol grip.

493
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:28,800
Like he had professor green starts nervously smoking a pipe.

494
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:30,640
Totally.

495
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:30,960
Okay.

496
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,400
Completely.

497
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:32,720
Okay.

498
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,760
No one bats an eye.

499
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,360
Everyone's down for it.

500
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,400
They enjoy the smell.

501
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:40,400
This is healthy for the nerves and invigorating for the lungs.

502
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:44,640
Everett this whole time has seemed unaffected by the whole situation is more confused than

503
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,520
anything else.

504
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,680
So are we, you know, where she is or we're going to get her.

505
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,640
What's going on?

506
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,320
Does anyone know?

507
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,760
Thorough is standing up again.

508
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,520
Does anyone know where she is?

509
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:56,560
Everett?

510
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,320
Where did you last see her?

511
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:02,080
She is running off in the tree line of the past behind my house.

512
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,200
I mean, south.

513
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,480
How long ago?

514
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,360
It was, it was last night.

515
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,200
I think it was about two in the morning.

516
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,240
I just made that up, Zach.

517
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,080
I don't know if that matters the time.

518
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,040
No, it was three in the morning.

519
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:15,840
It was late at night.

520
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,960
I didn't have my watch on me.

521
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:23,280
Perhaps the judge would like to lead us in searching for her trail out by a tree line.

522
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,880
Everybody roll spot hidden.

523
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,280
62 on a 65.

524
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,800
41 on a 45.

525
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,440
76 on a 40 fail.

526
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,760
I fail at 97 on a 45.

527
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,760
I'm a dinosaur hunter.

528
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,480
All I do is spot hidden bones.

529
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,440
That's my character.

530
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,600
Joe and Justin, take your headphones off.

531
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:03,040
Professor Horace Green and Judge Ephraim Cortland.

532
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:11,680
Around this time, you notice a man standing in one of the windows watching the proceedings

533
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,320
take place.

534
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:16,480
You recognize him immediately as Silas Cole.

535
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:21,120
This man has made contention what it is today.

536
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,720
He is the reason that the mine is profitable.

537
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:29,280
He is the reason that there's electricity all throughout the entire town.

538
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:35,600
He is the philanthropist making sure that children have education.

539
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,720
Him and his wife, Mary.

540
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,880
He's five foot eight.

541
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,960
He's got messy, dirty blonde hair.

542
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:48,000
His crooked yellow teeth and bright green eyes that are sunken in, but they're also

543
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,240
bulging a little bit.

544
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:56,080
And he's just paying very close attention to everything happening from a back window

545
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,120
of the church.

546
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,120
Uh, I run outside to go talk to him.

547
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,720
I'm gonna come after him, follow, see what the professor's up to.

548
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:10,400
Do I have time to talk briefly in private before the judge can ooze his way forward?

549
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,760
Yeah, let's do a little contest.

550
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:19,120
I believe there are some breakdowns in athletics in this game.

551
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:19,840
And so...

552
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:22,960
Oh, nope.

553
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:23,840
There are not.

554
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,440
I was completely wrong.

555
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,680
How would you run fast in this game?

556
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,680
Fast talk, but with your legs.

557
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,600
Pilot your own self.

558
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:31,920
Jump.

559
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,680
It's like a video game where if you jump, fast.

560
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,200
All right, we'll just use dexterity.

561
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,520
So roll a dexterity contest against each other.

562
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:43,760
Fail.

563
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,200
49 on a 40.

564
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:45,600
Fail.

565
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,800
73 on a 60.

566
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,880
Okay, so you're both going to make it out at the same time?

567
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,480
Stumbling over each other.

568
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,360
Yeah.

569
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:59,040
With Courtland leaving, there's a breath of fresh air inside as you both kind of bail

570
00:31:59,040 --> 00:31:59,680
outside.

571
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:07,680
Yes, now the smell of Judge Courtland has dissipated from his region.

572
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:13,120
And you make it out there and you see that Silas Cole is this man.

573
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,880
Just these massive eyes.

574
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,800
He's holding a ladder.

575
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:24,160
And right next to him, he has odd looking mechanical devices with some sort of like

576
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:29,120
wooden planks going off from a middle point on his body.

577
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:29,600
No, no, no.

578
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:35,760
On the ground next to him, he's got like three or four of these devices, essentially,

579
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:41,680
that have some sort of motor in the middle and then these planks coming off from them

580
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:44,240
and around his shoulder like a lasso.

581
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,000
He's got copper wiring.

582
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:51,280
Oh, well, Ephraim, we might have solved your problem.

583
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,200
He's wearing huge pants.

584
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:59,600
So he's wearing both suspenders and a belt.

585
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,400
Well, a chill runs down Thomas's spine.

586
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:07,040
As any beans getting in the mix can only mean trouble.

587
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:07,520
No, no, no.

588
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,040
This is Silas Cole.

589
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,240
I know, but clearly.

590
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:24,240
Mr. Cole, as you may know, I'm Professor Horace Green, and I sometimes pay your men to bring

591
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,440
me any fossils they might find in the mine.

592
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,440
I'm concerned about...

593
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,360
Why are you concerned?

594
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:38,400
One of your employees, Thomas, a young man who would bring me fossils.

595
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:45,920
I haven't been able to find him today, and he told me he had found something quite special.

596
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,080
Have you heard anything about Thomas?

597
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,680
Did anything happen to him in the mine?

598
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,800
No, he's completely avoiding eye contact with you.

599
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:00,480
His eyes are bugged out, looking at the ground, kind of looking at your feet.

600
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,480
And then he looks straight up at you, and he's like,

601
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,400
No, I don't...

602
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,160
Looks back down.

603
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,160
I don't know what you're talking about.

604
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,160
Did you create these devices?

605
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:11,540
Yeah.

606
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,160
I'm something of a man of science myself.

607
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:16,640
Could you explain the principle to me?

608
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:17,280
It spins.

609
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,840
I'll show you if we go inside, but did you...

610
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,760
This Thomas fellow, what do you know about him?

611
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,080
Well, I know he was a gambler.

612
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:33,840
Uh, I'm worried someone might have hurt him for his gambling debts.

613
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,960
Do you think that's why he's gone?

614
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,360
It could be, Mr. Cole.

615
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,960
Why do you think he's gone?

616
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,600
Probably the same reason that you said just now.

617
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,100
Indeed.

618
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:47,760
In all candor, Mr. Cole, I had heard you were quarreling with Thomas

619
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,680
the day before his disappearance.

620
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:50,640
Interesting.

621
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,320
What was that quarrel about?

622
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,480
He was down, uh, he didn't do his job.

623
00:34:54,800 --> 00:35:01,600
And you see Ephraim's like just finished packing some chew into his lip,

624
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,520
and he lights a hand-rolled cigarette.

625
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:10,640
He walks over to Silas and just grabs the copper wire off his shoulder.

626
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:15,760
Okay, so first off, I need psychology.

627
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,200
Yeah, go ahead and roll psychology.

628
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,600
Should have a points into that.

629
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,360
A 90 on a 10.

630
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,800
I got a lot of weird skills though.

631
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,640
43 out of 10.

632
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:28,720
Um, yeah, he wasn't, he wasn't doing his job right.

633
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,280
We had words, I'm glad he's working for you,

634
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:35,520
because he's not working for me now, obviously, because he's gone.

635
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:39,840
And then Judge Ephraim grabs the copper wiring or goes to,

636
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:45,280
and Silas Cole puts his opposite arm on the Judge's shoulder

637
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,440
and looks straight up into his eyes.

638
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,000
And you see these wild green bulging eyes looking at you.

639
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:58,800
Are you sure that you want to do that unless you're helping me?

640
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,080
Because it seemed like maybe you're not helping.

641
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:08,240
Your lights, your lights stopped working because it looks like you took my copper wire.

642
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,680
I would do no such thing.

643
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:13,360
If your lights aren't working there in the courthouse,

644
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:16,080
then I can get that working for you.

645
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,040
But these are for the church currently.

646
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:23,600
So please either help me carry them inside or release them.

647
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,360
Okay, when can you get them to mine?

648
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,840
I need it like now.

649
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,280
I can't do any work in the dark.

650
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,800
You're not there now.

651
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:37,120
And so let's go inside the church first.

652
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:39,920
Uh, Ephraim blows some smoke into his face,

653
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:43,520
grabs the copper wire and heads back into the church.

654
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:46,800
Horace Green, um, chews on his pipe a little bit

655
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,840
and blows some smoke into the air and turns around and goes back into the church.

656
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,000
And Silas Cole doesn't make a fucking move

657
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,520
the entire time either one of those actions are taken.

658
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,600
Let's bring the boys back.

659
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,880
Courtland and Green, do you want to describe in order

660
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,600
how you arrived back into the church?

661
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,960
Ephraim walks into the church, smoking a cigarette,

662
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:24,480
spits some chew spit on the ground and he's got copper wire over his shoulder

663
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:29,600
and he just throws a copper wire onto the ground and just kind of stands there.

664
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:34,560
Horace goes back to where he was sitting and opens up his book again,

665
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,280
but it doesn't really look like he's reading it now.

666
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,320
Cole's here.

667
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:43,200
And as soon as Courtland, Judge Courtland says Cole's here,

668
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:50,160
the doors bust open to the church and a skittish man looking at the ground in front of him

669
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:55,280
kind of seeing the copper wiring on the ground immediately starts collecting it

670
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:00,320
as he's pulling in these four odd contraptions you've never seen before.

671
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:04,720
Some sort of motor in the middle and then wooden planks coming off from the sides.

672
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:09,760
Silas Cole is five foot eight with messy dirty blonde hair.

673
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:15,760
He's got crooked yellow teeth and these bright green eyes that are sunken in

674
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,240
but also bulging at the same time.

675
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,080
And he's wearing huge pants.

676
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:25,360
He's got suspenders and a belt.

677
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,080
Holy shit.

678
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:30,720
Yeah, no.

679
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:31,620
Yeah.

680
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,720
Sorry, preacher there.

681
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,320
You're good.

682
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:36,880
Carry on.

683
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,920
I'm just gonna go ahead and hook these up for y'all.

684
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,400
It's pretty hot in here.

685
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,400
And this is the new one and kind of like holds a thumbs up.

686
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,240
Do we do this yet?

687
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,320
You guys get this?

688
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,920
Oh God, Zach.

689
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,440
You really do need to watch Dark.

690
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,640
I can't wait.

691
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,480
You found your wire.

692
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,080
No, he's got...

693
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:07,440
He said he didn't steal mine, but he's gonna help fix it, I hope.

694
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,640
Silas, do you know where Kitty is, Miss Kitty?

695
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:15,360
Silas Cole has already set up a ladder in the middle of the aisle and is all the way up

696
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:24,080
and is hooking up the very first ceiling fan that's ever existed here in the town of Contingent.

697
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,840
And he looks down at you and he's like,

698
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:30,400
I don't know who you're talking about.

699
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,880
We're all here because of some missing people.

700
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,360
Why didn't you come to the meeting?

701
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,760
Maybe you know something about it.

702
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,880
And Ephraim walks over to the ladder

703
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:45,840
and puts a hand on it and kind of like menacingly looks up at Silas.

704
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:48,400
I don't know anything about any missing people.

705
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:57,600
I'm just here to provide circulating air for the entire townsfolk here while I have contention.

706
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,960
Air's not good enough here.

707
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:06,480
Being right above you, the smell is not pleasant.

708
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:10,720
You hear a little harumph from Horace Green.

709
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:15,840
Ephraim just keeps staring up at him and he finishes putting in the first ceiling fan,

710
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,720
comes back down the ladder.

711
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,400
Are you like right at the base?

712
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:25,040
Like not to where he can't get down but where I'll be like right next to him when he gets down.

713
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:30,880
And then yeah he just looks you dead in the eyes with these wild crazed green eyes

714
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,840
and begins moving the ladder forward.

715
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:40,000
He runs the wire through real quick and sets it up and the first fan starts going.

716
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:47,680
And everyone in this room feels relief from this hot humid air for the first time.

717
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,800
And as he begins setting up the second one he looks down.

718
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:56,480
I don't think that the dearest appearances need to be looked into.

719
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,200
Personally, good riddance.

720
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,160
Contention's better off without those people.

721
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,600
That's not for you to decide.

722
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,840
That's literally my job.

723
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:10,400
Well, it kind of seems like we're here at a town hall meeting

724
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:14,160
to figure out what the next best move is.

725
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:19,200
Bobby Custard takes control once again and is like,

726
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,000
well yeah no that is about there they're right.

727
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:28,000
And you know with all this air flowing down I feel like it's about time to take a vote.

728
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,480
Oh shit that does feel pretty nice.

729
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,680
Hey when you fix up my lights you need to put one of these in.

730
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,920
Silas Cole looks at you.

731
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:39,040
I can make that happen.

732
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,480
We get to it then.

733
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:44,240
So nobody's looking into these disappearances?

734
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,880
I didn't even know about them until I showed up here.

735
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,600
I'm more concerned with that so.

736
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:53,360
Mr. Cole why don't you want us to look into these disappearances?

737
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,560
Completely ignores you.

738
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:59,440
And the crowd begins to continue to chatter and chatter and chatter

739
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:06,240
until their voices rise up meeting yours and your voice is lost as you say Mr. Cole.

740
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,040
Jack walks up to Bobby Custard.

741
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,200
Is it Custer or Custer?

742
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,880
Yep Bobby Custard.

743
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:17,040
And he walks up to him he's like you better get control of this crowd now

744
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:20,240
if you want anything to be done hand on shoulder.

745
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:27,840
I mean I think looking up at Silas Cole who's putting up the final ceiling fan in the church.

746
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,520
I I think we're good probably.

747
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:35,440
You're gonna tell me one of us goes missing.

748
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:39,680
A couple ceiling fans will do the trick you don't want to look for us.

749
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:44,720
As I say that I'm gripping him ever so slightly more aggressively.

750
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:45,520
Roll intimidate.

751
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:49,840
Uh do not pass.

752
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:55,760
Bobby just kind of like shirks off of you as Everett Pace approaches.

753
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:59,600
Bobby I I don't know much about what's going on here but if there's a grave

754
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:02,160
robber on the loose we're gonna have to stop that.

755
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:05,200
They'll just keep coming night after night taking all the bodies.

756
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,880
Horace is pushing his way up too.

757
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:14,480
Sheriff I overheard a minor last night um saying that one of the disappeared had been

758
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:15,680
arguing with Mr. Cole.

759
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:19,280
Now I seem to think he's he's got an ulterior mold of fear.

760
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,880
Don't just let these people disappear because he gave you some fans.

761
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,480
Ephraim's looking up at the fans and then looks down and sees

762
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:30,080
these three talking to Bobby and waddles over there.

763
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:35,760
Now I I it's not that I'm not doing anything because there's fans here it's just that

764
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:41,360
I'm not doing anything because people don't seem too upset except for maybe the three

765
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:48,400
of you and if if we don't know where this person who clearly disappeared and then somehow

766
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,440
came back.

767
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:54,000
If we don't know where to go after her then I don't know what you expect me to do.

768
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,640
Well it sounds to me like she's got something in the woods there.

769
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:57,840
She had three bodies.

770
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:59,600
She didn't have three bodies when I saw her.

771
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,760
She dropped them off somewhere between here and there.

772
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,680
We got to search around between here and there.

773
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:07,520
And that's what Judge Courtland hears as he approaches.

774
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,560
I forgot about this damn body sir.

775
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:14,240
Sheriff what are you planning on doing about about that?

776
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,960
Because you know you got to do your job so I can do mine.

777
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:21,760
He looks over all of your shoulders at Silas Cole.

778
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:26,320
Thanks Mr. Cole we certainly do appreciate it here.

779
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:30,800
I I slap him like with my walking stick in the shin when he does that.

780
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:40,880
Now I now I certainly don't want to step on any toes here of the man who essentially

781
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:45,200
owns and runs this town if you guys catch my drift.

782
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:53,040
But if you happen to have plans aka Mr. Pace going down to the woods trying to find a spot

783
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:59,920
in between the two spots I'll certainly come with you if if you if you if you require my

784
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:06,720
assistance but if we could keep it on the down low from Mr. Cole clearly I think that

785
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,960
would be the best course of action.

786
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:13,200
So maybe don't all stand around here all at the same time.

787
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,320
I get it yeah.

788
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:18,400
Jack turns around and just starts walking out puts his hat back on his head or whatever.

789
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:23,520
Not all at once but let's pretend like we're dissatisfied and after Jack's gone away like

790
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:27,600
a little bit then the professor turns around too and he's like he looks like he did not

791
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,440
get what he wanted from the from the sheriff.

792
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:35,920
No I I promise I'm doing my job y'all just need to you know calm down about the whole

793
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,280
situation.

794
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:43,040
Uh Ephraim looks at Everett and looks at Bobby he's like I don't see any reason to piss

795
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:46,320
him off till I get one of them fans so uh yeah.

796
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:54,400
And then I make a big show of spitting on Bobby's shoes and slowly turn around and

797
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:55,120
walk off.

798
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:57,520
Bobby looks directly at Everett Pace.

799
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:01,040
He didn't have to he didn't have to spit on my shoes like that.

800
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:10,720
Everett grabs the preacher by the shoulder and pulls him in real tight close to his ear.

801
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:16,640
We're gonna find that grave robber and if something happens to Clara's grave before

802
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:20,320
we do it's you that I'm blaming.

803
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:21,520
And he starts walking away.

804
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:22,560
Nice.

805
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:23,600
Sick.

806
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:24,880
Fuck yeah.

807
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:25,920
What a creepo.

808
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:29,280
Oh I love Everett Pace.

809
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,200
What a horrifying creature.

810
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,920
You guys all made dope characters.

811
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:34,560
Big fan.

812
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:37,680
Horrified of what you're capable of.

813
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:46,800
As characters you're curious as to the the uh the thoughts.

814
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:49,520
I think Everett is kind of on the surface right now.

815
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:54,400
He's he's worried about his the grave on his property there and uh you know doesn't

816
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:55,520
really know what's going on.

817
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:59,200
He kind of removes himself from the town's affairs normally so

818
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,440
it's just that this ended up on his doorstep.

819
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:06,240
Horace typically wouldn't care to get involved either but he can't resist a conundrum.

820
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:10,080
Courtland didn't expect to get wrapped into any of this he just wanted his

821
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:14,880
lights on and but he he really does love stringing up a

822
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:18,400
a criminal so he gets excited at the thought of catching one.

823
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:22,560
Horrifying.

824
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:27,600
Jack Pearlman probably was uh less invested before he got pissed off by

825
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:30,960
Judge and Silas Cole kind of just being assholes.

826
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:37,040
Which is funny because at first he was pissed off at the Judge for being an a jerk to Silas

827
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:41,920
Cole and that he was way more pissed off at Silas Cole implying that they should do nothing.

828
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:46,560
And it kind of lit a little fire underneath him as a citizen of contention.

829
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:47,600
Under his little butt.

830
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:49,920
Under his little hot buns.

831
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:51,760
Under his tight little butt.

832
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:58,640
So yeah he I think he would he's definitely he's a little on fire right now like he's like angry

833
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:03,440
but it's trying to direct trying to direct it in a way to do something instead of just

834
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:04,400
punching somebody.

835
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:11,920
Maybe a change of pace for old Jack Pearlman.

836
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:14,080
I love Everett Pace with all my heart.

837
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:20,080
And uh I think Jack Pearlman and Everett Pace are gonna get fanfic'd together.

838
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:21,360
I can predict it already.

839
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:23,280
Ship him.

840
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:24,000
Ship him.

841
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,440
Yeah we're both you know we both are living alone on our.

842
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,200
Your couple's name could be Jace.

843
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:32,500
Oh.

844
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:34,180
Jevret.

845
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:37,040
Or Earlman.

846
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:40,900
Pervert?

847
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:42,240
There it is.

848
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:44,880
Pervert.

849
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:47,760
Nailed it.

850
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:48,320
Nice.

851
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:56,320
As the crowd dissipates from the church and heads to their respective daily goings-ons

852
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:04,240
you see Silas Cole walking down south to the new mine where they've set up shop after the one

853
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:08,160
a little bit west of there has finished up.

854
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:10,480
Started a new dig site further south.

855
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:19,600
And the four of you kind of reconvene with the sheriff, the preacher, Bobby Custard,

856
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:22,480
and Professor Horace Green steps right up.

857
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:26,560
So father sheriff when when do we go looking for for Miss Kitty?

858
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:29,520
I mean are y'all free now?

859
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:30,480
Yes.

860
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:36,000
Since we have the daylight it seems like if she's out there robbing graves it seems like

861
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:42,640
a scary time to maybe look for her now but you know by nightfall maybe we'll have a better

862
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:47,600
sense of where she's heading and then we'll be able to catch her in the act if you will.

863
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:54,080
Perhaps hopefully we see I feel like the daylight is the less scary time to look for the grave

864
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:58,720
robber and we would like to find her before she commits the act again you know ideally.

865
00:49:58,720 --> 00:49:59,840
Is that not what I said?

866
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:02,720
I don't think so.

867
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:06,320
Okay you were very smart and I agree.

868
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:06,800
Let's go.

869
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,800
So if we if we were we gonna go look in the woods for her or?

870
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,880
Well I tell you my place is right there.

871
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:17,840
The cemetery is right there so let's go right there.

872
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:21,520
And I point I just like drew a line between the two and pointed to the middle.

873
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:29,600
Well if we're gonna look for her now I'm I'm okay with that has been a while since I

874
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:34,080
uh left anything on Ruth and Cassie's graves so.

875
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:37,360
He's gonna softball it in there like that?

876
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:39,520
It's my wife and daughter.

877
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:41,600
Fresh graves you say?

878
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:51,120
I ain't got no tracking skills but I'll help maybe maybe not who can say.

879
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:54,560
Oh oh tracking skills that's what we need anybody got any of those?

880
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:58,080
I know but I can spot hidden things and I can

881
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:02,400
navigate and I have a great understanding of the natural world.

882
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:05,360
Ah the natural world that's something I know about too.

883
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:06,160
Yeah me too.

884
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:14,480
You know perhaps we need to dig or excavate uh to solve this grave robbing mystery I.

885
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:17,200
Sheriff now you must uh surely be.

886
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:21,680
I'm finding myself less and less knowledgeable about the natural world

887
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:24,640
and more and more knowledgeable about tracking.

888
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:26,160
That's what I was hoping you'd say.

889
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:32,000
You you're uh you hunt quite a bit don't you Sheriff?

890
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:36,480
You seem like you might join us on Midian Adventure here in the future.

891
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:40,960
Of course it's his job to guide lost souls through the wilderness.

892
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:44,000
Yeah we just decided that you're an expert tracker.

893
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:49,120
And that nice raccoon that raccoon hat you're wearing you

894
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:51,360
must have got that from tracking and trapping it.

895
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:58,320
And he just pets it and then he makes a purring sound for it.

896
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:01,840
I hate that I stopped doing that.

897
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:08,880
I'll probably find an ending in there somewhere.

898
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:18,000
Hey by the way Sheriff you got any new people I need to on the docket I should look at?

899
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,880
I didn't have time because the the lights were off.

900
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:24,160
No no the episode's over now okay.

901
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:26,800
Stop it.

902
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:30,000
Stop rolling with it.

903
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:30,640
I'm off the clock.

904
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,280
I said I met that acting.

905
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:35,280
We normally don't do outros.

906
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:43,440
That that that this was episode 91 of pretending to be people.

907
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:46,000
Oh yes yes y'all come back now you hear?
