Hello friends engulfed in flames, it's your local firefighter Wolf the Dog and I'm here

00:06.160 --> 00:11.960
to spray your burning bodies down with all the hot gossip and news from Contingent at

00:11.960 --> 00:15.960
694.2 BTBP my babies.

00:15.960 --> 00:22.400
Now this week on Howlin with Wolf, your firefighter Wolf the Dog read some dope shit on the Glass

00:22.400 --> 00:32.780
Canon Podcast subreddit, user BFEvans19 recommended 694.2 BTBP writing, among other lovely things

00:32.780 --> 00:38.180
they quote, wanted to bring these guys to everyone's attention because I think they

00:38.180 --> 00:44.780
bring the same energy to gaming that the GCP does and I expect that a lot of GCP fans would

00:44.780 --> 00:51.300
also enjoy pretending to be people, y'all that shit means so much to your living Lexington

00:51.300 --> 00:52.820
Wolf the Dog.

00:52.820 --> 00:56.700
Speaking of tragedy, it's time for the news.

00:56.700 --> 01:02.140
Last time was basically combat from the time the Robotman blasted the door from its frame,

01:02.140 --> 01:07.780
to when the Robotman almost cut off Officer Bishop's arm, to when the Robotman froze at

01:07.780 --> 01:13.260
the command of Officer Pettymore, to when the Robotman's torso flew out the window gripping

01:13.260 --> 01:15.260
the throat of Officer Vigna.

01:15.260 --> 01:21.700
Thank beans, he poked that terminator top in the eye just in time to escape before the

01:21.700 --> 01:24.820
metal fella exploded like fireworks.

01:24.820 --> 01:30.660
Speaking of fireworks, we got a musical mortar for y'all today and they're here to blow y'all's

01:30.660 --> 01:37.060
brains up with their sound, it's kudzu with no backbone.

01:45.260 --> 01:55.340
You got shit on your balls?

01:55.340 --> 01:58.540
I got shit on my balls, you're exactly right.

01:58.540 --> 01:59.540
I was leaning forward.

01:59.540 --> 02:00.540
That's good luck.

02:00.540 --> 02:01.540
Yeah.

02:01.540 --> 02:05.300
Well, it took me like three wipes of just my balls to get the poop off of them.

02:05.300 --> 02:10.180
Because it like hit full on, I was like, oh, I don't know that that has ever happened to

02:10.180 --> 02:11.180
me before.

02:11.180 --> 02:14.500
I think it's because it's a hot day and I'm wearing black jeans, so I had long balls.

02:14.740 --> 02:19.860
I got two Cadbury eggs today.

02:19.860 --> 02:25.940
At the end of the last episode, the large metal man's torso unattached from its lower

02:25.940 --> 02:31.300
half and a small jetpack began shooting flames from the bottom of its torso.

02:31.300 --> 02:36.220
It grabbed Keith by the throat and flew through the window of the living room into the front

02:36.220 --> 02:37.220
yard.

02:37.220 --> 02:41.580
Keith bit into the mechanical hand and two of his teeth broke off.

02:41.580 --> 02:44.140
Keith then poked its one good eye.

02:44.140 --> 02:48.940
The thing dropped Keith onto the front lawn and then flew up into the night sky where

02:48.940 --> 02:52.100
it exploded like fireworks.

02:52.100 --> 02:53.100
What do you do?

02:53.100 --> 02:58.780
I cheer because I love fireworks.

02:58.780 --> 03:02.100
I think I just moan in pain for a while.

03:02.100 --> 03:03.100
Yeah.

03:03.100 --> 03:06.900
I might be real close to passing out from pain.

03:06.900 --> 03:12.540
I try to get up off the ground, but having, I assume my ribs broken from that crowbar

03:12.540 --> 03:24.580
and then dropped on the ground, I lay down and just kind of like, oh, and just like,

03:24.580 --> 03:28.300
if you can in post, just repeat that like eight or nine times.

03:28.300 --> 03:30.580
That's what I do.

03:30.580 --> 03:32.980
You need to role play that.

03:32.980 --> 03:33.980
Don't though.

03:33.980 --> 03:34.980
Yeah, please don't.

03:35.220 --> 03:38.260
I want to make my way to the front window and just look out.

03:38.260 --> 03:41.180
Keith, Keith, you out there?

03:41.180 --> 03:42.180
Hey.

03:42.180 --> 03:43.180
Oh good.

03:43.180 --> 03:44.180
It didn't take you.

03:44.180 --> 03:45.180
I'm okay.

03:45.180 --> 03:50.740
As you look out, the window is completely broken open and you know, some wind is hitting

03:50.740 --> 03:57.660
the curtains and blowing them about and the cool night air is blowing in on your face

03:57.660 --> 04:03.340
and you're now, after all of the adrenaline of the situation, you all are starting to

04:03.340 --> 04:09.820
feel the extreme pain this metal man has put you through.

04:09.820 --> 04:10.980
Ow!

04:10.980 --> 04:13.780
That metal man put me through extreme pain.

04:13.780 --> 04:18.300
Would first aid help me at all since I'm not like bleeding or anything, I'm just...

04:18.300 --> 04:23.260
You're also just like laying in a yard so you don't really have anything with you.

04:23.260 --> 04:24.260
That's true.

04:24.260 --> 04:28.220
I want to pull my shirt off and try and first aid my arm with it.

04:28.220 --> 04:31.140
All right, go ahead and roll first aid for me.

04:32.140 --> 04:33.140
Uh, fail.

04:33.140 --> 04:34.540
71 on a 30.

04:34.540 --> 04:35.540
Okay.

04:35.540 --> 04:38.140
So I just casually drape it over the blood.

04:38.140 --> 04:44.340
I would like to pull off my cell phone and call the EMTs and have them roll first aid

04:44.340 --> 04:45.340
on us.

04:45.340 --> 04:46.780
That makes sense.

04:46.780 --> 04:52.260
I'm going to get up on my feet out of the yard and try to, as quickly as I can, get

04:52.260 --> 04:53.700
into the house or close to the house.

04:53.700 --> 04:59.060
That way any falling debris doesn't hit me from the beautiful explosion that just happened

04:59.060 --> 05:00.060
above me.

05:00.060 --> 05:01.060
Absolutely.

05:01.980 --> 05:09.540
I'm going to go inside and I see Clark attempting to do his arm up and I'm going to go up to

05:09.540 --> 05:13.180
him, grab his shirt, and try to finish what he started.

05:16.180 --> 05:18.180
I got a 31 on a 60 for first aid.

05:18.180 --> 05:20.180
All right, roll a d4.

05:20.180 --> 05:21.180
Pyramid.

05:23.180 --> 05:24.180
Clark, you get three.

05:24.180 --> 05:25.180
Three hit points back.

05:25.180 --> 05:27.180
It's feeling better already.

05:27.180 --> 05:28.180
Thank you.

05:28.180 --> 05:29.180
Thank you.

05:29.180 --> 05:30.180
You owe me.

05:30.300 --> 05:32.980
That's what any a contention PD officer would do.

05:32.980 --> 05:33.980
I would hope.

05:33.980 --> 05:36.580
I feel like I'm at about seven health.

05:36.580 --> 05:40.620
It's just barely above me, Clark.

05:40.620 --> 05:46.180
And I start to laugh and then immediately my ribs just hurt and I lay on the ground.

05:46.180 --> 05:47.180
John!

05:47.180 --> 05:49.620
John, you okay?

05:49.620 --> 05:51.180
He's like five feet away from you.

05:51.180 --> 05:52.180
Oh.

05:52.180 --> 05:53.180
No.

05:53.180 --> 05:54.180
No.

05:54.180 --> 05:55.180
What about you?

05:55.180 --> 05:56.180
Keith, patch me up.

05:56.180 --> 05:57.760
Keith, go see if you can help him.

05:57.760 --> 05:58.760
Help me up.

06:01.180 --> 06:02.180
Grab my left arm.

06:02.180 --> 06:04.180
I use my good arm.

06:04.180 --> 06:07.180
Guys, you can just stay there, the EMTs are coming.

06:07.180 --> 06:09.280
Wait, what's wrong with you?

06:09.280 --> 06:11.380
I was attacked by a giant metal man.

06:11.380 --> 06:12.900
Yeah, I mean we all were.

06:12.900 --> 06:17.100
What happened specifically to you so that I can first aid you and maybe get you a couple

06:17.100 --> 06:18.260
hit points back?

06:18.260 --> 06:22.220
He tried to pinch my ribs together, but a lucky surgical screw.

06:22.260 --> 06:30.060
I believe there's actually still a hand, a metal hand halfway inside John Lee Pettymore's

06:30.060 --> 06:31.060
side.

06:31.060 --> 06:35.460
Yeah, so instead of answering, I just point to the metal hand sticking in on my side.

06:35.460 --> 06:38.100
Can I tell, is it like broken the skin or is it like...

06:38.100 --> 06:39.100
Yes.

06:39.100 --> 06:40.100
There's a hand in me.

06:40.100 --> 06:41.100
Okay.

06:41.100 --> 06:42.100
Tried to make me its puppet.

06:42.100 --> 06:45.780
I am going to attempt first aid on him as well.

06:45.780 --> 06:47.820
I would like to wait for the EMTs.

06:47.820 --> 06:51.620
Yeah, you should probably wait for the EMTs.

06:52.620 --> 06:57.940
Keith, no offense man, but I want the professionals to remove this hand from my side.

06:57.940 --> 06:58.940
That's yeah, I agree.

06:58.940 --> 07:02.020
Yeah, I'm going to wait for them too because there's nothing.

07:02.020 --> 07:05.100
I look down at my side, my just side is bruised.

07:05.100 --> 07:11.020
I can walk, but it hurts to move my arms and to laugh, which is something I love doing.

07:11.020 --> 07:12.020
Did you guys see a robot?

07:12.020 --> 07:13.020
That was a robot.

07:13.020 --> 07:18.680
I mean, I watched him fly up into the sky and explode like a beautiful firework.

07:18.680 --> 07:20.620
So either he was a robot or...

07:20.620 --> 07:24.980
I'm pretty good at his job as a firework technician.

07:24.980 --> 07:27.340
Can you guys all roll sanity for me?

07:27.340 --> 07:30.780
Ooh, I crit pass.

07:30.780 --> 07:31.780
I crit pass.

07:31.780 --> 07:32.780
Shit.

07:32.780 --> 07:37.060
This isn't the first time I've confronted the terrifying truth about robots in our world.

07:37.060 --> 07:38.060
Ooh, pass.

07:38.060 --> 07:39.060
14.

07:39.060 --> 07:40.060
I failed.

07:40.060 --> 07:41.060
Okay.

07:41.060 --> 07:42.060
Because I was first hand.

07:42.060 --> 07:43.060
Saw it.

07:43.060 --> 07:44.060
Clark, you lose.

07:44.060 --> 07:45.060
No sanity.

07:45.060 --> 07:46.060
I get it first hand.

07:46.060 --> 07:47.060
Nice.

07:47.060 --> 07:48.060
Right, John Lee?

07:48.060 --> 07:49.060
First hand.

07:49.060 --> 07:50.060
Yeah, I get it buddy.

07:50.500 --> 07:51.900
I'm gonna lose one sanity.

07:51.900 --> 07:56.220
And Keith, if you could roll a D6 and have it for me.

07:56.220 --> 07:57.220
One.

07:57.220 --> 08:01.740
I love fireworks, so I was more just stoked than scared.

08:01.740 --> 08:07.260
Before the EMTs get over here, I do want to go sit down at that piano, play a little chopsticks.

08:07.260 --> 08:13.620
When you walk over and sit down at the piano, you start playing it, but no sound comes out.

08:13.620 --> 08:18.940
And when you kind of lean forward and looking inside, there are no strings inside this piano.

08:19.020 --> 08:21.820
Can I do a search to see what I do see?

08:21.820 --> 08:22.820
Yeah.

08:22.820 --> 08:26.380
What do I see?

08:26.380 --> 08:28.820
You see no strings inside the piano.

08:28.820 --> 08:30.540
He rolled an 80 on his search.

08:30.540 --> 08:33.060
You see the inside of a piano.

08:33.060 --> 08:34.540
Is this a guitar?

08:34.540 --> 08:39.860
So I want to stand up and I want to open the bench that I'm sitting on.

08:39.860 --> 08:41.340
Ooh, nice.

08:41.340 --> 08:42.580
As a piano player.

08:42.580 --> 08:46.340
Yeah, I know a couple piano songs.

08:46.340 --> 08:49.660
I saw Billy Joel and Elton John on tour.

08:49.660 --> 08:57.300
There is sheet music for a song entitled The Rise of the End.

08:57.300 --> 09:00.380
Can I put the sheet music up and attempt to play it?

09:00.380 --> 09:02.180
Yeah, I'd do that.

09:02.180 --> 09:07.540
You kind of remember reading music and you can kind of plunk around on this thing, but

09:07.540 --> 09:12.660
it's honestly, it's really hard to play music when you can't hear the music.

09:12.660 --> 09:13.820
Is there anything else in the bench?

09:13.820 --> 09:15.500
No, it's just that one piece.

09:15.540 --> 09:19.500
I want to hobble over to the coffee table and you mentioned there's a tube.

09:19.500 --> 09:20.500
Yes.

09:20.500 --> 09:22.500
I want to look at that tube.

09:22.500 --> 09:26.620
Looking at the plastic tube, you see that there's a cap on one end that screws off.

09:26.620 --> 09:29.420
I'm going to do that very slowly.

09:29.420 --> 09:30.420
Okay.

09:30.420 --> 09:31.820
Snakes pop out.

09:31.820 --> 09:32.820
Exactly.

09:32.820 --> 09:37.780
I thought it was peanuts.

09:37.780 --> 09:42.100
Inside is just a rolled up paper, a bunch of paper that's all rolled up.

09:42.100 --> 09:45.740
I want to unfurl it and glean what I can real quick.

09:45.740 --> 09:53.260
When you unfurl it, you see these are blueprints for a place called Calm Comfy Campground.

09:53.260 --> 09:54.260
Blueprints.

09:54.260 --> 10:01.700
It looks like there is a large lake noted that it is called Lake Calm with an island

10:01.700 --> 10:02.700
on it.

10:02.700 --> 10:04.700
It's spelled with C's, right?

10:04.700 --> 10:05.700
Yes.

10:06.380 --> 10:13.700
On the island is one large building with six small buildings surrounding it.

10:13.700 --> 10:14.700
Ew.

10:14.700 --> 10:15.700
Ew.

10:15.700 --> 10:16.700
Call back.

10:16.700 --> 10:17.700
Comedy, right there.

10:17.700 --> 10:18.700
No, it's mystery.

10:18.700 --> 10:19.700
We're a mystery podcast.

10:19.700 --> 10:20.700
They're very similar.

10:20.700 --> 10:21.700
Yeah, this isn't funny.

10:21.700 --> 10:31.900
We're not supposed to be funny, Luke, and many would say we're not.

10:31.900 --> 10:33.660
I want to check on Randy Angst.

10:33.660 --> 10:34.660
Okay.

10:34.660 --> 10:44.180
As you go to the bathroom, you see an elderly man laying in the bathtub with a beautiful

10:44.180 --> 10:52.060
three piece blue suit on his upper body and no clothes on his lower body.

10:52.060 --> 10:55.260
Hey, Randy, did you poop those suit pants?

10:55.260 --> 11:04.460
When you speak, he kind of like twitches and it smells vile in here and you can kind of

11:04.460 --> 11:07.180
see that the bathtub is a bit dirty.

11:07.180 --> 11:15.020
Yeah, Randy, I'd love to give you a hand, but listen, I think it's a good thing you're

11:15.020 --> 11:16.020
in that bathtub, buddy.

11:16.020 --> 11:17.900
We're going to scare you up another change of clothes.

11:17.900 --> 11:23.620
Why don't you just get everything on you wet and scrub that all off and we'll talk in a

11:23.620 --> 11:24.620
minute.

11:24.620 --> 11:25.620
Okay?

11:25.620 --> 11:26.620
Okay.

11:26.620 --> 11:27.620
Does the water still work?

11:27.620 --> 11:30.740
Did artillery shells take that out or just give that faucet?

11:30.740 --> 11:32.020
Just try to wash the shit off yourself.

11:32.020 --> 11:33.020
Oh, no.

11:33.020 --> 11:34.020
It doesn't look like it.

11:34.580 --> 11:35.580
It's getting hot very quickly.

11:35.580 --> 11:36.580
Okay.

11:36.580 --> 11:37.580
Well, there you go.

11:37.580 --> 11:38.580
Hot shit water.

11:38.580 --> 11:39.580
It smells great now.

11:39.580 --> 11:40.580
The aroma.

11:40.580 --> 11:41.580
Good luck, Randy.

11:41.580 --> 11:42.580
I closed the door.

11:42.580 --> 11:43.580
All right.

11:43.580 --> 11:45.580
Maybe hit that fan on the way out.

11:45.580 --> 11:49.940
When we first came in here, we just looked around the living room and then shit kind

11:49.940 --> 11:50.940
of hit the fan.

11:50.940 --> 11:54.620
I want to explore the house a little more and see if I can find any like specifically

11:54.620 --> 11:55.620
an office.

11:55.620 --> 11:56.620
Maybe.

11:56.620 --> 11:57.620
Gotcha.

11:57.620 --> 12:02.660
Was there a fan in Randy's pants because he shit his pants twice.

12:02.820 --> 12:03.820
Oh, man.

12:03.820 --> 12:04.820
Wow.

12:04.820 --> 12:05.820
Yeah.

12:05.820 --> 12:06.820
That was a weaving avenue.

12:06.820 --> 12:07.820
Cut that out.

12:07.820 --> 12:08.820
Yeah.

12:08.820 --> 12:09.820
Whew.

12:09.820 --> 12:10.820
Not a joke.

12:10.820 --> 12:16.380
That was pretty good, guys.

12:16.380 --> 12:20.420
You know, the last session was really good, so this makes sense.

12:20.420 --> 12:21.420
Yeah, it's okay.

12:21.420 --> 12:25.500
It's okay if this one sucks.

12:25.500 --> 12:31.740
So walking around the rest of the house, it's a really nice house, but it's not that big.

12:31.820 --> 12:35.820
It's only one story and there's no basement to it.

12:35.820 --> 12:38.540
It's a two bedroom, two bath.

12:38.540 --> 12:40.700
Everything is fucking immaculate.

12:40.700 --> 12:42.540
This is an extremely clean house.

12:42.540 --> 12:50.860
As you're going through stuff, it looks like James, who lived here, lived very minimalistically.

12:50.860 --> 12:55.700
Except he's got a statue with a tuxedo and a suit of armor and a giant rose painting

12:55.700 --> 12:56.700
and a piano.

12:56.700 --> 12:57.700
Yeah.

12:57.700 --> 12:58.700
He spent all of his money on nice things.

12:58.700 --> 13:01.420
He didn't stand out starkly in contrast to his minimalized stuff.

13:01.420 --> 13:05.820
He has no furniture, just impressive for us all right.

13:05.820 --> 13:06.820
He was a collector.

13:06.820 --> 13:10.740
Clark, I don't know if you've ever thought about getting into contention real estate,

13:10.740 --> 13:13.580
but this place is now officially a fixer-upper.

13:13.580 --> 13:14.580
The owner's dead.

13:14.580 --> 13:18.620
We've got the estate agent in the bathtub with shit all over his pants.

13:18.620 --> 13:20.620
I think we could negotiate a pretty good deal on this if you ever want to.

13:20.620 --> 13:22.620
Yeah, all you got to do is rebuild the entire home.

13:22.620 --> 13:25.180
Keith, I'm not trying to get in on ... I'm sorry, man.

13:25.180 --> 13:26.460
I don't want to buy a house with you.

13:26.460 --> 13:28.860
Clark, if you want to buy a house, man, I think we should look in on this.

13:28.860 --> 13:30.020
You want to flip it with me?

13:30.020 --> 13:31.020
I want to flip this, yeah.

13:31.020 --> 13:36.620
I don't know how to ... I don't know anything about houses, so I don't find anything that

13:36.620 --> 13:38.860
would pertain to maybe his work at the mill?

13:38.860 --> 13:39.860
No, nothing.

13:39.860 --> 13:40.860
Okay.

13:40.860 --> 13:41.860
Yeah.

13:41.860 --> 13:46.780
No, this is ... Honestly, it's pretty weird how bare and spartan the rest of this house

13:46.780 --> 13:47.780
is.

13:47.780 --> 13:49.540
I'm going to set fire to this fucking place.

13:49.540 --> 13:50.540
You think so?

13:50.540 --> 13:52.660
Not until we own it.

13:52.660 --> 13:55.980
I was personally thinking when you guys were talking about flipping this house, John would

13:55.980 --> 13:57.560
probably know how to fix it.

13:57.560 --> 14:04.300
My guess is that Clark has a pretty dope savings account because he seems to not spend his

14:04.300 --> 14:05.500
money on anything.

14:05.500 --> 14:06.500
Yeah.

14:06.500 --> 14:07.500
Yeah.

14:07.500 --> 14:12.100
I come up, I'm like, guys, is this really what we want to be focusing on right now?

14:12.100 --> 14:13.380
You're all bleeding everywhere.

14:13.380 --> 14:15.300
I put my hands on my head.

14:15.300 --> 14:21.600
John, I do distinctly remember you hours ago saying the only way to fix this situation

14:21.600 --> 14:22.600
is to solve.

14:22.600 --> 14:24.740
Hell yeah, man, but look where we are.

14:24.740 --> 14:26.460
You got to keep your mind open to possibilities.

14:26.460 --> 14:28.020
You just got to keep thinking.

14:28.020 --> 14:34.380
Who is going to buy a house from two contingent PD officers if we don't solve this case?

14:34.380 --> 14:35.380
Nobody.

14:35.380 --> 14:36.380
All right.

14:36.380 --> 14:37.740
That's the smartest thing you've ever said.

14:37.740 --> 14:38.740
I agree.

14:38.740 --> 14:39.740
I'm not a smart man.

14:39.740 --> 14:43.580
I know what house flipping is.

14:43.580 --> 14:47.940
That's where you're not ... You just turn it over, right?

14:47.940 --> 14:49.420
It's like raising a barn.

14:49.420 --> 14:51.940
It's like ... In reverse.

14:51.940 --> 14:54.260
You know how you got to get tires rotated?

14:54.260 --> 14:57.420
Raising a barn, not in reverse, but in a 90 degree angle.

14:57.420 --> 14:58.420
House flipping, yeah.

14:58.420 --> 14:59.420
You flip that on its own.

14:59.420 --> 15:03.380
Actually, house flipping shows would be so much more fucking popular than they are if

15:03.380 --> 15:05.100
they actually just flip the house, yeah.

15:05.100 --> 15:08.180
Do you guys remember when you were a kid, you saw people move houses?

15:08.180 --> 15:09.180
Did you ever see that?

15:09.180 --> 15:10.180
Yeah, we moved houses.

15:10.180 --> 15:11.180
When they moved it off.

15:11.180 --> 15:12.180
Doing the big, yeah.

15:12.180 --> 15:13.180
That's insane.

15:13.180 --> 15:14.180
Yeah, where they get the foundation or whatever of.

15:14.180 --> 15:16.980
How do they fucking do that, and why don't I see that more often these days?

15:16.980 --> 15:17.980
I don't know.

15:17.980 --> 15:18.980
I used to see it all the time.

15:18.980 --> 15:19.980
I feel like I saw it a lot when I was a kid.

15:19.980 --> 15:24.220
I feel like now it's just, I don't know, something about the bubble market, man.

15:24.220 --> 15:25.220
The housing bubble, maybe.

15:25.220 --> 15:26.220
Yeah, the market.

15:26.220 --> 15:30.900
Oh, because they had a bubble around the houses, and now the housing bubble bubble popped,

15:30.900 --> 15:33.860
and now you can't do that anymore, because if it falls off the trailer, the bubble can't

15:33.860 --> 15:34.860
protect it.

15:34.860 --> 15:35.860
The bubble can't protect it.

15:35.860 --> 15:36.860
You're right.

15:36.860 --> 15:37.860
That's it.

15:37.860 --> 15:41.060
When I was a kid, I used to always think in any room that I was in, how I would leave

15:41.060 --> 15:43.780
that room if the room was upside down.

15:43.780 --> 15:44.780
Oh, cool.

15:44.780 --> 15:45.780
That's fun.

15:45.780 --> 15:48.180
That's dope.

15:48.180 --> 15:49.180
Through the door.

15:49.180 --> 15:50.180
Yeah.

15:50.180 --> 15:51.180
Yeah.

15:52.180 --> 15:56.900
It's almost always a doorway.

15:56.900 --> 15:57.900
It's like-

15:57.900 --> 16:01.580
We all stop to look around the room we're in, and it's just like, oh, you just have

16:01.580 --> 16:03.100
to reach up a little bit higher for the doorknob.

16:03.100 --> 16:06.380
Higher for the doorknob, and then step over the exit of the doorway.

16:06.380 --> 16:10.940
If you're like a five or six year old, you could probably reach that.

16:10.940 --> 16:11.940
It would be a leap.

16:11.940 --> 16:12.940
If you were in a foyer, too.

16:12.940 --> 16:13.940
Oh, yeah.

16:13.940 --> 16:14.940
Yeah, sure.

16:14.940 --> 16:15.940
You've got a taller ceiling going up.

16:15.940 --> 16:16.940
You'd be screwing a McMansion.

16:16.940 --> 16:17.940
Yeah.

16:18.700 --> 16:21.700
I love to talk about those weird high ceilings in McMansions and how pointless they are.

16:21.700 --> 16:23.700
Love tall ceilings.

16:23.700 --> 16:26.380
By the way, the ceilings in this house, very tall.

16:26.380 --> 16:27.380
Yeah, but they-

16:27.380 --> 16:28.380
No, no, no.

16:28.380 --> 16:29.380
Not the house we're in.

16:29.380 --> 16:30.380
The house you're in.

16:30.380 --> 16:31.380
Oh.

16:31.380 --> 16:32.380
Ew, gross.

16:32.380 --> 16:33.380
The house you're in.

16:33.380 --> 16:35.380
The house always you're in.

16:35.380 --> 16:37.380
Oh, that's why the walls are wet.

16:37.380 --> 16:38.380
Okay.

16:38.380 --> 16:41.860
Hey, did I show you guys what was in that hole over there that I fell into?

16:41.860 --> 16:42.860
No.

16:42.860 --> 16:43.860
Oh, yeah.

16:43.860 --> 16:44.860
No.

16:44.860 --> 16:45.860
What is it?

16:45.860 --> 16:46.860
Also, are your legs okay?

16:46.860 --> 16:47.860
Did you break your leg or something?

16:48.780 --> 16:50.780
No, I actually landed with cat-like agility.

16:50.780 --> 16:51.780
Wow.

16:51.780 --> 16:53.060
No, but what was down there?

16:53.060 --> 16:54.060
Was it like-

16:54.060 --> 16:55.060
There's two dead people down there.

16:55.060 --> 16:56.060
Oh.

16:56.060 --> 16:57.060
Oh.

16:57.060 --> 16:58.540
How dead are they?

16:58.540 --> 16:59.540
Yeah.

16:59.540 --> 17:00.540
How dead were they?

17:00.540 --> 17:01.540
Were they decayed?

17:01.540 --> 17:04.660
They looked to be maybe a week or two old.

17:04.660 --> 17:06.660
They're a little musty.

17:06.660 --> 17:09.420
I mean, they're not infants, sorry.

17:09.420 --> 17:10.420
No, no.

17:10.420 --> 17:11.420
I know what you mean.

17:11.420 --> 17:12.420
Yeah, we knew what you meant.

17:12.420 --> 17:13.420
Okay, cool.

17:13.980 --> 17:19.860
The all prevailing and inescapable odor of the dead did pervade throughout the house

17:19.860 --> 17:23.140
when you fell through that hole, but I just assumed, you know, it was Randy.

17:23.140 --> 17:29.060
Wait, so do you think James kept those people down there or do you think-

17:29.060 --> 17:32.260
It looks like they fell into the armor trap, right?

17:32.260 --> 17:33.260
Could they have died from that fall?

17:33.260 --> 17:34.900
You said it was 12 feet, right?

17:34.900 --> 17:36.140
Do you die from a 12 feet drop?

17:36.140 --> 17:37.140
I don't think you die.

17:37.140 --> 17:39.140
Well, you break your legs and if you're down in a pit-

17:39.140 --> 17:40.140
And then you can't get out, sure.

17:40.140 --> 17:42.300
But you don't die from falling 12 feet.

17:42.300 --> 17:43.300
Sure.

17:44.180 --> 17:45.180
You could if you were upside down or something.

17:45.180 --> 17:46.180
He just didn't let them out.

17:46.180 --> 17:47.180
Yeah.

17:47.180 --> 17:51.940
Well, so that's what I'm thinking is, do you think James could be some kind of crazy H.H.

17:51.940 --> 17:53.180
Holmes killer?

17:53.180 --> 17:58.220
Well, so I fell down there and then all hell broke loose, but I used my steely cool to

17:58.220 --> 18:01.060
go through the pockets before I tried to get myself out of there.

18:01.060 --> 18:02.060
I do.

18:02.060 --> 18:03.060
I really get a more, um-

18:03.060 --> 18:04.060
Hold on.

18:04.060 --> 18:05.060
Can I get Ramona out of here?

18:05.060 --> 18:12.060
Ramona, Ramona, let me hold you while you're going in here, baby.

18:12.300 --> 18:14.300
Damn, your house is clean.

18:14.300 --> 18:16.020
Yeah, it is, dude.

18:16.020 --> 18:17.020
Not this room.

18:17.020 --> 18:19.260
Fucking my man cave.

18:19.260 --> 18:21.500
More like a man's grave.

18:21.500 --> 18:22.500
Whoa.

18:22.500 --> 18:27.000
This man cave is more like a man's grave.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
So I found a subreddit-

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
I forgot all about that.

18:29.000 --> 18:34.620
I found a subreddit called man caves and every number one post is somebody doing more like

18:34.620 --> 18:35.620
a man's grave.

18:35.620 --> 18:36.620
Doing more like a man's grave.

18:36.620 --> 18:37.620
Yeah.

18:37.620 --> 18:38.620
That's incredible.

18:38.620 --> 18:39.620
Fuck.

18:39.620 --> 18:40.620
That is shit.

18:41.260 --> 18:44.980
So yeah, I went through the pockets down there on those bodies and they had one of those

18:44.980 --> 18:46.360
symbols in their pockets.

18:46.360 --> 18:48.380
It's the circle with the circle surrounding it.

18:48.380 --> 18:49.820
The six around them, yeah.

18:49.820 --> 18:52.580
Just like these blueprints over here that you also found.

18:52.580 --> 18:53.820
You're right.

18:53.820 --> 19:01.620
That lake has an island on it with a building in that same configuration.

19:01.620 --> 19:04.300
I think it's a clue, boys.

19:04.300 --> 19:05.780
Smells like a clue.

19:06.780 --> 19:10.220
Wait, where was the CCC?

19:10.220 --> 19:12.220
I feed Clark a Scooby Sniff.

19:12.220 --> 19:13.220
Where was the CCC?

19:13.220 --> 19:15.020
Does anybody know where that is?

19:15.020 --> 19:16.020
Oh.

19:16.020 --> 19:17.020
Randy might.

19:17.020 --> 19:19.980
Yeah, I take the blueprints back to the bathroom and like-

19:19.980 --> 19:22.980
Hey Randy buddy.

19:22.980 --> 19:25.240
You getting cleaned up in there?

19:25.240 --> 19:31.860
Warm water is pouring out from underneath the door and it has a slight color to it and

19:31.860 --> 19:33.300
it smells just awful.

19:33.300 --> 19:35.980
Randy, I notice there's a lot of shit water out here.

19:35.980 --> 19:37.540
You doing okay in there, buddy?

19:37.540 --> 19:39.540
The drain is clogged.

19:39.540 --> 19:44.140
Okay, why don't you just try to rub your hand over it and get some of that shit out of the

19:44.140 --> 19:45.140
holes, you know?

19:45.140 --> 19:46.580
I'm trying to stomp it down.

19:46.580 --> 19:48.380
Oh no, that's the opposite.

19:48.380 --> 19:50.180
Do you have any- Okay, listen.

19:50.180 --> 19:51.180
Don't worry about that.

19:51.180 --> 19:54.020
Do you know about the- What was it called?

19:54.020 --> 19:55.020
CCC.

19:55.020 --> 19:56.620
Calm Comfy Campgrounds.

19:56.620 --> 19:59.780
Do you know where the Calm Comfy Campgrounds are?

19:59.780 --> 20:00.780
No.

20:00.780 --> 20:02.460
Okay, well thanks for your help, buddy.

20:02.460 --> 20:03.460
No problem.

20:03.460 --> 20:04.460
Thanks for coming and checking on me.

20:04.460 --> 20:06.380
Can I get some pants?

20:06.380 --> 20:09.500
Why don't you figure out this- Yeah, we'll get you pants, but it really doesn't seem

20:09.500 --> 20:13.460
like you're at pants stage yet if you're still at drain shit stomping stage.

20:13.460 --> 20:16.520
The water is no longer- We're definitely not getting you socks.

20:16.520 --> 20:20.620
The water is no longer running.

20:20.620 --> 20:27.180
And you just hear this like- You just doubling down on that stomping, huh?

20:27.180 --> 20:28.180
I'm trying.

20:28.180 --> 20:31.900
Okay, well, yeah, just keep that up, I guess.

20:31.900 --> 20:35.300
All right, well hey guys, yeah, he didn't know anything about that.

20:35.300 --> 20:36.620
What is that smell?

20:36.620 --> 20:40.140
Oh yeah, that's all the shit water Randy got everywhere.

20:40.140 --> 20:41.140
Probably the corpses too.

20:41.140 --> 20:42.500
Oh yeah, that makes sense.

20:42.500 --> 20:48.100
You look down in the pit, yeah, these two bodies, very, very super dead, skin is already

20:48.100 --> 20:50.660
turned, you know, whatever color.

20:50.660 --> 20:54.500
Hey guys, is there anything else in this house you want to look at, otherwise I'm gonna go

20:54.500 --> 20:58.940
outside and wait for the ambulance, because I think I'm gonna throw up, and I feel like

20:58.940 --> 21:01.940
if I throw up, the pain from my ribs is gonna make me throw up.

21:01.940 --> 21:05.300
Yeah, there's also already a lot of shit water in here, so if you could not throw up on our

21:05.300 --> 21:10.380
new house, that would be- I go out in the front yard and just sit down

21:10.380 --> 21:11.380
on the ground.

21:11.380 --> 21:16.660
The ambulance is coming down the street and pulls into the driveway, which is not where

21:16.660 --> 21:20.220
your cruiser is, because your cruiser is in the yard.

21:20.220 --> 21:21.420
Correct, I might know.

21:21.420 --> 21:22.860
The cool way to park.

21:22.860 --> 21:25.780
When I see the ambulance pull up, I'm probably heading out too.

21:25.780 --> 21:27.220
I'm in a lot of pain.

21:27.220 --> 21:33.380
I stand up and I wave with my left hand, because I assume my right side got hit, yeah, I wave

21:33.380 --> 21:37.900
and call the EMT guys over, and I put them in Clark's direction because I feel like he

21:37.900 --> 21:40.180
has the biggest injury.

21:40.180 --> 21:43.740
I got a sloppy arm, folks, I say to the paramedics as they walk up.

21:43.740 --> 21:45.540
Oh my god, that's incredible.

21:45.540 --> 21:47.780
It hurts real bad too.

21:47.780 --> 21:49.340
What happened tonight, guys?

21:49.340 --> 21:50.340
This is crazy.

21:50.340 --> 21:52.220
Are you related to Drew?

21:52.220 --> 21:55.820
No, you've asked me that before.

21:55.820 --> 21:57.580
This is just what I sound like.

21:57.580 --> 22:04.500
I talk to the paramedic, I'm like, pretty good tourniquet on his arm, huh?

22:04.500 --> 22:05.500
No.

22:05.500 --> 22:10.020
It made me feel better, Keith, don't worry.

22:10.020 --> 22:11.020
We'll get him next time, buddy.

22:11.020 --> 22:15.660
I just look down at the ground and I just wait for my turn to get treated.

22:15.660 --> 22:20.620
We'd love to tell you all about the weird robot shenanigans that happened here, but

22:20.620 --> 22:21.620
we need help.

22:22.020 --> 22:23.020
What?

22:23.020 --> 22:24.020
We'd love to tell you about him.

22:24.020 --> 22:28.940
Yeah, don't listen to him, he's just screwing with you, just help us, just help us.

22:28.940 --> 22:34.180
I look at the guy and I kind of eyeball down to the robot hand still stuck in me, and I'm

22:34.180 --> 22:35.180
like, hmm?

22:35.180 --> 22:41.620
He looks at it and he's like, uh, yeah, okay, we can definitely take care of all three of

22:41.620 --> 22:42.940
you at the same time.

22:42.940 --> 22:48.260
Cool, what should we roll to make that happen?

22:48.260 --> 22:50.140
I take three healing potions.

22:50.140 --> 22:56.460
Yeah, I actually have a Phoenix down, so I kill myself and then put that on me and I'm

22:56.460 --> 22:58.740
back to full health.

22:58.740 --> 22:59.740
Final Fantasy.

22:59.740 --> 23:03.660
Hey, folks out there, you ever play Final Fantasy?

23:03.660 --> 23:05.940
That was a Final Fantasy joke.

23:05.940 --> 23:09.180
I win 95.

23:09.180 --> 23:12.060
Jon is going to regain three hit points.

23:12.060 --> 23:13.060
Yay.

23:13.060 --> 23:14.260
I'm at 12.

23:14.260 --> 23:16.380
Keith regains one hit point.

23:16.380 --> 23:17.580
God dammit.

23:17.580 --> 23:19.740
And Clark regains four hit points.

23:19.740 --> 23:20.740
Nice.

23:20.740 --> 23:26.780
Um, can I ask them for some of their hit points since I did give them some, well, I gave you

23:26.780 --> 23:27.780
four back, huh?

23:27.780 --> 23:28.780
I'm just kidding.

23:28.780 --> 23:32.620
Just kidding, I'm good with six hit points.

23:32.620 --> 23:34.620
I'll just be careful.

23:34.620 --> 23:35.620
I'm at 11.

23:35.620 --> 23:38.620
I'm at, I already said, but I'm at 12.

23:38.620 --> 23:43.100
Okay, boys, what are we going to do next?

23:43.100 --> 23:45.060
We've explored the tuxedo statue.

23:45.060 --> 23:47.180
Did we check out the painting yet?

23:47.220 --> 23:48.220
Yeah, we checked out the painting.

23:48.220 --> 23:52.020
Remember it had all the, uh, we bonded over the bomb making.

23:52.020 --> 23:53.020
That's right.

23:53.020 --> 23:55.940
Oh, do you fellas remember, uh, there was some blood writing in there.

23:55.940 --> 23:58.180
It said, stop her.

23:58.180 --> 23:59.580
Who do you guys think her is?

23:59.580 --> 24:00.580
Who wrote it even?

24:00.580 --> 24:01.900
Do you guys have forensics at all?

24:01.900 --> 24:02.900
Yeah, but not much.

24:02.900 --> 24:03.900
I have 40.

24:03.900 --> 24:06.000
I got 50.

24:06.000 --> 24:11.620
We should maybe like swab that DNA, the blood and see if it's anybody.

24:11.620 --> 24:17.040
If we can like stick it into the database and see if it's DNA that pops up of anybody

24:17.040 --> 24:18.040
that's yeah.

24:18.040 --> 24:19.040
I want to do that.

24:19.040 --> 24:21.440
I want to run in there and take a sample of the blood that says, stop her.

24:21.440 --> 24:22.440
Okay.

24:22.440 --> 24:23.440
Do I need to roll for that?

24:23.440 --> 24:26.560
Cause that just basically, I just want to put it in.

24:26.560 --> 24:27.560
That's very easy.

24:27.560 --> 24:28.560
Yeah.

24:28.560 --> 24:30.760
I'd like to research the piano, I guess.

24:30.760 --> 24:33.680
How 33, what are you doing?

24:33.680 --> 24:36.920
I am, um, re searching, researching that.

24:36.920 --> 24:42.120
So I go into the, um, the inside where all the strings would be and I'm just feeling

24:42.120 --> 24:44.520
around for like loose keys.

24:44.520 --> 24:45.740
I run my hands over the keys.

24:45.740 --> 24:49.300
I'm just kind of checking everything again thoroughly, but this time I did get a crit

24:49.300 --> 24:50.300
success.

24:50.300 --> 24:51.300
33.

24:51.300 --> 24:52.300
You did indeed.

24:52.300 --> 24:59.440
And as you are looking through the empty piano, you would make note of the fact that there

24:59.440 --> 25:06.380
were piano strings in here at a certain point in time.

25:06.380 --> 25:11.320
However, those strings are no longer here.

25:11.320 --> 25:12.320
By God.

25:12.320 --> 25:14.540
Boys, I don't know what it means, but.

25:14.540 --> 25:23.420
And in one small corner now, dammit, uh, were there any other pieces in here?

25:23.420 --> 25:25.520
We got the painting of a Rose.

25:25.520 --> 25:28.540
We looked at, okay, we got tuxedo suit, man.

25:28.540 --> 25:29.540
We got suit of armor.

25:29.540 --> 25:31.420
Did we search the tuxedo?

25:31.420 --> 25:37.060
The tic, the tuxedo statue was the bow tie that moved, that popped up the look at the

25:37.060 --> 25:38.060
pockets though.

25:38.060 --> 25:40.020
Might as well run a hand through.

25:40.020 --> 25:41.020
It's a statue.

25:41.020 --> 25:42.020
It was a statue.

25:42.500 --> 25:44.480
I was picturing a tuxedo on a statue.

25:44.480 --> 25:48.260
It was a guy in a tuxedo statue.

25:48.260 --> 25:49.260
That's gaudy.

25:49.260 --> 25:50.640
Oh yeah.

25:50.640 --> 25:52.180
All this shit is horrible.

25:52.180 --> 25:54.180
He's got the rose paint.

25:54.180 --> 25:55.180
Wait, hold on.

25:55.180 --> 25:56.460
Yeah, let's try his glasses.

25:56.460 --> 25:59.740
Bow tie that moved, Rose painting.

25:59.740 --> 26:02.980
It was a hard hat on the suit of armor.

26:02.980 --> 26:07.460
If you remember what present I acted like I got cook.

26:07.460 --> 26:11.380
It had those things and it had a Rose, it had a hard hat and it had a, was it a bow

26:11.420 --> 26:12.420
tie in the package?

26:12.420 --> 26:13.420
It was indeed.

26:13.420 --> 26:15.060
A silk bow tie.

26:15.060 --> 26:17.700
Do you think the package came from James?

26:17.700 --> 26:18.820
I'm thinking this.

26:18.820 --> 26:22.240
We found James dead with Maggie cook.

26:22.240 --> 26:25.220
She got a gift box with those things in it.

26:25.220 --> 26:29.860
We are at James's house with two dead bodies and a 12 foot pit.

26:29.860 --> 26:32.380
I forgot that she was with him when she died.

26:32.380 --> 26:35.060
Having some kind of foot feast.

26:35.060 --> 26:37.100
It's probably just a coincidence.

26:37.100 --> 26:42.980
I wonder if there's a connection between Maggie and James other than her dad working

26:42.980 --> 26:44.220
at the mill and him working at the mill.

26:44.220 --> 26:46.220
I wonder if they knew each other before all this.

26:46.220 --> 26:52.220
Guys, I think it's pretty clear this is all just one big coincidence.

26:52.220 --> 26:53.540
So I mean, what do you think?

26:53.540 --> 27:01.140
I mean, that is the mysterious present that I took credit for, which you know was a lie,

27:01.140 --> 27:02.140
right?

27:02.140 --> 27:03.140
You know, by this time.

27:03.140 --> 27:04.140
My eyes narrow.

27:04.140 --> 27:05.140
It's like a key.

27:05.180 --> 27:07.060
I go to my gun.

27:07.060 --> 27:12.140
By this time, you know that I'm an incompetent fool, which I would never say if it didn't

27:12.140 --> 27:13.140
benefit me.

27:13.140 --> 27:16.580
It's the perfect cover, though, for a criminal mastermind.

27:16.580 --> 27:18.300
Okay, so how?

27:18.300 --> 27:22.180
We put together the pieces of a puzzle that we don't know what the puzzle was.

27:22.180 --> 27:24.020
Why would he have sent this stuff?

27:24.020 --> 27:25.820
I think we need to go to the mill.

27:25.820 --> 27:26.820
I think the mill's a really good place to go.

27:26.820 --> 27:29.020
I think we need to go to the mill and interview some people.

27:29.020 --> 27:32.300
I feel like we've been trying to go to the mill for half our lives.

27:32.300 --> 27:33.900
I think we need to go to the mill.

27:33.900 --> 27:34.900
Mighty Ducks on three.

27:34.900 --> 27:35.900
One, two, three.

27:35.900 --> 27:36.900
Mighty Ducks.

27:36.900 --> 27:37.900
Mighty Ducks.

27:37.900 --> 27:38.900
Is it quack?

27:38.900 --> 27:39.900
It's quack.

27:39.900 --> 27:40.900
It's quack.

27:40.900 --> 27:41.900
That's super not what they did in that movie, guys.

27:41.900 --> 27:42.900
I know.

27:42.900 --> 27:43.900
I used to do that.

27:43.900 --> 27:44.900
That's my fault.

27:44.900 --> 27:47.500
Mighty Ducks on three.

27:47.500 --> 27:52.100
So looking around this house, do you want to make sure that it's, you know, is it a

27:52.100 --> 27:53.100
crime scene?

27:53.100 --> 27:54.100
What are you doing?

27:54.100 --> 27:58.140
Well, obviously it's a crime scene, but I don't think that the public needs to know

27:58.140 --> 27:59.140
about a...

27:59.140 --> 28:00.580
Two more disappeared bodies.

28:00.580 --> 28:04.780
I don't think the public needs to know about an artillery-shelled robot.

28:04.780 --> 28:07.540
Yeah, I bet a few people do though.

28:07.540 --> 28:11.060
We should get that handbag from those paramedics, run some tests on that bad boy.

28:11.060 --> 28:12.060
The handbag?

28:12.060 --> 28:13.060
The handbag.

28:13.060 --> 28:14.060
The handbag, yeah.

28:14.060 --> 28:17.260
Hey, a guy who claims he's not related to Drew.

28:17.260 --> 28:18.260
What's your name, buddy?

28:18.260 --> 28:19.260
I'm the EMT.

28:19.260 --> 28:20.260
Sweet.

28:20.260 --> 28:21.980
Hey, can I have that robot hand?

28:21.980 --> 28:22.980
Yeah, absolutely.

28:22.980 --> 28:23.980
Thanks, man.

28:23.980 --> 28:25.420
Hey, Mr. EMT.

28:25.420 --> 28:26.420
There's a...

28:26.420 --> 28:27.420
Emmett.

28:27.420 --> 28:28.420
I'm Emmett, the EMT.

28:28.420 --> 28:29.420
Hey, Emmett.

28:30.420 --> 28:32.860
We've got a crime scene here.

28:32.860 --> 28:36.500
We've got a couple bodies at the bottom of a pit that we can't get out of.

28:36.500 --> 28:41.780
Could you send some guys with ropes to pull those up for us and get them over to the corner?

28:41.780 --> 28:46.300
Yeah, I'll call the rope ambulance and they'll be right over.

28:46.300 --> 28:47.300
You're good people, Emmett.

28:47.300 --> 28:49.940
I'm gonna set up some caution tape all around this scene.

28:49.940 --> 28:51.180
You make sure nobody else gets in here.

28:51.180 --> 28:52.180
Yeah, hey, Emmett.

28:52.180 --> 28:54.220
Will you just keep an eye on things?

28:54.220 --> 28:57.340
Listen, we're deputizing you.

28:57.340 --> 28:58.580
Does that sound cool?

28:58.580 --> 29:00.300
Actually, I'd like to not be...

29:00.300 --> 29:01.300
Too late, buddy.

29:01.300 --> 29:03.540
And I'll pin a little Sheriff's Star sticker.

29:03.540 --> 29:05.540
Let's just get Florence over here to...

29:05.540 --> 29:06.540
Who?

29:06.540 --> 29:07.540
Flo.

29:07.540 --> 29:08.540
Florence?

29:08.540 --> 29:09.540
Florence.

29:09.540 --> 29:10.540
Yeah.

29:10.540 --> 29:11.540
Sure.

29:11.540 --> 29:15.700
Let's get Flo over here to patrol until we tell her not to.

29:15.700 --> 29:16.700
Sounds good.

29:16.700 --> 29:20.020
So you're calling Florence directly or...

29:20.020 --> 29:22.580
Bring, bring, bring, bring.

29:22.580 --> 29:23.580
She doesn't answer.

29:23.580 --> 29:24.580
I'll send her a text.

29:24.580 --> 29:25.580
Damn it.

29:25.580 --> 29:29.540
Drew, tell them to relay the info to Florence.

29:29.540 --> 29:30.540
Sounds good.

29:30.540 --> 29:31.540
Yeah, it's not gonna happen.

29:31.540 --> 29:36.340
Hey, Drew, what's the deal with your cousin, Emmett?

29:36.340 --> 29:39.020
What?

29:39.020 --> 29:51.620
Ever since he got gum surgery, he just thinks he's better than me.

29:51.620 --> 29:52.660
I know who that goes, man.

29:52.660 --> 29:54.660
I got some cousins.

29:54.660 --> 29:55.660
It's like, we get it.

29:55.660 --> 29:57.380
You're pretty now.

29:57.380 --> 30:02.060
I do legitimately want to set up a caution tape over the perimeter of the yard, and then

30:02.060 --> 30:03.900
even over the doors and the windows and stuff.

30:03.900 --> 30:07.660
And maybe we could set up some kind of scarecrow cop in the window.

30:07.660 --> 30:13.340
We'll put the tuxedo statue up in a window and put a little badge.

30:13.340 --> 30:19.340
I'm thinking if Florence isn't answering our shit, I would like to have some sort of surveillance

30:19.340 --> 30:20.340
here.

30:20.340 --> 30:21.340
I don't know how we could do that.

30:21.340 --> 30:22.340
Somebody could leave their cell phone.

30:22.340 --> 30:23.340
Oh, no.

30:23.340 --> 30:31.340
I do have a GoPro that streams to my phone that I could just tape up on a wall.

30:31.340 --> 30:32.340
Do it.

30:32.340 --> 30:37.620
I go to my cruiser, and I'm hoping that my other two officers aren't looking at me.

30:37.620 --> 30:41.500
And I open up the trunk, and I look around, and I open up.

30:41.500 --> 30:46.300
My trunk has a false bottom that the spare tire goes in, but I don't have a spare tire

30:46.300 --> 30:47.300
in there.

30:47.300 --> 30:48.300
I just have a bunch of snacks.

30:48.300 --> 30:55.020
And then I have a GoPro in there, and I close it.

30:55.020 --> 30:59.420
So I get the GoPro, and I tape it.

30:59.420 --> 31:04.100
Where is the statue, the suit of armor?

31:04.100 --> 31:05.100
Is that in the foyer?

31:05.100 --> 31:06.420
Those are both in the foyer.

31:06.420 --> 31:10.540
Kind of above and to the right of both of those, I put it up in the corner, and I tape

31:10.540 --> 31:14.100
it up there, and I have it feeding to my phone.

31:14.100 --> 31:15.100
Sweet.

31:15.100 --> 31:16.100
Done.

31:16.100 --> 31:21.340
And I'm kind of sad, because I was going to do some cool ... I've been trying to learn

31:21.340 --> 31:27.660
how to skateboard, so I've been putting it on my helmet while I skateboard, but none

31:27.660 --> 31:31.620
of the footage is useful, because I'm not very good at skateboarding, so.

31:31.620 --> 31:36.820
I think that footage could be useful.

31:36.820 --> 31:38.860
I'm going to go check on Randy again.

31:38.860 --> 31:40.860
I'm going to say, hey, buddy.

31:40.860 --> 31:41.860
Listen.

31:41.860 --> 31:42.860
Splash, splash.

31:42.860 --> 31:43.860
I was thinking about you.

31:43.860 --> 31:44.860
Hey, man.

31:44.860 --> 31:47.580
You know, it's all about keeping that attitude positive.

31:47.580 --> 31:52.100
The door flings open, and steam starts just pouring out of this room.

31:52.100 --> 31:53.740
Oh, you're enjoying this now.

31:53.740 --> 31:56.460
Well, I guess it's good that I caught you in a good mood, because hey, it does seem

31:56.460 --> 32:01.900
to me like the estate has a real fixer-upper on their hands, and I'd be willing to take

32:01.900 --> 32:04.780
this off your hands pretty cheap.

32:04.780 --> 32:06.700
We can talk about that later.

32:06.700 --> 32:08.700
Glad you got the shit taken care of.

32:08.700 --> 32:09.700
Here's some pants.

32:09.700 --> 32:10.700
Hey, buddy.

32:10.700 --> 32:11.700
I need you to do me a big favor.

32:11.700 --> 32:13.340
Why'd you get sweatpants?

32:13.340 --> 32:14.820
So you could shit them again easily?

32:14.820 --> 32:15.820
Okay, you know what?

32:15.820 --> 32:16.820
That all adds up.

32:16.820 --> 32:17.820
So, hey.

32:17.820 --> 32:21.940
We're going to send an officer over here, but we really got to get going, so please

32:21.940 --> 32:27.180
don't sell anything in the next seven hours or whatever, and could you just keep an eye

32:27.180 --> 32:34.340
on things for like 30 minutes, and hey, here's my card, and if any robots come back, do let

32:34.340 --> 32:35.340
us know immediately.

32:35.340 --> 32:36.340
Any?

32:36.340 --> 32:37.340
Oh, God.

32:37.340 --> 32:38.340
Okay.

32:38.340 --> 32:43.420
Officer of Contingent, the Contingent PD will be here to relieve you, uh, presently, but-

32:43.420 --> 32:44.420
Presently?

32:44.420 --> 32:45.780
Yeah, that means soon.

32:45.780 --> 32:49.540
But don't relieve yourself presently again, Randy.

32:49.540 --> 32:53.300
All right, well, thank you, Officer Pettymore.

32:53.300 --> 32:55.460
Yeah, uh, no problem, Mr. Anx.

32:55.460 --> 33:03.700
And he walks out and into the living room, and he points at the legs with the pelvic

33:03.700 --> 33:06.100
area, standing-

33:06.100 --> 33:08.620
What?

33:08.620 --> 33:09.620
Standing on the ground.

33:09.620 --> 33:10.620
Oh, yeah.

33:10.620 --> 33:13.820
And, uh, he just kind of points at them.

33:13.820 --> 33:16.900
Yeah, man, we kicked a robot's ass.

33:16.900 --> 33:18.460
That's all the commotion.

33:18.460 --> 33:23.420
He just, uh, he just sits down on the couch, all right, and just pulls out his phone.

33:23.420 --> 33:27.780
I want to go through the pockets of that robot's legs that I forgot were in the middle of this

33:27.780 --> 33:28.780
room.

33:28.780 --> 33:33.020
Yeah, I would like to thoroughly examine the robot legs for markings or manufacturers.

33:33.420 --> 33:35.820
Maybe even look inside the wiring and sit there in the air.

33:35.820 --> 33:37.820
I also want to check out his robot dick.

33:37.820 --> 33:38.820
Yeah.

33:38.820 --> 33:39.820
What's he got?

33:39.820 --> 33:47.060
Okay, when you go through the pockets of his, like, tactical pants, you find a couple knives,

33:47.060 --> 33:54.320
a bunch of ammo for the weapon he was using earlier, and that's it.

33:54.320 --> 33:57.140
That's all that's in the pants.

33:57.140 --> 34:05.580
John unbuttons those pants, unzips those pants, and starts bringing those trousers

34:05.580 --> 34:17.420
to the ground, and there is, hanging between the mechanical legs of this thing, it's a

34:17.420 --> 34:18.420
real penis.

34:18.420 --> 34:19.420
Look at that, boys.

34:19.420 --> 34:21.820
Okay, so hold on.

34:21.820 --> 34:22.820
I was not expecting-

34:22.820 --> 34:26.620
I was hoping for, like, a key to the end of the game.

34:27.100 --> 34:30.340
I thought it was going to be, like, John Peter's face stares back at you.

34:30.340 --> 34:31.340
Yeah, right.

34:31.340 --> 34:34.780
You see his dick, and branded on it is, a fool.

34:34.780 --> 34:38.620
It's his dick, but there's a green light on it.

34:38.620 --> 34:43.580
Weird tubes extend from the shaft.

34:43.580 --> 34:50.940
Okay, so when you take his pants down to the ground, he is smooth like a Ken doll.

34:50.940 --> 35:01.300
However, on the penis spot, the spot where a penis and balls would be, there is a little

35:01.300 --> 35:09.860
symbol etched into the metal, and it is an M, the letter M, as in Mancy, made of four

35:09.860 --> 35:12.300
double helices.

35:12.300 --> 35:18.700
I would like to do a reverse image search on that logo.

35:18.700 --> 35:20.060
Okay.

35:20.060 --> 35:21.060
Full luck.

35:21.060 --> 35:22.060
No dice.

35:22.060 --> 35:24.060
76 on a 45.

35:24.060 --> 35:25.060
Okay.

35:25.060 --> 35:27.420
If I look at it, do I- does it ring any bells for Clark?

35:27.420 --> 35:28.420
Nope.

35:28.420 --> 35:32.780
Can we get Drew to come down here and take those legs to evidence?

35:32.780 --> 35:34.580
That sounds like a flow job.

35:34.580 --> 35:35.580
No, we won't-

35:35.580 --> 35:36.580
Flow job.

35:36.580 --> 35:37.580
I think we won't-

35:37.580 --> 35:38.580
Flow's coming down here, but eventually she'll leave, so she'll take the legs with her.

35:38.580 --> 35:40.420
Well, we haven't gotten in contact with Flow.

35:40.420 --> 35:42.660
I contacted Drew to get in contact with Flow.

35:42.660 --> 35:44.380
I want Flow to stay here.

35:44.380 --> 35:47.900
I think we should have Drew come down here, take the legs back to evidence.

35:47.900 --> 35:49.300
But then they're just sitting in a room.

35:49.460 --> 35:51.340
It's not like Drew can do anything with them there.

35:51.340 --> 35:53.580
Yeah, but we can do with them at some point.

35:53.580 --> 35:54.580
I'm with you.

35:54.580 --> 35:55.580
I think we should do that.

35:55.580 --> 35:57.940
If they stay here, then they're just going to go by the wayside.

35:57.940 --> 36:01.740
There's three of you and one police cruiser, so you can take them with you if you want.

36:01.740 --> 36:02.740
Yeah, we can just take them.

36:02.740 --> 36:03.740
Ooh, let's take the robot legs.

36:03.740 --> 36:06.620
Yeah, but I feel like if we take the robot legs with us, they're going to attack us

36:06.620 --> 36:07.620
at some point.

36:07.620 --> 36:08.620
Then we can get them at a jump point.

36:08.620 --> 36:09.620
And-

36:09.620 --> 36:10.620
No, let's take them.

36:10.620 --> 36:11.620
We might be able to figure out a way to ride them.

36:11.620 --> 36:12.620
Scarecrow cap.

36:12.620 --> 36:18.820
Well, it's two against one, so all in favor of having Drew take them back to evidence,

36:18.820 --> 36:19.820
say aye.

36:19.820 --> 36:20.820
Aye.

36:20.820 --> 36:21.820
Aye.

36:21.820 --> 36:25.260
All in favor of taking them with us to the mill.

36:25.260 --> 36:26.260
Aye.

36:26.260 --> 36:27.260
Aye.

36:27.260 --> 36:28.260
Okay, so I-

36:28.260 --> 36:31.900
It's cute that you think this is a democracy, Keith.

36:31.900 --> 36:32.900
I-

36:32.900 --> 36:34.780
We'll throw them in the trunk there, Keith.

36:34.780 --> 36:35.780
That way they can't get to them.

36:35.780 --> 36:36.780
We'll take real good care of them, buddy.

36:36.780 --> 36:38.900
Yeah, we'll throw them in the trunk of my cruiser.

36:38.900 --> 36:39.900
Great, guys.

36:39.900 --> 36:40.900
Okay, well-

36:40.900 --> 36:44.060
What, are you afraid they'll ruin your snacks?

36:44.060 --> 36:45.900
You don't know that I have snacks in there.

36:45.900 --> 36:47.620
We know about your snacks, buddy.

36:47.620 --> 36:51.500
I sit down on the ground, I'm like, you guys can do whatever you want to do.

36:51.500 --> 36:55.220
Apparently this isn't a democracy, so I'll just do whatever you guys want to do.

36:55.220 --> 36:58.220
Why'd you say it like that?

36:58.220 --> 36:59.220
He's mad.

36:59.220 --> 37:00.220
Keith is angry.

37:00.220 --> 37:10.700
I will stand up when we go to the mill, but I'm driving my fucking car.

37:10.700 --> 37:12.100
He's got the best drive.

37:12.100 --> 37:13.100
Me.

37:13.100 --> 37:14.660
I have 40 drive.

37:14.660 --> 37:15.660
70.

37:15.700 --> 37:17.900
Yeah, well, it's my car, so I'm driving.

37:17.900 --> 37:22.620
Actually, I don't sit down on the ground, I go sit in the driver's seat of my car and

37:22.620 --> 37:24.020
wait for the other two officers.

37:24.020 --> 37:26.860
John, you want to help me lug this into the trunk?

37:26.860 --> 37:29.580
No, but sure.

37:29.580 --> 37:33.180
Yeah, we lift it and carry it over to the trunk.

37:33.180 --> 37:35.820
Oh, that makes the ribs sore.

37:35.820 --> 37:36.820
Right before they get-

37:36.820 --> 37:37.820
Oh, yeah.

37:37.820 --> 37:39.500
Right before they get to my car-

37:39.500 --> 37:40.500
I don't think I can carry it.

37:40.500 --> 37:41.500
Taking one arm.

37:41.500 --> 37:42.500
One arm.

37:42.500 --> 37:45.440
Yeah, I get to the ankles underneath the armpit there.

37:45.440 --> 37:50.920
Right before they get to my car, I do the lock, unlock game with them.

37:50.920 --> 37:54.480
I lock the trunk right before they try to open it.

37:54.480 --> 37:59.880
I fire my gun into the air several times.

37:59.880 --> 38:02.080
Keith, do not play this shit with me today.

38:02.080 --> 38:05.800
You hear from inside the house, oh, no.

38:05.800 --> 38:08.840
Sorry, Randy.

38:08.840 --> 38:14.080
I hear the gun shoot off, I'm like, ah, I don't want to test it, so I unlock it and

38:14.080 --> 38:15.080
then-

38:15.120 --> 38:16.120
Oh, I put the legs in the trunk.

38:16.120 --> 38:19.560
No, I lock it right before they open it.

38:19.560 --> 38:22.080
I'm laughing, but it hurts.

38:22.080 --> 38:26.840
The first time I do it, it hurts my ribs to laugh, so I just unlock it because I'm like,

38:26.840 --> 38:27.840
I can't keep doing this.

38:27.840 --> 38:29.720
It'll be too funny.

38:29.720 --> 38:30.720
So it's unlocked.

38:36.720 --> 38:37.720
I open it.

38:37.720 --> 38:39.720
And then I lock it right before.

38:39.720 --> 38:42.360
No, it's unlocked.

38:42.360 --> 38:49.240
At this point, I'm just like hurting and tired and mad.

38:49.240 --> 38:51.240
Delta Green.

39:12.360 --> 39:14.360
Why you do?

39:14.360 --> 39:26.360
Oh, how can you have enough drowning out of the noise?

39:26.360 --> 39:30.360
With no mind at all.

39:30.360 --> 39:34.360
No mind at all.

39:34.360 --> 39:38.360
No mind at all.

39:38.360 --> 39:40.360
Fight, fight.

39:40.360 --> 39:42.360
Stream it out.
