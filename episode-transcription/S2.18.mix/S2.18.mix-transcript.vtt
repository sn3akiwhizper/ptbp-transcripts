00:00.000 --> 00:04.320
Welcome to the Bone Zone, my skeletons.

00:04.320 --> 00:09.160
We gather only the finest of bones to provide for y'all.

00:09.160 --> 00:12.080
Big bones, little bones,

00:12.080 --> 00:16.560
those super thin weird bones that gross you out

00:16.560 --> 00:19.840
when you devour a chicken's roasted carcass.

00:19.840 --> 00:23.120
Them fish bones that people swallow.

00:23.120 --> 00:27.960
Corn bones, teeth bones, you know the ones.

00:27.960 --> 00:34.080
And I am rattling at y'all live from 694.2 PTBP.

00:34.080 --> 00:37.320
It's your bone daddy, Wolf the dog,

00:37.320 --> 00:40.000
here to make your ear bones quiver

00:40.000 --> 00:43.280
with otherworldly vibrations.

00:43.280 --> 00:46.920
Something's making my damn bones quiver.

00:46.920 --> 00:50.560
Oh shit, it's this week's Howlin' with Wolf.

00:50.560 --> 00:56.200
And this week's HWW comes from Kate in Limestone, New York,

00:56.240 --> 01:00.040
who tweeted about the show and tagged at Pretending Pod.

01:00.040 --> 01:03.880
A very easy and helpful thing to do.

01:03.880 --> 01:06.640
Go on, do it for ol' Wolfie.

01:06.640 --> 01:09.880
Kate from Limestone, New York writes,

01:09.880 --> 01:14.880
I wanna thank the PTBP gang for confirming to my coworkers

01:15.240 --> 01:18.840
that I am exactly as fuckin' weird as they thought.

01:18.840 --> 01:22.360
And shout out to Mickalyn for introducing me

01:22.360 --> 01:27.280
to this absolute shit show in my newest hyper fixation.

01:27.280 --> 01:29.880
You're one of the best humans I could know.

01:29.880 --> 01:33.760
I can't wait to hear these idiots fuck up next episode.

01:33.760 --> 01:38.240
And remember, they are watching even when you aren't.

01:38.240 --> 01:40.440
Well, I heard from a little producer

01:40.440 --> 01:44.040
that it's Kate from Limestone's birthday today.

01:44.040 --> 01:46.320
And you know what that means.

01:46.320 --> 01:48.840
Wait, do y'all know what that means?

01:48.840 --> 01:52.000
I'm unfamiliar with a birth day.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.160
And what people do about them.

01:54.160 --> 01:57.120
Well, Kate, thanks for writin' in regardless.

01:57.120 --> 01:59.920
And I hope your birthday is one in which things happen

01:59.920 --> 02:02.520
that humans generally desire.

02:02.520 --> 02:04.000
If you wanna write up somethin'

02:04.000 --> 02:06.420
for your bone-filled wolf to how,

02:06.420 --> 02:09.840
tag at Pretending Pod on Twitter or Instagram.

02:09.840 --> 02:12.640
Tag Pretending to be People on Facebook.

02:12.640 --> 02:16.320
Or even better, write up a five-star review

02:16.320 --> 02:18.360
on the podcast app of your choice

02:18.360 --> 02:20.720
and send us the receipts.

02:20.720 --> 02:24.320
Or even best, write up that five-star review

02:24.320 --> 02:27.720
on whatever app you use and post that garbage

02:27.720 --> 02:30.640
on your socials on Reddit

02:30.640 --> 02:34.280
or on a local coffee shop tech board.

02:34.280 --> 02:37.760
Wherever, just make sure we hear about it.

02:37.760 --> 02:39.700
Now, listen to this.

02:39.700 --> 02:43.140
Apparently, a Zatch of some sort

02:43.140 --> 02:46.800
took over my airwaves recently, which is...

02:48.480 --> 02:50.000
It's fine.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.960
He at least had some cool news.

02:52.960 --> 02:56.240
The good people here at PTBP will be matching

02:56.240 --> 02:59.280
all new and upgrading Patreon subscriptions

02:59.280 --> 03:00.880
for the month of December.

03:00.880 --> 03:03.120
And they're takin' that doubled amount

03:03.120 --> 03:06.260
and donating it to a crisis cold weather shelter

03:06.260 --> 03:09.220
in a place called Springfield, Missouri

03:09.220 --> 03:12.360
to help keep the folks in their community warm

03:12.360 --> 03:15.160
during the upcoming winter months.

03:15.160 --> 03:19.040
The shelter is openly accepting of all genders,

03:19.040 --> 03:23.240
open on all nights when the temperature is dangerously cold

03:23.240 --> 03:27.120
and oh, that's right, they'll also shelter them pets.

03:27.120 --> 03:30.120
So go on, join the Patreon.

03:30.120 --> 03:31.880
Links in the show notes.

03:31.880 --> 03:34.040
Help those pretending to be people boys

03:34.040 --> 03:36.000
help the folks in their community

03:36.000 --> 03:38.640
who are showin' up and doin' the hard work.

03:38.640 --> 03:40.320
Links in the show notes.

03:40.320 --> 03:43.680
Last year, the Patreon went up $400.

03:43.680 --> 03:47.840
We matched that and donated $800 to the shelter.

03:47.840 --> 03:52.480
This year, it's already up over 250 bucks.

03:52.480 --> 03:56.160
We're well on our way to toppin' last year's donations.

03:56.160 --> 03:57.540
Thanks to y'all.

03:57.540 --> 04:00.560
Links in the damn show notes.

04:00.560 --> 04:04.160
Plus, available for patrons ear holes,

04:04.160 --> 04:06.880
the 38th exclusive episode is a

04:06.880 --> 04:10.260
Contention PD Halloween special called

04:10.260 --> 04:13.640
It's the Butterfinger Bandit Keith Beans.

04:13.680 --> 04:18.560
The boys play child versions of their season one characters

04:18.560 --> 04:21.780
to solve a spooky mystery.

04:21.780 --> 04:26.780
Now, please ignore, explore, and or adore

04:26.780 --> 04:30.240
the spooky nature of my omniscience.

04:30.240 --> 04:32.440
It's time for the news.

04:32.440 --> 04:36.320
Last time, the boys done fucked up.

04:36.320 --> 04:39.040
Big surprise, right?

04:39.080 --> 04:44.080
Apparently, that Zach being does a decent recap,

04:44.200 --> 04:46.760
so no need for me to double dip.

04:46.760 --> 04:50.360
I'm just here to exalt Alter Girl with

04:50.360 --> 04:54.360
My Life is Great and It's All My Fault.

04:54.360 --> 04:58.100
It's all my fault

04:58.100 --> 05:03.040
Cause my life is great

05:03.040 --> 05:05.040
And it's all mine

05:10.040 --> 05:15.040
Cause my life is great

05:15.040 --> 05:19.040
And it's all my fault

05:29.040 --> 05:33.040
It's from the meat juice they put in there.

05:33.040 --> 05:36.040
They rung out of horse for it.

05:37.040 --> 05:38.040
Oh, man.

05:38.040 --> 05:39.040
Give me that horse juice.

05:39.040 --> 05:40.040
I'm late to this.

05:40.040 --> 05:43.040
I didn't see the Channel 5 Chad Hanks interview

05:43.040 --> 05:45.040
during White Boy Summer.

05:45.040 --> 05:48.040
It's actually, I get him now, I think.

05:48.040 --> 05:49.040
Like, I understand.

05:49.040 --> 05:53.040
Not like, I kind of saw that take coming, I guess, but.

05:53.040 --> 05:56.040
Not that he's not an idiot, not that, but like.

05:56.040 --> 05:59.040
Wait, Thomas, put your shirt back on.

05:59.040 --> 06:00.040
No.

06:00.040 --> 06:01.040
Oh, are we recording?

06:01.040 --> 06:05.040
Yeah, do the Denzel voice.

06:05.040 --> 06:07.040
30 Seconds of Silence.

06:09.040 --> 06:10.040
Are we fucking?

06:10.040 --> 06:12.040
Did I just say I like Chad Hanks on you?

06:12.040 --> 06:13.040
Did we record that?

06:13.040 --> 06:15.040
Okay, you gotta delete that.

06:15.040 --> 06:17.040
You gotta, you can't.

06:17.040 --> 06:18.040
No, I didn't say I liked him.

06:18.040 --> 06:22.040
I said I get what, I get why.

06:22.040 --> 06:23.040
Yeah, you just said you liked him

06:23.040 --> 06:25.040
and you're apologizing for saying you get him.

06:25.040 --> 06:27.040
It was clearly a bit, Your Honor.

06:29.040 --> 06:30.040
So, what do you say?

06:30.040 --> 06:33.040
Do I delete all this or do we do 30 Seconds of Silence?

06:33.040 --> 06:37.040
If you delete it, it's not relevant enough anymore.

06:37.040 --> 06:39.040
Would have been fucking hilarious.

06:39.040 --> 06:40.040
I think it's up to Joe.

06:40.040 --> 06:41.040
12 months ago.

06:41.040 --> 06:43.040
It doesn't matter that it's out of date

06:43.040 --> 06:45.040
because you opened it with this is,

06:45.040 --> 06:47.040
I'm just now seeing it, but I thought it was funny.

06:47.040 --> 06:49.040
Yeah, I get it was in context for the fact that.

06:49.040 --> 06:50.040
What do you think, Luke?

06:50.040 --> 06:51.040
Do you think it should stay in?

06:51.040 --> 06:52.040
I like Tom Hanks.

06:55.040 --> 06:57.040
Now that we've recovered from that mess,

06:57.040 --> 07:00.040
it is episode 18.

07:00.040 --> 07:03.040
What's your favorite Colin Hanks appearance?

07:03.040 --> 07:04.040
Orange County.

07:04.040 --> 07:05.040
Yeah, it's a good one.

07:05.040 --> 07:08.040
Don't you think that Tom Hanks knew in his bones

07:08.040 --> 07:10.040
when he named Chet Hanks, Chet Hanks,

07:10.040 --> 07:12.040
that he would be a country music star?

07:12.040 --> 07:13.040
Oh, yeah.

07:13.040 --> 07:14.040
And then this happened.

07:14.040 --> 07:16.040
He didn't see the other way it could go.

07:18.040 --> 07:20.040
They didn't make these kind of Chets back then.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.040
That's right.

07:21.040 --> 07:22.040
The future didn't exist yet.

07:22.040 --> 07:23.040
Yeah.

07:23.040 --> 07:24.040
It was the brand new model.

07:24.040 --> 07:25.040
There was no way to foresee.

07:25.040 --> 07:29.040
It's really unfortunate for Chet and the world.

07:29.040 --> 07:30.040
It's unfortunate for Tom.

07:30.040 --> 07:35.040
I think Chet is expressing himself to his fullest.

07:36.040 --> 07:38.040
He is living his truest life.

07:38.040 --> 07:40.040
More words of support from Thomas Cox.

07:42.040 --> 07:44.040
I don't support Chet Hanks.

07:44.040 --> 07:45.040
I don't like Chet Hanks,

07:45.040 --> 07:47.040
but after watching an interview,

07:47.040 --> 07:49.040
I get why he is like he is.

07:49.040 --> 07:52.040
It's episode 18 of season two,

07:52.040 --> 07:55.040
but more importantly, as of three nights ago,

07:55.040 --> 07:58.040
we've been recording for five years.

07:58.040 --> 07:59.040
December 1st.

07:59.040 --> 08:03.040
And we've been releasing for four years.

08:03.040 --> 08:04.040
That's insane.

08:04.040 --> 08:06.040
Did that one actually happen in November?

08:06.040 --> 08:07.040
Which one?

08:07.040 --> 08:08.040
Releasing.

08:08.040 --> 08:09.040
No.

08:09.040 --> 08:11.040
I think I uploaded three episodes early,

08:11.040 --> 08:12.040
but then we were like,

08:12.040 --> 08:16.040
it's December 1st is when it actually officially dropped,

08:16.040 --> 08:18.040
because we started recording on December 1st,

08:18.040 --> 08:21.040
and that's when season one starts on December 1st,

08:21.040 --> 08:22.040
because of the calendar.

08:22.040 --> 08:24.040
You have to do that.

08:24.040 --> 08:25.040
Yeah.

08:25.040 --> 08:27.040
That is actual play legal.

08:27.040 --> 08:31.040
When Gary Gygax received the original...

08:31.040 --> 08:32.040
Who?

08:32.040 --> 08:33.040
Gary Gygax?

08:33.040 --> 08:35.040
That's a cool name.

08:36.040 --> 08:37.040
That's his name, right, Joe?

08:37.040 --> 08:38.040
Yeah.

08:38.040 --> 08:39.040
Yeah, yeah.

08:39.040 --> 08:41.040
You know who that is, right, Zach?

08:41.040 --> 08:47.040
When Gary Gygax received the original rules of D&D from God,

08:47.040 --> 08:51.040
it included that very specific fucking condition

08:51.040 --> 08:55.040
that the day it is today is the day you're roleplaying.

08:55.040 --> 08:58.040
The day it is today is the day that you're roleplaying.

08:58.040 --> 09:00.040
It's what it said on the tablets from Mountain Doom.

09:00.040 --> 09:03.040
Which he had to translate on his own

09:03.040 --> 09:06.040
and no one else could look at the handbooks from God.

09:06.040 --> 09:09.040
Are you implying he didn't do it faithfully,

09:09.040 --> 09:12.040
or he did it to some advantage for himself?

09:12.040 --> 09:14.040
I'm saying I think it might all be made up.

09:14.040 --> 09:17.040
Listeners, this is the closest this podcast has ever come to ending,

09:17.040 --> 09:21.040
as I don't know if we can continue on as friends.

09:21.040 --> 09:23.040
Certainly not roleplaying partners after.

09:23.040 --> 09:25.040
Are your guys' hands sweaty?

09:25.040 --> 09:27.040
My hands are the sweatiest they've ever been.

09:27.040 --> 09:28.040
I'm nauseous.

09:28.040 --> 09:29.040
I'm going to have to change gloves.

09:32.040 --> 09:34.040
Don't spill the sweat out of those.

09:38.040 --> 09:39.040
Dude, I was watching Shark Tank

09:39.040 --> 09:42.040
and this one guy was selling this poncho that...

09:42.040 --> 09:43.040
That catches your blood sweat?

09:43.040 --> 09:45.040
That catches your body sweat when you work out,

09:45.040 --> 09:47.040
and the fucking commercials he was showing them.

09:47.040 --> 09:49.040
So you can drink it afterward?

09:49.040 --> 09:51.040
No, it's to help lose body weight

09:51.040 --> 09:54.040
if you're trying to get in a certain weight class or whatever.

09:54.040 --> 09:57.040
And some people just like to see how much they sweat.

09:57.040 --> 09:59.040
Yeah, they did this on Jackass.

09:59.040 --> 10:00.040
Would that be his whole...

10:00.040 --> 10:02.040
It was that, but yeah, it was his thing that he was selling.

10:02.040 --> 10:03.040
It's just a heavy sweater.

10:03.040 --> 10:06.040
But in the video he showed of people using it,

10:06.040 --> 10:09.040
it was literally people afterwards dumping the sweat out

10:09.040 --> 10:11.040
and it was vile.

10:11.040 --> 10:14.040
I might have said this before on this podcast,

10:14.040 --> 10:16.040
that that's one of the only gags from Jackass

10:16.040 --> 10:18.040
that made me gag in real life.

10:18.040 --> 10:20.040
All the gross shit that they've ever done,

10:20.040 --> 10:23.040
it was something about the sweat suit that got me so grossed out.

10:23.040 --> 10:26.040
It was so disgusting, dude. I hated it.

10:26.040 --> 10:27.040
And then Mark Cuban bought it.

10:27.040 --> 10:29.040
But wait, so is this guy's whole marketing thing?

10:29.040 --> 10:31.040
Is it some people want to see the sweat?

10:31.040 --> 10:32.040
Is that the whole thing?

10:32.040 --> 10:35.040
If Mark Cuban bought it, that means enough people out there

10:35.040 --> 10:37.040
do want to see.

10:37.040 --> 10:40.040
But it was like to lose water weight

10:40.040 --> 10:42.040
if you're like a wrestler or something

10:42.040 --> 10:43.040
trying to make weight,

10:43.040 --> 10:44.040
and then you've got to weigh it.

10:44.040 --> 10:45.040
I've seen people do that,

10:45.040 --> 10:48.040
where they tape off their pant legs and stuff like that,

10:48.040 --> 10:49.040
their sweat pants and stuff,

10:49.040 --> 10:51.040
to just keep it all in there.

10:51.040 --> 10:52.040
One of the guys was like,

10:52.040 --> 10:54.040
how many people is that, though?

10:54.040 --> 10:55.040
That can't be much.

10:55.040 --> 10:56.040
He's like, a lot of people will just buy it

10:56.040 --> 10:59.040
to see how much they sweat and look at their sweat.

10:59.040 --> 11:02.040
It's 13 people, but they're all really rich.

11:02.040 --> 11:03.040
I don't want to say.

11:03.040 --> 11:05.040
Mark Cuban was like, oh no, I totally get that.

11:05.040 --> 11:06.040
I want to point out,

11:06.040 --> 11:08.040
Thomas has been making a face this whole time

11:08.040 --> 11:09.040
like he wants one.

11:09.040 --> 11:10.040
I don't want to, no, no, no.

11:10.040 --> 11:13.040
I don't want to say Mark Cuban is an infallible businessman

11:13.040 --> 11:14.040
and never makes mistakes.

11:14.040 --> 11:15.040
That's not why I think

11:15.040 --> 11:17.040
maybe there's something else going on here.

11:17.040 --> 11:19.040
What I think is going on is that

11:19.040 --> 11:21.040
maybe once every season or two,

11:21.040 --> 11:24.040
Mark Cuban will buy a bad product

11:24.040 --> 11:26.040
and then bring that person into his life

11:26.040 --> 11:29.040
just to prank his other billionaire friends.

11:29.040 --> 11:32.040
And he funds the idea to a ridiculous amount,

11:32.040 --> 11:36.040
but it's really all a Clooney-esque, pretty cruel.

11:36.040 --> 11:37.040
Like dinner for schmucks?

11:37.040 --> 11:39.040
Yeah, it's pretty much dinner for schmucks.

11:39.040 --> 11:40.040
But he shits in the guy's litter box.

11:40.040 --> 11:42.040
Oh my God, what if all the sharks do it?

11:42.040 --> 11:46.040
What if one season they fund a schmuck?

11:46.040 --> 11:49.040
I would watch that season.

11:49.040 --> 11:50.040
Oh my God.

11:50.040 --> 11:54.040
They have a private schmuck-off

11:54.040 --> 11:56.040
where they see how far they can get the product

11:56.040 --> 11:57.040
they think is the dumbest.

11:57.040 --> 12:00.040
Speaking of charity, for the month of December.

12:00.040 --> 12:03.040
I'll give you a million for one percent.

12:03.040 --> 12:05.040
How's that, Seth?

12:05.040 --> 12:06.040
And a special invitation.

12:06.040 --> 12:07.040
Donations?

12:07.040 --> 12:08.040
Oh, charity?

12:08.040 --> 12:09.040
It starts at home.

12:09.040 --> 12:10.040
That's why.

12:10.040 --> 12:11.040
That's why.

12:11.040 --> 12:12.040
In the month of December,

12:12.040 --> 12:14.040
we're going to take all new and upgrading subscriptions

12:14.040 --> 12:18.040
on our Patreon over at patreon.com slash pretending pod

12:18.040 --> 12:21.040
and we are going to match that increase

12:21.040 --> 12:23.040
and we're going to take that double the amount

12:23.040 --> 12:26.040
and we're going to donate it to a crisis cold weather shelter

12:26.040 --> 12:28.040
here in Springfield, Missouri

12:28.040 --> 12:30.040
to help keep people in our community warm

12:30.040 --> 12:32.040
during these cold winter nights.

12:32.040 --> 12:34.040
Got to be able to sleep in the warm.

12:34.040 --> 12:36.040
Yeah, it's only open when it's under 32 degrees.

12:36.040 --> 12:37.040
It takes all genders.

12:38.040 --> 12:41.040
From what we could see when we were doing our research last year,

12:41.040 --> 12:44.040
it seemed to be a really reputable and solid organization

12:44.040 --> 12:46.040
doing really good work in our hometown.

12:46.040 --> 12:47.040
It gets cold here and we're,

12:47.040 --> 12:51.040
a farmer's almanac says that we're in for a real cold winter.

12:51.040 --> 12:52.040
Farmers almanac.

12:52.040 --> 12:54.040
What's the thing where you cut it and the inside-

12:54.040 --> 12:55.040
The persimmons, yeah.

12:55.040 --> 12:57.040
Apparently those were showing the spoon shape.

12:57.040 --> 12:59.040
I think that was the thing that tells you it's cold.

12:59.040 --> 13:00.040
Yep, that's how they do it.

13:00.040 --> 13:01.040
Spoon persimmons.

13:01.040 --> 13:02.040
In science land.

13:02.040 --> 13:03.040
We also-

13:03.040 --> 13:04.040
Wait.

13:04.040 --> 13:05.040
What?

13:05.040 --> 13:06.040
We have a very large-

13:06.040 --> 13:07.040
Is that bio-farming?

13:07.040 --> 13:08.040
Yeah.

13:08.040 --> 13:10.040
House-less population in Springfield

13:10.040 --> 13:13.040
who are not served very well by our city government

13:13.040 --> 13:14.040
or the state government.

13:14.040 --> 13:15.040
Yeah.

13:15.040 --> 13:16.040
So there's a lot of people who really need it.

13:16.040 --> 13:17.040
Yeah, and it's really rad.

13:17.040 --> 13:19.040
We've got some extremely progressive churches

13:19.040 --> 13:21.040
who have come together to put this together

13:21.040 --> 13:24.040
and we're here to help support people doing good shit.

13:24.040 --> 13:25.040
It's been under 20 degrees-

13:25.040 --> 13:26.040
A lot.

13:26.040 --> 13:28.040
10, 12 times in the past couple weeks here.

13:28.040 --> 13:29.040
I get it.

13:29.040 --> 13:30.040
We should have done it in November.

13:30.040 --> 13:31.040
That's my bad.

13:31.040 --> 13:32.040
No, no, no. I just mean-

13:32.040 --> 13:34.040
It's going to get worse.

13:34.040 --> 13:35.040
It's going to get worse.

13:35.040 --> 13:36.040
It's going to get worse.

13:36.040 --> 13:37.040
It's just going to get worse.

13:37.040 --> 13:38.040
There's a little wrinkle to this one.

13:38.040 --> 13:40.040
Oh, there is a little wrinkle to this one.

13:40.040 --> 13:42.040
I thought we'd try to bump those numbers

13:42.040 --> 13:45.040
that way we could send them a fair amount of cash.

13:45.040 --> 13:47.040
We're doing a raffle this time around.

13:47.040 --> 13:49.040
R-r-r-raffle.

13:49.040 --> 13:50.040
Raffle.

13:50.040 --> 13:51.040
You can win.

13:51.040 --> 13:53.040
I hope I win.

13:53.040 --> 13:55.040
He hopes he wins.

13:55.040 --> 13:57.040
I hope I win.

13:57.040 --> 13:59.040
No, I'm saving that for Jesus.

13:59.040 --> 14:00.040
That's right.

14:00.040 --> 14:02.040
Like when he comes back.

14:02.040 --> 14:04.040
When he comes on your back.

14:04.040 --> 14:05.040
Soon.

14:05.040 --> 14:06.040
Yeah.

14:06.040 --> 14:07.040
Soon.

14:07.040 --> 14:08.040
Enter me.

14:08.040 --> 14:10.040
Yeah, you should let Jesus into you.

14:10.040 --> 14:11.040
A resurrection.

14:11.040 --> 14:12.040
Her heart?

14:12.040 --> 14:14.040
There's a left behind joke here.

14:14.040 --> 14:15.040
Res-e-rection?

14:15.040 --> 14:17.040
Is that what you're trying to say?

14:17.040 --> 14:18.040
He just-

14:18.040 --> 14:19.040
A resurrection.

14:19.040 --> 14:20.040
A res-e-rection.

14:20.040 --> 14:21.040
A res-e-rection.

14:21.040 --> 14:24.040
Wow, we're going to have to cut out so much of this fucking-

14:24.040 --> 14:29.040
Every $5 newly subscribed or upgraded Patreon subscription will get you one entry into the

14:29.040 --> 14:30.040
raffle.

14:30.040 --> 14:33.040
We're going to do three raffle winners at the end of December.

14:33.040 --> 14:38.040
Two of you will receive a PTBP t-shirt, any design you want from the merch store or the

14:38.040 --> 14:43.040
season one Patreon exclusive merch or the season two Patreon exclusive merch, which

14:43.040 --> 14:48.040
we're dropping this month in December and will be available to patrons in January.

14:48.040 --> 14:49.040
And it's really cool.

14:49.040 --> 14:50.040
And it's fun.

14:50.040 --> 14:51.040
It's really fucking cool.

14:51.040 --> 14:52.040
Sick.

14:52.040 --> 14:53.040
Is it though?

14:53.040 --> 14:59.040
And we are going to have the third winner either receive a shirt, if you want that you

14:59.040 --> 15:02.040
can have a shirt, or if you'd prefer-

15:02.040 --> 15:06.040
You can write a song and we'll use it as the theme song.

15:06.040 --> 15:07.040
I mean, sure.

15:07.040 --> 15:08.040
Should we start doing that?

15:08.040 --> 15:09.040
That's pretty fun.

15:09.040 --> 15:11.040
Yeah, if you'd prefer that.

15:11.040 --> 15:12.040
And it's good.

15:12.040 --> 15:13.040
Hopefully you know how to do that.

15:13.040 --> 15:14.040
If not, we'll be interested.

15:14.040 --> 15:15.040
Oh yeah, don't-

15:15.040 --> 15:18.040
Then get a shirt.

15:18.040 --> 15:22.040
Let's please volunteer yourself for second and third place if you can.

15:22.040 --> 15:23.040
Okay, let's do it.

15:23.040 --> 15:25.040
Let's do a different option if they don't want to do the music.

15:25.040 --> 15:26.040
Did we say what they actually get?

15:26.040 --> 15:27.040
No, we haven't said what they actually get yet.

15:27.040 --> 15:30.040
If you don't want to do the music option, we'll make another one up.

15:30.040 --> 15:31.040
Okay, what would be cool?

15:32.040 --> 15:33.040
What if they got to-

15:33.040 --> 15:37.040
They can play in a game with the three of you as their fellow players.

15:37.040 --> 15:38.040
Oh, with the boys?

15:38.040 --> 15:41.040
And I'll run it and it'll be home brewed by me.

15:41.040 --> 15:42.040
Daddy and the boys?

15:42.040 --> 15:43.040
Daddy and the boys.

15:43.040 --> 15:47.040
And they only have to upgrade just like $5 to the entry?

15:47.040 --> 15:49.040
$5 will be in one entry.

15:49.040 --> 15:52.040
To get one entry, which is kind of cool if you're already at the $5 level and you want

15:52.040 --> 15:57.040
to see us record those Den of Sins, you can bump up to $15, get yourself two entries.

15:57.040 --> 15:59.040
Speaking of which, in the Den of Sin-

15:59.040 --> 16:00.040
Wait, that already happened.

16:00.040 --> 16:01.040
Nevermind.

16:01.040 --> 16:02.040
Cut.

16:02.040 --> 16:03.040
Oh yeah.

16:03.040 --> 16:04.040
It hasn't happened, but it will have.

16:04.040 --> 16:09.040
But if you're a Patreon subscriber at any level, you can enjoy the Patreon exclusive

16:09.040 --> 16:12.040
campaign, the hunt for John Lee Pettymore's gold.

16:12.040 --> 16:13.040
But gold.

16:13.040 --> 16:14.040
But gold.

16:14.040 --> 16:15.040
But gold.

16:15.040 --> 16:16.040
But gold.

16:16.040 --> 16:17.040
But gold.

16:17.040 --> 16:18.040
The hunt for John Lee Pettymore's gold.

16:18.040 --> 16:19.040
I'm but a gold.

16:19.040 --> 16:20.040
Oh, it's not even that.

16:20.040 --> 16:21.040
It's the hunt for John Lee.

16:21.040 --> 16:25.040
The lost treasure of John Lee Pettymore.

16:25.040 --> 16:26.040
Wow.

16:27.040 --> 16:31.040
I really wanted it to be gold, but I couldn't find a way to logically think how John Lee

16:31.040 --> 16:37.040
Pettymore would convert his cash to gold in the time he had alive in the world.

16:37.040 --> 16:40.040
So it has to just be lost treasure.

16:40.040 --> 16:42.040
But gold would be such a better title.

16:42.040 --> 16:44.040
Anyway, the lost treasure of John Lee Pettymore.

16:44.040 --> 16:46.040
It's a Patreon exclusive campaign.

16:46.040 --> 16:49.040
At any level you sign up for that, you'll get episodes of that, which will be coming

16:49.040 --> 16:52.040
out starting in December and going on for a few months after that.

16:52.040 --> 16:58.040
And those are podcast episodes, audio episodes, and that will be the 39th one that we will

16:58.040 --> 16:59.040
release.

16:59.040 --> 17:01.040
So there's 39 bonus episodes over on Patreon.

17:01.040 --> 17:02.040
Go hit that out.

17:02.040 --> 17:03.040
Oh, and one other note.

17:03.040 --> 17:07.040
We've got an editor here at Pretending to Be People.

17:07.040 --> 17:08.040
Ooh.

17:08.040 --> 17:09.040
Who is it?

17:09.040 --> 17:10.040
Who is it?

17:10.040 --> 17:12.040
It's our friend and collaborator.

17:12.040 --> 17:13.040
Collaborator.

17:13.040 --> 17:14.040
Collaborator.

17:14.040 --> 17:15.040
Collaborator.

17:15.040 --> 17:16.040
Collaborator.

17:16.040 --> 17:17.040
His name is-

17:17.040 --> 17:18.040
Is it Taylor?

17:18.040 --> 17:21.040
No, that's not a name pun.

17:22.040 --> 17:23.040
Nope.

17:23.040 --> 17:24.040
He already is a collaborator.

17:24.040 --> 17:26.040
Am I getting closer?

17:26.040 --> 17:33.040
His name is Cole Simmons of Brat Pit and now known as Mint Fatigue.

17:33.040 --> 17:35.040
And also what did he do?

17:35.040 --> 17:37.040
Oh, maybe he wrote some lyrics.

17:37.040 --> 17:39.040
Am I correct?

17:39.040 --> 17:40.040
Music.

17:40.040 --> 17:43.040
Or other way around, wrote some music for a certain podcast theme song?

17:43.040 --> 17:49.040
I believe he produced and wrote, co-produced and co-wrote the music of our current season

17:49.040 --> 17:50.040
two theme song.

17:50.040 --> 17:52.040
My life is great and it's all my fault by all.

17:52.040 --> 17:53.040
What a good song.

17:53.040 --> 17:54.040
What a great song.

17:54.040 --> 17:55.040
Hell yeah.

17:55.040 --> 17:56.040
Great songs.

17:56.040 --> 17:57.040
Great song for a good podcast.

17:57.040 --> 17:58.040
Good job, Cole.

17:58.040 --> 18:04.040
Anyway, so Cole is doing our first initial sweep of the podcast to do a nice edit through

18:04.040 --> 18:05.040
there for me.

18:05.040 --> 18:10.040
That way I can come on through and do the little creative edits I like to do afterwards

18:10.040 --> 18:13.040
without spending so much of my time editing.

18:13.040 --> 18:18.040
And I'm just so happy to have Cole here with us at Pretending to Be People.

18:18.040 --> 18:22.240
Cole removes everything problematic we say and then Zach goes back and creatively edits

18:22.240 --> 18:24.040
the things we actually said to make us something problematic.

18:24.040 --> 18:25.040
AI has gotten really, really good.

18:25.040 --> 18:28.040
It's a fun little game they like to play.

18:28.040 --> 18:31.040
I feel like Cole is in the room with us here in a creepy way.

18:31.040 --> 18:35.040
I know Cole in the chilies.

18:35.040 --> 18:38.040
Also our new sponsor, Chilies.

18:38.040 --> 18:39.040
That's enough.

18:39.040 --> 18:40.040
Let's get into this fucking thing.

18:40.040 --> 18:44.040
Let's start shouting out aspirational sponsors.

18:44.040 --> 18:45.040
Aspirin.

18:45.040 --> 18:46.040
Aspirin.

18:46.040 --> 18:49.040
You can get your aspirational dorm room at Target.

18:49.040 --> 18:51.040
Everything you need for back to school.

18:51.040 --> 18:52.040
Target's a big swing.

18:52.040 --> 18:55.040
Which was several months ago.

18:55.040 --> 18:57.040
And coming up, depending on if you're listening to this.

18:57.040 --> 18:58.040
Christmas!

18:58.040 --> 18:59.040
It's Christmas at Target.

18:59.040 --> 19:02.040
It's Christmas at Target.

19:02.040 --> 19:03.040
You hear those sleigh bells?

19:03.040 --> 19:05.040
Ding-a-ding-ding-ding-a-ding.

19:05.040 --> 19:06.040
What do we have?

19:06.040 --> 19:08.040
Fucking 45 minutes of bullshit and no podcast right now?

19:08.040 --> 19:10.040
It's actually not as much as I thought.

19:10.040 --> 19:11.040
We're doing pretty good.

19:11.040 --> 19:14.040
I thought we had a solid 20 at least.

19:14.040 --> 19:15.040
16?

19:15.040 --> 19:16.040
That's not great.

19:16.040 --> 19:20.040
We're headed down to 12, which isn't too insufferable.

19:20.040 --> 19:25.040
Don't be too selective with your edits here, Cole.

19:25.040 --> 19:27.040
Alright, let's get this straight.

19:27.040 --> 19:32.040
You went with Stevie, the new intern and secret eldest child of Fred Godell, to an anonymously

19:32.040 --> 19:36.040
submitted dropped pin, which had been secretly submitted by Stevie.

19:36.040 --> 19:41.040
And that led you to a series of road signs telling you to turn around and a dead end

19:41.040 --> 19:46.040
with a dense tree line, which was secretly a wall covered in plants and bushes and trees.

19:46.040 --> 19:51.040
And inside was an unnaturally smooth gorge and a single simple steel train car took you

19:51.040 --> 19:54.040
across the wildly deep and foggy ravine with strangely slick sides.

19:54.040 --> 19:59.040
Of course, after you left behind all food and drink, which Stevie explained was secretly

19:59.040 --> 20:03.040
a ploy by Fred Godell because caffeine makes it harder for him to affect your mind.

20:03.040 --> 20:06.040
Which is why the train couldn't actually detect the lasagna.

20:06.040 --> 20:07.040
Caffeine-free lasagna.

20:07.040 --> 20:08.040
And then you finally-

20:08.040 --> 20:09.040
Now at Target.

20:09.040 --> 20:11.040
That's right, folks.

20:11.040 --> 20:16.040
And then you finally got in the Can-Van, family-sized frozen lasagna for the holiday season.

20:16.040 --> 20:17.040
And you started driving.

20:17.040 --> 20:18.040
$14.99.

20:18.040 --> 20:19.040
Even had a full tank of gas.

20:19.040 --> 20:24.040
But at the very first gas station, from the one-way road to Godell's Gate to Grover's

20:24.040 --> 20:30.040
Gorge, there at each pump, a green Range Rover, and stepping out of one while staring directly

20:30.040 --> 20:36.040
at the Can-Van, was president of the Godell company himself, Fred Godell.

20:37.040 --> 20:42.040
And then, quote unquote, safely, back in the city, you left God in the tied up body of

20:42.040 --> 20:48.040
Fox Godell with Stevie, just the two of them, where else but in Cal Colorado's basement.

20:48.040 --> 20:50.040
It's a very well-built basement.

20:50.040 --> 20:55.040
And then you decided to keep Vivica in the room to do a better edit of the footage from

20:55.040 --> 20:56.040
Grover's Gorge.

20:56.040 --> 20:59.040
And she crit-failed her grip check.

20:59.040 --> 21:04.040
Does anyone have anything they'd like to say about any of that?

21:04.040 --> 21:05.040
I'm sorry, Vivica.

21:05.040 --> 21:09.040
I did want to mention, in re-listening to the episode, that we all made a point not

21:09.040 --> 21:11.040
to show her any of the God stuff.

21:11.040 --> 21:15.040
So she's at least not as freaked in the bean as she could be.

21:15.040 --> 21:16.040
Freaked in the bean.

21:16.040 --> 21:18.040
You did keep her away from the God stuff.

21:18.040 --> 21:22.040
Sorry, we thought sanity was problematic, so this season we're going to have freaked

21:22.040 --> 21:25.040
in the bean rolls.

21:25.040 --> 21:28.040
Brought to you by Busch's Baked Beans.

21:28.040 --> 21:31.040
Found a target.

21:31.040 --> 21:33.040
Freaked in the bean indeed.

21:33.040 --> 21:39.040
She was spared, perhaps, some sort of mental break there, but the critical failure on seeing

21:39.040 --> 21:47.040
those human-animal hybrids at the end, which were outlined by Beck Wilder in the edit,

21:47.040 --> 21:49.040
that's really what did it.

21:49.040 --> 21:50.040
The people animals?

21:50.040 --> 21:53.040
Yeah, yeah, I think that more than anything.

21:53.040 --> 21:55.040
Yeah, they were like covered in blood too.

21:55.040 --> 21:59.040
One of them had like a pug face, but a human body.

21:59.040 --> 22:04.040
And I was asked on Instagram by a famous pretending to be people artist, Slidewhistle.

22:04.040 --> 22:05.040
Shout out to Slidewhistle.

22:05.040 --> 22:06.040
Shout out to Slidewhistle.

22:06.040 --> 22:13.040
Slidewhistle asked if the pug face was like furry, like a dog face, or if it had like

22:13.040 --> 22:16.040
human skin flaps, but then in the shape of a pug.

22:16.040 --> 22:17.040
Excellent question.

22:17.040 --> 22:18.040
And I asked which was worse.

22:18.040 --> 22:20.040
I think a little bit of fur.

22:20.040 --> 22:25.040
And they said just the human skin with the flaps.

22:25.040 --> 22:26.040
So it was that?

22:26.040 --> 22:28.040
So I said that, yeah, for sure it's that.

22:28.040 --> 22:29.040
I agree.

22:29.040 --> 22:30.040
So that's awful.

22:30.040 --> 22:31.040
So that's nasty.

22:31.040 --> 22:32.040
And cute Hannah.

22:32.040 --> 22:38.040
What if it has like real thin like Charlie Brown hair, the kind you can totally see through.

22:38.040 --> 22:41.040
And it's just like in weird patches.

22:41.040 --> 22:42.040
Ugh, ducky ducky.

22:42.040 --> 22:44.040
Somebody do AI of that.

22:44.040 --> 22:48.040
Oh, somebody do AI of that.

22:48.040 --> 22:49.040
Somebody do AI of that.

22:49.040 --> 22:53.040
We're no longer asking for fan art.

22:54.040 --> 22:57.040
We're just asking for props.

23:03.040 --> 23:07.040
The editing bay has the air sucked out of it entirely and you can all hear the blood

23:07.040 --> 23:13.040
in your ears pounding through your heads as you see the images of the unnaturally lush

23:13.040 --> 23:21.040
greenery and the sounds of the bones and cartilage and Julius's face being broken and rearranged.

23:21.040 --> 23:26.040
And you're brought right back to the most dreadful and confusing place you've ever seen

23:26.040 --> 23:28.040
on a screen, much less been to.

23:28.040 --> 23:31.040
Back to Grover's gorge and you feel nauseous.

23:31.040 --> 23:34.040
But this was your goal.

23:34.040 --> 23:38.040
You technically succeeded, but how these mixed emotions land on you right now, it's really

23:38.040 --> 23:40.040
up to the roll of the dice.

23:40.040 --> 23:42.040
So I'm going to need a grip check from each of you.

23:42.040 --> 23:47.040
And if you pass this grip check, the success and pride you feel in a mission accomplished

23:47.040 --> 23:52.040
pushes through the horrific memories and cements a stronger resolve.

23:52.040 --> 23:59.040
And you'll be able to add 1d8 to your grip and you'll be able to add 1d10 to any skill

23:59.040 --> 24:04.040
of your choosing with an explanation of how this resolve makes you better in that skill.

24:04.040 --> 24:09.040
But if you fail, the swirling, well, we'll get to that if you all fail there.

24:11.040 --> 24:12.040
Yeah, I fail.

24:12.040 --> 24:13.040
I failed.

24:13.040 --> 24:14.040
I failed.

24:14.040 --> 24:16.040
God, you gave us such a cool thing we could have done.

24:16.040 --> 24:17.040
I know.

24:17.040 --> 24:20.040
You've never given us cool shit before.

24:20.040 --> 24:21.040
Ever.

24:21.040 --> 24:22.040
Ever.

24:22.040 --> 24:25.040
You never give us anything.

24:25.040 --> 24:33.040
If you fail, the swirling mix of devastation and helplessness will overwhelm you while

24:33.040 --> 24:37.040
you lose yourselves in the footage playing in the editing bay and you won't be able

24:37.040 --> 24:43.040
to take your eyes off the screens and you'll miss Vivica tensing up like a horse editing

24:43.040 --> 24:45.040
a commercial for fireworks.

24:45.040 --> 24:47.040
You mean a dog?

24:47.040 --> 24:49.040
You mean glue?

24:58.040 --> 25:03.040
You're going to tense up like a horse editing a commercial for glue.

25:08.040 --> 25:09.040
Which is what she does.

25:09.040 --> 25:11.040
Tenses up like a horse editing a commercial for glue.

25:11.040 --> 25:14.040
She tenses up like a horse editing a commercial for glue.

25:14.040 --> 25:18.040
She tenses up like a dog editing a commercial for fireworks.

25:18.040 --> 25:19.040
She's tense?

25:19.040 --> 25:20.040
We don't see it though, right?

25:20.040 --> 25:21.040
Yeah, we all failed.

25:21.040 --> 25:22.040
We missed it.

25:22.040 --> 25:23.040
Yeah, you all failed.

25:23.040 --> 25:29.040
So, wrapped up in your own sort of situation, she tensely continues the edit and wraps

25:29.040 --> 25:30.040
up.

25:30.040 --> 25:31.040
Okay.

25:31.040 --> 25:32.040
Wow.

25:32.040 --> 25:33.040
Yeah.

25:33.040 --> 25:34.040
Wow, right?

25:34.040 --> 25:36.040
Like, it's really something, isn't it?

25:36.040 --> 25:37.040
I've never seen anything-

25:37.040 --> 25:38.040
You handled it really well.

25:38.040 --> 25:40.040
It's going to, I mean, this is good news, right?

25:40.040 --> 25:41.040
Don't you think this is good?

25:41.040 --> 25:44.040
I mean, not this is bad news, but don't you think this makes great news?

25:44.040 --> 25:47.040
I, we're going to get promotions.

25:47.040 --> 25:49.040
She's like holding back vomit.

25:49.040 --> 25:50.040
Hey, hey, hey.

25:50.040 --> 25:54.040
I know you're probably thinking right now about local Emmys and that's making you nervous,

25:54.040 --> 25:58.040
but, well, let me say you're right to be nervous because I can't imagine anything beating

25:58.040 --> 25:59.040
you this year.

25:59.040 --> 26:00.040
We're talking Pulitzer.

26:00.040 --> 26:07.040
Just looking at the computer tower, just looking at the monitors, just looks back at you, starts

26:07.040 --> 26:09.040
shaking your head no.

26:09.040 --> 26:13.040
I know you're a perfectionist, but I saw your cut and it's good.

26:13.040 --> 26:14.040
We've got to get it out immediately.

26:14.040 --> 26:15.040
People need to see this, Vivica.

26:15.040 --> 26:17.040
I know you probably want more time with it, right?

26:17.040 --> 26:18.040
She nods.

26:18.040 --> 26:21.040
Typh has to see it and it'll have to go out tomorrow, right?

26:21.040 --> 26:24.040
She's running her hands over her face and-

26:24.040 --> 26:28.040
This is perhaps the most consequential story of the last 20 years.

26:28.040 --> 26:29.040
This is 9-11, Vivica.

26:29.040 --> 26:30.040
This is your 9-11.

26:30.040 --> 26:32.040
But, like, in a good way.

26:32.040 --> 26:34.040
I don't understand how that makes me comfortable.

26:34.040 --> 26:37.040
Can I just throw a persuade role on this is your 9-11?

26:37.040 --> 26:38.040
Yeah, go ahead and roll.

26:38.040 --> 26:42.040
Yeah, I started role-playing a reasonable response.

26:42.040 --> 26:44.040
How foolish of me.

26:44.040 --> 26:45.040
That's a pass.

26:45.040 --> 26:49.040
71 on an 80.

26:49.040 --> 26:51.040
Opportunities like this don't come around very often, you're right.

26:51.040 --> 26:54.040
Yeah, I just worry about the larger implications.

26:54.040 --> 26:57.040
We worry about the larger implications of it not getting out, wouldn't you say?

26:57.040 --> 27:01.040
So we're just going to, Bec, can you just burn yourself a copy there that we're going

27:01.040 --> 27:05.040
to get sent out of the editing room over to production?

27:05.040 --> 27:07.040
You can keep working on this for your sizzle reel.

27:07.040 --> 27:08.040
Bec pulls out a thumb drive.

27:08.040 --> 27:09.040
Yeah, yeah.

27:09.040 --> 27:14.040
And I just go over and just plug it straight in and maybe kind of move her out of the way

27:14.040 --> 27:17.040
to get to the keyboard to just go ahead and drop it over there into the thumb drive.

27:17.040 --> 27:18.040
Does it go off without a hitch?

27:18.040 --> 27:20.040
Roll computer.

27:20.040 --> 27:22.040
Science.

27:22.040 --> 27:23.040
That's a pass.

27:23.040 --> 27:24.040
34 on a 60.

27:24.040 --> 27:26.040
It goes off without a hitch.

27:26.040 --> 27:27.040
I plug it out.

27:27.040 --> 27:29.040
Vivica, this is going to be a good thing.

27:29.040 --> 27:31.040
Like, did you see that medical device in there?

27:31.040 --> 27:35.040
Like, I know you freaked out by, like, the scary stuff, but there's also stuff there

27:35.040 --> 27:38.040
that's going to revolutionize the way we do medicine.

27:38.040 --> 27:40.040
Like, it could cure cancer.

27:40.040 --> 27:43.040
She's just stone face staring at the floor.

27:43.040 --> 27:44.040
Vivica, are you okay?

27:44.040 --> 27:46.040
Are you having personal problems?

27:46.040 --> 27:48.040
I'm not having personal problems.

27:48.040 --> 27:51.040
I'm having problems with what I just saw, obviously.

27:51.040 --> 27:53.040
I'm fucking having problems with what I just saw, Cal.

27:53.040 --> 27:57.040
And you're asking me if I have personal problems right now.

27:57.040 --> 27:59.040
What the fuck is wrong with you?

27:59.040 --> 28:00.040
You're right.

28:00.040 --> 28:01.040
You're right.

28:01.040 --> 28:07.040
I feel like I already dealt with some of these truths, and I apologize if we thrust this upon you, as it were.

28:07.040 --> 28:11.040
We've had a little more time to process this than you have, apparently.

28:11.040 --> 28:12.040
Yes, exactly.

28:12.040 --> 28:14.040
But we didn't want to go to anybody but you with this, Vivica.

28:14.040 --> 28:16.040
You're the best in the business.

28:16.040 --> 28:17.040
It had to be you.

28:17.040 --> 28:21.040
We thought you would be, you know, strong enough to handle it versus hiding it from you.

28:21.040 --> 28:23.040
And you would really do it justice.

28:23.040 --> 28:24.040
And you have.

28:24.040 --> 28:25.040
It's a good edit.

28:25.040 --> 28:26.040
It's a great edit.

28:26.040 --> 28:27.040
This is what this is, Vivica.

28:27.040 --> 28:29.040
This is justice, putting this out in the world.

28:29.040 --> 28:30.040
You saw what they did.

28:30.040 --> 28:32.040
You saw the footage from the It Pit.

28:32.040 --> 28:33.040
It has to be out there.

28:33.040 --> 28:34.040
Fine.

28:34.040 --> 28:39.040
So we're probably going to have, like, seven or eight different days where we show this footage.

28:39.040 --> 28:42.040
So maybe, you know, adrenaline if you're not tired.

28:42.040 --> 28:45.040
Any kind of motions towards, like, her workstation.

28:45.040 --> 28:48.040
Or if you need to, you know, get some rest.

28:48.040 --> 28:50.040
I'll be right back. I'll be right back. I'll be right back.

28:50.040 --> 28:52.040
We're handling this well.

28:52.040 --> 28:55.040
As the door closes behind her.

28:55.040 --> 28:57.040
What time is it right now?

28:57.040 --> 28:59.040
What, like 2.30 in the morning?

28:59.040 --> 29:02.040
Oh, okay. So there's no way my uncle is here right now?

29:02.040 --> 29:05.040
No. No, he's at the bar still, at least.

29:05.040 --> 29:08.040
Well, in the city, they stay up until, like, five sometimes.

29:08.040 --> 29:09.040
Well, and he wasn't at...

29:09.040 --> 29:12.040
Especially if you call it a private club.

29:12.040 --> 29:14.040
If you have the proper permits.

29:14.040 --> 29:17.040
Luke, he also wasn't at work today.

29:17.040 --> 29:19.040
Yeah, and he's not answering texts, right?

29:19.040 --> 29:20.040
That's right.

29:20.040 --> 29:23.040
Didn't somebody tell us that he was going to a meeting or something?

29:23.040 --> 29:26.040
Somebody at least gave a reason for his absence.

29:26.040 --> 29:28.040
Yes, he was at a meeting at City Tower.

29:28.040 --> 29:30.040
It's a big tower that looks like a T.

29:32.040 --> 29:33.040
No.

29:35.040 --> 29:41.040
Vivica is in the bathroom, and the three of you have wrapped up this edit.

29:41.040 --> 29:42.040
Good job. Good job, man.

29:42.040 --> 29:44.040
I can't wait until I see it on TV.

29:44.040 --> 29:47.040
Do you guys, like, after seeing how Vivica reacted,

29:47.040 --> 29:49.040
have any, like, second thoughts now?

29:49.040 --> 29:50.040
Like, that's gonna...

29:50.040 --> 29:52.040
What just happened is gonna happen all over the city,

29:52.040 --> 29:55.040
and then we're not gonna be there to help talk him down.

29:55.040 --> 29:59.040
I think maybe that's the kind of outrage we need to fight against Grover's Gorge.

29:59.040 --> 30:01.040
Was it outrage or abject terror?

30:01.040 --> 30:06.040
I think our audience is smart enough to decide for themselves.

30:06.040 --> 30:10.040
We try to not hold their hands, or at least we did when I was an anchor here.

30:10.040 --> 30:13.040
I think... I think we can trust them.

30:13.040 --> 30:14.040
I'm just saying...

30:14.040 --> 30:15.040
People will recognize.

30:15.040 --> 30:18.040
Vivica's, like, a hardened, like, professional who's edited, like,

30:18.040 --> 30:21.040
everything that's come through here, and she's never had a reaction like that.

30:21.040 --> 30:23.040
Are you afraid of success, Clark?

30:24.040 --> 30:25.040
Who's Clark?

30:31.040 --> 30:33.040
Cal, are you okay?

30:33.040 --> 30:34.040
It's me, Beck.

30:34.040 --> 30:35.040
Seriously, are you okay?

30:35.040 --> 30:38.040
I'm... I'm... I'm fine, Beck.

30:38.040 --> 30:40.040
Are you fine? Are you afraid of success?

30:40.040 --> 30:42.040
I don't know. I guess if that... Maybe I am.

30:42.040 --> 30:46.040
If it's, like, success on one hand, and, like, you know,

30:46.040 --> 30:51.040
people not being able to live in the world that we present them as fact now,

30:51.040 --> 30:52.040
I don't know which is worth it.

30:52.040 --> 30:55.040
I didn't go through all that to not have a producer credit in this,

30:55.040 --> 30:57.040
so I think it's going up.

30:57.040 --> 30:59.040
What if we take another pass at it, and, like,

30:59.040 --> 31:02.040
maybe just take out a few of the more mind-blowing things?

31:02.040 --> 31:06.040
Maybe the animal people come out, and we save that for later?

31:06.040 --> 31:08.040
Perhaps you might be on to something.

31:08.040 --> 31:13.040
A whole week of series progressively leading up to...

31:13.040 --> 31:14.040
He's into it.

31:14.040 --> 31:18.040
Hey, Julius, this will increase numbers.

31:18.040 --> 31:19.040
Absolutely.

31:19.040 --> 31:21.040
As we tease the real things.

31:21.040 --> 31:23.040
But it will also, yes, perhaps,

31:23.040 --> 31:26.040
anesthetize the population to some extent

31:26.040 --> 31:29.040
against the kind of surely atypical reaction we've seen here.

31:31.040 --> 31:34.040
At that exact moment, the glass door that goes in,

31:34.040 --> 31:37.040
the frosty glass door that leads into the editing bay,

31:37.040 --> 31:42.040
it's a pole, and it is being pushed as a body slams into it,

31:42.040 --> 31:46.040
and then disheveled opens the door, flinging it open,

31:46.040 --> 31:49.040
and you see Kurt, you guys would know Kurt.

31:49.040 --> 31:51.040
He's in his thirties, but he looks older,

31:51.040 --> 31:53.040
his eyes are sunken in,

31:53.040 --> 31:56.040
and he's wearing a disheveled can windbreaker.

31:56.040 --> 31:59.040
He's got big curly hair on top,

31:59.040 --> 32:01.040
and as he kind of pushes in,

32:01.040 --> 32:04.040
you see he's got an old TCN polo

32:04.040 --> 32:07.040
underneath his can windbreaker.

32:07.040 --> 32:11.040
You know, Kurt goes around and shops wild videos

32:11.040 --> 32:13.040
to different news agencies that he's taken

32:13.040 --> 32:16.040
throughout the late evening of night,

32:16.040 --> 32:18.040
and he kind of flings the door open,

32:18.040 --> 32:22.040
and is like, boys, I got something for you.

32:22.040 --> 32:24.040
Oh, let me get the voice.

32:24.040 --> 32:26.040
Oh, I was glaring at you in character,

32:26.040 --> 32:28.040
not because I disapproved of your voice choice.

32:28.040 --> 32:29.040
Boys, welcome.

32:29.040 --> 32:32.040
Boys, boys, welcome to daddy.

32:32.040 --> 32:33.040
Oh, boy.

32:33.040 --> 32:36.040
Is that your entry phrase, to this voice?

32:36.040 --> 32:38.040
Boys, welcome to daddy.

32:38.040 --> 32:40.040
Welcome to daddy.

32:40.040 --> 32:42.040
No, I'm back in it.

32:42.040 --> 32:44.040
Welcome, welcome, welcome.

32:44.040 --> 32:47.040
Boys, welcome to daddy.

32:47.040 --> 32:52.040
It is I, Kurt, typical American guy.

32:52.040 --> 32:55.040
I want to be your dad.

32:55.040 --> 32:57.040
I am Kurt.

32:57.040 --> 32:59.040
What's the voice?

32:59.040 --> 33:01.040
He flings the door.

33:01.040 --> 33:04.040
He flings the mic in Luke's face.

33:04.040 --> 33:06.040
He flings the mic.

33:06.040 --> 33:07.040
Sorry, Cole.

33:07.040 --> 33:08.040
He flings the door open.

33:08.040 --> 33:09.040
Hey, it's me, Kurt.

33:09.040 --> 33:10.040
Hello.

33:10.040 --> 33:11.040
Hello, it is I, Kurtis.

33:11.040 --> 33:13.040
Call me daddy.

33:14.040 --> 33:17.040
Oh, no.

33:17.040 --> 33:18.040
No, thank you.

33:18.040 --> 33:20.040
Wrong editing, babe.

33:23.040 --> 33:26.040
Guys, it's Kurt, the mute nightcrawler.

33:34.040 --> 33:38.040
He walks in and hands you a notepad.

33:38.040 --> 33:39.040
Where you guys crawl on it.

33:39.040 --> 33:41.040
What do you want, Kurt?

33:41.040 --> 33:44.040
No, it says welcome to daddy.

33:50.040 --> 33:53.040
I grabbed the video from him and pop it in and see what it is.

33:53.040 --> 33:55.040
He flings the door open.

33:55.040 --> 33:57.040
Hello, boys.

33:57.040 --> 34:05.040
You must call me daddy because I have footage that you are going to really love.

34:05.040 --> 34:13.040
Oh, your mind may not be prepared to handle the footage that I have for you this evening.

34:13.040 --> 34:15.040
I want you to prepare.

34:15.040 --> 34:17.040
Hey, Kurt.

34:17.040 --> 34:18.040
Hello, Kurt.

34:18.040 --> 34:20.040
We're not going to call you daddy.

34:20.040 --> 34:21.040
We tell you that every time.

34:21.040 --> 34:24.040
I don't know why, but also, we have some...

34:24.040 --> 34:25.040
Oh, Julius.

34:25.040 --> 34:26.040
Oh, Julius, no.

34:26.040 --> 34:28.040
I just only recently met him.

34:28.040 --> 34:29.040
I thought it was just...

34:29.040 --> 34:31.040
No, Julius, he gets every new employee.

34:31.040 --> 34:33.040
He introduced himself to me as daddy.

34:33.040 --> 34:36.040
Oh, Julius, no.

34:36.040 --> 34:38.040
Oh, this is very disappointing.

34:38.040 --> 34:39.040
Julius feels dirty.

34:39.040 --> 34:40.040
Kurt, you ought to be ashamed.

34:40.040 --> 34:44.040
He's just winking at Julius.

34:44.040 --> 34:45.040
Julius, I'm sorry.

34:45.040 --> 34:46.040
This is Kurt.

34:46.040 --> 34:50.040
He's a weirdo, a bad coworker, and a nightcrawler.

34:50.040 --> 34:51.040
Whoa, hey, come on.

34:51.040 --> 34:52.040
He's a nightcrawler.

34:52.040 --> 34:54.040
Well, let's see what you've got.

34:54.040 --> 34:57.040
We're probably pretty full up this week, but let's see.

34:57.040 --> 35:02.040
Yeah, this might be the last time you see us down in the non-executive editing bay.

35:02.040 --> 35:05.040
That's not a real thing, but we're on the up and up is what I mean.

35:05.040 --> 35:07.040
But let's see what footage you have.

35:07.040 --> 35:08.040
Beck likes Kurt.

35:21.040 --> 35:22.040
No.

35:22.040 --> 35:23.040
Kurt?

35:23.040 --> 35:24.040
Kurt, you got another tape?

35:24.040 --> 35:26.040
You're gonna love it, especially.

35:26.040 --> 35:27.040
It's fucked up, man.

35:27.040 --> 35:30.040
This isn't like that fish man from the other day,

35:30.040 --> 35:32.040
and it was just a guy taking a swim in the river, right?

35:32.040 --> 35:40.040
If you can tell me how this is not real, that would actually help my mental state.

35:40.040 --> 35:41.040
I don't know.

35:41.040 --> 35:42.040
I mean, I'm sorry, Kurt.

35:42.040 --> 35:44.040
No offense or some offense.

35:44.040 --> 35:49.040
I don't know what might help the mental state of a man such as you who chases ambulances

35:49.040 --> 35:51.040
to film the grisly aftermath.

35:51.040 --> 35:53.040
That is how it starts.

35:53.040 --> 35:55.040
We go back to your place.

35:55.040 --> 35:58.040
That's how it starts.

35:58.040 --> 36:01.040
Julius pops the video in to see what's on it.

36:01.040 --> 36:06.040
Starts with an ambulance, and you see he's sprinting up on an ambulance

36:06.040 --> 36:12.040
as the EMTs are rushing over to a car that is flipped over on a bridge in the city,

36:12.040 --> 36:14.040
looking out beyond this accident.

36:14.040 --> 36:17.040
You see the city skyscape in the background.

36:17.040 --> 36:19.040
That's what it's called.

36:19.040 --> 36:22.040
Kyle shakes his head and turns away, like looks away.

36:22.040 --> 36:26.040
The other two of you see a mother and daughter trapped in this car,

36:26.040 --> 36:32.040
and one of the EMTs is running up to try to pry open the door to get the two of them.

36:32.040 --> 36:37.040
Suddenly, out of nowhere, you hear coming out the left speakers, the audio.

36:37.040 --> 36:46.040
A car speeding through slams into the EMT, who is trying to help accident on top of accident.

36:46.040 --> 36:47.040
It's gruesome.

36:47.040 --> 36:49.040
The camera zooms in.

36:49.040 --> 36:52.040
He rushes towards them, trying to figure out what was going on.

36:52.040 --> 36:56.040
The camera whips over behind to see where the car came from.

36:56.040 --> 37:01.040
There's nothing, but then the camera sees people stopping on this bridge,

37:01.040 --> 37:06.040
getting out of their cars, looking up beyond and above the camera.

37:06.040 --> 37:08.040
The camera whips around.

37:08.040 --> 37:12.040
It's like a bolt of lightning that's continuously striking,

37:12.040 --> 37:14.040
or an unnaturally focused tornado.

37:14.040 --> 37:20.040
An unholy, stomach-dropping phenomenon connects the sky above and the bridge below,

37:20.040 --> 37:24.040
and Kurt begins running toward it, the camera bouncing up and down as he zooms,

37:24.040 --> 37:28.040
and pulls focus onto this vibrating, humming, electric, and wet mass

37:28.040 --> 37:32.040
that makes up this towering force of nature,

37:32.040 --> 37:36.040
this terrifying, unfamiliar weather pattern.

37:36.040 --> 37:39.040
Quietly to himself, but right into the microphone, Kurt states,

37:39.040 --> 37:47.040
Perhaps this is a new fear for the future of humanity as earthquakes and volcanoes once were

37:47.040 --> 37:50.040
for the first of our kind upon witnessing them.

37:50.040 --> 37:54.040
And then just as quickly as a lightning bolt flashes back into nothingness,

37:54.040 --> 37:57.040
this colossal cylinder of destruction is gone,

37:57.040 --> 38:03.040
and Kurt makes it to the front of a confused and scared crowd to shoot the wake of this devastation,

38:03.040 --> 38:09.040
and you all see a hole in this bridge about the size of a big revolving door at a mall,

38:09.040 --> 38:12.040
and Kurt approaches the edge with caution.

38:12.040 --> 38:16.040
You can hear onlookers screaming at him to get away and be careful,

38:16.040 --> 38:22.040
but he holds his camera out over the edge and you see the choppy waters of the enormous city river below,

38:22.040 --> 38:29.040
and there's a tugboat with a full barge, and it's too close to the changing tide.

38:29.040 --> 38:33.040
It's fighting, resisting the new path, but whatever that was,

38:33.040 --> 38:37.040
it punched a hole in the bottom of the city river,

38:37.040 --> 38:41.040
and this tugboat is circling the drain smoothly at first,

38:41.040 --> 38:44.040
and then violently, this vessel is ripped bow first,

38:44.040 --> 38:48.040
and it plunges into the unknown followed by its barge.

38:48.040 --> 38:51.040
Kurt doesn't move a fucking muscle,

38:51.040 --> 38:54.040
and after about 30 seconds worth of an eternity,

38:54.040 --> 38:58.040
the spiraling waters below slow their pattern,

38:58.040 --> 39:01.040
and the regular flow of the city river resumes,

39:01.040 --> 39:06.040
and as the camera zooms back out of the hole on this bridge,

39:06.040 --> 39:10.040
you all notice the unnaturally smooth edges

39:10.040 --> 39:12.040
where the bridge was punctured.

39:12.040 --> 39:15.040
You hear Kurt breathe into the microphone.

39:15.040 --> 39:19.040
The tearing nature is rough and ugly and leaves shrapnel,

39:19.040 --> 39:23.040
and this is clearly none of those things.

39:23.040 --> 39:25.040
He runs back, camera kind of bouncing,

39:25.040 --> 39:27.040
you see people all lined out,

39:27.040 --> 39:32.040
and he runs up to the first person he sees who looks like

39:32.040 --> 39:33.040
Carrot Top.

39:35.040 --> 39:37.040
He puts the camera on and says,

39:37.040 --> 39:39.040
Sir, what did you see?

39:39.040 --> 39:43.040
The person is mouth wide open, speechless.

39:43.040 --> 39:44.040
Smart.

39:46.040 --> 39:49.040
He runs up to the next person in the crowd.

39:49.040 --> 39:52.040
It's a kid, and he's also mouth agape,

39:52.040 --> 39:54.040
and he's staring at the hole,

39:54.040 --> 39:56.040
and he's looking into the camera,

39:56.040 --> 39:59.040
into the hole, into the camera.

39:59.040 --> 40:02.040
Is it like a special effect?

40:02.040 --> 40:06.040
It's like a ride,

40:06.040 --> 40:09.040
and then it's like a mirror, right?

40:09.040 --> 40:12.040
Yes, it must have been. Who are you here with?

40:12.040 --> 40:14.040
I just was taking a stroll.

40:22.040 --> 40:24.040
Your loved ones must be looking for you.

40:24.040 --> 40:26.040
It's like the kid that Will Smith shoots

40:26.040 --> 40:30.040
in the Men in Black testing facility,

40:30.040 --> 40:33.040
because they're out at midnight with physics textbooks.

40:35.040 --> 40:37.040
What the fuck are they up to?

40:39.040 --> 40:42.040
News story, the wandering children of the city.

40:44.040 --> 40:46.040
What, does the city have an urchin problem

40:46.040 --> 40:48.040
that we might explore a little later?

40:48.040 --> 40:49.040
All cities.

40:52.040 --> 40:54.040
And he goes up to the third person.

40:54.040 --> 40:56.040
Thomas, what do they look like?

40:56.040 --> 40:57.040
Carrot Top.

41:01.040 --> 41:04.040
The camera whips back around to the original Carrot Top.

41:04.040 --> 41:07.040
Well, it's his twin brother that's standing right next to him.

41:08.040 --> 41:10.040
Camera pans back and forth between the two of them.

41:10.040 --> 41:13.040
Must you be silent like your brother?

41:13.040 --> 41:16.040
What my brother said speaks for all of us, I think.

41:16.040 --> 41:18.040
You see several more Carrot Tops in the crowd.

41:19.040 --> 41:21.040
One of them comes up and goes,

41:21.040 --> 41:23.040
I think we've angered God.

41:23.040 --> 41:24.040
Yeah.

41:24.040 --> 41:27.040
Well, I mean, this sick society

41:27.040 --> 41:29.040
has been angering God for a long time.

41:30.040 --> 41:32.040
Well, you might be surprised.

41:32.040 --> 41:35.040
You might not, by what we believe.

41:36.040 --> 41:38.040
You want to interview us some more?

41:38.040 --> 41:39.040
Nope.

41:39.040 --> 41:40.040
Kurt runs away.

41:40.040 --> 41:41.040
Kurt runs away.

41:41.040 --> 41:42.040
The camera turns off and he's like,

41:42.040 --> 41:44.040
I couldn't get any other footage.

41:44.040 --> 41:47.040
So, Cal, you see, has been watching

41:47.040 --> 41:49.040
since his kind of false modesty at the start

41:49.040 --> 41:51.040
pretty much the whole time, and he chuckles.

41:51.040 --> 41:54.040
And he's like, okay, Kurt.

41:54.040 --> 41:56.040
Well, that's a very nice,

41:56.040 --> 41:58.040
is that your audition reel for Marvel

41:58.040 --> 42:00.040
or the Fast franchise?

42:00.040 --> 42:01.040
It's a little weird that you have a kid

42:01.040 --> 42:04.040
point out its special effects halfway through,

42:04.040 --> 42:06.040
but that was very well done, I suppose.

42:06.040 --> 42:08.040
That's better than what you normally

42:08.040 --> 42:10.040
apply yourself to, I guess.

42:10.040 --> 42:12.040
Let's get a grip check from everybody.

42:12.040 --> 42:15.040
See if that, see if Cal's bullshitting,

42:15.040 --> 42:17.040
or if he actually feels that way.

42:17.040 --> 42:18.040
Cal passes.

42:18.040 --> 42:19.040
Beck passes.

42:19.040 --> 42:20.040
Resilient.

42:20.040 --> 42:22.040
Cal feels that way, which is why he said it.

42:22.040 --> 42:23.040
I got a 99.

42:24.040 --> 42:28.040
Beck lets out a wily, like a Looney Tunes scream

42:28.040 --> 42:29.040
and runs out of it.

42:29.040 --> 42:30.040
I'm back.

42:30.040 --> 42:31.040
Who's back?

42:31.040 --> 42:32.040
God damn it.

42:32.040 --> 42:33.040
Clark, I'm fine.

42:35.040 --> 42:36.040
Do you mean Keith?

42:36.040 --> 42:38.040
Julius lets out a wily, god damn it.

42:38.040 --> 42:40.040
What happens, Julius?

42:44.040 --> 42:46.040
And that was just from seeing this footage.

42:46.040 --> 42:47.040
Yeah.

42:47.040 --> 42:50.040
Yeah, he also says, I think we've angered God.

42:50.040 --> 42:52.040
Go ahead and roll a D4.

42:52.040 --> 42:53.040
Nice.

42:55.040 --> 42:57.040
It's the one with four sides.

42:57.040 --> 42:58.040
He flipped me off.

42:58.040 --> 42:59.040
One.

42:59.040 --> 43:00.040
He flipped me off again.

43:03.040 --> 43:05.040
All right, you just lose one grip.

43:05.040 --> 43:06.040
Good.

43:07.040 --> 43:09.040
Can Beck look at that footage

43:09.040 --> 43:12.040
and see a time on it and try and compare

43:12.040 --> 43:14.040
maybe what we were doing in Grover's Gorge

43:14.040 --> 43:15.040
when this happened?

43:15.040 --> 43:17.040
Yeah, it seems to be,

43:17.040 --> 43:22.040
it seems to have happened roughly 20 to 30 minutes

43:22.040 --> 43:25.040
after you left Cal Colorado's house.

43:26.040 --> 43:27.040
Oh, no.

43:27.040 --> 43:28.040
It just reasons.

43:28.040 --> 43:29.040
Gotcha.

43:29.040 --> 43:30.040
We have angered God.

43:30.040 --> 43:31.040
Oh, shit.

43:31.040 --> 43:33.040
Can we, from landmarks in the footage

43:33.040 --> 43:36.040
or maybe just asking Kurt, where did this happen?

43:36.040 --> 43:38.040
Is it the neighbor near my house?

43:38.040 --> 43:39.040
Yeah.

43:39.040 --> 43:41.040
Okay, I call Stevie.

43:41.040 --> 43:42.040
Yeah, that phone.

43:42.040 --> 43:43.040
Bing, bing.

43:43.040 --> 43:44.040
Bing, bing.

43:44.040 --> 43:45.040
Bing, bing.

43:45.040 --> 43:46.040
Bing, bing.

43:46.040 --> 43:47.040
Bing, bing.

43:47.040 --> 43:48.040
Taylor again.

43:48.040 --> 43:49.040
Bing, bing.

43:49.040 --> 43:50.040
Bing, bing.

43:50.040 --> 43:52.040
And then it goes to Stevie's voicemail.

43:52.040 --> 43:55.040
Beck sees the look on Cal's face

43:55.040 --> 43:58.040
and Beck starts to get the drained blood

43:58.040 --> 43:59.040
from the head feeling.

43:59.040 --> 44:00.040
Hi, Stevie.

44:00.040 --> 44:02.040
Cal Colorado, City Action News.

44:02.040 --> 44:04.040
Just wanted to check in,

44:04.040 --> 44:07.040
see how y'all are doing in my basement.

44:07.040 --> 44:10.040
Hope you're having a good time.

44:10.040 --> 44:12.040
I did, you know about the pizza money I left.

44:12.040 --> 44:13.040
I think I told you about that.

44:13.040 --> 44:15.040
If you don't, there's $25 on the counter.

44:15.040 --> 44:17.040
If that's not enough for pizza these days,

44:17.040 --> 44:25.040
there is $1,500 in the front drawer of the desk in my office.

44:25.040 --> 44:29.040
So take as much as you need.

44:29.040 --> 44:31.040
I hope you're having a good time.

44:31.040 --> 44:33.040
Please just let me know that everything's okay.

44:33.040 --> 44:34.040
Thank you.

44:34.040 --> 44:35.040
Again, this is Cal Colorado.

44:35.040 --> 44:36.040
Good night.

44:36.040 --> 44:37.040
Choice.

44:37.040 --> 44:38.040
So good.

44:38.040 --> 44:41.040
Julius has kind of rewound the video

44:41.040 --> 44:44.040
and is on one of the lightning strike looking things.

44:44.040 --> 44:47.040
And is just like intently just staring at it

44:47.040 --> 44:50.040
and picking at his face.

44:50.040 --> 44:51.040
Gross.

44:51.040 --> 44:54.040
We got to go and check on our friend.

44:54.040 --> 44:56.040
Beck says, remembering that Kurt's there.

44:56.040 --> 44:58.040
We should check on our friend.

44:58.040 --> 45:00.040
Yeah, I'm terribly sorry, Kurt.

45:00.040 --> 45:03.040
Again, I do find this all very impressive

45:03.040 --> 45:06.040
and certainly better than your normal filth and depravity.

45:06.040 --> 45:09.040
You should pursue this passion for CG,

45:09.040 --> 45:11.040
computer-generated imagery.

45:11.040 --> 45:14.040
But we do have to go check on our friend.

45:14.040 --> 45:18.040
I really, really hope you have a pleasant evening.

45:18.040 --> 45:20.040
This has been Cal Colorado.

45:20.040 --> 45:23.040
Julius was in a daze a little bit and turns around

45:23.040 --> 45:25.040
and looks at Kurt and he's like,

45:25.040 --> 45:26.040
what's the rate, daddy?

45:26.040 --> 45:28.040
What's the rate, Kurt?

45:32.040 --> 45:35.040
And he pulls out a canned checkbook.

45:35.040 --> 45:38.040
Well, I would say for something like this,

45:39.040 --> 45:42.040
I'm hoping for 800.

45:42.040 --> 45:45.040
Julius writes a check for $500 and hands it to him.

45:47.040 --> 45:50.040
The F can look like an E, the five can look like an eight.

45:50.040 --> 45:51.040
Yep.

45:51.040 --> 45:52.040
This'll do.

45:54.040 --> 45:56.040
Does Julius hear him say that?

45:57.040 --> 45:58.040
What?

45:58.040 --> 46:00.040
And he's out.

46:00.040 --> 46:03.040
He's like, that's just $300.

46:03.040 --> 46:05.040
And as the three of you head out,

46:05.040 --> 46:07.040
is that the move?

46:07.040 --> 46:10.040
Yeah, I think Beck would want to just check on Vivica

46:10.040 --> 46:11.040
before we leave.

46:11.040 --> 46:12.040
Yeah.

46:12.040 --> 46:13.040
Maybe just tap on the bathroom door.

46:13.040 --> 46:14.040
Oh, yeah.

46:14.040 --> 46:17.040
We have a whole new release strategy to discuss with her.

46:17.040 --> 46:18.040
Okay, yeah.

46:18.040 --> 46:20.040
So when you tap on the door, she immediately opens it.

46:20.040 --> 46:23.040
Hey, Viv, I know you're having a tough time with this

46:23.040 --> 46:25.040
and we've talked about it and...

46:25.040 --> 46:26.040
She goes for a hug.

46:26.040 --> 46:27.040
Oh, hey.

46:27.040 --> 46:28.040
It's like kind of weird.

46:28.040 --> 46:29.040
It's like not normal.

46:29.040 --> 46:31.040
Hey, no, it's okay.

46:31.040 --> 46:33.040
We talked about it and you're right,

46:33.040 --> 46:35.040
that this is maybe too much too fast.

46:35.040 --> 46:36.040
We're gonna take another pass at the edit

46:36.040 --> 46:39.040
and we're just gonna take out some of the really scary stuff

46:39.040 --> 46:42.040
and maybe kind of build up to it over the course of a week or two.

46:42.040 --> 46:43.040
Prepare people for it.

46:43.040 --> 46:44.040
You were right.

46:44.040 --> 46:45.040
It is scary.

46:45.040 --> 46:46.040
You were right, Vivica.

46:46.040 --> 46:49.040
Go ahead and roll as you're saying you were right.

46:49.040 --> 46:52.040
Beck, if you could roll alertness.

46:54.040 --> 46:57.040
I pass a nine on a 40.

46:57.040 --> 47:01.040
Yeah, the hug felt weird but nothing too strange

47:01.040 --> 47:03.040
and she kind of walks out and is like...

47:03.040 --> 47:05.040
She put a goddamn kick me sign on my back.

47:07.040 --> 47:11.040
Okay, so I guess you send that off to production

47:11.040 --> 47:13.040
and we'll see you in the morning.

47:13.040 --> 47:14.040
See you tomorrow.

47:14.040 --> 47:16.040
Yeah, we'll see you tomorrow with fresh eyes.

47:16.040 --> 47:17.040
It's all gonna be okay.

47:17.040 --> 47:19.040
And she's walking out the door.

47:19.040 --> 47:25.040
I need either humant or alertness from Julius and Cal.

47:26.040 --> 47:27.040
I pass humant.

47:27.040 --> 47:28.040
With a?

47:28.040 --> 47:29.040
34.

47:29.040 --> 47:30.040
Okay.

47:30.040 --> 47:31.040
I critically fail.

47:31.040 --> 47:32.040
Okay.

47:32.040 --> 47:34.040
Either within 88.

47:34.040 --> 47:37.040
So Cal has leaned down to tie his shoe.

47:38.040 --> 47:40.040
She kind of turns back and is like,

47:40.040 --> 47:42.040
okay, I'll see you tomorrow.

47:42.040 --> 47:45.040
And heads out and closes the door behind her

47:45.040 --> 47:49.040
off of the marbleless floor in front of you.

47:49.040 --> 47:52.040
Empty, dark outside but it's well lit in here.

47:52.040 --> 47:53.040
Well lit?

47:53.040 --> 47:57.040
Yeah, you can hear a vacuum going in the background

47:57.040 --> 47:59.040
as it's like 3.30 in the morning.

47:59.040 --> 48:02.040
Oh yeah, then the ghost of the janitor

48:02.040 --> 48:05.040
who worked here in the 50s is vacuuming at night.

48:05.040 --> 48:07.040
Should we go check on God?

48:07.040 --> 48:09.040
I mean, I've got a bad feeling.

48:09.040 --> 48:11.040
I'm worried that what we just saw in that footage

48:11.040 --> 48:13.040
that Kirk brought is, I don't know,

48:13.040 --> 48:15.040
did something fuck up at the God basement?

48:15.040 --> 48:17.040
I don't think that he's still in there.

48:17.040 --> 48:19.040
Wasn't that your neighborhood, Cal?

48:19.040 --> 48:22.040
Oh, I mean, nearby.

48:22.040 --> 48:24.040
It wasn't quite as nice.

48:25.040 --> 48:27.040
The nearest bridge to get to downtown.

48:27.040 --> 48:28.040
Yeah, yeah.

48:28.040 --> 48:32.040
That's a lot of bridge and tunnel coming through there

48:32.040 --> 48:34.040
but no, that's not quite my neighborhood.

48:34.040 --> 48:39.040
Is that bridge tall enough to, you know, splat?

48:39.040 --> 48:40.040
What do you mean?

48:40.040 --> 48:42.040
Jump off and die?

48:42.040 --> 48:43.040
Oh, Lord, yes.

48:43.040 --> 48:47.040
It's actually probably the most popular suicide bridge in the city.

48:48.040 --> 48:50.040
Yeah, it's like 83.6 yards tall.

48:50.040 --> 48:52.040
It's on TripAdvisor.

48:52.040 --> 48:54.040
Yeah, I mean, well, you see, the thing is

48:54.040 --> 48:56.040
it was built in the 1880s

48:56.040 --> 49:00.040
and there has been a lot of time for death to accumulate.

49:00.040 --> 49:02.040
It's the subject of some local fascination.

49:02.040 --> 49:07.040
And how far of a walk from your apartment is it?

49:07.040 --> 49:08.040
15 minutes.

49:08.040 --> 49:10.040
Julius just kind of looks at Beck and Cal.

49:10.040 --> 49:15.040
Yeah, Beck is nodding at you with a grim expression.

49:16.040 --> 49:18.040
Yeah, it could have happened, I guess.

49:18.040 --> 49:21.040
We got to go check and make sure Stevie's okay

49:21.040 --> 49:23.040
and I've got a bad feeling.

49:23.040 --> 49:24.040
Here's another kicker.

49:24.040 --> 49:26.040
We have a date with you in the hospital.

49:26.040 --> 49:29.040
Do you want to get dropped off, me and Cal, go check it out?

49:29.040 --> 49:31.040
No, I've got to go.

49:32.040 --> 49:34.040
I looked it up in the rules, by the way,

49:34.040 --> 49:37.040
and the official rules of Delta Green.

49:37.040 --> 49:39.040
You're not conscious at two hit points.

49:39.040 --> 49:40.040
Like, you can't even...

49:40.040 --> 49:41.040
How could you be?

49:41.040 --> 49:43.040
You're not conscious at one or two hit points.

49:43.040 --> 49:44.040
Good thing I've got four.

49:44.040 --> 49:47.040
But you roll con when you go down to one or two hit points

49:47.040 --> 49:50.040
and if you succeed, then you're fine.

49:50.040 --> 49:52.040
You're just unconscious.

49:52.040 --> 49:56.040
But if you fail, you take a permanent injury

49:56.040 --> 49:58.040
that reduces one of your stats.

49:58.040 --> 49:59.040
It's super bad for you.

49:59.040 --> 50:01.040
It's super bad for you.

50:03.040 --> 50:06.040
Good thing we didn't know that when it happened to me.

50:06.040 --> 50:07.040
Well, no, because it worked out

50:07.040 --> 50:09.040
because you actually succeeded on your contract

50:09.040 --> 50:12.040
to stay conscious both times, I believe.

50:12.040 --> 50:14.040
So no permanent injury, which works out well.

50:14.040 --> 50:18.040
And I'm up to four hit points, so we're not breaking any rules.

50:18.040 --> 50:21.040
Yes, we're not breaking any rules.

50:21.040 --> 50:23.040
I told them I'd be back tomorrow,

50:23.040 --> 50:26.040
which technically I've got so many hours to get back there.

50:26.040 --> 50:27.040
Let's go. I'll go with you.

50:27.040 --> 50:29.040
I mean, if you're feeling up to it,

50:29.040 --> 50:32.040
I'm just worried if a strong breeze comes through.

50:32.040 --> 50:34.040
I think we've left logic behind long ago.

50:34.040 --> 50:37.040
Julius takes one of the pills that the nurse gave him.

50:37.040 --> 50:39.040
One of the limitless pills.

50:40.040 --> 50:42.040
Because we're not using willpower points,

50:42.040 --> 50:45.040
I think it's just going to be 3.30 in the morning.

50:45.040 --> 50:51.040
Zach imposes a negative 40 to skill checks starting now.

50:51.040 --> 50:53.040
Basically, you're exhausted.

50:53.040 --> 50:54.040
Cal is exhausted.

50:54.040 --> 50:55.040
Yeah.

50:55.040 --> 50:59.040
Now that the energy of getting the edit done,

50:59.040 --> 51:02.040
the excitement, all the adrenaline from today is finally worn off,

51:02.040 --> 51:06.040
he's not sure why Vivica is so adverse

51:06.040 --> 51:09.040
to this amazing opportunity that's been dropped in front of him.

51:09.040 --> 51:11.040
And he just wants to go back to his apartment,

51:11.040 --> 51:13.040
his nice apartment where nothing has happened.

51:13.040 --> 51:17.040
God hasn't blasted through, say, the ceiling or anything.

51:17.040 --> 51:19.040
I guess if I've got to go to sleep,

51:19.040 --> 51:21.040
I might as well go to sleep at the hospital.

51:21.040 --> 51:24.040
So I guess call me and let me know if Stevie's there.

51:24.040 --> 51:25.040
Righty-o.

51:25.040 --> 51:28.040
Okay, so you guys are going to leave and drop off Julius at the hospital

51:28.040 --> 51:32.040
on the way to Cal Colorado's townhouse.

51:32.040 --> 51:34.040
I need an alertness check

51:34.040 --> 51:40.040
as you all head out the can studio in downtown city.

51:40.040 --> 51:41.040
88 on the 70.

51:41.040 --> 51:42.040
Wow, dude.

51:42.040 --> 51:43.040
89.

51:43.040 --> 51:44.040
Wow.

51:44.040 --> 51:47.040
59 on a 40.

51:47.040 --> 51:50.040
Cal leans down to tie his other shoe.

51:50.040 --> 51:53.040
As you guys head out, you're pulling out of the parking lot

51:53.040 --> 51:55.040
and you don't see.

51:55.040 --> 51:57.040
And nothing happens.

51:57.040 --> 52:01.040
You don't see a goddamn thing.

52:01.040 --> 52:03.040
You don't see a couple things.

52:03.040 --> 52:04.040
Okay, it could be worse.

52:04.040 --> 52:05.040
Yeah.

52:05.040 --> 52:06.040
Yeah, moving on.

52:06.040 --> 52:08.040
I guess it'll be fun later.

52:08.040 --> 52:10.040
And we can all look back and be like,

52:10.040 --> 52:12.040
Whoa, it was that roll?

52:12.040 --> 52:14.040
That's crazy.

52:14.040 --> 52:15.040
So just remember this.

52:15.040 --> 52:18.040
Cal forgets something he left in the office

52:18.040 --> 52:20.040
and comes back outside.

52:20.040 --> 52:23.040
It's not something that shouldn't have been a roll though, right?

52:23.040 --> 52:24.040
No, it's great.

52:24.040 --> 52:27.040
If the sky is on fire or there's people screaming and running.

52:27.040 --> 52:29.040
No, there's people hiding from you.

52:29.040 --> 52:30.040
Oh, okay.

52:30.040 --> 52:31.040
Multiple people.

52:31.040 --> 52:34.040
There's always multiple.

52:34.040 --> 52:37.040
In any situation Zach sets up in a role-playing game,

52:37.040 --> 52:39.040
there are multiple Waldos in each scene

52:39.040 --> 52:41.040
that we could have been rolling to find.

52:41.040 --> 52:43.040
And he finally remembered to ask.

52:43.040 --> 52:45.040
And he's like, wow, interesting.

52:45.040 --> 52:47.040
Very first time.

52:47.040 --> 52:48.040
You don't wear...

52:48.040 --> 52:49.040
Do you know what they call it in England?

52:49.040 --> 52:50.040
I don't.

52:50.040 --> 52:51.040
Do you know, Joe?

52:51.040 --> 52:52.040
I don't think so.

52:52.040 --> 52:53.040
It's Where's Wally?

52:53.040 --> 52:54.040
I was going to guess Wally.

52:54.040 --> 52:55.040
So maybe I did know it at some point.

52:55.040 --> 52:56.040
I was hoping somebody would say it.

52:56.040 --> 52:57.040
And then I could say,

52:57.040 --> 52:59.040
No, it's Where's your cunt or something stupid.

52:59.040 --> 53:06.040
But it's Where's Wally?

53:06.040 --> 53:07.040
So you head off.

53:07.040 --> 53:08.040
And at the hospital,

53:08.040 --> 53:11.040
we're going to go ahead and have you stay overnight

53:11.040 --> 53:13.040
and get some health back.

53:13.040 --> 53:14.040
Yay.

53:14.040 --> 53:15.040
Yeah.

53:15.040 --> 53:16.040
So go ahead and roll a D4.

53:16.040 --> 53:18.040
I also looked up the rules for Delta Green on this.

53:18.040 --> 53:20.040
Apparently you're supposed to roll for the surgeon

53:20.040 --> 53:23.040
to see if they're good enough to help you.

53:23.040 --> 53:24.040
One.

53:24.040 --> 53:25.040
Wow.

53:25.040 --> 53:26.040
Surely you could also have a credit rating roll

53:26.040 --> 53:28.040
against that to see if you can afford a good surgeon.

53:28.040 --> 53:31.040
I actually wrote in here that he wouldn't have a good surgeon

53:31.040 --> 53:33.040
because his health insurance with City Action News

53:33.040 --> 53:35.040
hasn't started up yet.

53:35.040 --> 53:36.040
Yep.

53:36.040 --> 53:38.040
So that's why I only got one.

53:38.040 --> 53:40.040
That's why you only got one hit point back.

53:40.040 --> 53:42.040
So you're going to wake up up to five.

53:42.040 --> 53:45.040
However, you do also every single night gets you-

53:45.040 --> 53:46.040
Yeah.

53:46.040 --> 53:47.040
Wait.

53:47.040 --> 53:49.040
He got one back or two back when we just talked to the nurse.

53:49.040 --> 53:50.040
Two back for talking to the nurse.

53:50.040 --> 53:53.040
So we need to have more than one for his actual hospital stay.

53:53.040 --> 53:55.040
That doesn't seem mechanically fair.

53:55.040 --> 53:56.040
No, no.

53:56.040 --> 53:57.040
Turns out the surgeon sucks.

53:57.040 --> 53:58.040
Don't they?

53:58.040 --> 54:00.040
Yeah, surgeon's not super great.

54:00.040 --> 54:02.040
You absolutely should get more than one.

54:02.040 --> 54:04.040
It should be a plus something no matter the roll.

54:04.040 --> 54:06.040
I agree, but I'm just the handler.

54:06.040 --> 54:07.040
Oh, this is actually-

54:07.040 --> 54:08.040
What am I supposed to do?

54:08.040 --> 54:14.040
This is the start of the arc where we sue the hospital for their incredible malpractice

54:14.040 --> 54:16.040
and treating Julius.

54:16.040 --> 54:18.040
They can also crit fail on the check.

54:18.040 --> 54:23.040
I'm just saying it doesn't make it even worth it for him to have separated from us.

54:23.040 --> 54:29.040
So you will get an additional one for a full night's sleep if you can succeed a con check,

54:29.040 --> 54:34.040
but we'll have you do that after we figure out what happens at Cal Colorado's in case

54:34.040 --> 54:37.040
they call you and are like, actually.

54:37.040 --> 54:38.040
Okay.

54:38.040 --> 54:40.040
So I've got one more back at the moment.

54:40.040 --> 54:41.040
Yeah, for now.

54:41.040 --> 54:42.040
What did they do to me?

54:42.040 --> 54:43.040
Fluids.

54:43.040 --> 54:44.040
And-

54:44.040 --> 54:47.040
Seems like the nurse should have done that.

54:47.040 --> 54:48.040
Fluids.

54:48.040 --> 54:49.040
Fluids.

54:49.040 --> 54:50.040
Just fluids.

54:50.040 --> 54:51.040
One pain.

54:51.040 --> 54:54.040
I have the little pressy button for whatever that is.

54:54.040 --> 54:55.040
Morphine.

54:55.040 --> 54:56.040
Morphine.

54:56.040 --> 54:58.040
They're like, yeah, you can have morphine, I guess.

54:58.040 --> 54:59.040
I'll sue this.

54:59.040 --> 55:00.040
Do you know who I am?

55:00.040 --> 55:03.040
Sue this hospital if you don't get any morphine.

55:03.040 --> 55:04.040
You're fucking high as shit.

55:04.040 --> 55:07.040
You're like, I'm Cal Colorado.

55:07.040 --> 55:10.040
So yeah, I'm no pain, but I'm on the good stuff.

55:10.040 --> 55:11.040
No pain, one gain.

55:11.040 --> 55:12.040
On the good stuff.

55:12.040 --> 55:14.040
Hopefully you guys don't need me.

55:14.040 --> 55:19.040
This does feel worthless.

55:19.040 --> 55:21.040
It does not seem correct.

55:21.040 --> 55:22.040
It doesn't seem correct.

55:22.040 --> 55:25.040
It could have just been like, okay, Luke, take your headphones off and when you wake

55:25.040 --> 55:28.040
up, you're going to get six hit points or some shit.

55:28.040 --> 55:30.040
I mean, I can read from it.

55:30.040 --> 55:33.040
Since when have we played by the rules?

55:33.040 --> 55:36.040
That's a super great point.

55:36.040 --> 55:38.040
I mean, I can read from it right here.

55:38.040 --> 55:45.040
I can quote you the regulation, Thomas.

55:45.040 --> 55:51.040
Oh, no, I'm just kidding.

55:51.040 --> 55:54.040
We're feisty tonight, Cole.

55:54.040 --> 55:56.040
Should I step outside?

55:56.040 --> 55:57.040
Yeah, I guess so.

55:57.040 --> 55:58.040
You should go wait in the cold.

55:58.040 --> 56:01.040
Oh, do you have a Bluetooth headphones?

56:01.040 --> 56:02.040
I don't.

56:02.040 --> 56:03.040
I forgot the headphones.

56:03.040 --> 56:04.040
You can just rub your ears.

56:04.040 --> 56:05.040
I have headphones.

56:05.040 --> 56:07.040
I'll go outside until it's too cold.

56:07.040 --> 56:08.040
You can go to your room.

56:08.040 --> 56:09.040
Yeah, go to your room.

56:09.040 --> 56:10.040
I'll go to my room.

56:10.040 --> 56:11.040
You can put in my headphones.

56:11.040 --> 56:13.040
I just didn't want to hear you, you know?

56:13.040 --> 56:14.040
I'm going to go outside.

56:14.040 --> 56:18.040
That way I can, well, I can vape in my own room too, but just let me know.

56:18.040 --> 56:19.040
Just let me know.

56:19.040 --> 56:23.040
All right, now that Luke is out of the room, shall we go to Cal Colorado's home?

56:24.040 --> 56:27.040
Beep, beep, beep, beep.

56:27.040 --> 56:29.040
Our city traffic's crazy.

56:29.040 --> 56:31.040
Did you guys drive separately?

56:31.040 --> 56:32.040
Beep, beep, beep.

56:32.040 --> 56:33.040
No, we all came in the can van, right?

56:33.040 --> 56:34.040
Yeah, we're all in the can van.

56:34.040 --> 56:37.040
Well, I assume the can van, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

56:37.040 --> 56:38.040
Okay, right.

56:38.040 --> 56:42.040
Oh, you know, maybe after, yeah, Cal probably picks up his car from the parking lot, like

56:42.040 --> 56:45.040
where he left it before we headed out to Grover's Gorge.

56:45.040 --> 56:46.040
Yeah.

56:46.040 --> 56:48.040
How, like two days ago or whatever?

56:48.040 --> 56:49.040
Today, earlier today.

56:49.040 --> 56:52.040
Just, I mean, yesterday according to the time law, time law.

56:53.040 --> 56:54.040
Classic time law.

56:54.040 --> 56:55.040
International time law.

56:55.040 --> 56:56.040
Time law, not van law.

56:56.040 --> 57:01.040
But yeah, so it says July 6th on your phone, but it, you know, you haven't slept in July

57:01.040 --> 57:04.040
6th yet, so it's still July 5th in your bones.

57:04.040 --> 57:05.040
Yeah, exactly.

57:05.040 --> 57:07.040
I think Beck is still driving the van.

57:07.040 --> 57:08.040
Okay, sounds good.

57:08.040 --> 57:11.040
And the two of you pull up to Cal Colorado's home.

57:11.040 --> 57:12.040
You see nothing.

57:12.040 --> 57:16.040
He pulls his Mercedes into a little garage, like underneath the street.

57:16.040 --> 57:17.040
Nice.

57:17.040 --> 57:18.040
Beep, beep.

57:18.040 --> 57:20.040
As he passes Beck parking on the street in a salute.

57:20.040 --> 57:21.040
Beep, beep.

57:21.040 --> 57:28.040
I mean, you guys must be like making eyes at each other as there's nothing amiss so

57:28.040 --> 57:29.040
far.

57:29.040 --> 57:33.040
Yeah, Cal could walk straight into the basement from the garage, but to be polite to Beck,

57:33.040 --> 57:37.040
he walks out the door, back up onto the street, and then lets him in the front door.

57:37.040 --> 57:39.040
And before they go downstairs, he's like, do you want anything?

57:39.040 --> 57:40.040
Uh, tea, coffee?

57:40.040 --> 57:41.040
No.

57:41.040 --> 57:42.040
Whiskey?

57:42.040 --> 57:43.040
I think I'm good.

57:43.040 --> 57:46.040
We just got to make sure Stevie's like here and okay.

57:46.040 --> 57:47.040
Yes, yes, of course.

57:47.040 --> 57:52.040
I assume they fell asleep playing chess or Catan.

57:52.040 --> 57:55.040
Beck is going to make his way to the basement door.

57:55.040 --> 57:56.040
Yep, Cal's whispering.

57:56.040 --> 57:59.040
My daughter, Carol, she taught me about Catan.

57:59.040 --> 58:01.040
Yeah, it's a fun one.

58:01.040 --> 58:02.040
Do you know it?

58:02.040 --> 58:04.040
Oh yeah, we play it all the time in the group.

58:04.040 --> 58:05.040
Oh, we should play it.

58:05.040 --> 58:07.040
Yeah, you can come some night to a game night, sure.

58:07.040 --> 58:08.040
I like the sheep.

58:08.040 --> 58:09.040
The sheep are good.

58:09.040 --> 58:13.040
Sometimes you can get a good floor and you corner the market on them.

58:13.040 --> 58:15.040
Shh, we're getting close.

58:15.040 --> 58:16.040
Quiet, Beck.

58:16.040 --> 58:21.040
As you guys open up the door to the basement, you head down the stairs, each step creaking.

58:21.040 --> 58:29.040
Cal hits the light and you see the restraints previously on the body of Greg Godell, which

58:29.040 --> 58:38.040
have been cut off, lying helplessly, lying lifelessly on the ground of the basement of

58:38.040 --> 58:43.040
Cal Colorado's basement.

58:43.040 --> 58:45.040
The shackles are lying lifelessly.

58:45.040 --> 58:46.040
What's lifeless?

58:46.040 --> 58:47.040
The shackles.

58:47.040 --> 58:48.040
Oh, okay.

58:48.040 --> 58:49.040
All the stuff that-

58:49.040 --> 58:50.040
Oh, okay.

58:50.040 --> 58:51.040
I don't give a shit.

58:51.040 --> 58:52.040
Where's Stevie?

58:52.040 --> 58:55.040
Yeah, there's no sign of Stevie, no sign of Greg anywhere.

58:55.040 --> 58:56.040
Stevie!

58:56.040 --> 58:57.040
They're both gone.

58:57.040 --> 58:59.040
I kind of expected one or the other to still be here.

58:59.040 --> 59:05.040
They went out to get pizza for all of us, and Stevie might've thought that she needed

59:05.040 --> 59:06.040
the help of-

59:06.040 --> 59:07.040
A god.

59:07.040 --> 59:08.040
A turtle.

59:08.040 --> 59:09.040
God turtle.

59:09.040 --> 59:10.040
God turtle.

59:10.040 --> 59:12.040
A pizza god turtle.

59:12.040 --> 59:14.040
No, I think that something bad has happened.

59:14.040 --> 59:15.040
They're not here.

59:15.040 --> 59:17.040
The whole thing was that they were supposed to stay here.

59:17.040 --> 59:21.040
And I want to look at, you said the stuff we had used to wrap him up with is on the

59:21.040 --> 59:22.040
floor.

59:22.040 --> 59:23.040
Is it, it's cut?

59:23.040 --> 59:24.040
Is that what you said?

59:24.040 --> 59:25.040
Yeah, it's cut.

59:25.040 --> 59:27.040
Are there like scissors or a knife laying around?

59:27.040 --> 59:29.040
There's a pair of scissors sitting on a table.

59:29.040 --> 59:30.040
Okay.

59:30.040 --> 59:31.040
Just nearby.

59:31.040 --> 59:34.040
I wondered if he had somehow cut himself free or if she had helped him.

59:34.040 --> 59:35.040
Could be either one.

59:35.040 --> 59:39.040
I'm taking by the scene of this that, no, I'm thinking, well, look, there's scissors

59:39.040 --> 59:40.040
laying right here.

59:40.040 --> 59:42.040
I think that maybe Stevie set them loose.

59:42.040 --> 59:44.040
There's no signs of a struggle.

59:44.040 --> 59:47.040
No signs of forced ingress.

59:47.040 --> 59:53.040
It seems logical, yes, that she unlocked the door herself down here and took them both

59:53.040 --> 59:54.040
outside.

59:54.040 --> 59:58.040
She knew the whole thing was to like not let him get to a place where he could kill himself.

59:58.040 --> 01:00:01.040
So maybe, I don't know, he said something to her that made her think that wouldn't

01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:02.040
happen?

01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:05.040
I don't know what Stevie was thinking, but they're a lot closer to this situation

01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:06.040
than we are.

01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:09.040
Hopefully we, Beck, do you think that video was real?

01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:10.040
I do.

01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:11.040
Ah, fuck.

01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:17.040
I've never seen Kurt doctor his footage before, like that's kind of his whole thing.

01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:20.040
It's kind of his whole thing.

01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:22.040
It's, you know, raw and real.

01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:23.040
That's like what he says.

01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:26.040
It's daddy's real stuff is what he always says.

01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:29.040
Beck, why do you hang out with that creature?

01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:31.040
Sometimes his footage is wild, man.

01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:35.040
Have you seen like, you had to have seen the 1973 Bigfoot that he had.

01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:36.040
He's 30.

01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:37.040
He's like 30.

01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:39.040
That he got a hold of.

01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:40.040
Oh, Kurt is 30.

01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:42.040
Yeah, but the Bigfoot was born in 1973.

01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:43.040
Right.

01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:44.040
Exactly.

01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:45.040
Right.

01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:48.040
A great year for big feet.

01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:59.040
NPS estimates put it at like at least 33 big feet born in the continental United States.

01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:01.040
The biggest year on record.

01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:05.040
For instance, in 2021, there were only five estimated big feet born.

01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:06.040
That's a lot less.

01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:09.040
The numbers is dwindling.

01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:12.040
No, there's less of them.

01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:14.040
There's smaller feet now.

01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:15.040
Little feet.

01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:16.040
Little feet.

01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:18.040
A land before feet.

01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:24.040
Which is my foot fetish parody of a land before feet.

01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:27.040
Where all the dinosaurs are played by feet.

01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:28.040
What do you guys do?

01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:29.040
Beck, it's clear.

01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:31.040
We have to find Stevie immediately.

01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:32.040
Yeah, it's a bummer.

01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:35.040
I was really hoping we could like crash here and then.

01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:43.040
Sometimes younger people don't answer my calls.

01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:47.040
Would she answer your call or a text?

01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:48.040
You should try it.

01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:49.040
I'll give that a shot, yeah.

01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:58.040
They find me exhausting, I've heard.

01:01:58.040 --> 01:02:00.040
You know Carol, you know my daughter.

01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:03.040
I think people are just intimidated, you know?

01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:05.040
My daughter said she finds me exhausting.

01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:07.040
Do you ever find me exhausting, Beck?

01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:09.040
I mean, no.

01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:12.040
But we don't like live together, so maybe if we lived together,

01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:14.040
I would be exhausted at some point.

01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:16.040
But that just happens in relationships.

01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:18.040
But no, I don't find you exhausting at all.

01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:19.040
Thank you.

01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:20.040
Thank you, Beck.

01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:23.040
Sometimes we say things to hurt the ones we love.

01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:24.040
I'm on the call.

01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:25.040
I'm on the call.

01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:26.040
Oh, oh, oh.

01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:27.040
I'm sorry.

01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:28.040
I'm sorry.

01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:29.040
Breathe, breathe.

01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:30.040
Breathe, breathe.

01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:35.040
And then he goes to Stevie's voicemail.

01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:36.040
Beep.

01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:39.040
Hey, Stevie, it's Beck.

01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:42.040
We're really worried about you because you're not where we left you,

01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:44.040
and that was kind of the whole thing we had set up,

01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:45.040
is that you'd be where we left you.

01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:47.040
Tell her I hope she doesn't think I'm exhausting.

01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:49.040
Cal hopes that you don't think he's exhausting,

01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:54.040
and I hope that you're alive and that your brother's alive

01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:59.040
and that there's not a new god in the world that is maybe bad for us.

01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:00.040
I don't...

01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:01.040
I'll talk to you later.

01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:02.040
Bye.

01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:03.040
Are you guys crashing?

01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:04.040
And I send a text.

01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:05.040
Okay.

01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:06.040
Nice.

01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:07.040
Please call.

01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:08.040
Just please call?

01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:09.040
Yep.

01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:11.040
Beck, I know you prefer to take the can van,

01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:14.040
but perhaps tonight on this hunt for Stevie,

01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:16.040
we should take my ride.

01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:17.040
The Mercedes?

01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:18.040
Is that what you're talking about?

01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:19.040
Yes.

01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:20.040
Dude, yeah.

01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:23.040
Some very nice Mercedes coupe, whatever that is.

01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:24.040
Don't look at me.

01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:25.040
I just...

01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:26.040
Thomas doesn't know.

01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:27.040
Coupe C. C class.

01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:28.040
We kicked the wrong guy out.

01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:30.040
Hey, Luke.

01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:37.040
I mean, we've got to fit a van load of equipment in it,

01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:38.040
but I could...

01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:39.040
Yeah, we'll get it in there.

01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:40.040
No, no, no, Beck.

01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:41.040
It was a search mission.

01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:44.040
And frankly, while I've seen tonight what today,

01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:47.040
what a common cell phone can do.

01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:48.040
Most of your job, Beck.

01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:52.040
Whoa, Cal.

01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:53.040
Over the line.

01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:55.040
And mine as well.

01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:56.040
And mine as well.

01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:57.040
So...

01:03:57.040 --> 01:03:59.040
This is some 4 a.m. talk here.

01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:02.040
He's so exhausted.

01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:03.040
He's being a bitch.

01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:09.040
What I'm saying is you've got the newest phone.

01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:12.040
But this is like, this is more of the story.

01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:13.040
This is more story.

01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:15.040
We need to film it.

01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:16.040
It's more story.

01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:18.040
Okay, the small one, the small camera.

01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:19.040
No sound, no lights.

01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:21.040
You can have a shotgun mic on top.

01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:22.040
Yeah, I got it.

01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:23.040
I just...

01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:24.040
I'm not carrying a boom.

01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:25.040
Why are we paring down?

01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:26.040
We've got to move quickly.

01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:27.040
We've got to move quickly.

01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:29.040
Oh, okay.

01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:30.040
Through the streets.

01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:32.040
In my sweet Mercedes.

01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:34.040
I looked it up.

01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:35.040
C class works.

01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:37.040
In my sweet C class.

01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:38.040
Yeah, okay.

01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:39.040
I'll grab...

01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:41.040
I'll just grab some of the mics and I can fit a tripod.

01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:43.040
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:45.040
Yeah, that's what I'm going to grab.

01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:46.040
We need equipment.

01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:50.040
We spend like 10 minutes like sorting out a pile.

01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:53.040
This won't even fit in that tiny trunk.

01:04:54.040 --> 01:04:57.040
Yeah, when the cameraman's just sitting right there.

01:04:57.040 --> 01:05:00.040
The back ends up getting a surprising amount.

01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:05.040
He Tetris is a pretty sweet kid.

01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:06.040
Yeah.

01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:07.040
All right.

01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:08.040
I mean, you guys are going to be...

01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:10.040
Now, I think if you go out and continue this,

01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:13.040
you're not going to be able to get a sleep

01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:15.040
and then show up at a normal time to work.

01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:18.040
So you're going to be at a negative 40 all day for the next day.

01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:19.040
Unless we go to sleep.

01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:20.040
Yeah.

01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:22.040
I mean, we've already said we want to spend a little more time on the edit.

01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:24.040
I think we deserve to sleep in.

01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:25.040
Wake up pretty late.

01:05:25.040 --> 01:05:26.040
I just didn't know how late.

01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:27.040
7 a.m.

01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:29.040
I don't know how long you're hunting for is what I'm saying.

01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:30.040
This hunt.

01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:31.040
Oh, I mean, I figured we're...

01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:33.040
We're going to take a spin around the block.

01:05:34.040 --> 01:05:38.040
I figured story-wise we'd go to the hole

01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:40.040
and you'd show us God or whatever

01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:44.040
and we'd worry about fucking sleep and shit later.

01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:46.040
I wasn't worried about mechanics in this hunt.

01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:48.040
I figured we'd go straight to it.

01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:49.040
You're going to the hole?

01:05:49.040 --> 01:05:50.040
Yeah.

01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:51.040
Right?

01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:52.040
Sure.

01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:53.040
Awesome.

01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:54.040
Fuck off.

01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:56.040
The way you say that.

01:05:57.040 --> 01:05:58.040
Awesome.

01:05:58.040 --> 01:05:59.040
Awesome.

01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:00.040
Awesome.

01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:06.040
When you arrive to the nearest bridge that heads over the city river

01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:10.040
into downtown from Cal, Colorado's lovely neighborhood.

01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:11.040
Beans Bridge.

01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:12.040
Beck.

01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:14.040
You don't know the history?

01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:15.040
No.

01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:16.040
Oh.

01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:17.040
It is blocked off.

01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:20.040
80 men died building this.

01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:23.040
Some say their bones are in the mortar.

01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:24.040
They are.

01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:28.040
There are flashing lights everywhere.

01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:30.040
There are all sorts of different crews.

01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:33.040
You see people in suits.

01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:36.040
You see people in all sorts of different...

01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:37.040
There's cops.

01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:39.040
There's people in hazmat gear.

01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:41.040
There's all sorts of different...

01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:42.040
There's tents popping up.

01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:44.040
There's a whole crew.

01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:48.040
There's a whole kit and caboodle, a whole situation happening.

01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:49.040
News crew?

01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:52.040
There are other news crews that have begun piling up here.

01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:53.040
Yeah.

01:06:53.040 --> 01:06:56.040
Cal elbows you a little too hard in the ribs and he's like,

01:06:56.040 --> 01:06:57.040
hot damn.

01:06:57.040 --> 01:06:58.040
You were right, Beck.

01:06:58.040 --> 01:07:00.040
We should have brought all this shit.

01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:04.040
Oh yeah, I got the tripod and I've got a lav mic for you

01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:07.040
and the light here I can attach to the top.

01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:08.040
Yeah, we're set.

01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:11.040
You've got this Rube Goldberg of things attached to the camera

01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:14.040
and you're holding it in one hand and a boom in the other.

01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:20.040
Yeah, it's a backpack strap thing that sends the boom over the top of my head.

01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:23.040
I see this golden glow on my skin and I'm like,

01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:25.040
oh my god, he did it.

01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:26.040
The perfect lighting.

01:07:28.040 --> 01:07:29.040
Oh yeah, we're live.

01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:30.040
Or not live.

01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:35.040
We're to tape in four, three, two, silent one.

01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:36.040
Follow me, follow me.

01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:37.040
Are you getting this?

01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:38.040
Are you getting this?

01:07:38.040 --> 01:07:39.040
We're live on Bean's Bridge.

01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:42.040
Reporting from the scene of a bizarre accident,

01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:45.040
some kind of hole has been punctured through the structure.

01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:51.040
We've got some footage obtained by a consultant earlier tonight.

01:07:54.040 --> 01:07:57.040
Once again, I want to stress this was not shot by anybody

01:07:57.040 --> 01:07:59.040
strictly affiliated with Cannes News.

01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:00.040
But you can see here, folks,

01:08:00.040 --> 01:08:03.040
you can see here the extraordinary footage captured earlier tonight

01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:05.040
showing what we're approaching the hole now.

01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:07.040
You can probably see in the insert, again, the footage.

01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:10.040
The two of you are walking up to where the rest of the media

01:08:10.040 --> 01:08:14.040
has bottlenecked up and there's big kind of wooden structures

01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:17.040
with four legs and a bar across the top.

01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:21.040
Table?

01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:23.040
It's sawhorses, right?

01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:24.040
Yeah.

01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:28.040
Long ones.

01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:30.040
You mean like just a barricade?

01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:31.040
You're right.

01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:32.040
Yep, it's a barricade.

01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:33.040
There's a bunch of them.

01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:37.040
And they're keeping the media at arm's length here.

01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:41.040
But if you zoom in past the shoulder of Mr. Cal Colorado,

01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:47.040
you can see that they're whole, that there are people of all sorts of dress

01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:52.040
walking around, taking samples, taking pictures, taking video, all sorts.

01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:56.040
I want to scan the crowd whether it's with a camera or not for Stevie.

01:08:56.040 --> 01:09:00.040
Maybe I'm just holding it on the area and looking my head around.

01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:02.040
Is Stevie around?

01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:05.040
Go ahead and roll search at a negative 40.

01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:10.040
Would have been a pass, but it's a fail.

01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:12.040
Can I aid his search maybe?

01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:15.040
You can also roll search if you would like since you just failed.

01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:19.040
I'd like to roll search and I'd like to maybe try to bump up something on my search

01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:21.040
by calling Stevie's phone.

01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:23.040
Oh, okay. Yeah, that sounds great.

01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:24.040
90.

01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:32.040
You convince yourself that the noise that you're hearing in the back of your head

01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:36.040
is just because you think you're expecting to hear a ringtone?

01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:39.040
Beck, I can't hear shit over these throngs.

01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:45.040
Beck, like when you're on camera, it never talks to you,

01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:48.040
so he just does a nod from behind the camera.

01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:53.040
Cal's feeling a little frosty and there's maybe a side of him

01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:56.040
you haven't really seen in his professional newsman days,

01:09:56.040 --> 01:10:00.040
but you know he did some of this roving reporting when he was younger

01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:05.040
and without any sleep, you're worried about the glint you see in his eye

01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:08.040
and he gives you a big wink and he says,

01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:11.040
All right, Beck, just remember, act like you're supposed to be there.

01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:14.040
And Cal just moves one of the barricades aside and slips on through

01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:18.040
and mushens you in and we start heading straight for somebody with authority.

01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:20.040
Beck does, just follows the lead.

01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:23.040
Yes. Oh, fuck yeah.

01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:25.040
Well, I guess we'll see what happens the next time.

01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:29.040
We can come back inside for now.

01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:32.040
I should mention that this is a terrible idea

01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:35.040
because I don't have a skill that I can succeed on basically.

01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:40.040
All you have to do is film, baby.

01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:05.040
And it's all my fault.
