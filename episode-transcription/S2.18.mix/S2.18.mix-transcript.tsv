4320	9160	We gather only the finest of bones to provide for y'all.
9160	12080	Big bones, little bones,
12080	16560	those super thin weird bones that gross you out
16560	19840	when you devour a chicken's roasted carcass.
19840	23120	Them fish bones that people swallow.
23120	27960	Corn bones, teeth bones, you know the ones.
27960	34080	And I am rattling at y'all live from 694.2 PTBP.
34080	37320	It's your bone daddy, Wolf the dog,
37320	40000	here to make your ear bones quiver
40000	43280	with otherworldly vibrations.
43280	46920	Something's making my damn bones quiver.
46920	50560	Oh shit, it's this week's Howlin' with Wolf.
50560	56200	And this week's HWW comes from Kate in Limestone, New York,
56240	60040	who tweeted about the show and tagged at Pretending Pod.
60040	63880	A very easy and helpful thing to do.
63880	66640	Go on, do it for ol' Wolfie.
66640	69880	Kate from Limestone, New York writes,
69880	74880	I wanna thank the PTBP gang for confirming to my coworkers
75240	78840	that I am exactly as fuckin' weird as they thought.
78840	82360	And shout out to Mickalyn for introducing me
82360	87280	to this absolute shit show in my newest hyper fixation.
87280	89880	You're one of the best humans I could know.
89880	93760	I can't wait to hear these idiots fuck up next episode.
93760	98240	And remember, they are watching even when you aren't.
98240	100440	Well, I heard from a little producer
100440	104040	that it's Kate from Limestone's birthday today.
104040	106320	And you know what that means.
106320	108840	Wait, do y'all know what that means?
108840	112000	I'm unfamiliar with a birth day.
112000	114160	And what people do about them.
114160	117120	Well, Kate, thanks for writin' in regardless.
117120	119920	And I hope your birthday is one in which things happen
119920	122520	that humans generally desire.
122520	124000	If you wanna write up somethin'
124000	126420	for your bone-filled wolf to how,
126420	129840	tag at Pretending Pod on Twitter or Instagram.

157760	159700	Now, listen to this.
159700	163140	Apparently, a Zatch of some sort
163140	166800	took over my airwaves recently, which is...
168480	170000	It's fine.
170000	172960	He at least had some cool news.
172960	176240	The good people here at PTBP will be matching
176240	179280	all new and upgrading Patreon subscriptions
179280	180880	for the month of December.
180880	183120	And they're takin' that doubled amount
183120	186260	and donating it to a crisis cold weather shelter
186260	189220	in a place called Springfield, Missouri
189220	192360	to help keep the folks in their community warm
192360	195160	during the upcoming winter months.
195160	199040	The shelter is openly accepting of all genders,
199040	203240	open on all nights when the temperature is dangerously cold
203240	207120	and oh, that's right, they'll also shelter them pets.

227840	232480	This year, it's already up over 250 bucks.
232480	236160	We're well on our way to toppin' last year's donations.

240560	244160	Plus, available for patrons ear holes,
244160	246880	the 38th exclusive episode is a
246880	250260	Contention PD Halloween special called
250260	253640	It's the Butterfinger Bandit Keith Beans.
253680	258560	The boys play child versions of their season one characters
258560	261780	to solve a spooky mystery.
261780	266780	Now, please ignore, explore, and or adore
266780	270240	the spooky nature of my omniscience.
270240	272440	It's time for the news.
272440	276320	Last time, the boys done fucked up.
276320	279040	Big surprise, right?
279080	284080	Apparently, that Zach being does a decent recap,
284200	286760	so no need for me to double dip.
286760	290360	I'm just here to exalt Alter Girl with
290360	294360	My Life is Great and It's All My Fault.
294360	298100	It's all my fault
298100	303040	Cause my life is great
303040	305040	And it's all mine
310040	315040	Cause my life is great
315040	319040	And it's all my fault
329040	333040	It's from the meat juice they put in there.
333040	336040	They rung out of horse for it.
337040	338040	Oh, man.
338040	339040	Give me that horse juice.
339040	340040	I'm late to this.
340040	343040	I didn't see the Channel 5 Chad Hanks interview
343040	345040	during White Boy Summer.
345040	348040	It's actually, I get him now, I think.
348040	349040	Like, I understand.
349040	353040	Not like, I kind of saw that take coming, I guess, but.
353040	356040	Not that he's not an idiot, not that, but like.
356040	359040	Wait, Thomas, put your shirt back on.
359040	360040	No.
360040	361040	Oh, are we recording?
361040	365040	Yeah, do the Denzel voice.
365040	367040	30 Seconds of Silence.
369040	370040	Are we fucking?
370040	372040	Did I just say I like Chad Hanks on you?
372040	373040	Did we record that?
373040	375040	Okay, you gotta delete that.
375040	377040	You gotta, you can't.
377040	378040	No, I didn't say I liked him.
378040	382040	I said I get what, I get why.
382040	383040	Yeah, you just said you liked him
383040	385040	and you're apologizing for saying you get him.
385040	387040	It was clearly a bit, Your Honor.
389040	390040	So, what do you say?
390040	393040	Do I delete all this or do we do 30 Seconds of Silence?
393040	397040	If you delete it, it's not relevant enough anymore.
397040	399040	Would have been fucking hilarious.
399040	400040	I think it's up to Joe.
400040	401040	12 months ago.
401040	403040	It doesn't matter that it's out of date
403040	405040	because you opened it with this is,
405040	407040	I'm just now seeing it, but I thought it was funny.
407040	409040	Yeah, I get it was in context for the fact that.
409040	410040	What do you think, Luke?
410040	411040	Do you think it should stay in?
411040	412040	I like Tom Hanks.
415040	417040	Now that we've recovered from that mess,
417040	420040	it is episode 18.
420040	423040	What's your favorite Colin Hanks appearance?
423040	424040	Orange County.
424040	425040	Yeah, it's a good one.
425040	428040	Don't you think that Tom Hanks knew in his bones
428040	430040	when he named Chet Hanks, Chet Hanks,
430040	432040	that he would be a country music star?
432040	433040	Oh, yeah.
433040	434040	And then this happened.
434040	436040	He didn't see the other way it could go.
438040	440040	They didn't make these kind of Chets back then.
440040	441040	That's right.
441040	442040	The future didn't exist yet.
442040	443040	Yeah.
443040	444040	It was the brand new model.
444040	445040	There was no way to foresee.
445040	449040	It's really unfortunate for Chet and the world.
449040	450040	It's unfortunate for Tom.
450040	455040	I think Chet is expressing himself to his fullest.
456040	458040	He is living his truest life.
458040	460040	More words of support from Thomas Cox.
462040	464040	I don't support Chet Hanks.
464040	465040	I don't like Chet Hanks,
465040	467040	but after watching an interview,
467040	469040	I get why he is like he is.
469040	472040	It's episode 18 of season two,
472040	475040	but more importantly, as of three nights ago,
475040	478040	we've been recording for five years.
478040	479040	December 1st.
479040	483040	And we've been releasing for four years.
483040	484040	That's insane.
484040	486040	Did that one actually happen in November?
486040	487040	Which one?
487040	488040	Releasing.
488040	489040	No.
489040	491040	I think I uploaded three episodes early,
491040	492040	but then we were like,
492040	496040	it's December 1st is when it actually officially dropped,
496040	498040	because we started recording on December 1st,
498040	501040	and that's when season one starts on December 1st,
501040	502040	because of the calendar.
502040	504040	You have to do that.
504040	505040	Yeah.
505040	507040	That is actual play legal.
507040	511040	When Gary Gygax received the original...
511040	512040	Who?
512040	513040	Gary Gygax?
513040	515040	That's a cool name.
516040	517040	That's his name, right, Joe?
517040	518040	Yeah.
518040	519040	Yeah, yeah.
519040	521040	You know who that is, right, Zach?
521040	527040	When Gary Gygax received the original rules of D&D from God,
527040	531040	it included that very specific fucking condition
531040	535040	that the day it is today is the day you're roleplaying.
535040	538040	The day it is today is the day that you're roleplaying.
538040	540040	It's what it said on the tablets from Mountain Doom.
540040	543040	Which he had to translate on his own
543040	546040	and no one else could look at the handbooks from God.
546040	549040	Are you implying he didn't do it faithfully,
549040	552040	or he did it to some advantage for himself?
552040	554040	I'm saying I think it might all be made up.
554040	557040	Listeners, this is the closest this podcast has ever come to ending,
557040	561040	as I don't know if we can continue on as friends.
561040	563040	Certainly not roleplaying partners after.
563040	565040	Are your guys' hands sweaty?
565040	567040	My hands are the sweatiest they've ever been.
567040	568040	I'm nauseous.
568040	569040	I'm going to have to change gloves.
572040	574040	Don't spill the sweat out of those.
578040	579040	Dude, I was watching Shark Tank
579040	582040	and this one guy was selling this poncho that...
582040	583040	That catches your blood sweat?
583040	585040	That catches your body sweat when you work out,
585040	587040	and the fucking commercials he was showing them.
587040	589040	So you can drink it afterward?
589040	591040	No, it's to help lose body weight
591040	594040	if you're trying to get in a certain weight class or whatever.
594040	597040	And some people just like to see how much they sweat.
597040	599040	Yeah, they did this on Jackass.
599040	600040	Would that be his whole...
600040	602040	It was that, but yeah, it was his thing that he was selling.
602040	603040	It's just a heavy sweater.
603040	606040	But in the video he showed of people using it,
606040	609040	it was literally people afterwards dumping the sweat out
609040	611040	and it was vile.
611040	614040	I might have said this before on this podcast,
614040	616040	that that's one of the only gags from Jackass
616040	618040	that made me gag in real life.
618040	620040	All the gross shit that they've ever done,
620040	623040	it was something about the sweat suit that got me so grossed out.
623040	626040	It was so disgusting, dude. I hated it.
626040	627040	And then Mark Cuban bought it.
627040	629040	But wait, so is this guy's whole marketing thing?
629040	631040	Is it some people want to see the sweat?
631040	632040	Is that the whole thing?
632040	635040	If Mark Cuban bought it, that means enough people out there
635040	637040	do want to see.
637040	640040	But it was like to lose water weight
640040	642040	if you're like a wrestler or something
642040	643040	trying to make weight,
643040	644040	and then you've got to weigh it.
644040	645040	I've seen people do that,
645040	648040	where they tape off their pant legs and stuff like that,
648040	649040	their sweat pants and stuff,
649040	651040	to just keep it all in there.
651040	652040	One of the guys was like,
652040	654040	how many people is that, though?
654040	655040	That can't be much.
655040	656040	He's like, a lot of people will just buy it
656040	659040	to see how much they sweat and look at their sweat.
659040	662040	It's 13 people, but they're all really rich.
662040	663040	I don't want to say.
663040	665040	Mark Cuban was like, oh no, I totally get that.
665040	666040	I want to point out,
666040	668040	Thomas has been making a face this whole time
668040	669040	like he wants one.
669040	670040	I don't want to, no, no, no.
670040	673040	I don't want to say Mark Cuban is an infallible businessman
673040	674040	and never makes mistakes.
674040	675040	That's not why I think
675040	677040	maybe there's something else going on here.
677040	679040	What I think is going on is that
679040	681040	maybe once every season or two,
681040	684040	Mark Cuban will buy a bad product
684040	686040	and then bring that person into his life
686040	689040	just to prank his other billionaire friends.
689040	692040	And he funds the idea to a ridiculous amount,
692040	696040	but it's really all a Clooney-esque, pretty cruel.
696040	697040	Like dinner for schmucks?
697040	699040	Yeah, it's pretty much dinner for schmucks.
699040	700040	But he shits in the guy's litter box.
700040	702040	Oh my God, what if all the sharks do it?
702040	706040	What if one season they fund a schmuck?
706040	709040	I would watch that season.
709040	710040	Oh my God.
710040	714040	They have a private schmuck-off
714040	716040	where they see how far they can get the product
716040	717040	they think is the dumbest.
717040	720040	Speaking of charity, for the month of December.
720040	723040	I'll give you a million for one percent.
723040	725040	How's that, Seth?
725040	726040	And a special invitation.
726040	727040	Donations?
727040	728040	Oh, charity?
728040	729040	It starts at home.
729040	730040	That's why.
730040	731040	That's why.
731040	732040	In the month of December,
732040	734040	we're going to take all new and upgrading subscriptions
734040	738040	on our Patreon over at patreon.com slash pretending pod
738040	741040	and we are going to match that increase
741040	743040	and we're going to take that double the amount
743040	746040	and we're going to donate it to a crisis cold weather shelter
746040	748040	here in Springfield, Missouri
748040	750040	to help keep people in our community warm
750040	752040	during these cold winter nights.
752040	754040	Got to be able to sleep in the warm.
754040	756040	Yeah, it's only open when it's under 32 degrees.
756040	757040	It takes all genders.
758040	761040	From what we could see when we were doing our research last year,
761040	764040	it seemed to be a really reputable and solid organization
764040	766040	doing really good work in our hometown.
766040	767040	It gets cold here and we're,
767040	771040	a farmer's almanac says that we're in for a real cold winter.
771040	772040	Farmers almanac.
772040	774040	What's the thing where you cut it and the inside-
774040	775040	The persimmons, yeah.
775040	777040	Apparently those were showing the spoon shape.
777040	779040	I think that was the thing that tells you it's cold.
779040	780040	Yep, that's how they do it.
780040	781040	Spoon persimmons.
781040	782040	In science land.
782040	783040	We also-
783040	784040	Wait.
784040	785040	What?
785040	786040	We have a very large-
786040	787040	Is that bio-farming?
787040	788040	Yeah.
788040	790040	House-less population in Springfield
790040	793040	who are not served very well by our city government
793040	794040	or the state government.
794040	795040	Yeah.
795040	796040	So there's a lot of people who really need it.
796040	797040	Yeah, and it's really rad.
797040	799040	We've got some extremely progressive churches
799040	801040	who have come together to put this together
801040	804040	and we're here to help support people doing good shit.
804040	805040	It's been under 20 degrees-
805040	806040	A lot.
806040	808040	10, 12 times in the past couple weeks here.
808040	809040	I get it.
809040	810040	We should have done it in November.
810040	811040	That's my bad.
811040	812040	No, no, no. I just mean-
812040	814040	It's going to get worse.
814040	815040	It's going to get worse.
815040	816040	It's going to get worse.
816040	817040	It's just going to get worse.
817040	818040	There's a little wrinkle to this one.
818040	820040	Oh, there is a little wrinkle to this one.
820040	822040	I thought we'd try to bump those numbers
822040	825040	that way we could send them a fair amount of cash.
825040	827040	We're doing a raffle this time around.
827040	829040	R-r-r-raffle.
829040	830040	Raffle.
830040	831040	You can win.
831040	833040	I hope I win.
833040	835040	He hopes he wins.
835040	837040	I hope I win.
837040	839040	No, I'm saving that for Jesus.
839040	840040	That's right.
840040	842040	Like when he comes back.
842040	844040	When he comes on your back.
844040	845040	Soon.
845040	846040	Yeah.
846040	847040	Soon.
847040	848040	Enter me.
848040	850040	Yeah, you should let Jesus into you.
850040	851040	A resurrection.
851040	852040	Her heart?
852040	854040	There's a left behind joke here.
854040	855040	Res-e-rection?
855040	857040	Is that what you're trying to say?
857040	858040	He just-
858040	859040	A resurrection.
859040	860040	A res-e-rection.
860040	861040	A res-e-rection.
861040	864040	Wow, we're going to have to cut out so much of this fucking-
864040	869040	Every $5 newly subscribed or upgraded Patreon subscription will get you one entry into the
869040	870040	raffle.
870040	873040	We're going to do three raffle winners at the end of December.
873040	878040	Two of you will receive a PTBP t-shirt, any design you want from the merch store or the
878040	883040	season one Patreon exclusive merch or the season two Patreon exclusive merch, which
883040	888040	we're dropping this month in December and will be available to patrons in January.
888040	889040	And it's really cool.
889040	890040	And it's fun.
890040	891040	It's really fucking cool.
891040	892040	Sick.
892040	893040	Is it though?
893040	899040	And we are going to have the third winner either receive a shirt, if you want that you
899040	902040	can have a shirt, or if you'd prefer-
902040	906040	You can write a song and we'll use it as the theme song.
906040	907040	I mean, sure.
907040	908040	Should we start doing that?
908040	909040	That's pretty fun.
909040	911040	Yeah, if you'd prefer that.
911040	912040	And it's good.
912040	913040	Hopefully you know how to do that.
913040	914040	If not, we'll be interested.
914040	915040	Oh yeah, don't-
915040	918040	Then get a shirt.
918040	922040	Let's please volunteer yourself for second and third place if you can.
922040	923040	Okay, let's do it.
923040	925040	Let's do a different option if they don't want to do the music.
925040	926040	Did we say what they actually get?
926040	927040	No, we haven't said what they actually get yet.
927040	930040	If you don't want to do the music option, we'll make another one up.
930040	931040	Okay, what would be cool?
932040	933040	What if they got to-
933040	937040	They can play in a game with the three of you as their fellow players.
937040	938040	Oh, with the boys?
938040	941040	And I'll run it and it'll be home brewed by me.
941040	942040	Daddy and the boys?
942040	943040	Daddy and the boys.
943040	947040	And they only have to upgrade just like $5 to the entry?
947040	949040	$5 will be in one entry.
949040	952040	To get one entry, which is kind of cool if you're already at the $5 level and you want
952040	957040	to see us record those Den of Sins, you can bump up to $15, get yourself two entries.
957040	959040	Speaking of which, in the Den of Sin-
959040	960040	Wait, that already happened.
960040	961040	Nevermind.
961040	962040	Cut.
962040	963040	Oh yeah.
963040	964040	It hasn't happened, but it will have.
964040	969040	But if you're a Patreon subscriber at any level, you can enjoy the Patreon exclusive
969040	972040	campaign, the hunt for John Lee Pettymore's gold.
972040	973040	But gold.
973040	974040	But gold.
974040	975040	But gold.
975040	976040	But gold.
976040	977040	But gold.
977040	978040	The hunt for John Lee Pettymore's gold.
978040	979040	I'm but a gold.
979040	980040	Oh, it's not even that.
980040	981040	It's the hunt for John Lee.
981040	985040	The lost treasure of John Lee Pettymore.
985040	986040	Wow.
987040	991040	I really wanted it to be gold, but I couldn't find a way to logically think how John Lee
991040	997040	Pettymore would convert his cash to gold in the time he had alive in the world.
997040	1000040	So it has to just be lost treasure.
1000040	1002040	But gold would be such a better title.
1002040	1004040	Anyway, the lost treasure of John Lee Pettymore.
1004040	1006040	It's a Patreon exclusive campaign.
1006040	1009040	At any level you sign up for that, you'll get episodes of that, which will be coming
1009040	1012040	out starting in December and going on for a few months after that.
1012040	1018040	And those are podcast episodes, audio episodes, and that will be the 39th one that we will
1018040	1019040	release.
1019040	1021040	So there's 39 bonus episodes over on Patreon.
1021040	1022040	Go hit that out.
1022040	1023040	Oh, and one other note.
1023040	1027040	We've got an editor here at Pretending to Be People.
1027040	1028040	Ooh.
1028040	1029040	Who is it?
1029040	1030040	Who is it?
1030040	1032040	It's our friend and collaborator.
1032040	1033040	Collaborator.
1033040	1034040	Collaborator.
1034040	1035040	Collaborator.
1035040	1036040	Collaborator.
1036040	1037040	His name is-
1037040	1038040	Is it Taylor?
1038040	1041040	No, that's not a name pun.
1042040	1043040	Nope.
1043040	1044040	He already is a collaborator.
1044040	1046040	Am I getting closer?
1046040	1053040	His name is Cole Simmons of Brat Pit and now known as Mint Fatigue.
1053040	1055040	And also what did he do?
1055040	1057040	Oh, maybe he wrote some lyrics.
1057040	1059040	Am I correct?
1059040	1060040	Music.
1060040	1063040	Or other way around, wrote some music for a certain podcast theme song?
1063040	1069040	I believe he produced and wrote, co-produced and co-wrote the music of our current season
1069040	1070040	two theme song.
1070040	1072040	My life is great and it's all my fault by all.
1072040	1073040	What a good song.
1073040	1074040	What a great song.
1074040	1075040	Hell yeah.
1075040	1076040	Great songs.
1076040	1077040	Great song for a good podcast.
1077040	1078040	Good job, Cole.
1078040	1084040	Anyway, so Cole is doing our first initial sweep of the podcast to do a nice edit through
1084040	1085040	there for me.
1085040	1090040	That way I can come on through and do the little creative edits I like to do afterwards
1090040	1093040	without spending so much of my time editing.
1093040	1098040	And I'm just so happy to have Cole here with us at Pretending to Be People.
1098040	1102240	Cole removes everything problematic we say and then Zach goes back and creatively edits
1102240	1104040	the things we actually said to make us something problematic.
1104040	1105040	AI has gotten really, really good.
1105040	1108040	It's a fun little game they like to play.
1108040	1111040	I feel like Cole is in the room with us here in a creepy way.
1111040	1115040	I know Cole in the chilies.
1115040	1118040	Also our new sponsor, Chilies.
1118040	1119040	That's enough.
1119040	1120040	Let's get into this fucking thing.
1120040	1124040	Let's start shouting out aspirational sponsors.
1124040	1125040	Aspirin.
1125040	1126040	Aspirin.
1126040	1129040	You can get your aspirational dorm room at Target.
1129040	1131040	Everything you need for back to school.
1131040	1132040	Target's a big swing.
1132040	1135040	Which was several months ago.
1135040	1137040	And coming up, depending on if you're listening to this.
1137040	1138040	Christmas!
1138040	1139040	It's Christmas at Target.
1139040	1142040	It's Christmas at Target.
1142040	1143040	You hear those sleigh bells?
1143040	1145040	Ding-a-ding-ding-ding-a-ding.
1145040	1146040	What do we have?
1146040	1148040	Fucking 45 minutes of bullshit and no podcast right now?
1148040	1150040	It's actually not as much as I thought.
1150040	1151040	We're doing pretty good.
1151040	1154040	I thought we had a solid 20 at least.
1154040	1155040	16?
1155040	1156040	That's not great.
1156040	1160040	We're headed down to 12, which isn't too insufferable.
1160040	1165040	Don't be too selective with your edits here, Cole.
1165040	1167040	Alright, let's get this straight.
1167040	1172040	You went with Stevie, the new intern and secret eldest child of Fred Godell, to an anonymously
1172040	1176040	submitted dropped pin, which had been secretly submitted by Stevie.
1176040	1181040	And that led you to a series of road signs telling you to turn around and a dead end
1181040	1186040	with a dense tree line, which was secretly a wall covered in plants and bushes and trees.
1186040	1191040	And inside was an unnaturally smooth gorge and a single simple steel train car took you
1191040	1194040	across the wildly deep and foggy ravine with strangely slick sides.
1194040	1199040	Of course, after you left behind all food and drink, which Stevie explained was secretly
1199040	1203040	a ploy by Fred Godell because caffeine makes it harder for him to affect your mind.
1203040	1206040	Which is why the train couldn't actually detect the lasagna.
1206040	1207040	Caffeine-free lasagna.
1207040	1208040	And then you finally-
1208040	1209040	Now at Target.
1209040	1211040	That's right, folks.
1211040	1216040	And then you finally got in the Can-Van, family-sized frozen lasagna for the holiday season.
1216040	1217040	And you started driving.
1217040	1218040	$14.99.
1218040	1219040	Even had a full tank of gas.
1219040	1224040	But at the very first gas station, from the one-way road to Godell's Gate to Grover's
1224040	1230040	Gorge, there at each pump, a green Range Rover, and stepping out of one while staring directly
1230040	1236040	at the Can-Van, was president of the Godell company himself, Fred Godell.
1237040	1242040	And then, quote unquote, safely, back in the city, you left God in the tied up body of
1242040	1248040	Fox Godell with Stevie, just the two of them, where else but in Cal Colorado's basement.
1248040	1250040	It's a very well-built basement.
1250040	1255040	And then you decided to keep Vivica in the room to do a better edit of the footage from
1255040	1256040	Grover's Gorge.
1256040	1259040	And she crit-failed her grip check.
1259040	1264040	Does anyone have anything they'd like to say about any of that?
1264040	1265040	I'm sorry, Vivica.
1265040	1269040	I did want to mention, in re-listening to the episode, that we all made a point not
1269040	1271040	to show her any of the God stuff.
1271040	1275040	So she's at least not as freaked in the bean as she could be.
1275040	1276040	Freaked in the bean.
1276040	1278040	You did keep her away from the God stuff.
1278040	1282040	Sorry, we thought sanity was problematic, so this season we're going to have freaked
1282040	1285040	in the bean rolls.
1285040	1288040	Brought to you by Busch's Baked Beans.
1288040	1291040	Found a target.
1291040	1293040	Freaked in the bean indeed.
1293040	1299040	She was spared, perhaps, some sort of mental break there, but the critical failure on seeing
1299040	1307040	those human-animal hybrids at the end, which were outlined by Beck Wilder in the edit,
1307040	1309040	that's really what did it.
1309040	1310040	The people animals?
1310040	1313040	Yeah, yeah, I think that more than anything.
1313040	1315040	Yeah, they were like covered in blood too.
1315040	1319040	One of them had like a pug face, but a human body.
1319040	1324040	And I was asked on Instagram by a famous pretending to be people artist, Slidewhistle.
1324040	1325040	Shout out to Slidewhistle.
1325040	1326040	Shout out to Slidewhistle.
1326040	1333040	Slidewhistle asked if the pug face was like furry, like a dog face, or if it had like
1333040	1336040	human skin flaps, but then in the shape of a pug.
1336040	1337040	Excellent question.
1337040	1338040	And I asked which was worse.
1338040	1340040	I think a little bit of fur.
1340040	1345040	And they said just the human skin with the flaps.
1345040	1346040	So it was that?
1346040	1348040	So I said that, yeah, for sure it's that.
1348040	1349040	I agree.
1349040	1350040	So that's awful.
1350040	1351040	So that's nasty.
1351040	1352040	And cute Hannah.
1352040	1358040	What if it has like real thin like Charlie Brown hair, the kind you can totally see through.
1358040	1361040	And it's just like in weird patches.
1361040	1362040	Ugh, ducky ducky.
1362040	1364040	Somebody do AI of that.
1364040	1368040	Oh, somebody do AI of that.
1368040	1369040	Somebody do AI of that.
1369040	1373040	We're no longer asking for fan art.
1374040	1377040	We're just asking for props.
1383040	1387040	The editing bay has the air sucked out of it entirely and you can all hear the blood
1387040	1393040	in your ears pounding through your heads as you see the images of the unnaturally lush
1393040	1401040	greenery and the sounds of the bones and cartilage and Julius's face being broken and rearranged.
1401040	1406040	And you're brought right back to the most dreadful and confusing place you've ever seen
1406040	1408040	on a screen, much less been to.
1408040	1411040	Back to Grover's gorge and you feel nauseous.
1411040	1414040	But this was your goal.
1414040	1418040	You technically succeeded, but how these mixed emotions land on you right now, it's really
1418040	1420040	up to the roll of the dice.
1420040	1422040	So I'm going to need a grip check from each of you.
1422040	1427040	And if you pass this grip check, the success and pride you feel in a mission accomplished
1427040	1432040	pushes through the horrific memories and cements a stronger resolve.
1432040	1439040	And you'll be able to add 1d8 to your grip and you'll be able to add 1d10 to any skill
1439040	1444040	of your choosing with an explanation of how this resolve makes you better in that skill.
1444040	1449040	But if you fail, the swirling, well, we'll get to that if you all fail there.
1451040	1452040	Yeah, I fail.
1452040	1453040	I failed.
1453040	1454040	I failed.
1454040	1456040	God, you gave us such a cool thing we could have done.
1456040	1457040	I know.
1457040	1460040	You've never given us cool shit before.
1460040	1461040	Ever.
1461040	1462040	Ever.
1462040	1465040	You never give us anything.
1465040	1473040	If you fail, the swirling mix of devastation and helplessness will overwhelm you while
1473040	1477040	you lose yourselves in the footage playing in the editing bay and you won't be able
1477040	1483040	to take your eyes off the screens and you'll miss Vivica tensing up like a horse editing
1483040	1485040	a commercial for fireworks.
1485040	1487040	You mean a dog?
1487040	1489040	You mean glue?
1498040	1503040	You're going to tense up like a horse editing a commercial for glue.
1508040	1509040	Which is what she does.
1509040	1511040	Tenses up like a horse editing a commercial for glue.
1511040	1514040	She tenses up like a horse editing a commercial for glue.
1514040	1518040	She tenses up like a dog editing a commercial for fireworks.
1518040	1519040	She's tense?
1519040	1520040	We don't see it though, right?
1520040	1521040	Yeah, we all failed.
1521040	1522040	We missed it.
1522040	1523040	Yeah, you all failed.
1523040	1529040	So, wrapped up in your own sort of situation, she tensely continues the edit and wraps
1529040	1530040	up.
1530040	1531040	Okay.
1531040	1532040	Wow.
1532040	1533040	Yeah.
1533040	1534040	Wow, right?
1534040	1536040	Like, it's really something, isn't it?
1536040	1537040	I've never seen anything-
1537040	1538040	You handled it really well.
1538040	1540040	It's going to, I mean, this is good news, right?
1540040	1541040	Don't you think this is good?
1541040	1544040	I mean, not this is bad news, but don't you think this makes great news?
1544040	1547040	I, we're going to get promotions.
1547040	1549040	She's like holding back vomit.
1549040	1550040	Hey, hey, hey.
1550040	1554040	I know you're probably thinking right now about local Emmys and that's making you nervous,
1554040	1558040	but, well, let me say you're right to be nervous because I can't imagine anything beating
1558040	1559040	you this year.
1559040	1560040	We're talking Pulitzer.
1560040	1567040	Just looking at the computer tower, just looking at the monitors, just looks back at you, starts
1567040	1569040	shaking your head no.
1569040	1573040	I know you're a perfectionist, but I saw your cut and it's good.
1573040	1574040	We've got to get it out immediately.
1574040	1575040	People need to see this, Vivica.
1575040	1577040	I know you probably want more time with it, right?
1577040	1578040	She nods.
1578040	1581040	Typh has to see it and it'll have to go out tomorrow, right?
1581040	1584040	She's running her hands over her face and-
1584040	1588040	This is perhaps the most consequential story of the last 20 years.
1588040	1589040	This is 9-11, Vivica.
1589040	1590040	This is your 9-11.
1590040	1592040	But, like, in a good way.
1592040	1594040	I don't understand how that makes me comfortable.
1594040	1597040	Can I just throw a persuade role on this is your 9-11?
1597040	1598040	Yeah, go ahead and roll.
1598040	1602040	Yeah, I started role-playing a reasonable response.
1602040	1604040	How foolish of me.
1604040	1605040	That's a pass.
1605040	1609040	71 on an 80.
1609040	1611040	Opportunities like this don't come around very often, you're right.
1611040	1614040	Yeah, I just worry about the larger implications.
1614040	1617040	We worry about the larger implications of it not getting out, wouldn't you say?
1617040	1621040	So we're just going to, Bec, can you just burn yourself a copy there that we're going
1621040	1625040	to get sent out of the editing room over to production?
1625040	1627040	You can keep working on this for your sizzle reel.
1627040	1628040	Bec pulls out a thumb drive.
1628040	1629040	Yeah, yeah.
1629040	1634040	And I just go over and just plug it straight in and maybe kind of move her out of the way
1634040	1637040	to get to the keyboard to just go ahead and drop it over there into the thumb drive.
1637040	1638040	Does it go off without a hitch?
1638040	1640040	Roll computer.
1640040	1642040	Science.
1642040	1643040	That's a pass.
1643040	1644040	34 on a 60.
1644040	1646040	It goes off without a hitch.
1646040	1647040	I plug it out.
1647040	1649040	Vivica, this is going to be a good thing.
1649040	1651040	Like, did you see that medical device in there?
1651040	1655040	Like, I know you freaked out by, like, the scary stuff, but there's also stuff there
1655040	1658040	that's going to revolutionize the way we do medicine.
1658040	1660040	Like, it could cure cancer.
1660040	1663040	She's just stone face staring at the floor.
1663040	1664040	Vivica, are you okay?
1664040	1666040	Are you having personal problems?
1666040	1668040	I'm not having personal problems.
1668040	1671040	I'm having problems with what I just saw, obviously.
1671040	1673040	I'm fucking having problems with what I just saw, Cal.
1673040	1677040	And you're asking me if I have personal problems right now.
1677040	1679040	What the fuck is wrong with you?
1679040	1680040	You're right.
1680040	1681040	You're right.
1681040	1687040	I feel like I already dealt with some of these truths, and I apologize if we thrust this upon you, as it were.
1687040	1691040	We've had a little more time to process this than you have, apparently.
1691040	1692040	Yes, exactly.
1692040	1694040	But we didn't want to go to anybody but you with this, Vivica.
1694040	1696040	You're the best in the business.
1696040	1697040	It had to be you.
1697040	1701040	We thought you would be, you know, strong enough to handle it versus hiding it from you.
1701040	1703040	And you would really do it justice.
1703040	1704040	And you have.
1704040	1705040	It's a good edit.
1705040	1706040	It's a great edit.
1706040	1707040	This is what this is, Vivica.
1707040	1709040	This is justice, putting this out in the world.
1709040	1710040	You saw what they did.
1710040	1712040	You saw the footage from the It Pit.
1712040	1713040	It has to be out there.
1713040	1714040	Fine.
1714040	1719040	So we're probably going to have, like, seven or eight different days where we show this footage.
1719040	1722040	So maybe, you know, adrenaline if you're not tired.
1722040	1725040	Any kind of motions towards, like, her workstation.
1725040	1728040	Or if you need to, you know, get some rest.
1728040	1730040	I'll be right back. I'll be right back. I'll be right back.
1730040	1732040	We're handling this well.
1732040	1735040	As the door closes behind her.
1735040	1737040	What time is it right now?
1737040	1739040	What, like 2.30 in the morning?
1739040	1742040	Oh, okay. So there's no way my uncle is here right now?
1742040	1745040	No. No, he's at the bar still, at least.
1745040	1748040	Well, in the city, they stay up until, like, five sometimes.
1748040	1749040	Well, and he wasn't at...
1749040	1752040	Especially if you call it a private club.
1752040	1754040	If you have the proper permits.
1754040	1757040	Luke, he also wasn't at work today.
1757040	1759040	Yeah, and he's not answering texts, right?
1759040	1760040	That's right.
1760040	1763040	Didn't somebody tell us that he was going to a meeting or something?
1763040	1766040	Somebody at least gave a reason for his absence.
1766040	1768040	Yes, he was at a meeting at City Tower.
1768040	1770040	It's a big tower that looks like a T.
1772040	1773040	No.
1775040	1781040	Vivica is in the bathroom, and the three of you have wrapped up this edit.
1781040	1782040	Good job. Good job, man.
1782040	1784040	I can't wait until I see it on TV.
1784040	1787040	Do you guys, like, after seeing how Vivica reacted,
1787040	1789040	have any, like, second thoughts now?
1789040	1790040	Like, that's gonna...
1790040	1792040	What just happened is gonna happen all over the city,
1792040	1795040	and then we're not gonna be there to help talk him down.
1795040	1799040	I think maybe that's the kind of outrage we need to fight against Grover's Gorge.
1799040	1801040	Was it outrage or abject terror?
1801040	1806040	I think our audience is smart enough to decide for themselves.
1806040	1810040	We try to not hold their hands, or at least we did when I was an anchor here.
1810040	1813040	I think... I think we can trust them.
1813040	1814040	I'm just saying...
1814040	1815040	People will recognize.
1815040	1818040	Vivica's, like, a hardened, like, professional who's edited, like,
1818040	1821040	everything that's come through here, and she's never had a reaction like that.
1821040	1823040	Are you afraid of success, Clark?
1824040	1825040	Who's Clark?
1831040	1833040	Cal, are you okay?
1833040	1834040	It's me, Beck.
1834040	1835040	Seriously, are you okay?
1835040	1838040	I'm... I'm... I'm fine, Beck.
1838040	1840040	Are you fine? Are you afraid of success?
1840040	1842040	I don't know. I guess if that... Maybe I am.
1842040	1846040	If it's, like, success on one hand, and, like, you know,
1846040	1851040	people not being able to live in the world that we present them as fact now,
1851040	1852040	I don't know which is worth it.
1852040	1855040	I didn't go through all that to not have a producer credit in this,
1855040	1857040	so I think it's going up.
1857040	1859040	What if we take another pass at it, and, like,
1859040	1862040	maybe just take out a few of the more mind-blowing things?
1862040	1866040	Maybe the animal people come out, and we save that for later?
1866040	1868040	Perhaps you might be on to something.
1868040	1873040	A whole week of series progressively leading up to...
1873040	1874040	He's into it.
1874040	1878040	Hey, Julius, this will increase numbers.
1878040	1879040	Absolutely.
1879040	1881040	As we tease the real things.
1881040	1883040	But it will also, yes, perhaps,
1883040	1886040	anesthetize the population to some extent
1886040	1889040	against the kind of surely atypical reaction we've seen here.
1891040	1894040	At that exact moment, the glass door that goes in,
1894040	1897040	the frosty glass door that leads into the editing bay,
1897040	1902040	it's a pole, and it is being pushed as a body slams into it,
1902040	1906040	and then disheveled opens the door, flinging it open,
1906040	1909040	and you see Kurt, you guys would know Kurt.
1909040	1911040	He's in his thirties, but he looks older,
1911040	1913040	his eyes are sunken in,
1913040	1916040	and he's wearing a disheveled can windbreaker.
1916040	1919040	He's got big curly hair on top,
1919040	1921040	and as he kind of pushes in,
1921040	1924040	you see he's got an old TCN polo
1924040	1927040	underneath his can windbreaker.
1927040	1931040	You know, Kurt goes around and shops wild videos
1931040	1933040	to different news agencies that he's taken
1933040	1936040	throughout the late evening of night,
1936040	1938040	and he kind of flings the door open,
1938040	1942040	and is like, boys, I got something for you.
1942040	1944040	Oh, let me get the voice.
1944040	1946040	Oh, I was glaring at you in character,
1946040	1948040	not because I disapproved of your voice choice.
1948040	1949040	Boys, welcome.
1949040	1952040	Boys, boys, welcome to daddy.
1952040	1953040	Oh, boy.
1953040	1956040	Is that your entry phrase, to this voice?
1956040	1958040	Boys, welcome to daddy.
1958040	1960040	Welcome to daddy.
1960040	1962040	No, I'm back in it.
1962040	1964040	Welcome, welcome, welcome.
1964040	1967040	Boys, welcome to daddy.
1967040	1972040	It is I, Kurt, typical American guy.
1972040	1975040	I want to be your dad.
1975040	1977040	I am Kurt.
1977040	1979040	What's the voice?
1979040	1981040	He flings the door.
1981040	1984040	He flings the mic in Luke's face.
1984040	1986040	He flings the mic.
1986040	1987040	Sorry, Cole.
1987040	1988040	He flings the door open.
1988040	1989040	Hey, it's me, Kurt.
1989040	1990040	Hello.
1990040	1991040	Hello, it is I, Kurtis.
1991040	1993040	Call me daddy.
1994040	1997040	Oh, no.
1997040	1998040	No, thank you.
1998040	2000040	Wrong editing, babe.
2003040	2006040	Guys, it's Kurt, the mute nightcrawler.
2014040	2018040	He walks in and hands you a notepad.
2018040	2019040	Where you guys crawl on it.
2019040	2021040	What do you want, Kurt?
2021040	2024040	No, it says welcome to daddy.
2030040	2033040	I grabbed the video from him and pop it in and see what it is.
2033040	2035040	He flings the door open.
2035040	2037040	Hello, boys.
2037040	2045040	You must call me daddy because I have footage that you are going to really love.
2045040	2053040	Oh, your mind may not be prepared to handle the footage that I have for you this evening.
2053040	2055040	I want you to prepare.
2055040	2057040	Hey, Kurt.
2057040	2058040	Hello, Kurt.
2058040	2060040	We're not going to call you daddy.
2060040	2061040	We tell you that every time.
2061040	2064040	I don't know why, but also, we have some...
2064040	2065040	Oh, Julius.
2065040	2066040	Oh, Julius, no.
2066040	2068040	I just only recently met him.
2068040	2069040	I thought it was just...
2069040	2071040	No, Julius, he gets every new employee.
2071040	2073040	He introduced himself to me as daddy.
2073040	2076040	Oh, Julius, no.
2076040	2078040	Oh, this is very disappointing.
2078040	2079040	Julius feels dirty.
2079040	2080040	Kurt, you ought to be ashamed.
2080040	2084040	He's just winking at Julius.
2084040	2085040	Julius, I'm sorry.
2085040	2086040	This is Kurt.
2086040	2090040	He's a weirdo, a bad coworker, and a nightcrawler.
2090040	2091040	Whoa, hey, come on.
2091040	2092040	He's a nightcrawler.
2092040	2094040	Well, let's see what you've got.
2094040	2097040	We're probably pretty full up this week, but let's see.
2097040	2102040	Yeah, this might be the last time you see us down in the non-executive editing bay.
2102040	2105040	That's not a real thing, but we're on the up and up is what I mean.
2105040	2107040	But let's see what footage you have.
2107040	2108040	Beck likes Kurt.
2121040	2122040	No.
2122040	2123040	Kurt?
2123040	2124040	Kurt, you got another tape?
2124040	2126040	You're gonna love it, especially.
2126040	2127040	It's fucked up, man.
2127040	2130040	This isn't like that fish man from the other day,
2130040	2132040	and it was just a guy taking a swim in the river, right?
2132040	2140040	If you can tell me how this is not real, that would actually help my mental state.
2140040	2141040	I don't know.
2141040	2142040	I mean, I'm sorry, Kurt.
2142040	2144040	No offense or some offense.
2144040	2149040	I don't know what might help the mental state of a man such as you who chases ambulances
2149040	2151040	to film the grisly aftermath.
2151040	2153040	That is how it starts.
2153040	2155040	We go back to your place.
2155040	2158040	That's how it starts.
2158040	2161040	Julius pops the video in to see what's on it.
2161040	2166040	Starts with an ambulance, and you see he's sprinting up on an ambulance
2166040	2172040	as the EMTs are rushing over to a car that is flipped over on a bridge in the city,
2172040	2174040	looking out beyond this accident.
2174040	2177040	You see the city skyscape in the background.
2177040	2179040	That's what it's called.
2179040	2182040	Kyle shakes his head and turns away, like looks away.
2182040	2186040	The other two of you see a mother and daughter trapped in this car,
2186040	2192040	and one of the EMTs is running up to try to pry open the door to get the two of them.
2192040	2197040	Suddenly, out of nowhere, you hear coming out the left speakers, the audio.
2197040	2206040	A car speeding through slams into the EMT, who is trying to help accident on top of accident.
2206040	2207040	It's gruesome.
2207040	2209040	The camera zooms in.
2209040	2212040	He rushes towards them, trying to figure out what was going on.
2212040	2216040	The camera whips over behind to see where the car came from.
2216040	2221040	There's nothing, but then the camera sees people stopping on this bridge,
2221040	2226040	getting out of their cars, looking up beyond and above the camera.
2226040	2228040	The camera whips around.
2228040	2232040	It's like a bolt of lightning that's continuously striking,
2232040	2234040	or an unnaturally focused tornado.
2234040	2240040	An unholy, stomach-dropping phenomenon connects the sky above and the bridge below,
2240040	2244040	and Kurt begins running toward it, the camera bouncing up and down as he zooms,
2244040	2248040	and pulls focus onto this vibrating, humming, electric, and wet mass
2248040	2252040	that makes up this towering force of nature,
2252040	2256040	this terrifying, unfamiliar weather pattern.
2256040	2259040	Quietly to himself, but right into the microphone, Kurt states,
2259040	2267040	Perhaps this is a new fear for the future of humanity as earthquakes and volcanoes once were
2267040	2270040	for the first of our kind upon witnessing them.
2270040	2274040	And then just as quickly as a lightning bolt flashes back into nothingness,
2274040	2277040	this colossal cylinder of destruction is gone,
2277040	2283040	and Kurt makes it to the front of a confused and scared crowd to shoot the wake of this devastation,
2283040	2289040	and you all see a hole in this bridge about the size of a big revolving door at a mall,
2289040	2292040	and Kurt approaches the edge with caution.
2292040	2296040	You can hear onlookers screaming at him to get away and be careful,
2296040	2302040	but he holds his camera out over the edge and you see the choppy waters of the enormous city river below,
2302040	2309040	and there's a tugboat with a full barge, and it's too close to the changing tide.
2309040	2313040	It's fighting, resisting the new path, but whatever that was,
2313040	2317040	it punched a hole in the bottom of the city river,
2317040	2321040	and this tugboat is circling the drain smoothly at first,
2321040	2324040	and then violently, this vessel is ripped bow first,
2324040	2328040	and it plunges into the unknown followed by its barge.
2328040	2331040	Kurt doesn't move a fucking muscle,
2331040	2334040	and after about 30 seconds worth of an eternity,
2334040	2338040	the spiraling waters below slow their pattern,
2338040	2341040	and the regular flow of the city river resumes,
2341040	2346040	and as the camera zooms back out of the hole on this bridge,
2346040	2350040	you all notice the unnaturally smooth edges
2350040	2352040	where the bridge was punctured.
2352040	2355040	You hear Kurt breathe into the microphone.
2355040	2359040	The tearing nature is rough and ugly and leaves shrapnel,
2359040	2363040	and this is clearly none of those things.
2363040	2365040	He runs back, camera kind of bouncing,
2365040	2367040	you see people all lined out,
2367040	2372040	and he runs up to the first person he sees who looks like
2372040	2373040	Carrot Top.
2375040	2377040	He puts the camera on and says,
2377040	2379040	Sir, what did you see?
2379040	2383040	The person is mouth wide open, speechless.
2383040	2384040	Smart.
2386040	2389040	He runs up to the next person in the crowd.
2389040	2392040	It's a kid, and he's also mouth agape,
2392040	2394040	and he's staring at the hole,
2394040	2396040	and he's looking into the camera,
2396040	2399040	into the hole, into the camera.
2399040	2402040	Is it like a special effect?
2402040	2406040	It's like a ride,
2406040	2409040	and then it's like a mirror, right?
2409040	2412040	Yes, it must have been. Who are you here with?
2412040	2414040	I just was taking a stroll.
2422040	2424040	Your loved ones must be looking for you.
2424040	2426040	It's like the kid that Will Smith shoots
2426040	2430040	in the Men in Black testing facility,
2430040	2433040	because they're out at midnight with physics textbooks.
2435040	2437040	What the fuck are they up to?
2439040	2442040	News story, the wandering children of the city.
2444040	2446040	What, does the city have an urchin problem
2446040	2448040	that we might explore a little later?
2448040	2449040	All cities.
2452040	2454040	And he goes up to the third person.
2454040	2456040	Thomas, what do they look like?
2456040	2457040	Carrot Top.
2461040	2464040	The camera whips back around to the original Carrot Top.
2464040	2467040	Well, it's his twin brother that's standing right next to him.
2468040	2470040	Camera pans back and forth between the two of them.
2470040	2473040	Must you be silent like your brother?
2473040	2476040	What my brother said speaks for all of us, I think.
2476040	2478040	You see several more Carrot Tops in the crowd.
2479040	2481040	One of them comes up and goes,
2481040	2483040	I think we've angered God.
2483040	2484040	Yeah.
2484040	2487040	Well, I mean, this sick society
2487040	2489040	has been angering God for a long time.
2490040	2492040	Well, you might be surprised.
2492040	2495040	You might not, by what we believe.
2496040	2498040	You want to interview us some more?
2498040	2499040	Nope.
2499040	2500040	Kurt runs away.
2500040	2501040	Kurt runs away.
2501040	2502040	The camera turns off and he's like,
2502040	2504040	I couldn't get any other footage.
2504040	2507040	So, Cal, you see, has been watching
2507040	2509040	since his kind of false modesty at the start
2509040	2511040	pretty much the whole time, and he chuckles.
2511040	2514040	And he's like, okay, Kurt.
2514040	2516040	Well, that's a very nice,
2516040	2518040	is that your audition reel for Marvel
2518040	2520040	or the Fast franchise?
2520040	2521040	It's a little weird that you have a kid
2521040	2524040	point out its special effects halfway through,
2524040	2526040	but that was very well done, I suppose.
2526040	2528040	That's better than what you normally
2528040	2530040	apply yourself to, I guess.
2530040	2532040	Let's get a grip check from everybody.
2532040	2535040	See if that, see if Cal's bullshitting,
2535040	2537040	or if he actually feels that way.
2537040	2538040	Cal passes.
2538040	2539040	Beck passes.
2539040	2540040	Resilient.
2540040	2542040	Cal feels that way, which is why he said it.
2542040	2543040	I got a 99.
2544040	2548040	Beck lets out a wily, like a Looney Tunes scream
2548040	2549040	and runs out of it.
2549040	2550040	I'm back.
2550040	2551040	Who's back?
2551040	2552040	God damn it.
2552040	2553040	Clark, I'm fine.
2555040	2556040	Do you mean Keith?
2556040	2558040	Julius lets out a wily, god damn it.
2558040	2560040	What happens, Julius?
2564040	2566040	And that was just from seeing this footage.
2566040	2567040	Yeah.
2567040	2570040	Yeah, he also says, I think we've angered God.
2570040	2572040	Go ahead and roll a D4.
2572040	2573040	Nice.
2575040	2577040	It's the one with four sides.
2577040	2578040	He flipped me off.
2578040	2579040	One.
2579040	2580040	He flipped me off again.
2583040	2585040	All right, you just lose one grip.
2585040	2586040	Good.
2587040	2589040	Can Beck look at that footage
2589040	2592040	and see a time on it and try and compare
2592040	2594040	maybe what we were doing in Grover's Gorge
2594040	2595040	when this happened?
2595040	2597040	Yeah, it seems to be,
2597040	2602040	it seems to have happened roughly 20 to 30 minutes
2602040	2605040	after you left Cal Colorado's house.
2606040	2607040	Oh, no.
2607040	2608040	It just reasons.
2608040	2609040	Gotcha.
2609040	2610040	We have angered God.
2610040	2611040	Oh, shit.
2611040	2613040	Can we, from landmarks in the footage
2613040	2616040	or maybe just asking Kurt, where did this happen?
2616040	2618040	Is it the neighbor near my house?
2618040	2619040	Yeah.
2619040	2621040	Okay, I call Stevie.
2621040	2622040	Yeah, that phone.
2622040	2623040	Bing, bing.
2623040	2624040	Bing, bing.
2624040	2625040	Bing, bing.
2625040	2626040	Bing, bing.
2626040	2627040	Bing, bing.
2627040	2628040	Taylor again.
2628040	2629040	Bing, bing.
2629040	2630040	Bing, bing.
2630040	2632040	And then it goes to Stevie's voicemail.
2632040	2635040	Beck sees the look on Cal's face
2635040	2638040	and Beck starts to get the drained blood
2638040	2639040	from the head feeling.
2639040	2640040	Hi, Stevie.
2640040	2642040	Cal Colorado, City Action News.
2642040	2644040	Just wanted to check in,
2644040	2647040	see how y'all are doing in my basement.
2647040	2650040	Hope you're having a good time.
2650040	2652040	I did, you know about the pizza money I left.
2652040	2653040	I think I told you about that.
2653040	2655040	If you don't, there's $25 on the counter.
2655040	2657040	If that's not enough for pizza these days,
2657040	2665040	there is $1,500 in the front drawer of the desk in my office.
2665040	2669040	So take as much as you need.
2669040	2671040	I hope you're having a good time.
2671040	2673040	Please just let me know that everything's okay.
2673040	2674040	Thank you.
2674040	2675040	Again, this is Cal Colorado.
2675040	2676040	Good night.
2676040	2677040	Choice.
2677040	2678040	So good.
2678040	2681040	Julius has kind of rewound the video
2681040	2684040	and is on one of the lightning strike looking things.
2684040	2687040	And is just like intently just staring at it
2687040	2690040	and picking at his face.
2690040	2691040	Gross.
2691040	2694040	We got to go and check on our friend.
2694040	2696040	Beck says, remembering that Kurt's there.
2696040	2698040	We should check on our friend.
2698040	2700040	Yeah, I'm terribly sorry, Kurt.
2700040	2703040	Again, I do find this all very impressive
2703040	2706040	and certainly better than your normal filth and depravity.
2706040	2709040	You should pursue this passion for CG,
2709040	2711040	computer-generated imagery.
2711040	2714040	But we do have to go check on our friend.
2714040	2718040	I really, really hope you have a pleasant evening.
2718040	2720040	This has been Cal Colorado.
2720040	2723040	Julius was in a daze a little bit and turns around
2723040	2725040	and looks at Kurt and he's like,
2725040	2726040	what's the rate, daddy?
2726040	2728040	What's the rate, Kurt?
2732040	2735040	And he pulls out a canned checkbook.
2735040	2738040	Well, I would say for something like this,
2739040	2742040	I'm hoping for 800.
2742040	2745040	Julius writes a check for $500 and hands it to him.
2747040	2750040	The F can look like an E, the five can look like an eight.
2750040	2751040	Yep.
2751040	2752040	This'll do.
2754040	2756040	Does Julius hear him say that?
2757040	2758040	What?
2758040	2760040	And he's out.
2760040	2763040	He's like, that's just $300.
2763040	2765040	And as the three of you head out,
2765040	2767040	is that the move?
2767040	2770040	Yeah, I think Beck would want to just check on Vivica
2770040	2771040	before we leave.
2771040	2772040	Yeah.
2772040	2773040	Maybe just tap on the bathroom door.
2773040	2774040	Oh, yeah.
2774040	2777040	We have a whole new release strategy to discuss with her.
2777040	2778040	Okay, yeah.
2778040	2780040	So when you tap on the door, she immediately opens it.
2780040	2783040	Hey, Viv, I know you're having a tough time with this
2783040	2785040	and we've talked about it and...
2785040	2786040	She goes for a hug.
2786040	2787040	Oh, hey.
2787040	2788040	It's like kind of weird.
2788040	2789040	It's like not normal.
2789040	2791040	Hey, no, it's okay.
2791040	2793040	We talked about it and you're right,
2793040	2795040	that this is maybe too much too fast.
2795040	2796040	We're gonna take another pass at the edit
2796040	2799040	and we're just gonna take out some of the really scary stuff
2799040	2802040	and maybe kind of build up to it over the course of a week or two.
2802040	2803040	Prepare people for it.
2803040	2804040	You were right.
2804040	2805040	It is scary.
2805040	2806040	You were right, Vivica.
2806040	2809040	Go ahead and roll as you're saying you were right.
2809040	2812040	Beck, if you could roll alertness.
2814040	2817040	I pass a nine on a 40.
2817040	2821040	Yeah, the hug felt weird but nothing too strange
2821040	2823040	and she kind of walks out and is like...
2823040	2825040	She put a goddamn kick me sign on my back.
2827040	2831040	Okay, so I guess you send that off to production
2831040	2833040	and we'll see you in the morning.
2833040	2834040	See you tomorrow.
2834040	2836040	Yeah, we'll see you tomorrow with fresh eyes.
2836040	2837040	It's all gonna be okay.
2837040	2839040	And she's walking out the door.
2839040	2845040	I need either humant or alertness from Julius and Cal.
2846040	2847040	I pass humant.
2847040	2848040	With a?
2848040	2849040	34.
2849040	2850040	Okay.
2850040	2851040	I critically fail.
2851040	2852040	Okay.
2852040	2854040	Either within 88.
2854040	2857040	So Cal has leaned down to tie his shoe.
2858040	2860040	She kind of turns back and is like,
2860040	2862040	okay, I'll see you tomorrow.
2862040	2865040	And heads out and closes the door behind her
2865040	2869040	off of the marbleless floor in front of you.
2869040	2872040	Empty, dark outside but it's well lit in here.
2872040	2873040	Well lit?
2873040	2877040	Yeah, you can hear a vacuum going in the background
2877040	2879040	as it's like 3.30 in the morning.
2879040	2882040	Oh yeah, then the ghost of the janitor
2882040	2885040	who worked here in the 50s is vacuuming at night.
2885040	2887040	Should we go check on God?
2887040	2889040	I mean, I've got a bad feeling.
2889040	2891040	I'm worried that what we just saw in that footage
2891040	2893040	that Kirk brought is, I don't know,
2893040	2895040	did something fuck up at the God basement?
2895040	2897040	I don't think that he's still in there.
2897040	2899040	Wasn't that your neighborhood, Cal?
2899040	2902040	Oh, I mean, nearby.
2902040	2904040	It wasn't quite as nice.
2905040	2907040	The nearest bridge to get to downtown.
2907040	2908040	Yeah, yeah.
2908040	2912040	That's a lot of bridge and tunnel coming through there
2912040	2914040	but no, that's not quite my neighborhood.
2914040	2919040	Is that bridge tall enough to, you know, splat?
2919040	2920040	What do you mean?
2920040	2922040	Jump off and die?
2922040	2923040	Oh, Lord, yes.
2923040	2927040	It's actually probably the most popular suicide bridge in the city.
2928040	2930040	Yeah, it's like 83.6 yards tall.
2930040	2932040	It's on TripAdvisor.
2932040	2934040	Yeah, I mean, well, you see, the thing is
2934040	2936040	it was built in the 1880s
2936040	2940040	and there has been a lot of time for death to accumulate.
2940040	2942040	It's the subject of some local fascination.
2942040	2947040	And how far of a walk from your apartment is it?
2947040	2948040	15 minutes.
2948040	2950040	Julius just kind of looks at Beck and Cal.
2950040	2955040	Yeah, Beck is nodding at you with a grim expression.
2956040	2958040	Yeah, it could have happened, I guess.
2958040	2961040	We got to go check and make sure Stevie's okay
2961040	2963040	and I've got a bad feeling.
2963040	2964040	Here's another kicker.
2964040	2966040	We have a date with you in the hospital.
2966040	2969040	Do you want to get dropped off, me and Cal, go check it out?
2969040	2971040	No, I've got to go.
2972040	2974040	I looked it up in the rules, by the way,
2974040	2977040	and the official rules of Delta Green.
2977040	2979040	You're not conscious at two hit points.
2979040	2980040	Like, you can't even...
2980040	2981040	How could you be?
2981040	2983040	You're not conscious at one or two hit points.
2983040	2984040	Good thing I've got four.
2984040	2987040	But you roll con when you go down to one or two hit points
2987040	2990040	and if you succeed, then you're fine.
2990040	2992040	You're just unconscious.
2992040	2996040	But if you fail, you take a permanent injury
2996040	2998040	that reduces one of your stats.
2998040	2999040	It's super bad for you.
2999040	3001040	It's super bad for you.
3003040	3006040	Good thing we didn't know that when it happened to me.
3006040	3007040	Well, no, because it worked out
3007040	3009040	because you actually succeeded on your contract
3009040	3012040	to stay conscious both times, I believe.
3012040	3014040	So no permanent injury, which works out well.
3014040	3018040	And I'm up to four hit points, so we're not breaking any rules.
3018040	3021040	Yes, we're not breaking any rules.
3021040	3023040	I told them I'd be back tomorrow,
3023040	3026040	which technically I've got so many hours to get back there.
3026040	3027040	Let's go. I'll go with you.
3027040	3029040	I mean, if you're feeling up to it,
3029040	3032040	I'm just worried if a strong breeze comes through.
3032040	3034040	I think we've left logic behind long ago.
3034040	3037040	Julius takes one of the pills that the nurse gave him.
3037040	3039040	One of the limitless pills.
3040040	3042040	Because we're not using willpower points,
3042040	3045040	I think it's just going to be 3.30 in the morning.
3045040	3051040	Zach imposes a negative 40 to skill checks starting now.
3051040	3053040	Basically, you're exhausted.
3053040	3054040	Cal is exhausted.
3054040	3055040	Yeah.
3055040	3059040	Now that the energy of getting the edit done,
3059040	3062040	the excitement, all the adrenaline from today is finally worn off,
3062040	3066040	he's not sure why Vivica is so adverse
3066040	3069040	to this amazing opportunity that's been dropped in front of him.
3069040	3071040	And he just wants to go back to his apartment,
3071040	3073040	his nice apartment where nothing has happened.
3073040	3077040	God hasn't blasted through, say, the ceiling or anything.
3077040	3079040	I guess if I've got to go to sleep,
3079040	3081040	I might as well go to sleep at the hospital.
3081040	3084040	So I guess call me and let me know if Stevie's there.
3084040	3085040	Righty-o.
3085040	3088040	Okay, so you guys are going to leave and drop off Julius at the hospital
3088040	3092040	on the way to Cal Colorado's townhouse.
3092040	3094040	I need an alertness check
3094040	3100040	as you all head out the can studio in downtown city.
3100040	3101040	88 on the 70.
3101040	3102040	Wow, dude.
3102040	3103040	89.
3103040	3104040	Wow.
3104040	3107040	59 on a 40.
3107040	3110040	Cal leans down to tie his other shoe.
3110040	3113040	As you guys head out, you're pulling out of the parking lot
3113040	3115040	and you don't see.
3115040	3117040	And nothing happens.
3117040	3121040	You don't see a goddamn thing.
3121040	3123040	You don't see a couple things.
3123040	3124040	Okay, it could be worse.
3124040	3125040	Yeah.
3125040	3126040	Yeah, moving on.
3126040	3128040	I guess it'll be fun later.
3128040	3130040	And we can all look back and be like,
3130040	3132040	Whoa, it was that roll?
3132040	3134040	That's crazy.
3134040	3135040	So just remember this.
3135040	3138040	Cal forgets something he left in the office
3138040	3140040	and comes back outside.
3140040	3143040	It's not something that shouldn't have been a roll though, right?
3143040	3144040	No, it's great.
3144040	3147040	If the sky is on fire or there's people screaming and running.
3147040	3149040	No, there's people hiding from you.
3149040	3150040	Oh, okay.
3150040	3151040	Multiple people.
3151040	3154040	There's always multiple.
3154040	3157040	In any situation Zach sets up in a role-playing game,
3157040	3159040	there are multiple Waldos in each scene
3159040	3161040	that we could have been rolling to find.
3161040	3163040	And he finally remembered to ask.
3163040	3165040	And he's like, wow, interesting.
3165040	3167040	Very first time.
3167040	3168040	You don't wear...
3168040	3169040	Do you know what they call it in England?
3169040	3170040	I don't.
3170040	3171040	Do you know, Joe?
3171040	3172040	I don't think so.
3172040	3173040	It's Where's Wally?
3173040	3174040	I was going to guess Wally.
3174040	3175040	So maybe I did know it at some point.
3175040	3176040	I was hoping somebody would say it.
3176040	3177040	And then I could say,
3177040	3179040	No, it's Where's your cunt or something stupid.
3179040	3186040	But it's Where's Wally?
3186040	3187040	So you head off.
3187040	3188040	And at the hospital,
3188040	3191040	we're going to go ahead and have you stay overnight
3191040	3193040	and get some health back.
3193040	3194040	Yay.
3194040	3195040	Yeah.
3195040	3196040	So go ahead and roll a D4.
3196040	3198040	I also looked up the rules for Delta Green on this.
3198040	3200040	Apparently you're supposed to roll for the surgeon
3200040	3203040	to see if they're good enough to help you.
3203040	3204040	One.
3204040	3205040	Wow.
3205040	3206040	Surely you could also have a credit rating roll
3206040	3208040	against that to see if you can afford a good surgeon.
3208040	3211040	I actually wrote in here that he wouldn't have a good surgeon
3211040	3213040	because his health insurance with City Action News
3213040	3215040	hasn't started up yet.
3215040	3216040	Yep.
3216040	3218040	So that's why I only got one.
3218040	3220040	That's why you only got one hit point back.
3220040	3222040	So you're going to wake up up to five.
3222040	3225040	However, you do also every single night gets you-
3225040	3226040	Yeah.
3226040	3227040	Wait.
3227040	3229040	He got one back or two back when we just talked to the nurse.
3229040	3230040	Two back for talking to the nurse.
3230040	3233040	So we need to have more than one for his actual hospital stay.
3233040	3235040	That doesn't seem mechanically fair.
3235040	3236040	No, no.
3236040	3237040	Turns out the surgeon sucks.
3237040	3238040	Don't they?
3238040	3240040	Yeah, surgeon's not super great.
3240040	3242040	You absolutely should get more than one.
3242040	3244040	It should be a plus something no matter the roll.
3244040	3246040	I agree, but I'm just the handler.
3246040	3247040	Oh, this is actually-
3247040	3248040	What am I supposed to do?
3248040	3254040	This is the start of the arc where we sue the hospital for their incredible malpractice
3254040	3256040	and treating Julius.
3256040	3258040	They can also crit fail on the check.
3258040	3263040	I'm just saying it doesn't make it even worth it for him to have separated from us.
3263040	3269040	So you will get an additional one for a full night's sleep if you can succeed a con check,
3269040	3274040	but we'll have you do that after we figure out what happens at Cal Colorado's in case
3274040	3277040	they call you and are like, actually.
3277040	3278040	Okay.
3278040	3280040	So I've got one more back at the moment.
3280040	3281040	Yeah, for now.
3281040	3282040	What did they do to me?
3282040	3283040	Fluids.
3283040	3284040	And-
3284040	3287040	Seems like the nurse should have done that.
3287040	3288040	Fluids.
3288040	3289040	Fluids.
3289040	3290040	Just fluids.
3290040	3291040	One pain.
3291040	3294040	I have the little pressy button for whatever that is.
3294040	3295040	Morphine.
3295040	3296040	Morphine.
3296040	3298040	They're like, yeah, you can have morphine, I guess.
3298040	3299040	I'll sue this.
3299040	3300040	Do you know who I am?
3300040	3303040	Sue this hospital if you don't get any morphine.
3303040	3304040	You're fucking high as shit.
3304040	3307040	You're like, I'm Cal Colorado.
3307040	3310040	So yeah, I'm no pain, but I'm on the good stuff.
3310040	3311040	No pain, one gain.
3311040	3312040	On the good stuff.
3312040	3314040	Hopefully you guys don't need me.
3314040	3319040	This does feel worthless.
3319040	3321040	It does not seem correct.
3321040	3322040	It doesn't seem correct.
3322040	3325040	It could have just been like, okay, Luke, take your headphones off and when you wake
3325040	3328040	up, you're going to get six hit points or some shit.
3328040	3330040	I mean, I can read from it.
3330040	3333040	Since when have we played by the rules?
3333040	3336040	That's a super great point.
3336040	3338040	I mean, I can read from it right here.
3338040	3345040	I can quote you the regulation, Thomas.
3345040	3351040	Oh, no, I'm just kidding.
3351040	3354040	We're feisty tonight, Cole.
3354040	3356040	Should I step outside?
3356040	3357040	Yeah, I guess so.
3357040	3358040	You should go wait in the cold.
3358040	3361040	Oh, do you have a Bluetooth headphones?
3361040	3362040	I don't.
3362040	3363040	I forgot the headphones.
3363040	3364040	You can just rub your ears.
3364040	3365040	I have headphones.
3365040	3367040	I'll go outside until it's too cold.
3367040	3368040	You can go to your room.
3368040	3369040	Yeah, go to your room.
3369040	3370040	I'll go to my room.
3370040	3371040	You can put in my headphones.
3371040	3373040	I just didn't want to hear you, you know?
3373040	3374040	I'm going to go outside.
3374040	3378040	That way I can, well, I can vape in my own room too, but just let me know.
3378040	3379040	Just let me know.
3379040	3383040	All right, now that Luke is out of the room, shall we go to Cal Colorado's home?
3384040	3387040	Beep, beep, beep, beep.
3387040	3389040	Our city traffic's crazy.
3389040	3391040	Did you guys drive separately?
3391040	3392040	Beep, beep, beep.
3392040	3393040	No, we all came in the can van, right?
3393040	3394040	Yeah, we're all in the can van.
3394040	3397040	Well, I assume the can van, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
3397040	3398040	Okay, right.
3398040	3402040	Oh, you know, maybe after, yeah, Cal probably picks up his car from the parking lot, like
3402040	3405040	where he left it before we headed out to Grover's Gorge.
3405040	3406040	Yeah.
3406040	3408040	How, like two days ago or whatever?
3408040	3409040	Today, earlier today.
3409040	3412040	Just, I mean, yesterday according to the time law, time law.
3413040	3414040	Classic time law.
3414040	3415040	International time law.
3415040	3416040	Time law, not van law.
3416040	3421040	But yeah, so it says July 6th on your phone, but it, you know, you haven't slept in July
3421040	3424040	6th yet, so it's still July 5th in your bones.
3424040	3425040	Yeah, exactly.
3425040	3427040	I think Beck is still driving the van.
3427040	3428040	Okay, sounds good.
3428040	3431040	And the two of you pull up to Cal Colorado's home.
3431040	3432040	You see nothing.
3432040	3436040	He pulls his Mercedes into a little garage, like underneath the street.
3436040	3437040	Nice.
3437040	3438040	Beep, beep.
3438040	3440040	As he passes Beck parking on the street in a salute.
3440040	3441040	Beep, beep.
3441040	3448040	I mean, you guys must be like making eyes at each other as there's nothing amiss so
3448040	3449040	far.
3449040	3453040	Yeah, Cal could walk straight into the basement from the garage, but to be polite to Beck,
3453040	3457040	he walks out the door, back up onto the street, and then lets him in the front door.
3457040	3459040	And before they go downstairs, he's like, do you want anything?
3459040	3460040	Uh, tea, coffee?
3460040	3461040	No.
3461040	3462040	Whiskey?
3462040	3463040	I think I'm good.
3463040	3466040	We just got to make sure Stevie's like here and okay.
3466040	3467040	Yes, yes, of course.
3467040	3472040	I assume they fell asleep playing chess or Catan.
3472040	3475040	Beck is going to make his way to the basement door.
3475040	3476040	Yep, Cal's whispering.
3476040	3479040	My daughter, Carol, she taught me about Catan.
3479040	3481040	Yeah, it's a fun one.
3481040	3482040	Do you know it?
3482040	3484040	Oh yeah, we play it all the time in the group.
3484040	3485040	Oh, we should play it.
3485040	3487040	Yeah, you can come some night to a game night, sure.
3487040	3488040	I like the sheep.
3488040	3489040	The sheep are good.
3489040	3493040	Sometimes you can get a good floor and you corner the market on them.
3493040	3495040	Shh, we're getting close.
3495040	3496040	Quiet, Beck.
3496040	3501040	As you guys open up the door to the basement, you head down the stairs, each step creaking.
3501040	3509040	Cal hits the light and you see the restraints previously on the body of Greg Godell, which
3509040	3518040	have been cut off, lying helplessly, lying lifelessly on the ground of the basement of
3518040	3523040	Cal Colorado's basement.
3523040	3525040	The shackles are lying lifelessly.
3525040	3526040	What's lifeless?
3526040	3527040	The shackles.
3527040	3528040	Oh, okay.
3528040	3529040	All the stuff that-
3529040	3530040	Oh, okay.
3530040	3531040	I don't give a shit.
3531040	3532040	Where's Stevie?
3532040	3535040	Yeah, there's no sign of Stevie, no sign of Greg anywhere.
3535040	3536040	Stevie!
3536040	3537040	They're both gone.
3537040	3539040	I kind of expected one or the other to still be here.
3539040	3545040	They went out to get pizza for all of us, and Stevie might've thought that she needed
3545040	3546040	the help of-
3546040	3547040	A god.
3547040	3548040	A turtle.
3548040	3549040	God turtle.
3549040	3550040	God turtle.
3550040	3552040	A pizza god turtle.
3552040	3554040	No, I think that something bad has happened.
3554040	3555040	They're not here.
3555040	3557040	The whole thing was that they were supposed to stay here.
3557040	3561040	And I want to look at, you said the stuff we had used to wrap him up with is on the
3561040	3562040	floor.
3562040	3563040	Is it, it's cut?
3563040	3564040	Is that what you said?
3564040	3565040	Yeah, it's cut.
3565040	3567040	Are there like scissors or a knife laying around?
3567040	3569040	There's a pair of scissors sitting on a table.
3569040	3570040	Okay.
3570040	3571040	Just nearby.
3571040	3574040	I wondered if he had somehow cut himself free or if she had helped him.
3574040	3575040	Could be either one.
3575040	3579040	I'm taking by the scene of this that, no, I'm thinking, well, look, there's scissors
3579040	3580040	laying right here.
3580040	3582040	I think that maybe Stevie set them loose.
3582040	3584040	There's no signs of a struggle.
3584040	3587040	No signs of forced ingress.
3587040	3593040	It seems logical, yes, that she unlocked the door herself down here and took them both
3593040	3594040	outside.
3594040	3598040	She knew the whole thing was to like not let him get to a place where he could kill himself.
3598040	3601040	So maybe, I don't know, he said something to her that made her think that wouldn't
3601040	3602040	happen?
3602040	3605040	I don't know what Stevie was thinking, but they're a lot closer to this situation
3605040	3606040	than we are.
3606040	3609040	Hopefully we, Beck, do you think that video was real?
3609040	3610040	I do.
3610040	3611040	Ah, fuck.
3611040	3617040	I've never seen Kurt doctor his footage before, like that's kind of his whole thing.
3617040	3620040	It's kind of his whole thing.
3620040	3622040	It's, you know, raw and real.
3622040	3623040	That's like what he says.
3623040	3626040	It's daddy's real stuff is what he always says.
3626040	3629040	Beck, why do you hang out with that creature?
3629040	3631040	Sometimes his footage is wild, man.
3631040	3635040	Have you seen like, you had to have seen the 1973 Bigfoot that he had.
3635040	3636040	He's 30.
3636040	3637040	He's like 30.
3637040	3639040	That he got a hold of.
3639040	3640040	Oh, Kurt is 30.
3640040	3642040	Yeah, but the Bigfoot was born in 1973.
3642040	3643040	Right.
3643040	3644040	Exactly.
3644040	3645040	Right.
3645040	3648040	A great year for big feet.
3648040	3659040	NPS estimates put it at like at least 33 big feet born in the continental United States.
3659040	3661040	The biggest year on record.
3661040	3665040	For instance, in 2021, there were only five estimated big feet born.
3665040	3666040	That's a lot less.
3666040	3669040	The numbers is dwindling.
3669040	3672040	No, there's less of them.
3672040	3674040	There's smaller feet now.
3674040	3675040	Little feet.
3675040	3676040	Little feet.
3676040	3678040	A land before feet.
3678040	3684040	Which is my foot fetish parody of a land before feet.
3684040	3687040	Where all the dinosaurs are played by feet.
3687040	3688040	What do you guys do?
3688040	3689040	Beck, it's clear.
3689040	3691040	We have to find Stevie immediately.
3691040	3692040	Yeah, it's a bummer.
3692040	3695040	I was really hoping we could like crash here and then.
3695040	3703040	Sometimes younger people don't answer my calls.
3703040	3707040	Would she answer your call or a text?
3707040	3708040	You should try it.
3708040	3709040	I'll give that a shot, yeah.
3709040	3718040	They find me exhausting, I've heard.
3718040	3720040	You know Carol, you know my daughter.
3720040	3723040	I think people are just intimidated, you know?
3723040	3725040	My daughter said she finds me exhausting.
3725040	3727040	Do you ever find me exhausting, Beck?
3727040	3729040	I mean, no.
3729040	3732040	But we don't like live together, so maybe if we lived together,
3732040	3734040	I would be exhausted at some point.
3734040	3736040	But that just happens in relationships.
3736040	3738040	But no, I don't find you exhausting at all.
3738040	3739040	Thank you.
3739040	3740040	Thank you, Beck.
3740040	3743040	Sometimes we say things to hurt the ones we love.
3743040	3744040	I'm on the call.
3744040	3745040	I'm on the call.
3745040	3746040	Oh, oh, oh.
3746040	3747040	I'm sorry.
3747040	3748040	I'm sorry.
3748040	3749040	Breathe, breathe.
3749040	3750040	Breathe, breathe.
3750040	3755040	And then he goes to Stevie's voicemail.
3755040	3756040	Beep.
3756040	3759040	Hey, Stevie, it's Beck.
3759040	3762040	We're really worried about you because you're not where we left you,
3762040	3764040	and that was kind of the whole thing we had set up,
3764040	3765040	is that you'd be where we left you.
3765040	3767040	Tell her I hope she doesn't think I'm exhausting.
3767040	3769040	Cal hopes that you don't think he's exhausting,
3769040	3774040	and I hope that you're alive and that your brother's alive
3774040	3779040	and that there's not a new god in the world that is maybe bad for us.
3779040	3780040	I don't...
3780040	3781040	I'll talk to you later.
3781040	3782040	Bye.
3782040	3783040	Are you guys crashing?
3783040	3784040	And I send a text.
3784040	3785040	Okay.
3785040	3786040	Nice.
3786040	3787040	Please call.
3787040	3788040	Just please call?
3788040	3789040	Yep.
3789040	3791040	Beck, I know you prefer to take the can van,
3791040	3794040	but perhaps tonight on this hunt for Stevie,
3794040	3796040	we should take my ride.
3796040	3797040	The Mercedes?
3797040	3798040	Is that what you're talking about?
3798040	3799040	Yes.
3799040	3800040	Dude, yeah.
3800040	3803040	Some very nice Mercedes coupe, whatever that is.
3803040	3804040	Don't look at me.
3804040	3805040	I just...
3805040	3806040	Thomas doesn't know.
3806040	3807040	Coupe C. C class.
3807040	3808040	We kicked the wrong guy out.
3809040	3810040	Hey, Luke.
3814040	3817040	I mean, we've got to fit a van load of equipment in it,
3817040	3818040	but I could...
3818040	3819040	Yeah, we'll get it in there.
3819040	3820040	No, no, no, Beck.
3820040	3821040	It was a search mission.
3821040	3824040	And frankly, while I've seen tonight what today,
3824040	3827040	what a common cell phone can do.
3827040	3828040	Most of your job, Beck.
3831040	3832040	Whoa, Cal.
3832040	3833040	Over the line.
3833040	3835040	And mine as well.
3835040	3836040	And mine as well.
3836040	3837040	So...
3837040	3839040	This is some 4 a.m. talk here.
3841040	3842040	He's so exhausted.
3842040	3843040	He's being a bitch.
3847040	3849040	What I'm saying is you've got the newest phone.
3849040	3852040	But this is like, this is more of the story.
3852040	3853040	This is more story.
3853040	3855040	We need to film it.
3855040	3856040	It's more story.
3856040	3858040	Okay, the small one, the small camera.
3858040	3859040	No sound, no lights.
3859040	3861040	You can have a shotgun mic on top.
3861040	3862040	Yeah, I got it.
3862040	3863040	I just...
3863040	3864040	I'm not carrying a boom.
3864040	3865040	Why are we paring down?
3865040	3866040	We've got to move quickly.
3866040	3867040	We've got to move quickly.
3868040	3869040	Oh, okay.
3869040	3870040	Through the streets.
3870040	3872040	In my sweet Mercedes.
3873040	3874040	I looked it up.
3874040	3875040	C class works.
3875040	3877040	In my sweet C class.
3877040	3878040	Yeah, okay.
3878040	3879040	I'll grab...
3879040	3881040	I'll just grab some of the mics and I can fit a tripod.
3881040	3883040	No, no, no, no, no, no.
3883040	3885040	Yeah, that's what I'm going to grab.
3885040	3886040	We need equipment.
3886040	3890040	We spend like 10 minutes like sorting out a pile.
3890040	3893040	This won't even fit in that tiny trunk.
3894040	3897040	Yeah, when the cameraman's just sitting right there.
3897040	3900040	The back ends up getting a surprising amount.
3903040	3905040	He Tetris is a pretty sweet kid.
3905040	3906040	Yeah.
3906040	3907040	All right.
3907040	3908040	I mean, you guys are going to be...
3908040	3910040	Now, I think if you go out and continue this,
3910040	3913040	you're not going to be able to get a sleep
3913040	3915040	and then show up at a normal time to work.
3915040	3918040	So you're going to be at a negative 40 all day for the next day.
3918040	3919040	Unless we go to sleep.
3919040	3920040	Yeah.
3920040	3922040	I mean, we've already said we want to spend a little more time on the edit.
3922040	3924040	I think we deserve to sleep in.
3924040	3925040	Wake up pretty late.
3925040	3926040	I just didn't know how late.
3926040	3927040	7 a.m.
3927040	3929040	I don't know how long you're hunting for is what I'm saying.
3929040	3930040	This hunt.
3930040	3931040	Oh, I mean, I figured we're...
3931040	3933040	We're going to take a spin around the block.
3934040	3938040	I figured story-wise we'd go to the hole
3938040	3940040	and you'd show us God or whatever
3940040	3944040	and we'd worry about fucking sleep and shit later.
3944040	3946040	I wasn't worried about mechanics in this hunt.
3946040	3948040	I figured we'd go straight to it.
3948040	3949040	You're going to the hole?
3949040	3950040	Yeah.
3950040	3951040	Right?
3951040	3952040	Sure.
3952040	3953040	Awesome.
3953040	3954040	Fuck off.
3954040	3956040	The way you say that.
3957040	3958040	Awesome.
3958040	3959040	Awesome.
3959040	3960040	Awesome.
3962040	3966040	When you arrive to the nearest bridge that heads over the city river
3966040	3970040	into downtown from Cal, Colorado's lovely neighborhood.
3970040	3971040	Beans Bridge.
3971040	3972040	Beck.
3972040	3974040	You don't know the history?
3974040	3975040	No.
3975040	3976040	Oh.
3976040	3977040	It is blocked off.
3977040	3980040	80 men died building this.
3980040	3983040	Some say their bones are in the mortar.
3983040	3984040	They are.
3985040	3988040	There are flashing lights everywhere.
3988040	3990040	There are all sorts of different crews.
3990040	3993040	You see people in suits.
3993040	3996040	You see people in all sorts of different...
3996040	3997040	There's cops.
3997040	3999040	There's people in hazmat gear.
3999040	4001040	There's all sorts of different...
4001040	4002040	There's tents popping up.
4002040	4004040	There's a whole crew.
4004040	4008040	There's a whole kit and caboodle, a whole situation happening.
4008040	4009040	News crew?
4009040	4012040	There are other news crews that have begun piling up here.
4012040	4013040	Yeah.
4013040	4016040	Cal elbows you a little too hard in the ribs and he's like,
4016040	4017040	hot damn.
4017040	4018040	You were right, Beck.
4018040	4020040	We should have brought all this shit.
4021040	4024040	Oh yeah, I got the tripod and I've got a lav mic for you
4024040	4027040	and the light here I can attach to the top.
4027040	4028040	Yeah, we're set.
4028040	4031040	You've got this Rube Goldberg of things attached to the camera
4031040	4034040	and you're holding it in one hand and a boom in the other.
4035040	4040040	Yeah, it's a backpack strap thing that sends the boom over the top of my head.
4040040	4043040	I see this golden glow on my skin and I'm like,
4043040	4045040	oh my god, he did it.
4045040	4046040	The perfect lighting.
4048040	4049040	Oh yeah, we're live.
4049040	4050040	Or not live.
4050040	4055040	We're to tape in four, three, two, silent one.
4055040	4056040	Follow me, follow me.
4056040	4057040	Are you getting this?
4057040	4058040	Are you getting this?
4058040	4059040	We're live on Bean's Bridge.
4059040	4062040	Reporting from the scene of a bizarre accident,
4062040	4065040	some kind of hole has been punctured through the structure.
4065040	4071040	We've got some footage obtained by a consultant earlier tonight.
4074040	4077040	Once again, I want to stress this was not shot by anybody
4077040	4079040	strictly affiliated with Cannes News.
4079040	4080040	But you can see here, folks,
4080040	4083040	you can see here the extraordinary footage captured earlier tonight
4083040	4085040	showing what we're approaching the hole now.
4085040	4087040	You can probably see in the insert, again, the footage.
4087040	4090040	The two of you are walking up to where the rest of the media
4090040	4094040	has bottlenecked up and there's big kind of wooden structures
4094040	4097040	with four legs and a bar across the top.
4100040	4101040	Table?
4102040	4103040	It's sawhorses, right?
4103040	4104040	Yeah.
4107040	4108040	Long ones.
4108040	4110040	You mean like just a barricade?
4110040	4111040	You're right.
4111040	4112040	Yep, it's a barricade.
4112040	4113040	There's a bunch of them.
4113040	4117040	And they're keeping the media at arm's length here.
4117040	4121040	But if you zoom in past the shoulder of Mr. Cal Colorado,
4121040	4127040	you can see that they're whole, that there are people of all sorts of dress
4127040	4132040	walking around, taking samples, taking pictures, taking video, all sorts.
4132040	4136040	I want to scan the crowd whether it's with a camera or not for Stevie.
4136040	4140040	Maybe I'm just holding it on the area and looking my head around.
4140040	4142040	Is Stevie around?
4142040	4145040	Go ahead and roll search at a negative 40.
4148040	4150040	Would have been a pass, but it's a fail.
4150040	4152040	Can I aid his search maybe?
4152040	4155040	You can also roll search if you would like since you just failed.
4155040	4159040	I'd like to roll search and I'd like to maybe try to bump up something on my search
4159040	4161040	by calling Stevie's phone.
4161040	4163040	Oh, okay. Yeah, that sounds great.
4163040	4164040	90.
4167040	4172040	You convince yourself that the noise that you're hearing in the back of your head
4172040	4176040	is just because you think you're expecting to hear a ringtone?
4176040	4179040	Beck, I can't hear shit over these throngs.
4182040	4185040	Beck, like when you're on camera, it never talks to you,
4185040	4188040	so he just does a nod from behind the camera.
4189040	4193040	Cal's feeling a little frosty and there's maybe a side of him
4193040	4196040	you haven't really seen in his professional newsman days,
4196040	4200040	but you know he did some of this roving reporting when he was younger
4200040	4205040	and without any sleep, you're worried about the glint you see in his eye
4205040	4208040	and he gives you a big wink and he says,
4208040	4211040	All right, Beck, just remember, act like you're supposed to be there.
4211040	4214040	And Cal just moves one of the barricades aside and slips on through
4214040	4218040	and mushens you in and we start heading straight for somebody with authority.
4218040	4220040	Beck does, just follows the lead.
4220040	4223040	Yes. Oh, fuck yeah.
4223040	4225040	Well, I guess we'll see what happens the next time.
4227040	4229040	We can come back inside for now.
4229040	4232040	I should mention that this is a terrible idea
4232040	4235040	because I don't have a skill that I can succeed on basically.
4238040	4240040	All you have to do is film, baby.
4262040	4265040	And it's all my fault.
