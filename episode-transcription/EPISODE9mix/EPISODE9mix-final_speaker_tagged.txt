0.00 118.58 speaker0  Hello to all my friends and all my enemies, it's your boy Wolf the Dog growling at you from Contention's best radio station, 694.2 PTBP. It's time for our first segment, the unveiling of Howlin' with Wolf, where we get to hear from y'all, my pups, my babies, my children. I'm only doing this out of the love in my big ole wolf heart, sharing airtime, fuck, but my pups are that important. Alright let's kick it off with this one from an anonymous listener. Dear V-cell, do not enter the mirror room. Do not let John enter the mirror room. Destroy the mirror room. Destroy Orotech. Destroy John. Destroy the world. Dear V-cell, nothing is real and everything is alive. The end has come and will come and come again. Find my bones, hear it and see. No, wait for me. I'm coming, but time moves so slowly. Wow, uh, that's uh, that's real something y'all. So if you want me to read whatever crazy horseshit you gotta say, submit a 5 star review on your podcast app, screenshot that shit and send it to us, or tag us on social media, at pretending pod on instagram and twitter, pretending to be people on facebook. Last time, the roving gang of tunnel vision cops left Mildred Mitchell, sans granddaughter and information. They went to Forgotten Treasures and bullied the nice lady there until she put her own life in danger by telling the cops about the drunk man who threatened her. Upon leaving, the white Toyota they'd been searching for peeled out onto the road. After a short, dangerous pursuit, Keith Vigna gunned down Charles Donovan and John Lee Pettymore fired warning shots into the air as well as Clark's tires, and they found a bald man
116.90 131.86 speaker1  tied up in that old trunk. I'm surprised they didn't shoot this old boy too.
127.30 167.82 speaker0  Wolf wants his pack to keep this old boy in your singing bowls.
164.78 183.62 speaker1  I'm gonna try to take the chain off and put like actual handcuffs on him. Okay good. Zip tie. Citizen's arrest style.
176.70 194.94 speaker2  You have replaced Billy Harrison's chain with handcuffs and you guys are heading to the clinic.
189.86 238.92 speaker1  pain in my foot so maybe I can I know I'm supposed to keep off of it but you know in case I ever need to be on it like stay in the pain. No pun intended. I'm a police officer. Gotcha bitch.
234.08 245.68 speaker3  Shh this is our secret.
243.60 248.80 speaker2  some of your drugs. You look so scary.
247.16 273.36 speaker3  Yeah I guess you could. Roll a D4 and see how many you take. I take D6 again. I'm a cheater. Take one.
272.36 277.64 speaker1  What does it do?
276.64 283.60 speaker2  It's Oxycontin. He just gives you like a bottle full of Oxycontin.
281.68 288.80 speaker1  Can I want to ask you if I take these?
287.80 307.76 speaker2  Yeah. So your trap rap game is now off the hook. do good more than it does detriment? Like it'll attack pain receptors? It'll do more good for the pain than...
306.76 309.76 speaker1  But I don't think...
308.76 318.44 speaker2  Like he's not using it recreationally. I'm gonna be on Oxycontin.
316.52 328.68 speaker1  They're all so happy. Oh shit.
327.68 354.96 speaker2  Like you'll be loopy right? Yeah you'll be a bit loopy. And maybe sleepy. Okay. Awesome.
350.40 373.92 speaker1  sleepiness, tiredness, drowsiness, dizziness, lightheadedness, weakness, itching, headache, dry mouth, sweating, and decreases the ability to feel pain. Okay I'll keep these for later but I'm probably gonna take them all the time sparingly.
371.24 378.84 speaker2  Check out Dr. Marie Jacobs. See where she fits into this mystery.
377.84 391.28 speaker1  Zaboomafoo? Zabrowski. Dr. Zaboomafoo.
390.28 393.28 speaker3  Do I know anything about her?
391.28 418.10 speaker2  She's Clark's ex-wife. She's got a private practice and that's all you know about her. Family practitioner. You do have an address and she lives in the suburbs which is in the northeast part of town. Let's get a burger first.
417.10 425.54 speaker1  What is the burger place called? Burgatory?
422.38 427.54 speaker2  It's like five minutes out of your way if you want to hop up there and grab a burger.
426.54 436.30 speaker1  Yeah.
432.06 439.30 speaker2  health days off, but I need a mental health hour after watching Charles explode all over that work.
438.30 456.84 speaker3  Frosty root beer. That might soak me all right. Number one. Number two.
455.84 462.84 speaker2  We have a vegan burger. Absolutely not that. I already ordered some.
461.84 477.00 speaker1  Oh, I don't want to even hear this. Yeah. No.
476.00 487.16 speaker2  That's fucking crazy. They don't like covered in some other for your browns and capped.
486.16 498.36 speaker1  He's covered in mushrooms.
495.52 504.16 speaker3  Does Dr. Marie Jacobs run her practice out of her home? No. Is it midday? Will she be at the clinic?
501.36 565.20 speaker2  I feel like we should go to go to her wherever she is. On the way to Dr. Marie Jacobs home, you guys pull onto our street in the suburbs. And as you are going down the street, you see kind of off to the right. There's a man with extremely unkempt hair and facial hair standing in his front yard, wearing a white tank top under some like rubber looking waders. And he is messing with a vacuum, holding the hose with one hand and pointing the wand like of the vacuum cleaner to the ground, kind of like he's challenging his yard to a duel. And he begins to hold the wand with both hands and his arms shake violently up and down and all around before he drops the vacuum wand and begins sprinting out into the street in front of your car, not even paying attention to you whatsoever.
564.20 571.56 speaker3  It was a vacuum.
569.24 573.56 speaker2  And it doesn't look like a fucked up vacuum. It's just a normal vacuum.
572.56 583.60 speaker3  No, normal vacuum. I wrote down disheveled man vacuuming his yard, so let's just keep going. Okay. Yeah.
578.52 589.16 speaker2  So yeah, I slam on the brakes and I say, sir, this might sound crazy, but were you trying to vacuum an oil creature out of this guy?
587.44 597.60 speaker3  He's like running away.
592.28 666.60 speaker2  As you slammed on the brakes, he begins running down the street as he's running. He begins to float off the ground and his legs are still flailing in a desperate gate roll sanity. Man, you really don't want us to see Marie Jacobs. in their front yard across the street and their jaws are dropped. How far in the air is he? Two feet. Like I run up and I try to pull him back down. Is not coming down. You are actively fighting against a force that you cannot see Clark.
659.44 686.60 speaker3  I grabbed the other leg, his pants fall down.
680.76 714.36 speaker2  As you are pulling on his shoe, as he kind of begins to get higher, you pull a shoe off of his foot and Clark, you are holding him, but you feel a force actively lifting him upward. He is three feet off the ground at this point. And you are the only thing holding him from floating away. And he is screaming.
713.36 718.08 speaker3  John, get the vacuum.
717.08 730.16 speaker2  Kids get the vacuum.
729.16 744.28 speaker3  Yeah. I mean, you're delegating right there, right there.
733.92 759.56 speaker2  And, uh, these two children, uh, are running over with the vacuum on an extension cord that is like extremely long and they're bringing it out into the street.
758.56 765.28 speaker1  They're coming with the vacuum.
764.08 779.04 speaker3  It's everywhere. What is it bud? What is it?
778.04 802.52 speaker2  You two are heroes. They're like nine. like holding it up. And he reaches over and flicks it on.
801.52 813.24 speaker3  do we do?
812.24 871.64 speaker2  Keep going. I'm making you both honorary deputies. You're vacuuming the hell out of that. This man's shoes. Oh my God, there's something. No, yeah. you're doing great.
869.64 876.24 speaker3  It's inside now.
875.24 911.74 speaker2  What are your names? I'm Aiden. Aiden. I'm Aiden. Like yeah. Brooke. Yeah. Yeah. They are. Cutback. Cutback. Clark, you actually feel the pressure is releasing and it is easier to hold this guy closer to the ground. And he is looking down.
909.64 925.24 speaker3  Oh, you're doing it.
922.24 930.24 speaker2  Clark, you get him all the way to the ground and he just begins sprinting. He is sprinting. He's like, run.
929.24 976.24 speaker3  Run. Can I do a check that I don't let him go? Yeah, absolutely. Okay. He rolled an aught. I want to grab him, like bear around the shoulders and pull him to like the nearest lawn. I just want to get him away from that area that he was floating in and off the road. And then if he's still struggling, I want to get him to the ground.
972.24 982.24 speaker2  Now I need both of you guys to roll sanity for me.
981.24 985.24 speaker3  I also fail.
982.24 988.24 speaker2  You guys are both going to lose a D4.
987.24 1003.24 speaker3  Four.
996.24 1025.24 speaker2  You guys can actually see on the street where you were, flashing in your vision is a thin layer of this viscous, like writhing ooze. And it is moving down the street into one of those drainage. Storm drain. Yeah. Off the side of the road where the sidewalk meets.
1024.24 1042.24 speaker1  What happens when you shoot it?
1041.24 1127.24 speaker2  The kids both like completely- Probably think it's pretty cool to see a cop she's killing, right? They're completely blank faced and they're backing away. you see the bag on this vacuum just explodes. And you see both of these kids are immediately just covered in this black viscous goo. They are gone. Not necessarily from your vision because you can currently see this mass of ooze. So more so you see the limbs of these kids inside of this ooze struggling to get out. God, I mean it's so dark that it seems to dampen the brightness of everything around it, all the lights shining down and stuff. And it kind of melts down into the ground and begins slowly at first, What do you do? No way. Yeah, 92 on a 49. So this is going to be a breaking point moment.
1125.24 1138.24 speaker3  I critically fail.
1137.24 1145.24 speaker2  Five. So that's a breaking point for me.
1144.24 1147.24 speaker1  What are you down to?
1146.24 1157.24 speaker2  That's not too bad. I have 40.
1155.24 1161.24 speaker3  How do you calculate the new breaking point?
1159.24 1189.24 speaker2  Keith Vigna, you're at 40, correct? your current sanity. 31. And John Lee Pettymore, your sanity is 44 and your power is 12, which means your breaking
1187.24 1200.24 speaker1  point is 32.
1194.24 1252.24 speaker2  new disorder that your character has gained and it will affect your willpower. I will discuss this off-microphone with you. after this incident. I hit my breaking point and froze. And hey, this is really important. As this flowing dark ooze is moving toward you, you can move.
1251.24 1253.24 speaker1  Oh, the bag burst.
1252.24 1276.24 speaker2  Yup. Yeah, I run. And Clark, what are you doing?
1274.24 1293.24 speaker3  I'm getting up and running. Maybe following wherever he runs, but running away. I want to follow the guy who's been sucked up in the air. See where he's running.
1291.24 1398.78 speaker2  This thing seems quick. Okay, so he begins to run down the street away from you and also toward Marie Jacobs' house. John, do you want to head to your cruiser or are you following after this unkempt man I don't know what I was going to say. Hot footed is a weird thing. They're running down the street in the suburbs. both and getting to Julie's. Jacobs? Yes. vision. I mean, it was there. It didn't move anywhere. It was moving, yes, at the time, but it didn't move out of your sight. It just disappeared and you can't see it anymore. I'm not afraid of silly putty. I'm not afraid of silly putty. I'm not afraid of silly putty. You hop in your car, take off down the street, and make it to Clark Bishop and this unkempt man wearing a white tank top and rubber-like waders. You look to your right and you see the address for Dr. Marie Jacobs' house. as Billy- Billie.
1397.78 1410.82 speaker1  Was that his name? Billy Harrison.
1408.42 1454.22 speaker2  that he has woken up. He has a concussion. He took a pretty huge blow to the back of his head and he was unconscious for quite an amount of time, which leads them to believe something might have gone wrong neurologically. So they did some scans, they're waiting on the report back, but he is currently awake and you can go talk to him and he's cuffed to the bed. As you walk into the room, he is laying in the bed, one cuff, yep, onto the bed.
1452.82 1461.98 speaker1  He kind of looks around.
1460.14 1477.50 speaker2  My name is O-Officer Vigna. You're not in trouble.
1472.04 1492.66 speaker1  want to set a timeline of what you remember meeting up to what I know. Does that make sense to you? Yeah. Billy Harrison. Do you know where you are right now?
1491.26 1495.14 speaker2  We're in contention.
1494.14 1523.26 speaker1  No. Where are you from? Close enough. What is the last thing you remember before you remember talking to me?
1522.26 1527.26 speaker2  John? Uh, Peters.
1526.26 1542.22 speaker1  How do you know John Peters? So John Peters was not in the army with you?
1541.22 1565.86 speaker2  Okay. He hadn't responded to any of my messages. And how long? A couple of days. Yeah, I tried calling him. He didn't, he didn't respond. I got worried about him.
1563.26 1573.02 speaker1  I don't see him very often. Or how do you, how often do you keep in contact with him?
1572.02 1576.86 speaker2  Okay.
1575.86 1611.58 speaker1  Right? And that's why you went and checked on him? Did you get to his house? Did you look into the windows or did you get into his house? Is there anything?
1610.14 1623.38 speaker2  What happened?
1616.50 1675.66 speaker1  Okay, so what's happened here is that we were chasing after a man named Charles and we found you tied up in the back of his car and he gave you, he must have hit you with something while you were looking through John's house or looking into John's house and he gave you a concussion and that's why you're here just for some tests and some just surveying to see what your health is like but do you know any one that would have wanted to hurt John? Did John ever talk about any enemies or any people he might have owed a debt to or anything that he might have been caught up with? What kind of video games did you play with him? Online or with him? Online. So did he ever tell you much about his personal life?
1674.66 1680.34 speaker2  Call of Duty. Okay.
1679.34 1706.82 speaker1  I mean... What kind of car do you drive? Probably. Let me start over. What kind of car do you, what car did you drive to John's house? Today's the third. Thank god. About what time did you get there?
1705.74 1708.82 speaker2  How late is it?
1706.82 1713.14 speaker1  It's about eight o'clock in the evening.
1712.14 1716.94 speaker2  Yeah.
1715.94 1722.30 speaker1  Yeah. So about six. Okay. About six hours you've been out.
1721.30 1726.54 speaker2  Um. That's really bad for you, isn't it?
1725.54 1744.26 speaker1  I'm not a doctor. Okay. You don't happen to know anybody that works at a dog grooming facility, do you?
1742.26 1750.02 speaker2  You're asking some weird questions.
1748.54 1753.02 speaker1  None of these questions are weird. You just might think they are.
1752.02 1762.34 speaker2  Okay. I don't know anyone who works at a dog grooming establishment.
1757.54 1772.54 speaker1  I guess, uh, you know, I, I got, I'll give you some rest and I'll talk to the doctor to see how you're doing. I'll, I'll let you, I'll leave you to it and kind of moves his hand with the handcuff on
1769.38 1788.38 speaker2  Is this still necessary?
1786.26 1864.86 speaker1  I get word from the doctor that you're okay. Um, you know, we don't want you getting up and walking off and you know, dying out there. I don't, I don't know about that. I am I under arrest? Should I put you under arrest? No, sorry, sir. You've been pretty cooperative so far, but you're making me question whether I should I was just checking. There's times where I text my friends and they don't text me back or call me back for a couple of days and it's for no reason, especially my close friends. I don't know about if you're that close with him. Tell me why you were at John Peter's house and I pull out my other pair of handcuffs and handcuff his other hand to the other side of the bed. Out of game. Is this something I should pursue or am I wasting time?
1863.50 1901.86 speaker2  Here's what we're going to do. has it drawn on you and he says, uncuff my hand right now or I'm going to shoot you.
1900.86 1910.16 speaker1  Absolutely. 40 on 80.
1902.86 1922.72 speaker2  Yeah, not only is he not scared in this moment at all, it looks like he has done this before
1917.44 1933.72 speaker1  I'm thinking of like, I want to like jump and just tase him, but I like, do I have the, I'm thinking I have a taser gun, but do I have like a stick it in his neck kind of taser? Oh, I don't know. You probably have the gun.
1930.68 1941.80 speaker2  Hey Luke, he's going to shoot you. Okay.
1940.80 1980.00 speaker1  Okay. Okay. I'm reaching down to my belt to pull out the key. Please don't shoot me. It unclicks. I put the key back on my belt and the handcuffs are unlocked.
1973.32 1982.40 speaker2  He's got the gun pressed firmly against the back of your head and he says, all right, here's what we're going to do.
1981.40 1988.96 speaker3  Fuck. Okay.
1987.96 2031.40 speaker2  Pass. Thomas and Joe. John Lee Pettymore drives his cruiser down the road of the suburbs and makes it to where Clark Bishop and this haggard looking man are running down the street and you guys kind
2030.40 2044.90 speaker3  Yeah. I can't, I can't see it either, man.
2039.12 2063.94 speaker2  And he turns and he kind of bends down and looks inside the cruiser and he sees John you? And he looks at both of you. He's like, what are you doing? And he just fucking starts running back toward his house immediately.
2062.94 2075.10 speaker3  And I'm trying to chase after him. Whatever that would take. Yeah.
2073.38 2083.86 speaker2  I mean, you could do unarmed combat or strength.
2082.86 2094.54 speaker3  He passes.
2087.78 2104.02 speaker2  I mean, this guy's wearing a white tank top with big rubber waders on and he's just like hoofing it down the street. I don't know. Squeak, squeak, squeak.
2102.06 2106.02 speaker3  I think I'll watch him run away.
2105.02 2153.18 speaker2  Okay. So he runs back to his house. I know where he lives. Cool. All right. So you guys are like right in front of the Jacobs home. It's a beautiful modern home with a large front yard and a recessed interest entrance. Just like every home on this street and in this neighborhood, you are in the suburbs. waiters. I mean, we've all, no servers live in this neighborhood.
2149.38 2165.72 speaker3  We've all waited tables, but I'm realizing suddenly that it's a little weird roleplay wise that we shrug our shoulders and go investigate Dr. Murray's house. I don't know what you're talking about.
2163.66 2198.34 speaker2  I don't feel great about those kids. that we cannot have like, we can't be on the hook for the death of two children. Nobody's going to believe the crazy guy and the waiters. There were never any kids. Yeah. Yeah, there weren't.
2195.94 2218.66 speaker3  There weren't, there weren't, there weren't, there weren't no children. There were no children. Let's uh, let's see what this doctor knows about our cases. You guys mark up to the front door?
2213.10 2245.58 speaker2  You hear scuffling from inside and then you can like very clearly hear someone approaching the door and you hear some heavy breathing, like right on the other side of the door. If you could just even open your door, we could just have a word with you right here.
2244.58 2249.98 speaker3  We're the police. We, we need to, we need to talk to you. I know who you are.
2247.98 2265.14 speaker2  You have a warrant? You can come back with a warrant. I don't know. Yeah. Do you want to? Yeah, I do. Restart? I do. Okay.
2264.14 2301.66 speaker3  She has a nicer house than that. Yeah. Fuck. Contention PD. Go away. Yeah. Nope. What'd you say? You said contingent PD? Clark's mind is preoccupied. What? Did you just say contingent PD? Uh, would you, uh, we just need to ask you some questions ma'am. Okay.
2300.66 2308.82 speaker2  Can you open the door for me? You can ask your questions through the door. Pausing the role play.
2307.82 2321.18 speaker3  Yeah. So her, she was just circled in the phone book at Julie Maxwell's place. So maybe if she knows her.
2317.26 2323.18 speaker2  I thought other people had, I thought there were two or three vectors to her.
2322.18 2328.18 speaker3  I do have something else to her. Oh, do you? Yes.
2327.18 2330.46 speaker2  That's important. Good.
2329.46 2391.78 speaker3  Good fucking call. John and Thomas. What were you saying? I put it together in my head that Julie might've just circled her name in the phone book as another person who bought a crazy item like her camera. What's it called? Did you purchase anything from forgotten treasures in the last, uh, let's say month. We think you did. And we're just kind of interested in it. You didn't do anything wrong. You want to open the door for us? Why? So we can take a look at that old thing. It sounds cool.
2390.78 2407.50 speaker2  What kind of price you fetch for that? Yeah. I do not pass. 83 out of 50. A man came and took it.
2406.02 2417.80 speaker3  Did you get a good look at the guy? We can, we can go and get that for you. Oh, we can be discreet. Oh, can you?
2416.06 2431.70 speaker2  Who's got us there? Was that man John Peters?
2430.16 2460.98 speaker3  Can you describe the man who took that? He was tall. He was drunk. Did you watch him carry it away? He had a gun. John, I mean a tall, drunk guy stealing a radio.
2455.66 2464.98 speaker2  There was the description of the menacing, drunk, mean guy with the gin blossoms. That wasn't Charles, right? I think it was. Oh, okay.
2463.98 2480.38 speaker3  Yeah, I think you're right. Because he was at Treasure, fucking, what's it called? Forgotten Treasures. He was at Forgotten Treasures. He was drunk when I saw him. It's gotta be Charles, and he's dead.
2478.54 2522.06 speaker2  He's staying at the same hotel as Vigna. Oh, God. I think she might be a witch. As she says that, you kind of see, so she's got one of those doors that has the glass pane at the top, and so you can see movement through there, and you didn't see any shape or anything earlier when she came to the door, but there is kind of the shape of a taller
2519.86 2525.78 speaker3  Ma'am, is there somebody in there with you?
2524.06 2551.54 speaker2  I think we have reasonable ... Clark, I think we have reasonable ...
2550.54 2553.54 speaker3  I sure am, Clark. I think we might as well.
2552.54 2578.54 speaker2  All right. I kick down the door. You know how to do it. Okay. I mean, they train you how to kick in a door. For sure. I figured it would be a strength test. Not like a cop test, but I like it.
2575.54 2596.54 speaker3  The cop test was so that you knew you were in the right to do this. Exactly.
2594.54 2601.54 speaker2  The house is a complete wreck. It smells weird in here.
2597.54 2606.54 speaker1  There's a haze in the air, but she's not there.
2605.54 2621.54 speaker2  Like from the basement. There's a door very clearly kind of around the corner that leads to the basement and it's open. Do you guys want to start going there or do you want to look around the rest of the house?
2620.54 2628.54 speaker3  What can I see from ... An ocular pad. An ocular pad and of the premises.

There are beakers and other types of like containment objects all over the place as well as mini jars, which is another thing that I just said. No, I'm just ... So, lots of stuff like that around. Just kind of like all around a mess. There's shit everywhere and in fact, it smells terrible and it kind of smells like shit in here. Well, when you ... Just general. Both, yeah. It's too big.

Her hair is a complete disaster. And she is wearing a white coverall with long neoprene gloves. Does it look like if you smeared the mascara off her face, she might actually be a cat? From what you know about both humans and cats, I would say no. Okay. As she does this, she looks at John and she says, And turns to Clark and says, And looks back at John. I didn't go to seven years of school to be called ma'am. Of course not, doctor. Hey, Clark.
