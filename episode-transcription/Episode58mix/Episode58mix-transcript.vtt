00:00.000 --> 00:07.520
Ho, ho, ho, my babies, it's your number one gift giver and home invader, Wolfy Claws.

00:07.520 --> 00:12.520
And I'm here to throw copious amounts of garbage down your chimneys at night, whether you've

00:12.520 --> 00:15.080
been naughty or nice.

00:15.080 --> 00:21.200
Hope you put that fire out, because my gifts of garbage are good and grease-filled, baby.

00:21.200 --> 00:29.920
And as always, we are delivering all that unholy holiday cheer live from 694.2 PTBP.

00:29.920 --> 00:32.120
What's that smell in the air?

00:32.120 --> 00:34.680
Is it holiday cheer and joy?

00:34.680 --> 00:40.880
Is it the smoldering ashes of a house I accidentally ignited into flame from throwing greasy garbage

00:40.880 --> 00:42.520
down their chimneys?

00:42.520 --> 00:45.400
No, it's Howlin' with Wolf.

00:45.400 --> 00:49.880
This week we got a new Howlin' with Wolf, and it comes from someone very close to my

00:49.880 --> 00:50.880
heart.

00:50.880 --> 00:54.920
Dear Wolf the Dog, You are handsome, you are beautiful.

00:54.920 --> 00:57.520
When you command, people obey.

00:57.520 --> 01:05.000
You are the master of trash, a savant of meat drippings, an academic of pandemics.

01:05.000 --> 01:11.120
Just wanted to let you know how special you are to everyone, especially me, baby.

01:11.120 --> 01:14.560
With great admiration, Wolf the Dog.

01:14.560 --> 01:17.440
Now damn, that was a nice letter.

01:17.440 --> 01:19.960
We should get more like that, I think.

01:19.960 --> 01:24.700
This kind being must have massive intellect to compose such a letter.

01:24.700 --> 01:28.600
If you want to write up something for your wolf to howl, remember to hit us up on one

01:28.600 --> 01:32.500
of the various forms of social media and tag us.

01:32.500 --> 01:39.820
Or give us a 5 star review on iTunes and all that jazz and send us a damn email for wolf's

01:39.820 --> 01:40.820
sake.

01:40.820 --> 01:44.260
Pretendinpod at gmail dot com, baby.

01:44.260 --> 01:51.300
Also if you love the show like I do, consider becoming a subscriber over on patreon dot

01:51.300 --> 01:54.040
com slash pretendinpod.

01:54.040 --> 01:57.760
We got some nice exclusives for y'all over there.

01:57.760 --> 02:01.800
Speaking of transition, it's the news.

02:01.800 --> 02:06.380
Leon Dunn murdered some cops while leaving Bruce Robin's office.

02:06.380 --> 02:12.720
The city PD tried to catch them contention boys, but the fast and furious car chase ended

02:12.720 --> 02:19.120
after Keith threw a shotgun at the lead car so hard it buried itself into the driver,

02:19.120 --> 02:24.760
causing the CPD cruiser to swerve and flip an absurd number of times.

02:24.760 --> 02:31.080
The wake of destruction got to John and Clark, and they dived into their own consciousnesses,

02:31.080 --> 02:36.400
unresponsive and chanting the numbers that translate to Bruce Robin.

02:36.400 --> 02:41.040
Right before they snapped out of their weird trance-like state, Keith learned an ominous

02:41.040 --> 02:43.480
fact from Leon Simpson.

02:43.480 --> 02:49.620
Apparently Clark Bishop is the overseer, and in his future he will go back to the past

02:49.620 --> 02:52.320
and found the circle of knowledge.

02:52.320 --> 02:54.320
So uh, that's fun.

02:54.320 --> 02:59.640
Y'all it's time to introduce a new one never heard before on this station.

02:59.640 --> 03:06.760
It's my favorite Christmas song of all time, one that inspires joy and happiness to all

03:06.760 --> 03:08.560
far and wide.

03:08.560 --> 03:16.240
No matter the dimension, no matter the timeline, it's Mariah Carey's All I Want For Christmas

03:16.240 --> 03:20.320
Is Kudzu With No Backbone.

03:38.560 --> 03:54.800
Clark Bishop and John Lee Pettymore, you come to and you are sitting in the car with Leon

03:54.800 --> 04:04.080
Simpson and Keith Vigna, and you are in a parking lot of CSU, City State University.

04:04.080 --> 04:09.760
And Leon and Keith are just, Keith especially, is just...

04:09.760 --> 04:14.520
I'm staring at you, mouth agape, like...

04:14.520 --> 04:15.520
Keith?

04:15.520 --> 04:16.520
Um...

04:16.520 --> 04:17.520
Uh...

04:17.520 --> 04:18.520
Uh...

04:18.520 --> 04:19.520
Where...

04:19.520 --> 04:20.520
Do you know?

04:20.520 --> 04:21.520
Know...

04:21.520 --> 04:22.520
Know what?

04:22.520 --> 04:23.520
Where are we?

04:23.520 --> 04:24.800
Yeah, I'm cool.

04:24.800 --> 04:29.280
Leon touches your arm, Keith, and he says, it might not be time.

04:29.280 --> 04:30.280
Oh, fuck.

04:30.280 --> 04:32.620
I look at Leon, time for what?

04:32.660 --> 04:34.500
Time for you guys to head on out.

04:34.500 --> 04:39.500
So here's what I'm thinking, Keith and, what's your name, John?

04:39.500 --> 04:44.180
If Keith and John want to go in from this way, her dorm is this next one right up here

04:44.180 --> 04:52.380
and he points at a building, and you see the entire campus of CSU is dripping in holiday

04:52.380 --> 04:54.380
festivities.

04:54.380 --> 04:59.580
Before we get out of the car, I want to hand Clark the folder with the pictures and stuff

04:59.580 --> 05:00.580
in it.

05:00.580 --> 05:02.060
Do you remember what you were just doing?

05:02.060 --> 05:07.540
We were in a car chase, I shot out a tire, I guess I don't remember how we got here though.

05:07.540 --> 05:11.860
You and John were, you were just chanting those numbers.

05:11.860 --> 05:12.860
Bruce Robin.

05:12.860 --> 05:14.460
Nah, that didn't sound like us.

05:14.460 --> 05:15.460
Over and over and over again.

05:15.460 --> 05:17.100
I don't remember saying those numbers.

05:17.100 --> 05:18.540
It was pretty freaky.

05:18.540 --> 05:24.300
And when you open up the envelope, you see the inside of a dorm room that is a crime

05:24.300 --> 05:25.300
scene.

05:25.300 --> 05:30.300
Police tape is up and there are little, like, placards, you know, for evidence all over

05:30.340 --> 05:36.820
the place and spray painted all over the walls and even, like, on the bed sheets and, like,

05:36.820 --> 05:40.940
pillowcases and the desk and really anything.

05:40.940 --> 05:50.820
Spray painted on there is 1-5-2-2-5-1-8-1-9-5-5-1-8.

05:50.820 --> 05:51.820
I decoded that.

05:51.820 --> 05:53.460
What's it say, Keith?

05:53.460 --> 05:55.460
It says overseer.

05:55.460 --> 05:58.020
Oh, that's what they called you.

05:58.020 --> 06:00.900
Remember that thing, that thing at the funeral?

06:00.900 --> 06:03.100
Yeah, the creepy thing.

06:03.100 --> 06:06.140
Look at those numbers and I think that's what it called you.

06:06.140 --> 06:08.340
That can't be right.

06:08.340 --> 06:10.460
How, that wouldn't make...

06:10.460 --> 06:15.020
What's stranger about that than, you know, anything we've experienced since the start

06:15.020 --> 06:19.340
of this podcast?

06:19.340 --> 06:23.100
Clark and I look at Leon.

06:23.100 --> 06:24.100
I look at Leon too.

06:24.100 --> 06:25.100
I look at you.

06:25.100 --> 06:27.860
Why won't nobody look at me?

06:27.860 --> 06:32.740
Leon, can you just, can you just tell him?

06:32.740 --> 06:38.100
Keith, John, if you guys take the dorm room, Clark and I will head around to the other

06:38.100 --> 06:41.980
side and get into the administration building.

06:41.980 --> 06:44.180
Do you think I'm the overseer?

06:44.180 --> 06:45.180
Yes.

06:45.180 --> 06:48.540
What does that mean to you?

06:48.540 --> 06:54.140
Clark, it's better not to think about it too much right now as it seems to be...

06:54.140 --> 06:55.140
I don't know.

06:55.140 --> 06:56.140
I was just telling Keith here.

06:56.140 --> 07:01.620
I don't know if I believe in destiny anymore, but if the prophecies are true, then you will

07:01.620 --> 07:06.060
eventually start the circle of knowledge in the past.

07:06.060 --> 07:07.380
That sounds right.

07:07.380 --> 07:10.980
Your old wizard self is running all over the fucking place in time, so...

07:10.980 --> 07:14.820
Remember that book you found that had the drawing in it?

07:14.820 --> 07:18.580
If Leon's right, that's, I think that's you.

07:18.580 --> 07:24.300
Clark is doing what I'm doing now, sitting in stunned silence, mulling it all over.

07:24.300 --> 07:26.140
Why'd you tell that girl to kill herself, man?

07:26.140 --> 07:28.020
Do you remember what was written in that book?

07:28.020 --> 07:30.540
It is only in death that he may rise again.

07:30.540 --> 07:31.540
Yeah.

07:31.540 --> 07:32.540
Horseshoes and hand grenades.

07:32.540 --> 07:33.900
What did it actually say?

07:33.900 --> 07:37.100
It is only through death that he may rise again.

07:37.100 --> 07:38.100
Oh.

07:38.100 --> 07:39.100
Pretty much nailed it.

07:39.100 --> 07:41.740
Yeah, that was real good without consulting notes or anything.

07:41.740 --> 07:44.520
I don't know why you ribbed him on that.

07:44.520 --> 07:46.300
So do we have to kill Clark or...

07:46.300 --> 07:47.540
No, no, God no.

07:47.540 --> 07:49.740
I mean, Clark is our greatest asset.

07:49.740 --> 07:53.140
I didn't know anything about that starting the circle thing, but Maggie did tell me that

07:53.140 --> 07:57.080
that's kind of the whole point of the circle of knowledge, wasn't it to bring about the

07:57.080 --> 07:58.080
Overseer?

07:58.080 --> 07:59.080
Isn't that what she told me?

07:59.080 --> 08:07.740
In a way, yes, but it's a matter of the end-of-the-world scenario that we've heard is perhaps coming

08:07.740 --> 08:13.980
can pretty much only be stopped by the Overseer, so we're really hoping that you show up later

08:13.980 --> 08:14.980
now.

08:14.980 --> 08:18.460
Clark throws up.

08:18.460 --> 08:19.500
The world?

08:19.500 --> 08:20.500
It's just the world.

08:20.500 --> 08:21.980
Hey, you got this, buddy.

08:21.980 --> 08:25.340
Leon, there's a huge flaw here in this whole thing.

08:25.340 --> 08:26.340
I don't do magic.

08:26.340 --> 08:27.340
I don't know how to do magic.

08:27.340 --> 08:29.100
Do you know how to do magic?

08:29.100 --> 08:30.100
No.

08:30.100 --> 08:32.860
I didn't even know magic was the thing until I saw Old Me.

08:32.860 --> 08:36.200
You obviously do in the past when your future self creates it.

08:36.200 --> 08:37.620
Does the circle know magic?

08:37.620 --> 08:39.700
Can you teach me to do magic?

08:39.700 --> 08:41.080
It's not really magic.

08:41.080 --> 08:42.080
I've never seen...

08:42.080 --> 08:44.380
Where is your sense of wonder, Leon?

08:44.380 --> 08:48.380
Honestly, I've seen too much to wonder about anything anymore.

08:48.380 --> 08:49.880
Have you talked to the Old Me?

08:49.880 --> 08:54.000
Do you know that Old Me has been sticking his hands in our daily lives for the last

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
few days?

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
No, what?

08:56.000 --> 08:59.920
Have you seen the video of the monkey who sticks his whole hand up a pug's butthole?

08:59.920 --> 09:02.360
Yes, but hold on, what was the other thing?

09:02.360 --> 09:03.520
That's what he's been doing to us.

09:03.520 --> 09:08.160
I watch that every night before I go to sleep, but I haven't seen...

09:08.160 --> 09:09.160
You're saying that...

09:09.160 --> 09:13.900
Like John said, like a monkey sticking its whole hand up a pug's butthole.

09:13.900 --> 09:17.680
He's been messing in our business, and we jump like that pug.

09:17.680 --> 09:18.680
We don't like it.

09:18.680 --> 09:31.240
What rude monkey is Old Clark?

09:31.240 --> 09:34.160
What do you know about that?

09:34.160 --> 09:39.960
I mean, obviously I know a lot about the monkey pug asshole stuff, but I'm very curious to

09:39.960 --> 09:44.800
hear about the ways in which Old Clark has put his fist inside of you.

09:44.800 --> 09:45.800
Don't get weird with it.

09:45.800 --> 09:47.120
No, no, no, you know what I mean.

09:47.120 --> 09:49.680
Just follow along with in the game we're playing.

09:49.680 --> 09:53.700
It seems as though he's been helping us in sort of indiscriminate ways.

09:53.700 --> 09:57.320
He tried to warn us a long time ago when none of us were around.

09:57.320 --> 10:01.240
He went and talked to Drew and told him something terrible was going to happen.

10:01.240 --> 10:02.240
That was Old Clark?

10:02.240 --> 10:03.240
It wasn't me.

10:03.240 --> 10:04.640
I thought that was just a double.

10:04.640 --> 10:08.320
Well, if he's time traveling, I guess it could be a younger but not the oldest.

10:08.320 --> 10:09.400
Oh, man.

10:09.400 --> 10:10.400
These are ancient mysteries.

10:10.400 --> 10:11.680
I don't know how it works.

10:11.680 --> 10:14.560
We saw him in the mausoleum too.

10:14.560 --> 10:16.760
He did something to us.

10:16.760 --> 10:17.760
What do you mean?

10:17.760 --> 10:19.380
I show whichever one.

10:19.380 --> 10:20.380
What's on my chest again?

10:20.380 --> 10:21.380
Marvin.

10:21.380 --> 10:22.380
Marvin.

10:22.380 --> 10:23.380
And it's crossed out.

10:23.380 --> 10:24.380
What's on my hand?

10:24.380 --> 10:25.380
Tildy.

10:25.380 --> 10:26.380
I'm going to show him that one.

10:26.380 --> 10:28.360
He branded us with a name.

10:28.360 --> 10:33.200
He branded you with a metal hot stick or like a spell.

10:33.200 --> 10:34.880
And I hold out my hand too.

10:34.880 --> 10:38.620
I hold out my, no, I'm not going to slap him.

10:38.620 --> 10:41.240
I hold out my hand.

10:41.240 --> 10:42.240
Look real close.

10:42.240 --> 10:43.240
Watch the birdie.

10:43.240 --> 10:46.720
I hold out the opposite hand to the one they're holding and then smack me with the other one.

10:46.720 --> 10:49.440
It hurts really bad when you hit him with the one that's painted.

10:49.440 --> 10:50.440
I don't hit him.

10:50.440 --> 10:52.840
I just solemnly hold my hand up with the others.

10:52.840 --> 10:57.040
I don't, I can't, the only thing I can assume is it was magic.

10:57.040 --> 10:58.720
He held up a scroll.

10:58.720 --> 10:59.720
Joe's asking that.

10:59.720 --> 11:03.520
I think he held up a scroll and the words alighted and then we blacked out.

11:03.520 --> 11:08.440
Yeah, he held up some kind of parchment and the words lit up and we blacked out.

11:08.440 --> 11:10.440
I just assumed it was magic of some kind.

11:10.440 --> 11:14.460
Yeah, I don't know what to call it, but the world definitely doesn't play by the rules

11:14.460 --> 11:20.020
that we believed and were taught that it did and part of the circle of knowledge is

11:20.020 --> 11:26.900
keeping that truth a secret from the general public because the minute that this goes wide,

11:26.900 --> 11:27.900
chaos will ensue.

11:27.900 --> 11:31.520
Not if he's like regulated, like set up a Hogwarts.

11:31.520 --> 11:34.060
That is an extremely good point, Jon.

11:34.060 --> 11:35.060
Thank you.

11:35.060 --> 11:36.060
Maybe season two.

11:36.060 --> 11:42.980
Yeah, fuck yeah, Jon as Dumbledore, right in on the discord if you want to see that.

11:42.980 --> 11:47.020
If you don't think that the overseer would be Dumbledore, then I don't know what to tell

11:47.020 --> 11:48.020
you.

11:48.020 --> 11:50.540
Wouldn't the overseer be doing more important stuff?

11:50.540 --> 11:51.540
He's Voldemort.

11:51.540 --> 11:52.540
Yeah.

11:52.540 --> 11:56.460
I touched your kids and I'm pretty sure they touched me too.

11:56.460 --> 11:58.500
Leon, Dewey Cox.

11:58.500 --> 12:01.060
We uh, that's Dewey Jack Black.

12:01.060 --> 12:02.060
Dewey Finn.

12:02.060 --> 12:03.060
Fuck.

12:03.060 --> 12:04.060
Sorry.

12:04.060 --> 12:08.820
Leon, we have other names, not embroidered, we have other names written on us.

12:08.820 --> 12:10.660
Clark shoots, uh, Kila Glantz.

12:10.660 --> 12:11.660
Yeah, I don't.

12:11.660 --> 12:12.660
I sure don't.

12:13.340 --> 12:14.340
Nevermind.

12:14.340 --> 12:19.460
Well, you guys seem to be having some inner turmoil here, which will lead me to my point.

12:19.460 --> 12:20.640
We are running out of time.

12:20.640 --> 12:21.640
We need to get in here.

12:21.640 --> 12:22.940
We need to make this quick.

12:22.940 --> 12:25.420
So, my plan split up.

12:25.420 --> 12:29.460
Two of you and two of us and we'll get this taken care of.

12:29.460 --> 12:36.240
All right now, Keith and Jon, I think you guys have the best chance at going in and

12:36.240 --> 12:38.900
figuring out what happened in the dorm room.

12:38.900 --> 12:40.900
Talk to her roommate.

12:40.900 --> 12:42.820
Talk to anyone who is friends with her.

12:42.820 --> 12:44.200
Try to get the run down.

12:44.200 --> 12:48.620
They will have already been talked to by the city police, so you're going to have to convince

12:48.620 --> 12:51.980
them that there's a reason that you're re-interviewing them.

12:51.980 --> 12:58.060
Clark, we're going to go ahead and sneak into the administration building and pull files.

12:58.060 --> 12:59.060
All right?

12:59.060 --> 13:02.140
Uh, I guess if you say so, if you think that's best.

13:02.140 --> 13:05.780
That's what, I don't even know what, what are we, what are we doing, Leon?

13:05.780 --> 13:06.780
What's going on?

13:06.780 --> 13:11.780
We need to figure out if Harriet Marks is the beginning of this or if she passed it

13:11.780 --> 13:13.780
on whatever it is.

13:13.780 --> 13:15.940
Do you have an inkling on what it is?

13:15.940 --> 13:19.140
Well, it seems to pass from person to person.

13:19.140 --> 13:25.680
Perhaps, you know, Bruce Robin quote unquote got it, whatever it is from Harriet Marks.

13:25.680 --> 13:28.300
She got it or whatever it is from the Overseer.

13:28.300 --> 13:29.300
You guys.

13:29.300 --> 13:30.300
Are you saying it follows?

13:30.300 --> 13:32.140
I mean, it seems to pass.

13:32.140 --> 13:34.940
Wait, you know that Harriet got it from the Overseer?

13:35.180 --> 13:37.900
Look at the, look at the numbers all over a dorm room.

13:37.900 --> 13:40.420
Any points of the pictures that are in your lap?

13:40.420 --> 13:41.420
Oh.

13:41.420 --> 13:45.660
So it gives the name of the last person who had it, is that the theory?

13:45.660 --> 13:47.780
We were writing down Bruce.

13:47.780 --> 13:48.780
What was Bruce writing down?

13:48.780 --> 13:49.780
He was writing down Harriet.

13:49.780 --> 13:50.780
Got it.

13:50.780 --> 13:51.780
I see what you're saying.

13:51.780 --> 13:52.780
And Harriet was writing the Overseer.

13:52.780 --> 13:56.660
It's just a theory, but if it starts with the Overseer, we need to figure out why you

13:56.660 --> 13:57.660
made this happen.

13:57.660 --> 13:59.420
I mean, I didn't.

13:59.420 --> 14:03.620
I understand that it's not you, but we need to figure out why future past you made this

14:03.620 --> 14:04.620
happen.

14:05.300 --> 14:10.580
Let's call him Clark, Clark, Clark, old, let's call him Clark old just so I don't feel like

14:10.580 --> 14:13.260
you guys are accusing me of shit I didn't do.

14:13.260 --> 14:18.340
No, old dick is really good, but let's stick with Clark old.

14:18.340 --> 14:21.660
I mean, how do you expect us to find that out?

14:21.660 --> 14:24.180
Your cops do your interrogation work.

14:24.180 --> 14:28.020
From what I've heard, you guys are real good at putting guns in people's faces and making

14:28.020 --> 14:29.020
them talk.

14:29.020 --> 14:30.020
I point my gun in his face.

14:30.020 --> 14:32.060
I'm like, you don't know a goddamn thing about us.

14:32.060 --> 14:33.100
And he just keeps talking.

14:33.140 --> 14:34.460
I got an idea, fellas.

14:34.460 --> 14:40.180
If you take a picture of me and use a filter to oldify me, then you got a picture of me.

14:40.180 --> 14:42.140
Ask if people have seen him around.

14:42.140 --> 14:43.140
Face app.

14:43.140 --> 14:44.140
I snap a pic.

14:44.140 --> 14:45.260
I smile real big.

14:45.260 --> 14:46.260
Snap a pic.

14:46.260 --> 14:50.060
GRUS8 is definitely going to get in on this.

14:50.060 --> 14:52.060
That's the, uh, nevermind.

14:52.060 --> 14:54.740
I'm going to cut that.

14:54.740 --> 14:57.300
Sorry about the Internet Research Agency.

14:57.300 --> 14:59.220
Some Delta Green lore.

14:59.220 --> 15:01.220
Oh, great.

15:01.220 --> 15:02.220
Okay.

15:02.340 --> 15:06.780
Well, I guess, uh, should we go to, go to her door?

15:06.780 --> 15:07.780
You killed the vibe, nerd.

15:07.780 --> 15:08.780
I know.

15:08.780 --> 15:18.380
All right, get the fuck out of my, come on, let's, uh, let's, let's make this happen,

15:18.380 --> 15:19.380
captain.

15:19.380 --> 15:20.380
Okay.

15:20.380 --> 15:21.380
I mean, I guess let's go to her dorm then, John.

15:21.380 --> 15:22.380
I'm following you.

15:22.380 --> 15:23.380
All right.

15:23.380 --> 15:24.380
Let's split up.

15:32.220 --> 15:43.140
Hey Joe, Clark is sitting in the back of the car.

15:43.140 --> 15:48.820
John Lee Pettymore and Keith Vigna get out, start walking toward the dorm.

15:48.820 --> 15:53.740
Leon puts the car in reverse and starts driving out of the parking lot.

15:53.740 --> 15:58.940
I need you to roll either a human or an alertness, whichever is higher.

15:58.940 --> 16:02.540
My alertness is higher.

16:02.540 --> 16:03.700
I crit pass.

16:03.700 --> 16:04.700
I crit pass.

16:04.700 --> 16:05.700
I got a one.

16:05.700 --> 16:08.860
I got a zero zero one.

16:08.860 --> 16:10.660
I got a 33.

16:10.660 --> 16:12.660
That's fucking wild.

16:12.660 --> 16:13.660
Is a one better than a 33?

16:13.660 --> 16:14.900
I think a one is better than a 33.

16:14.900 --> 16:15.900
It sounds like it should be better to me.

16:15.900 --> 16:19.740
I think a one is like the ultimate crit.

16:19.740 --> 16:21.020
I'm so sorry, Zach.

16:21.020 --> 16:22.220
I don't know how I do it.

16:22.220 --> 16:26.020
You do never, hey, never apologize.

16:26.020 --> 16:27.300
Never apologize, baby.

16:27.300 --> 16:28.820
All right, shit.

16:28.820 --> 16:29.820
Are you ready for this?

16:29.820 --> 16:32.060
I know, but go.

16:32.060 --> 16:41.700
You notice Leon's free hand is reaching and he grabs a gun out from under the shotgun

16:41.700 --> 16:47.980
seat, like in between the console and the shotgun seat, and he's moving it to aim it

16:47.980 --> 16:48.980
at you.

16:48.980 --> 16:50.740
And it's not a normal gun.

16:50.740 --> 16:53.980
It looks like the tranq gun that he gave you earlier.

16:53.980 --> 17:01.100
So instead of him just firing it into you, we are now going to roll against each other,

17:01.100 --> 17:02.220
depending on what you want to do.

17:02.220 --> 17:06.900
Well, I would like to kick the back of his chair to throw the aim of the gun off.

17:06.900 --> 17:07.900
Fantastic.

17:07.900 --> 17:12.980
So you're going to roll unarmed combat and he's going to roll at a negative 40 of firearms

17:12.980 --> 17:16.900
and we'll see how this plays out.

17:16.900 --> 17:18.620
He's got a 80% in firearms.

17:18.620 --> 17:20.180
No, sorry, 70.

17:20.180 --> 17:22.100
So he's going to go down to 30.

17:22.100 --> 17:28.380
I'm going to use brand new dice that I've never touched before.

17:28.380 --> 17:32.060
I got a straight 30 on a 70.

17:32.060 --> 17:34.540
You beat him.

17:34.540 --> 17:41.660
He fires and you see a little dart goes right into the headrest of the middle seat right

17:41.660 --> 17:42.940
next to you.

17:42.940 --> 17:44.500
And it is your turn to act.

17:44.500 --> 17:47.340
I want to wrestle the gun away from his hand.

17:47.340 --> 17:50.340
And as I'm doing so saying, what the fuck, Leon, what the fuck?

17:50.380 --> 17:54.020
All right, let's roll an unarmed combat check.

17:57.020 --> 17:58.020
I fail.

17:58.020 --> 17:59.020
I failed too.

17:59.020 --> 18:00.020
I got a 91.

18:00.020 --> 18:01.020
I got a 94.

18:01.020 --> 18:03.260
So that's just fail on fail.

18:03.260 --> 18:07.220
So he continues driving without a wrecking.

18:07.220 --> 18:13.160
However, the gun is just like being wildly moved back and forth and you've got two hands

18:13.160 --> 18:17.380
on his arm and he is trying to muscle back on you.

18:17.380 --> 18:18.860
It's his turn.

18:18.860 --> 18:22.180
And he is going to try to wrestle the gun away from you.

18:22.180 --> 18:24.180
So roll it up again, baby.

18:24.180 --> 18:27.300
I got a five.

18:27.300 --> 18:30.780
I crit on different dice.

18:30.780 --> 18:31.900
These are different dice.

18:31.900 --> 18:33.460
I don't think I've ever used these either.

18:33.460 --> 18:34.460
It's a 33.

18:34.460 --> 18:35.460
Okay.

18:35.460 --> 18:36.460
You have full control over the situation.

18:36.460 --> 18:37.460
What do you do?

18:37.460 --> 18:41.540
I rip the gun out of his hand and I pointed at the back of his head.

18:41.540 --> 18:42.540
Leon.

18:42.540 --> 18:43.540
Yeah.

18:43.540 --> 18:44.540
What the fuck?

18:44.540 --> 18:47.780
I just thought it'd be easier if you weren't conscious for this next part.

18:47.780 --> 18:48.780
Please don't.

18:48.780 --> 18:50.260
Did you want me unconscious?

18:50.260 --> 18:51.260
Yeah.

18:51.260 --> 18:53.620
There's a star.

18:53.620 --> 18:54.940
Is he still driving while we're talking?

18:54.940 --> 18:56.260
He is still driving while you're talking.

18:56.260 --> 18:57.520
Can I tell where he's going?

18:57.520 --> 18:58.580
Has he left campus?

18:58.580 --> 18:59.580
He hasn't.

18:59.580 --> 19:01.160
No, it's a, it's a pretty big campus.

19:01.160 --> 19:05.580
So he's just like driving slowly through these stop signs and stuff.

19:05.580 --> 19:08.980
I was just doing that for the best.

19:08.980 --> 19:15.440
So, okay, so you are, you are essentially, I know this sucks, but I've got a lot riding

19:15.440 --> 19:20.360
on you in the future and I thought it would be safest if you weren't around for this next

19:20.360 --> 19:25.920
little bit because what if we run into issues like the whole time we were running through

19:25.920 --> 19:32.400
the bar court place, I was horrified that a stray bullet or something ends all of this.

19:32.400 --> 19:37.000
And if you die, maybe the world ends like I don't know, but I need to protect you at

19:37.000 --> 19:38.000
all costs.

19:38.000 --> 19:43.200
But Leon, if you're saying that the overseer started the circle and I am the overseer,

19:43.200 --> 19:44.400
that means I live through all this.

19:44.400 --> 19:45.400
I'm untouchable.

19:45.400 --> 19:48.120
The, I don't know if the future and the past work.

19:48.120 --> 19:49.960
I don't know how any of this works.

19:49.960 --> 19:58.160
Roll a human for me, I fail a 42 on a 30.

19:58.160 --> 19:59.160
I just don't know.

19:59.160 --> 20:00.160
I don't know.

20:00.160 --> 20:02.320
I don't know how any of this works and I have to keep you safe.

20:02.320 --> 20:03.320
Listen to me, Leon.

20:03.320 --> 20:07.160
I've started to think that maybe this overseer business sounds pretty good to me.

20:07.160 --> 20:11.660
And if you're saying that I have bulletproof armor, cause I start the circle, I'm not saying

20:11.660 --> 20:15.360
that you are saying that I start the circle in the past.

20:15.360 --> 20:17.080
So I think I'm going to be dandy.

20:17.080 --> 20:18.720
I think I'm going to get out of this unscathed.

20:18.720 --> 20:21.720
You on the other hand, might want to keep your head down, cause I don't remember Leon

20:21.720 --> 20:24.280
being Clark Old's right hand man.

20:24.280 --> 20:30.280
Hey, Leon, from here on out, I'm on your side, but I want involved.

20:30.280 --> 20:32.680
You don't get to knock me out and sideline me like that.

20:32.680 --> 20:34.160
Okay, that's fair.

20:34.160 --> 20:35.720
Oh, Clark.

20:35.720 --> 20:38.920
We, uh, we gotta go to the camp.

20:38.920 --> 20:39.920
It's time.

20:39.920 --> 20:40.920
The camp?

20:40.920 --> 20:41.920
Yeah, we gotta go to...

20:41.920 --> 20:44.360
Joe's gonna say, is it the calm, comfy campground?

20:44.360 --> 20:46.480
We gotta go to the calm, comfy campground.

20:46.480 --> 20:47.480
Yeah, boy.

20:47.480 --> 20:50.240
Aren't you proud of me?

20:50.240 --> 20:51.360
I'm super proud of you.

20:51.360 --> 20:53.660
Zach, I remember that without even looking at notes.

20:53.660 --> 20:55.320
You get 10 luck.

20:55.320 --> 21:00.660
Yeah, that's what I was fishing for.

21:00.660 --> 21:05.640
But first, do you actually, let's go back to what you just said a few moments ago.

21:05.640 --> 21:10.720
Do you actually believe that you're like indestructible?

21:10.720 --> 21:12.120
It's all I've been presented with so far.

21:12.120 --> 21:13.440
Yeah, I think so.

21:13.440 --> 21:19.520
How competent do you feel with these other two solving this situation here at CSU?

21:19.520 --> 21:26.280
I mean, key's always a big question mark in my life, but maybe working together they can

21:26.280 --> 21:27.280
figure something out.

21:27.280 --> 21:28.480
I don't know.

21:28.480 --> 21:29.480
You know what?

21:29.480 --> 21:30.480
Let's...

21:30.480 --> 21:38.800
I am curious, Clark, and he turns the car back and heads up to...

21:38.800 --> 21:42.480
You actually see a sign on the building that you're heading directly towards and it's the

21:42.480 --> 21:47.520
administrative building, which is where you guys were originally planning on going.

21:47.520 --> 21:50.520
It's where he said you guys were originally planning on going.

21:50.520 --> 21:52.720
Before he tried to kidnap me.

21:52.720 --> 21:53.720
Uh-huh!

21:53.720 --> 21:54.720
Yeah!

21:54.720 --> 22:01.520
Before that happened, he's like, no hard feelings on that, by the way, I just, you know, I'm

22:01.520 --> 22:04.080
doing my job and I...

22:04.080 --> 22:10.920
But honestly, if you can prove what's happening here, I mean, I would be, I'll help, I'm interested.

22:10.920 --> 22:12.000
Let's just do this.

22:12.040 --> 22:13.520
Let's fucking go for it.

22:13.520 --> 22:17.560
And he pulls up to the spot right next to the door and...

22:17.560 --> 22:21.440
So you're saying we're not gonna go to the comfy campgrounds then?

22:21.440 --> 22:22.880
No, we absolutely will.

22:22.880 --> 22:25.660
We'll just take care of this first, because I want to see if you can.

22:25.660 --> 22:31.240
If you can, then I, you know, that'll be just incredible.

22:31.240 --> 22:32.240
And then we can head over there.

22:32.240 --> 22:34.160
It's not time sensitive then.

22:34.160 --> 22:38.560
It is, but I have a feeling that we've already got a timer on this situation.

22:38.560 --> 22:40.920
All right, Leon, I'll follow your lead.

22:40.920 --> 22:41.920
I like that.

22:41.920 --> 22:42.920
How does he get out?

22:42.920 --> 22:47.440
Yeah, and I think you might be, he relinquished the gun to you.

22:47.440 --> 22:48.920
Well, I definitely didn't give it back.

22:48.920 --> 22:49.920
Yeah.

22:49.920 --> 22:50.920
He hasn't asked for it, you mean?

22:50.920 --> 22:51.920
No, he hasn't asked for it.

22:51.920 --> 22:52.920
Yeah.

22:52.920 --> 22:53.920
Okay.

22:53.920 --> 22:54.920
Yeah, I'm gonna just hold on to it.

22:54.920 --> 23:17.360
John Lee Pettymore and Keith Vigna get out of the car that Clark Bishop and Leon Simpson

23:17.360 --> 23:18.360
were in.

23:18.360 --> 23:23.920
And you guys look out at the campus of CSU, City State University, and the entire thing

23:23.920 --> 23:27.160
is riddled with holiday spirit.

23:27.160 --> 23:31.880
There are decorations covering everything.

23:31.880 --> 23:33.760
Like say a holiday decoration.

23:33.760 --> 23:34.760
Wreath.

23:34.760 --> 23:39.480
Yeah, there's a big wreath that's just like on the dorm building right in front of you.

23:39.480 --> 23:40.480
Lights.

23:40.480 --> 23:41.480
Oh yeah.

23:41.480 --> 23:42.480
Oh, you know there's lights.

23:42.480 --> 23:44.520
There's like an absurd amount of Christmas lights.

23:44.520 --> 23:49.760
They're on every single building up the walls and on every tree on campus as well.

23:49.760 --> 23:51.640
It's actually, it's quite pretty.

23:51.640 --> 23:52.640
Inflatable minion.

23:52.960 --> 23:54.320
There's an inflatable minion.

23:54.320 --> 23:56.160
It's a wave.

23:56.160 --> 24:01.540
It's Derek and it's wearing the Christmas hat.

24:01.540 --> 24:02.540
What is that called?

24:02.540 --> 24:03.540
Santa hat?

24:03.540 --> 24:04.540
Santa hat.

24:04.540 --> 24:06.660
It's wearing a Christmas hat.

24:06.660 --> 24:11.240
And yeah, it's arms are just like the only thing that's moving on it.

24:11.240 --> 24:15.000
What is the mascot of City State University?

24:15.000 --> 24:18.240
The mascot of City State University.

24:18.240 --> 24:20.760
Yeah, that was the question he asked.

24:21.680 --> 24:26.360
What was the mascot of City State University?

24:26.360 --> 24:27.880
I'm assuming you have this written down.

24:27.880 --> 24:28.880
Just control F mascot.

24:28.880 --> 24:34.160
Oh yeah, let me just look it up on my computer real quick.

24:34.160 --> 24:35.880
It is a Venus fly trap.

24:35.880 --> 24:36.880
Cool.

24:36.880 --> 24:37.880
That's a native to North Carolina.

24:37.880 --> 24:39.900
Well, you don't know where we are.

24:39.900 --> 24:41.360
Not North Carolina though, right?

24:41.360 --> 24:44.240
Probably not, but it's native to the city.

24:44.240 --> 24:47.800
Tigers aren't from Detroit, so.

24:47.800 --> 24:49.960
Tigers are not from Detroit, Thomas.

24:49.960 --> 24:52.640
I know at least three tigers that are.

24:52.640 --> 24:56.280
Anyway, wow, this place is Christmassed out.

24:56.280 --> 24:58.080
This is a good podcast, guys.

24:58.080 --> 24:59.080
Are there trees?

24:59.080 --> 25:06.520
Okay, so you get past the Christmas decorations and you have been given directions to go to

25:06.520 --> 25:13.680
the dorm room of Harriet Marks, which is 328 Giff's house.

25:13.680 --> 25:17.080
And actually you see this building that is right in front of you.

25:17.080 --> 25:24.760
It has a sign on it that in big capital letters it says Giff's house, G-I-F-F-S.

25:24.760 --> 25:30.800
And the building is covered in a massive wreath that is lousy with lights.

25:30.800 --> 25:33.480
Let's go in there up to the third floor, I'm assuming.

25:33.480 --> 25:34.480
Room 328.

25:34.480 --> 25:40.480
When you guys go into Giff's house, you see that all the lights are out.

25:40.480 --> 25:45.160
Hey real quick, do you know how I already knew how that was spelled before you told

25:45.160 --> 25:46.160
us?

25:46.240 --> 25:50.560
If it had only had one F, you would have said it wrong.

25:50.560 --> 25:51.560
That's an opinion.

25:51.560 --> 25:57.840
So you guys were going into Giff's house and the lights are out.

25:57.840 --> 26:02.960
On your right there is a secretary's desk and there's a computer.

26:02.960 --> 26:07.360
The glow of the computer screen is the only light in this room, but you can make out from

26:07.360 --> 26:12.400
there that to your left there's like a sitting area with a baby grand piano and ahead of

26:12.400 --> 26:19.120
you there is a glass wall of windows with a door leading into that room and then from

26:19.120 --> 26:22.320
there there's a hallway that breaks off and it goes left and right.

26:22.320 --> 26:24.160
Baby grand piano is my pop star name.

26:24.160 --> 26:26.920
Ooh, that's really good.

26:26.920 --> 26:28.920
Yeah it is.

26:28.920 --> 26:29.920
Is the secretary there?

26:29.920 --> 26:33.040
No, there's no one in this room at all.

26:33.040 --> 26:40.080
Is there a fire escape plan on the wall to see if we can locate 321 or 328 without?

26:40.080 --> 26:44.120
Yeah absolutely, so you've got stairwells on either side of the building and an elevator

26:44.120 --> 26:45.120
in the middle.

26:45.120 --> 26:47.520
I'd like to see if I can access this computer.

26:47.520 --> 26:48.520
Sure.

26:48.520 --> 26:49.520
Yeah, you can hop on there.

26:49.520 --> 26:50.520
Any good stuff?

26:50.520 --> 26:54.840
Oh, there's a directory you can find out that when you look up Harriet Marks, she lives

26:54.840 --> 26:55.840
in 328.

26:55.840 --> 27:02.560
Her roommate's name is Amelia Locke and right across the hall is 330 Giff's house, which

27:02.560 --> 27:05.260
is listed as show dorm.

27:05.260 --> 27:10.000
Like one they show to prospective students on tours, yes.

27:10.000 --> 27:13.760
Let's go up there and see if we can find anything, probably need to talk to Amelia

27:13.760 --> 27:14.760
too.

27:14.760 --> 27:21.720
Or sidebar, we change our clothes, we go crash in that show dorm until somebody realizes

27:21.720 --> 27:27.920
what's up and we just do a whole spin-off where Keith and John Lee Pettymore go to college.

27:27.920 --> 27:29.520
You know what, I like that idea.

27:29.520 --> 27:30.520
Spin-off!

27:30.520 --> 27:35.320
I certainly never went to college unless it says otherwise on my character sheet.

27:35.320 --> 27:36.560
No, I went to...

27:36.560 --> 27:39.720
Oh no, I went here.

27:39.720 --> 27:41.560
Does it remind you of the good old days?

27:41.560 --> 27:42.800
It does, I want to go back.

27:42.800 --> 27:45.720
Well, I think we should get this investigation out of the way first.

27:45.720 --> 27:49.280
Actually, I have written down City University, which I imagine is City State University's

27:49.280 --> 27:50.280
intense crosstown rival.

27:50.280 --> 27:51.280
It absolutely is.

27:51.280 --> 27:52.280
Yeah, it's their big rival.

27:52.280 --> 27:54.440
No, I hate fucking CSU scum.

27:54.440 --> 27:56.440
Yeah, you're a poinsettia.

27:56.440 --> 27:57.440
Yeah!

27:57.440 --> 28:00.440
Well, I always wanted to come here because...

28:00.440 --> 28:01.440
Point!

28:01.440 --> 28:02.440
Poinsettia!

28:02.440 --> 28:03.440
City University leads the way!

28:03.440 --> 28:04.440
Nice!

28:04.440 --> 28:05.440
That's our fight song.

28:05.440 --> 28:08.520
I walk to where the elevator is.

28:08.520 --> 28:15.080
And the elevator door opens as the light emits from the elevator into the hallway that

28:15.080 --> 28:16.080
you're in.

28:16.080 --> 28:19.980
And you can also see it from the light on the vending machines behind you.

28:19.980 --> 28:26.200
The walls and the floor of this space are completely covered in numbers, like absolutely

28:26.200 --> 28:27.420
riddled in numbers.

28:27.420 --> 28:32.300
So many different sequences of numbers, in fact, that you can't make out any specific

28:32.300 --> 28:33.300
single sequence.

28:33.300 --> 28:34.680
What are they written with?

28:34.680 --> 28:36.040
All sorts of materials.

28:36.040 --> 28:44.200
We've got Sharpie, paint, spray paint, blood, cum, piss, like there seems to be a smear

28:44.200 --> 28:45.640
of shit on the wall at some point.

28:45.640 --> 28:47.160
Tell me more about the cum numbers.

28:47.160 --> 28:54.120
So the cum numbers, they're dripping, and they were dripping, now they're coagulated

28:54.120 --> 28:55.160
in place.

28:55.160 --> 28:57.680
Is there a dorm room near us?

28:57.680 --> 28:58.680
Just any dorm room?

28:58.680 --> 28:59.680
There's actually not, no.

28:59.680 --> 29:03.120
Well, damn, do you think people are still living in this dorm room, or in this dorm

29:03.120 --> 29:04.120
hall?

29:04.120 --> 29:05.120
I have no idea.

29:05.200 --> 29:09.040
I'm not able to clean this, literally this shit up, but I don't know.

29:09.040 --> 29:10.600
What dorm room are we in her dorm room?

29:10.600 --> 29:16.120
No, you were about to get into the elevator from the main floor up to the third floor,

29:16.120 --> 29:22.140
but you do see that when you turn to look into the elevator, in the corner that would

29:22.140 --> 29:29.040
be out of sight when the elevator door first opened, there is a slumped over body of a

29:29.040 --> 29:30.040
student.

29:30.040 --> 29:34.600
And the head has been smashed.

29:34.600 --> 29:42.360
Her face is no longer a face, it seems to have been hit repeatedly in the forehead and

29:42.360 --> 29:43.360
nose.

29:43.360 --> 29:45.120
What the fuck kind of hell dorm is this?

29:45.120 --> 29:46.600
I don't know, but uh.

29:46.600 --> 29:49.320
If John Lee Pettymark could roll a sanity check for me.

29:49.320 --> 29:52.200
Yeah, John, you probably shouldn't be looking at that.

29:52.200 --> 29:53.200
Fail.

29:53.200 --> 29:55.520
Go ahead and lose one sanity.

29:55.520 --> 29:56.520
We're getting there.

29:56.520 --> 30:01.520
I go over and turn the body over, look for like a, is there a purse on this person?

30:01.520 --> 30:04.880
Do you see that there is a fanny pack on this person?

30:04.880 --> 30:07.480
I'm gonna dig through and find identification.

30:07.480 --> 30:11.120
Yeah, her name was Samantha Carter.

30:11.120 --> 30:12.120
Poor Samantha.

30:12.120 --> 30:15.600
Well, good thing it wasn't Amelia, because that's who I'm wanting to talk to.

30:15.600 --> 30:18.320
And I hit the third floor button in the elevator.

30:18.320 --> 30:20.920
Alright, and Thomas, if you could leave the room.

30:20.920 --> 30:22.920
Before we do that, can you tell me what I found on the computer?

30:22.920 --> 30:27.360
It was just the info for like who lived where.

30:27.360 --> 30:28.760
Did you want to find anything else?

30:28.760 --> 30:30.320
Yeah, like the answer to all these mysteries.

30:30.320 --> 30:34.040
Oh yeah, the answer to all the mysteries isn't on there, unfortunately.

30:34.040 --> 30:35.040
But there was a...

30:35.040 --> 30:36.040
Wrong computer.

30:36.040 --> 30:37.040
Is there a reason I'm not going with him?

30:37.040 --> 30:42.560
There was a big, like, when you first got on the computer, the background for the entire

30:42.560 --> 30:49.560
thing was a promotional ad, like a poster, for The Jingle Ball, taking place the night

30:49.560 --> 30:52.640
of December 6th at CSU.

30:52.640 --> 30:58.400
And it says, follow the scavenger hunt to make your way to The Jingle Ball.

30:58.400 --> 31:00.580
Is December 6th the night that...

31:00.580 --> 31:01.580
That's the night.

31:01.580 --> 31:02.580
Okay.

31:02.580 --> 31:04.120
And do we know what date Harriet died?

31:04.120 --> 31:05.120
December 2nd.

31:05.120 --> 31:06.120
Okay.

31:06.120 --> 31:08.880
So is there a reason I'm not going up the elevator with him?

31:08.880 --> 31:09.880
Yes.

31:09.880 --> 31:10.880
Okay.

31:10.880 --> 31:11.880
I mean, we would have gone up together, right?

31:11.880 --> 31:12.880
Yep.

31:12.880 --> 31:13.880
Okay.

31:13.880 --> 31:23.760
Hey, Leon?

31:23.760 --> 31:27.200
Yeah.

31:27.200 --> 31:32.160
Got your gun here.

31:32.160 --> 31:33.160
Yeah, I know.

31:33.160 --> 31:35.760
Is this these, those mind control darts?

31:35.760 --> 31:41.040
He looks at you with like a grimace, like he's about to burp, like I just did.

31:41.040 --> 31:42.040
No.

31:42.040 --> 31:46.080
What would they have done to me?

31:46.080 --> 31:48.200
Probably fall asleep for a while.

31:48.200 --> 31:49.500
How long's a while?

31:49.500 --> 31:50.500
Not too long.

31:50.500 --> 31:51.500
I'm going to hold on to it then.

31:51.500 --> 31:54.680
I don't want you sneaking up behind me and doing it, trying to do it again.

31:54.680 --> 31:56.160
That seems fair.

31:56.160 --> 31:58.840
And I don't want to do that to you now.

31:58.840 --> 32:05.220
I mean, if you're willing to, you seem down for the cause and with your current knowledge,

32:05.220 --> 32:06.720
I think that we're good.

32:06.720 --> 32:07.720
All right.

32:07.720 --> 32:10.040
Let's find out what we can about the...

32:10.040 --> 32:11.040
It was Harriet Marks.

32:11.040 --> 32:12.800
That's what we were looking for, right?

32:12.800 --> 32:13.800
Harriet Marks.

32:13.800 --> 32:15.120
Let's see what we can find out.

32:15.120 --> 32:21.760
And you guys open up the door and now I want to paint a picture for you, Joe.

32:21.760 --> 32:24.720
When you're walking on this campus, it's fucking dead.

32:24.720 --> 32:26.200
Like it's evening.

32:26.200 --> 32:31.920
The sun is going down currently, but there is no one on this campus.

32:31.920 --> 32:38.180
It's just kind of, it's Saturday, you know, but it's still a college campus and there

32:38.180 --> 32:43.220
are holiday themed decorations obliterating this place.

32:43.220 --> 32:50.340
It's almost as if someone like vomited delicious holiday spirit all over for a block square

32:50.340 --> 32:52.260
of the city.

32:52.260 --> 32:56.180
It's filthy with holiday stuff.

32:56.180 --> 32:57.260
Just dirty with it.

32:57.260 --> 32:58.340
It's dirty with it.

32:58.340 --> 33:01.300
It's lousy with Christmas gear.

33:01.300 --> 33:08.860
It's like tiny Santa clauses everywhere and menorah, like blow up menorah, just like in

33:08.860 --> 33:11.240
a yard in front of one of the dorms.

33:11.240 --> 33:12.820
It's all over the place.

33:12.820 --> 33:13.820
It's great.

33:13.820 --> 33:14.820
If you love Christmas...

33:14.820 --> 33:16.180
How does Clark feel about Christmas?

33:16.180 --> 33:17.780
Does he have good memories?

33:17.780 --> 33:18.980
Oh shit.

33:18.980 --> 33:20.140
That's a good question.

33:20.140 --> 33:25.860
He probably has early good memories right up until his old parents didn't have Christmas

33:25.860 --> 33:26.980
for him no more.

33:26.980 --> 33:30.580
No more Christmas for old Clark Bishop, or young Clark Bishop.

33:30.580 --> 33:32.700
A young Clark Bishop still had no Christmas.

33:32.700 --> 33:34.020
Old young Clark Bishop.

33:34.020 --> 33:36.420
I think you nailed it.

33:36.420 --> 33:40.420
The technical name of your character at this point in the show.

33:40.420 --> 33:46.620
So when you guys walk in, the administration office is actually open, but inside all the

33:46.620 --> 33:50.500
lights are off and there's seemingly no one in here.

33:50.500 --> 33:52.340
Do we know what time of day it is right now?

33:52.340 --> 33:54.020
The sun is going down.

33:54.020 --> 33:55.460
It's about golden hour.

33:55.460 --> 33:57.820
It's yay around golden hour.

33:57.820 --> 33:59.060
Cool.

33:59.060 --> 34:00.060
Take a picture.

34:00.580 --> 34:01.580
It looks beautiful.

34:01.580 --> 34:02.580
Yeah, you and...

34:02.580 --> 34:03.580
It must be.

34:03.580 --> 34:06.220
You and Leon could take a great selfie right now.

34:06.220 --> 34:08.420
Leon, Leon, hang on a sec.

34:08.420 --> 34:09.420
Yeah.

34:09.420 --> 34:10.740
Gotta take a picture with you.

34:10.740 --> 34:13.380
Well, it's golden hour.

34:13.380 --> 34:16.780
We look great in front of all this Christmas stuff.

34:16.780 --> 34:22.740
Okay, so we're gonna go into where they have all the files.

34:22.740 --> 34:23.740
I don't know.

34:23.740 --> 34:25.340
I don't know how colleges work.

34:25.340 --> 34:27.300
And so let's just hop in there and see what happens.

34:27.420 --> 34:35.900
So you guys turn a corner in this unlit corridor and about halfway down the hallway, you see

34:35.900 --> 34:42.820
two figures and one of them, you just hear this like voice that is repeatedly just going

34:42.820 --> 34:43.820
like, please.

34:43.820 --> 34:50.420
Oh gosh, I would love to four if you just mumble some other words and is like letters

34:50.420 --> 34:54.460
and stuff and numbers and is like, please just hit me, hit me, hit me.

34:54.460 --> 34:55.460
Oh God.

34:55.500 --> 34:57.300
I'll have to do it to myself.

34:57.300 --> 34:59.460
He's talking to another figure that I can't see either.

34:59.460 --> 35:05.340
Yeah, and the other figure is just staring, just like standing there, not really moving.

35:05.340 --> 35:08.980
I nudge Leon, they're saying numbers.

35:08.980 --> 35:09.980
Is it the number stuff?

35:09.980 --> 35:10.980
I don't know.

35:10.980 --> 35:11.980
What do you want to do?

35:11.980 --> 35:12.980
Are they totally in our way?

35:12.980 --> 35:18.300
Well, and then you guys look over and there's a sign and it says like office and there's

35:18.300 --> 35:20.560
an arrow pointing directly toward them.

35:20.560 --> 35:22.540
We're both still wearing police uniforms, aren't we?

35:22.540 --> 35:23.540
Yeah.

35:23.540 --> 35:24.540
Sure, we'll approach them.

35:24.620 --> 35:26.140
We'll find the records office, right?

35:26.140 --> 35:27.140
Yeah, yeah.

35:27.140 --> 35:28.140
Perfect.

35:28.140 --> 35:30.140
I'll go get Justin from the other room.

35:48.140 --> 35:54.500
Luke, as Keith Vigna and John Lee Pettymore stand in the elevator, the elevator door closes

35:54.860 --> 36:02.220
and John Lee Pettymore pulls a Sharpie out and begins writing a sequence of numbers.

36:02.220 --> 36:04.200
I just watch him and see what they are.

36:04.200 --> 36:09.500
On the elevator wall and it is the numbers that you have seen him write and heard him

36:09.500 --> 36:10.500
chant.

36:10.500 --> 36:11.500
Right.

36:11.500 --> 36:12.500
Bruce Robin.

36:12.500 --> 36:13.500
Bruce Robin.

36:13.500 --> 36:16.360
The elevator door opens and you are on the third floor.

36:16.360 --> 36:22.140
It is also completely dark, the lights are all out and it is silent.

36:22.140 --> 36:24.900
I get my phone out to light the hallway.

36:24.900 --> 36:28.780
I guess I'll grab John and kind of just drag him behind me.

36:28.780 --> 36:34.040
Yeah, and when he can't write anymore he just starts murmuring those numbers over and over.

36:34.040 --> 36:37.220
Can I just like kind of slap him a little bit to see if he pops out of it?

36:37.220 --> 36:38.220
He does not.

36:38.220 --> 36:43.420
Okay, I'm looking for 328 on the placards on the walls and I'm leading John behind me.

36:43.420 --> 36:48.460
Yeah, you make it down there and you're at 328 Giff's house.

36:48.460 --> 36:49.460
Is it unlocked?

36:49.460 --> 36:50.460
It is.

36:50.460 --> 36:56.740
It is actually wide open as is the door across the hall, 330, which John told you was the

36:56.740 --> 36:57.740
show dorm.

36:57.740 --> 37:01.260
Before I go into 328 I'm going to look into 330, what does it look like?

37:01.260 --> 37:06.740
It looks like a very well presented dorm room for a college freshman.

37:06.740 --> 37:10.260
There's lots of, what did I say the mascot was?

37:10.260 --> 37:11.260
Venus Flytrap.

37:11.260 --> 37:18.220
There's lots of Venus Flytrap apparel and paraphernalia all throughout this city state

37:18.220 --> 37:20.740
dorm room with their logo all over.

37:20.740 --> 37:26.580
And in the middle of the room there is one out of place Casio keyboard with a sheet of

37:26.580 --> 37:27.700
music in front of it.

37:27.700 --> 37:30.340
I'll pull John in behind me and shut the door.

37:30.340 --> 37:31.340
Okay.

37:31.340 --> 37:32.740
That way he doesn't escape somehow.

37:32.740 --> 37:34.220
Are there numbers on the walls?

37:34.220 --> 37:35.740
There are, yes.

37:35.740 --> 37:39.420
There are numbers covering the walls, the floor, the ceiling, and literally like a desk.

37:39.420 --> 37:41.300
Was that also in the hallway and stuff?

37:41.300 --> 37:43.340
Yes, every single place that you've been so far.

37:43.340 --> 37:45.900
Okay, I'm going to go and see what the music is.

37:45.940 --> 37:50.780
A set of music notes written on the staff is pictures.

37:50.780 --> 37:57.300
And the pictures are seven eggs, a golf ball, a cat, a demon, and an egg.

37:57.300 --> 37:59.380
Are they like cartoons or?

37:59.380 --> 38:00.380
They are.

38:00.380 --> 38:07.940
And John Lee Pettymore begins writing once again on the back of the chair in this room.

38:07.940 --> 38:10.220
Bruce Robin in numbers.

38:10.220 --> 38:11.220
Is the keyboard on?

38:11.220 --> 38:12.220
It is.

38:12.220 --> 38:15.260
If I press on some keys is it just, what kind of sounds are they making?

38:15.700 --> 38:16.900
Oh no, it's jingle bells.

38:16.900 --> 38:20.700
It's like a, it's like ching, but it's a, I gotta, it's like cling.

38:20.700 --> 38:21.980
How do, how do bells sound?

38:21.980 --> 38:25.260
Like jingle bells are like chink, chink, chink, chink, chink, chink, chink, chink, chink.

38:25.260 --> 38:26.880
So it's a, it's a shunk.

38:26.880 --> 38:29.740
It's a shunk, but in a specific tone.

38:29.740 --> 38:30.740
So poke around.

38:30.740 --> 38:33.340
It's not like fart noises and like bleh, bleh, bleh.

38:33.340 --> 38:34.340
No, no.

38:34.340 --> 38:37.380
It's more like the, you know how they have like the choirs on there.

38:37.380 --> 38:39.660
They're like lah, lah, lah.

38:39.660 --> 38:44.940
I guess I'm going to take this sheet and put it in my pocket because I don't know what

38:44.940 --> 38:45.940
it means right now.

38:45.940 --> 38:46.940
Sure.

38:46.940 --> 38:50.340
I guess I'll take one more look around and then I guess go over to 328.

38:50.340 --> 38:51.340
Okay.

38:51.340 --> 38:55.100
So looking around, the only thing that you would notice is like there's a window in this

38:55.100 --> 39:01.740
dorm room and looking out you can see the whole campus from here and it too is completely,

39:01.740 --> 39:04.540
the whole campus is all festive.

39:04.540 --> 39:06.820
Like there are lights up everywhere.

39:06.820 --> 39:10.780
There's all these different decorations all over the place and in the middle of campus

39:10.780 --> 39:12.860
there's a large old bell tower.

39:12.860 --> 39:15.020
Is there a sheet for the dance in here?

39:15.020 --> 39:16.020
The ball?

39:16.020 --> 39:17.020
Like a flyer?

39:17.020 --> 39:18.020
Yes.

39:18.020 --> 39:19.020
Yeah.

39:19.020 --> 39:20.020
There are multiple flyers.

39:20.020 --> 39:23.180
Can I grab one and see like what is the like first clue or whatever on it?

39:23.180 --> 39:26.380
Actually on the back of one of them, they're written in Sharpie.

39:26.380 --> 39:34.460
It says one plus three plus nine plus and then it like has a bunch of math and then

39:34.460 --> 39:39.420
it says equals three 30 which you would know is the room number that you're standing in.

39:39.420 --> 39:41.460
What else does the like flyer say?

39:41.460 --> 39:45.260
The flyer just says it's got a bunch of like pictures.

39:45.260 --> 39:50.820
It's a lot of like illustration and design and then it says the annual jingle ball.

39:50.820 --> 39:57.540
Follow the scavenger hunt in order to make your way to the night of your holiday season.

39:57.540 --> 40:01.980
If I look around, is there anything that like looks like a scavenger hunt list or anything?

40:01.980 --> 40:02.980
Nope.

40:02.980 --> 40:03.980
Okay.

40:03.980 --> 40:05.200
I'm going to go head over to 328 then.

40:05.200 --> 40:06.200
In 328?

40:06.200 --> 40:07.200
With John and Toe.

40:07.200 --> 40:08.200
Yeah, John's with you.

40:08.200 --> 40:10.620
He's still doing the same dumb shit.

40:11.020 --> 40:14.860
In 328 you would see, it's a similar scene.

40:14.860 --> 40:21.260
There's shit written all over the place in all sorts of different materials and what

40:21.260 --> 40:26.580
you already learned about Harriet Marks is that she is a pro-union activist.

40:26.580 --> 40:33.820
There are pictures of her with different groups and different protests and marches and then

40:34.020 --> 40:42.020
her roommate, you find out her name, Amelia Locke, and she has pictures of her with different

40:42.020 --> 40:47.740
trophies and then you see actually she has all of her trophies displayed and they are

40:47.740 --> 40:56.720
for riddle competitions and scavenger hunt competitions and there is a space on her desk

40:56.720 --> 40:59.300
where a laptop would be.

40:59.300 --> 41:04.380
Like you see where her connecting cable, like her power cord would normally plug in.

41:04.380 --> 41:11.740
She's got the cord ready to plug in with one of those little DIY tricks with the binder clips.

41:11.740 --> 41:14.300
Right, right.

41:14.300 --> 41:19.860
And then you see like on the other side, the USB for her old school USB mouse is like clipped

41:19.860 --> 41:24.420
in on the other side for the USB port on the opposite side of this laptop that is not there.

41:24.420 --> 41:28.420
If I look around the room, is there any, can I find like a phone number or anything for

41:29.020 --> 41:32.140
Roll search for me.

41:32.140 --> 41:33.140
Eight on a forty.

41:33.140 --> 41:37.500
Uh, yes, you find phone numbers for both Harriet Marks and Amelia Clarke.

41:37.500 --> 41:38.500
Okay, I'm gonna...

41:38.500 --> 41:39.500
Sorry.

41:39.500 --> 41:40.500
Amelia Locke.

41:40.500 --> 41:41.500
Right, not Amelia Earhart.

41:41.500 --> 41:42.500
Correct.

41:42.500 --> 41:45.700
Uh, I'll write those down and I'm gonna give Amelia a call.

41:45.700 --> 41:46.700
Okay.

41:46.700 --> 41:47.700
Bring bring!

41:47.700 --> 41:48.700
And...

41:48.700 --> 41:49.700
Bring bring!

41:49.700 --> 41:50.700
That was Taylor.

41:50.700 --> 41:51.700
Thank you everyone.

41:51.700 --> 41:52.700
And it goes to voicemail.

41:52.700 --> 41:54.260
Voicemail box is not set up.

41:54.260 --> 41:55.900
Okay, put my phone away.

41:55.900 --> 41:57.540
What were all the trophies for?

41:57.660 --> 42:00.860
Oh, yeah, Brittle Competitions and Scavenger Hunt Competitions.

42:00.860 --> 42:08.340
With your correct search role, you actually find a handwritten note in the desk of Amelia

42:08.340 --> 42:13.860
Clarke, where she is talking about Amelia Locke, right?

42:13.860 --> 42:14.860
God damn it.

42:14.860 --> 42:17.240
What did I say that time, Clarke?

42:17.240 --> 42:18.700
Who is Amelia Clarke Bishop?

42:18.700 --> 42:20.140
I don't know.

42:20.140 --> 42:28.820
So Amelia Locke has a handwritten note in her desk where she is freehand writing her

42:28.820 --> 42:35.840
views on the suicide of her roommate, Harriet Marks.

42:35.840 --> 42:44.300
And basically nothing concrete, but she was very confused by the way it all went down.

42:44.340 --> 42:49.980
I did not think that Harriet was the type of person who would commit suicide and said

42:49.980 --> 42:54.740
that she had a plan to figure out what actually happened.

42:54.740 --> 42:56.020
Okay, interesting.

42:56.020 --> 42:57.500
Was it just on a scrap piece of paper?

42:57.500 --> 42:58.500
It was, yeah.

42:58.500 --> 43:01.780
Is there anything else in the desk that looks of interest?

43:01.780 --> 43:02.780
Dildo.

43:02.780 --> 43:04.700
I closed the desk.

43:04.700 --> 43:06.980
Kind of red-faced.

43:06.980 --> 43:11.180
Glad that Jon is kind of in that state so that I'm not more embarrassed than I would

43:11.180 --> 43:12.180
be.

43:12.180 --> 43:15.700
Is that like where Harriet's stuff was?

43:15.700 --> 43:17.700
Can I search around her desk and stuff?

43:17.700 --> 43:18.700
Absolutely.

43:18.700 --> 43:21.180
Go ahead and roll another search check for me.

43:21.180 --> 43:23.660
31 on a 40.

43:23.660 --> 43:29.600
Written on a sticky note and tucked away in between other papers, you find something that

43:29.600 --> 43:31.120
catches your eye.

43:31.120 --> 43:36.460
You find a sticky note that has a to-do list written on it.

43:36.460 --> 43:44.700
And the first thing says, research most unethical corporation in the city.

43:44.700 --> 43:50.700
And the second mark on the to-do list says, who is the overseer?

44:06.460 --> 44:36.300
How am I the only one trying to pull over How can I have enough drowning out of the

44:37.140 --> 44:38.140
house?

44:38.140 --> 44:39.140
No one knows.

44:39.140 --> 44:40.140
There's no one home.

44:40.140 --> 44:41.140
No one home.

44:41.140 --> 44:41.140
