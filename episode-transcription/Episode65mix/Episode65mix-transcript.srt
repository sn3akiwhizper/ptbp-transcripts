1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
Mike Smith here. Thank you again for joining us during our pledge drive this week.

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:14,320
You've just heard Under the Mulberry Tree with Mary Ann Kellans and we're about to get into

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:23,280
into a classic episode of our Smash It! Surprise, surprise Smash It!

4
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:31,620
Not everyone around here was rooting for this show but by god it's it's really

5
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:41,240
taken off. It's of course pretending to be people. An unlikely hit for 694.2

6
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:51,360
but but a hit nonetheless. I'm joined here today by Nyle Leota who...

7
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:58,680
Nyle Leota Oda. Nyle Leota I'm not gonna say the last that can't be your... Nyle Leota

8
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:08,320
Oda who who has come here and joined her. As you know me Mike Smith I've been at

9
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:13,680
this station for 35 years ever since I graduated from community college here in

10
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:22,360
contention and you know for a long time things were kind of done Mike's way but

11
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:28,960
Nyle has come in with with his uh you know his big city ideas. Listeners may

12
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:36,040
remember me from my show with my ex-wife over on KITI in the city. No one

13
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:43,200
listens to city radio. And I'm back here in contention under some interesting

14
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,360
circumstances but I've got a lot of great ideas to shake up the way things

15
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:55,760
we do here at 694.2 PTBP. Now you're from here right Nyle? I am yes. And you were you had a

16
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:01,640
you had a I understand a successful public radio career in the city. I did

17
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:09,640
indeed. Until you were... until I came back to contention to bring my fantastic pieces to

18
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:15,440
694.2 PTBP. You didn't you didn't have a successful marriage advice show with

19
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,800
your wife and then you got divorced. And then let's talk about how our listeners

20
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:27,560
can support us during this pledge drive week Mike. As as you know Nyle has

21
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:33,200
brought pretending to be people to our to our station and he's brought with it

22
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:41,120
a something called a Patreon. Patreon.com slash pretending pod. Thanks Nyle. You're

23
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:49,280
welcome Mike. You know Nyle public radio to me is it's responsible reporting

24
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,800
twice a day you've got your morning edition and you're all things considered

25
00:02:53,800 --> 00:03:00,320
and then in between you know in a small town you got a lot of time for a

26
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:06,960
traditional Celtic music for bluegrass for jazz we didn't have a lot of you

27
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:14,880
know fancy gunplay cop shows going on in this town before you got here but then

28
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,120
you brought us a little something called pretending to be people and people just

29
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:24,760
love it. Yes Mike. Don't they Mike? I believe that grass should be green like the color of money

30
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:29,480
speaking of which we've got a patreon at patreon.com slash pretending pod now I

31
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:34,080
want to say some new things to bring to that patreon don't you I do there's

32
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,720
currently a five dollar tier there and we've got some fantastic supporters at

33
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:44,560
that five dollar tier currently called honorary police officers I'd like to

34
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,520
give a quick shout out to three of those honorary police officers right now

35
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:55,760
Sasha S Brian C and Jasmine J thank you all so much for listening and

36
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:03,360
contributing to making sure that we can keep making PTBP at 694.2 with

37
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,200
pretending to be people thank you very much to everyone who has supported the

38
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:12,080
station and will continue to support it throughout this pledge drive so the

39
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:17,200
changes let's get into those are right off the bat here first off that five

40
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:23,320
dollar tier is no longer going to be called honorary police officers at five

41
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,760
dollars you'll still get the bonus content on a monthly basis but the name

42
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:35,600
has changed from honorary police officers to splashylvania fastpass

43
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,920
holder so if I'm getting this right everyone who was currently an honorary

44
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:47,800
police officer will be a splashylvania fastpass holder isn't that fun and I'm

45
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:56,800
also here to introduce not only the $10 tier but also a $15 tier and a $30 tier

46
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:04,480
but we're not stopping there we're also adding both a 50 and even a $100 tier to

47
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:09,760
keep this sinking boat afloat you think people are gonna pay $100 for your shitty

48
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:15,460
little again this is Nile Liotta Oda at 694.2 PTBP let's go ahead and

49
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:19,020
introduce this first clip from an old classic episode of pretending to be

50
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:24,300
people as you all know during pledge drives we like to play classic episodes

51
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:30,640
of your favorite public radio content and then interrupt them incessantly to

52
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:35,380
the point where they're essentially incoherent you just get a little bit and

53
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:40,860
then ten minutes of two assholes talking maybe just one and now let's cut to a

54
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:46,220
clip from an episode the listeners voted on as their favorite episode of

101
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:55,540
is an hour of bluegrass we won't get each week that brings us down to

102
00:09:55,540 --> 00:10:00,100
approximately 12 hours of bluegrass a day which I personally think is the

103
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:04,460
right amount of bluegrass for our listeners on all of the polls that we've

104
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:09,060
done yeah you haven't gone down to to Joe's coffee and ask the people there

105
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:12,820
what they're listening to in the morning the people at beans on beans know what

106
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:17,300

107

morning hotspot the donut hole is I haven't been downtown in 30 years since

108
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,940

110
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:38,900
laugh line there Nile pretending to public radio is a damn I'm sorry folks

111
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:44,460
public radio is a responsibility Nile it's not cheap entertainment it's not

112
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:51,380
it's not cops you know it's not America's most wanted it's jazz and

113
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:59,180
bluegrass damn it at least it isn't in this state it's okay intern if we could

114
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:04,620
get some tissues in here for Mike I'm fine I'm fine why don't you tell us

115
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:09,900
about your patreon tears absolutely I would be very excited to do that so

116
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:16,860
let's wipe away some of those te ars tears and get hyped up for some new TI

117
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:24,860
er s tears over on patreon.com slash pretending pod just to reiterate if you

118
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:31,420
are currently pledged at $5 a month the only change is your name as a

119
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:37,300
splashylvania fast pass holder you will still have access to the exclusive

120
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:43,060
monthly bonus content in the form of an audio episode what happened to the title

121
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:48,740
of honorary police officer you ask well we thought it was a better fit for the

122
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:56,540
rewards offered in our brand-new $10 tier now patrons who pledged $10 a month

123
00:11:56,540 --> 00:12:02,580
become honorary police officers and will not only have access to the exclusive

124
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:09,380
monthly bonus content but they will also have the opportunity to submit the name

125
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:17,420
and description of an NPC and a location these submissions will be drawn at

126
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:22,260
random and used in the show pretending to be people well now Nile normally we

127
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:27,720
don't agree but it makes a lot of sense for the people who get to participate to

128
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:32,540
be honorary police officers and for that to move to the $10 tier instead of the

129
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:37,140
$5 tier thank you so much for saying that Mike it's maybe the one good idea

130
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:42,700
you've ever had oh that brings joy to my heart and with joy I'd like to move on

131
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:49,660
and tell you about the $15 tier at patreon.com slash pretending pod people

132
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:58,740
who pledge $15 a month will join the den of sin that sounds inappropriate now

133
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:04,980
Nile tell me what that is people who pledge at the $15 level will have access

134
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:10,860
to a monthly live stream of the pretending to be people crew recording

135
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:17,700
their patreon bonus content and that will include a hangout after for about

136
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:22,140
an hour hour and a half who knows how long it could go and they'll be playing

137
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:29,300
games answering questions it's going to be a bonafide uncanny hootenanny a

138
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:34,220
binging shindig for those of you who want a behind-the-scenes look at the

139
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:39,020

160
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:36,620
think we need to go in this trailer I I go up to the back of the semi truck I

161
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:46,420
unlock it and before I open it up I hope it I open it up and then I step up

162
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:52,380
into it and go inside Jedediah takes a minute but he likes slowly is starting

163
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:57,100
to get up in and he looks back at you he's like I go over and give him a

164
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:01,180
boost and I'm getting up in there also following mm-hmm so the four of you

165
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:06,020
along with Jedediah blush and walk into this semi truck trailer and as soon as

166
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:11,860
all of you are in there the door behind you slam shut and there's a red light

167
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:15,900
that's coming from the opposite side of the trailer also this room that you're

168
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:20,580
in is square it's not the size of this in my truck trailer that you saw hold

169
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:28,220
on weren't we just in a oblong rectangle tractor trailer and now it's square what

170
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:33,180
the fuck I never encountered this kind of weirdness vigna you show up at this

171
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:38,260
goddamn job and suddenly everything goes funky well technically a ring tank

172
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:43,940
a prank take a right hey let's start yeah keep thinking I'm talking about we

173
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:48,100
got that long rectangular prism is still an oblong rectangular prism

174
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:53,100
technically a rectangle is a square I don't know ready to get a magic

175
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:56,980
Jeanette but you guys look up cool and it's completely dark in here except for

176
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:03,660
the red light coming down on all of you and Oh right above your heads you see

177
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:11,220
that there is what seems to be a gauge that is a red light slowly blinking and

178
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:16,300
each time it blinks it is lowering so it's like a battery power pack or

179
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:20,740
something that is lowering and lit in the room the only thing in this room is

180
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:28,220
a pedestal with a big red button on top and the light above you with each blink

181
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:47,740
is going okay I ripped the gauge out of the year you all remember gauging I was

182
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:52,380
at a show one time and I was standing right behind this dude who had huge

183
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:58,300
gauges and this kid just walked up with a padlock and just hooked it on this

184
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:05,580
dude's ear and ran away and the guy just chased him I will fill you in on this

185
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:13,820
they're not called gauges the gauge is the size of them yeah we all fucking know

186
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:19,860
Keith Vigna pulls out his sidearm and shoots the thing that's beeping

187
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:23,980
immediately all of your ears start ringing and nothing in the room

188
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:28,740
lightwise has changed the meter is still lowering but none of you can hear

189
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:34,420
anything as tinnitus takes over son of a bitch big no fuck don't fire your

190
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:38,340

192
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:56,500

193
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:02,100
bar lights all the way back up and then continues to beep and is making its way

194
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:07,300
back down I press the button again it goes right back up to the top and

195
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:18,220
continues to go down anymore let me get onto this I push the button Barry

200
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:44,940
beeping well what if hey guys what if we let the button go down to the bottom and

201
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:48,860
instead of some of the bad happenings the door opens Jedidiah is at the

202
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:55,500
back door just trying to open it back up and he's like Jedidiah is this not your

203
00:19:55,500 --> 00:20:02,560
trailer yeah so it is but you forgot okay well Clark is gonna go look at the

204
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:06,440
gauge more closely is it is it demarcated in any way is it is that the

205
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:09,520
right word demarcated does it have markings on it that indicate levels or

206
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:15,440
numbers or anything that's a great word Joe no it is simply just like just let

207
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:21,000
up the lights go back to the top and did you say it was coming out of the ceiling

208
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,320
yes it's coming out of the ceiling can I follow it to the top and see if it runs

209
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:34,120
to anything like a like a like a conduit go ahead and roll search it was

210
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:38,840
it was coming out of the ceiling but then I chased it in a rant fail 81 on a

211
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:44,480
20 as you're like trying to find some sort of connection between the two you

212
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:49,760
kind of trip backwards in the mostly darkness and press the button again

213
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:54,240
attaboy Clark that's what I was just trying to make sure want to make sure we

214
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,160
kept the button pressed that's all I was doing

215
00:20:56,160 --> 00:21:00,360
Keith Vigna looks around is there anything in this trailer no it is

216
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:06,040
completely empty except for the big red button and five idiots Keith Keith you

217

218
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,560

219
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:18,080

220
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:22,180
to press the button but I do want to make a good impression on my new

221
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:29,060
co-workers yeah so I go up to the button and I have my hand about like a

222
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:37,780
couple inches away from it and I go and just press it a bunch of times each time

223
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:41,580
it beeps and each time light goes right back to the top Keith we said you could

224
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:45,540
press the button once can I see anything else in this room if I maybe go past the

225
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:49,680
button as you pass the button you're not sure if you walking over there triggered

226
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:57,720
this or if it just started but you feel your socks are wet and looking down you

227
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:02,960
can't quite tell if it's the red from the light or whether the liquid is red

228
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:14,840
that is slowly rising in this room and you're all stepping in a red viscous

229

liquid no hell welcome back welcome back to six nine four point two PT BP why

235
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:14,000
Mike it's good to see ya obviously who Floyd now it's probably a little earlier

236
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:17,800
than you're used to being here I reckon there's a whole bunch of your audience

237
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:21,960
that don't even know who I am haha yeah hey you know they tend to they

238
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:26,720
tend to they tend to hit the sack early it can get pretty lonely here being here

239
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,720
that late I hear you guys pitter-pattering outside the door but

240
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:33,440
nobody ever comes in to say hey we're not here when you're here I've literally

241
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:42,200
never been here oh I hear you're no easy it's very anti public radio ethos the

242
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,560
spirit of the effort we're all putting into this but Niles only here from nine

243
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:50,480
to five well I guess it's the janitor crew or something the janitor crew I

244
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,960
believe we had to cut due to costs so the trash is always empty every time I'm

245
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,120
in here I'll just figure that's the janitor crew and the floors are all

246
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:02,020
sopping wet and oh well you can tell they're brushing their mops against the

247
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:05,720
walls there's scratches all over the walls I try and if I see him

248
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:09,880
exterminators must have been slacking on the job or something I don't what do you

249
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:14,240
mean like a creatures getting in at night or it's here all the time you're

250
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,640
the only creature that gets in here at night buddy from the hours of seven to

251
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,840
nine obviously they do call me the creature I think you should have gotten

252
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:28,080
the memo that we do no longer have trash service you are supposed to be taking

253
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,940
your own trash out each night I haven't I haven't been is but it's so well it's

254
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:35,760

that that's got a that's got a strong sound to it I like I like that fella now

278
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:04,680
Floyd you were talking about something strange going on here in the station do

279
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:08,480
you want to elaborate on that for our listeners here well it just seems to me

280
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:15,040
we don't want Mike if you interrupt him for once do we want listeners knowing

281
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:19,560
about I think that the listeners would be very glad to know that they are every

282
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:25,600
dollar you donate to this station will go to an unhaunted radio station it's

283
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:30,560
not haunted like people are saying well we might be able to afford a janitorial

284
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:35,000
staff if we get enough money and some of these issues might be resolved you said

285
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,880
the floors were wet it's it's told me for a loop here that you're telling me

286
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:43,920
that the the janitors are not doing their jobs lately because they're gone

287
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:48,200
there we we had to fire them because of no money but it's not haunted but

288
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,840
everything is so it's like they spilled their mop buckets in some of the carpets

289
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:57,200
here and there and the floors are shiny and bright like they've been picked

290
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:04,600
clean you are a late-night DJ maybe some of your you know exuberant habits

291
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:08,320
between the hours of seven and nine

292
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:15,840
that's the tornado drill that's just the the local tornado drill sirens those

293
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:19,560
happen randomly throughout the day at all times that did not sound like a

294
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:26,680
no no no no now you see at 8 a.m. is it on top of the station they do the

295
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:31,920
tornado siren drills at Wednesdays at 8 a.m. and then also just randomly

296
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:37,000
throughout the week and now back to our classic fan favorite episode of

297
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,640
pretending to be people entitled can I just say before before we get back to

298
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:47,400
your nonsense it is unconscionable to suggest that the radio station is

299
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:52,240
haunted by any kind of those kinds of assumptions might be your downfall Mike

300
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:57,320
back to the episode Keith's first day

301
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:04,600
Lindsay Manstein looks down the barrel of their gun at this little green man

302
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:10,240
Ames pulls the trigger roll firearms

303
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:16,120
hell yeah that's a crit success baby no way oh shit okay roll 2d 10 for damage

304
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:27,640
the same thing you just rolled fuck off I got another another crit success 22

305
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:34,160
22 so actually we're poor damage is weirdly enough when you fire a bullet

306
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:40,560
into this tiny little green man you just obliterate him but looking out all

307
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:47,680
around the first Church of contention sanctuary you see you've got 45 more to

308
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:54,440
go exactly I look over at Keith big na big na sack up let's do this as soon as

309
00:29:54,440 --> 00:30:00,600
I hear that I pull the shotgun off of my back

310
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:08,800
you fight four times yeah okay into the crowd of alien okay have Keith roll

311
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:17,920
firearms at a negative negative 40 I've got a 70 within that's a fail all right

312
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:22,720
so you just blast in and they're all like literally like jumping and four of

313
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:27,960
them that you aim at actually each time you aim at one they jump on to the top

314
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:32,120
head of the one next to them and then like the next one you aim at jumps on

315
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:36,400
top of the second one and they create this like wizard staff of small green

316
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:41,920
alien man so I had stand I hit none of them and each time they jump on top of

317
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:46,800
each other they're like and then when they're all on top they like pogo stick

318
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:56,640
away I have unloaded my shotgun and hit no one and therefore it's no longer your

319
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:03,720
turn and so yeah I take my time to put some more shotgun shells and not pay

320
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:07,360
attention to where they're going John Lee Pettymore what are you doing John

321
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:13,560
gets down on one knee oh yeah and he he takes his he takes his gun and he he

322
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:19,680
aims his service pistol at each one of those four little fucking brains on that

323
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:25,000
pogo stick and he's like die you alien scum and he pulls the trigger

324
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:34,360
firearms baby that's a crit success holy shit okay that'll take out three of

325
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:39,840
them so as they're like pogoing away from you you take out the top three and

326
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:46,400
all of their like green splatter just like falls into the baptism pool at the

327
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:51,480
top of the like sanctuary on the other side of the podium where every Sunday

328
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:58,680
pastor Adam Kane gives his sermons and with that it is all of the aliens turn

329
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:07,000
and they all start at the same time and it grows and grows and the power sends a

330
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,840
sound wave like a shock through all of your bodies I need everyone to roll

331
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:22,240
power I pass a 6 on a 60 oh nice I pass a 12 on a 50 well done I pass a 28 on a

332
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:31,320
65 rare I fail a 58 on a 50 medium rare you dumb dumb so in that exact moment

333
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:38,600
Lindsey Manstein you feel your brain begin to compress and like pulse you

334
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:47,600
lose let's roll of dice six damage as you feel liquid come out of your left

dripping from your ears I look at Clark and I'm like Clark I don't feel so good

337
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:05,200
Clark Bishop it's your turn I want to line up a shot that takes out as many of

338
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:10,680
them in a row as I can straight through these squishy gringo I like that like

339
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:14,320
they're still stacked on top of each other not all of the room is full of

340
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:22,920
these guys yeah full of little fellas angles all right so roll intelligence to

341

342
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:39,680
firearms straight up and down to take out as many of them as possible I don't

343
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:44,520
know I think it kind of added to the whole podcast

344
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:55,840
Zach that's a 22 oh my god he's not even lying about our special issue living in

345
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:04,000
some sort of weird gravity in this room like okay roll 2d 10 a 9 and a 3 holy

346
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,120
shit okay so 12 knock out three of them so you've got this lineup of three of

347
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:14,260
them in your sights there's like one on a pew one on the lectern and then one

348
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:18,720
hanging from a the Christian flag you know have you guys ever seen the

349
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:24,040
Christian flag I've seen the methodist flag not the Christian flag every church

350
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:28,400
that I like went to growing up had the American flag right next to the

351
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:34,840
Christian flag a very very strange choice of idols so one is hanging down

352
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:40,040
and the flag just bus and like it's almost like a like an ink package and

353
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:45,080
ink cartridge from like a money bag that you would steal a robbing and it just

354
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:51,700
banking bus this like green guck all over the flag and as soon as the flag

355
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:57,220
has been tarnished you see the stained glass at the very front of the sanctuary

356
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:04,700
just erupts into tiny tiny little particles of different colored glass all

357
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:10,580
making up some fucked up white Jesus holding a lamb and it just dissipates

358
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:17,980
into nothing as this massive version of these tiny little green men that you've

359
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:23,580
seen all over here this one stands at least two stories tall and it lowers its

360
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:31,580
head to crawl into the sanctuary of the first church of contention

361
