0	8760	What is up my people, it is your friendly neighborhood DJ Wolf the dog.
8760	16680	As always we are coming at you live and uncut from 694.2 PTPP contentions latest and greatest
16680	18560	radio station.
18560	23160	Wolf is here with some hot scoops of news.
23160	27320	Now the county said that the body from the junkyard had the organs of someone who died
27320	32840	200 years ago but the skin and hair of someone who died yesterday.
32840	38120	Somebody get Ripley's Believe It or Not on the line because that is some unbelievable
38120	39120	shit.
39120	44400	Charles, a drunk man and friend of the missing John Peters went to the police station to
44400	49120	get answers before pulling a gun and running away upon hearing the sound of a car crash
49120	50400	in the parking lot.
50400	58280	Sounds like it is about to hit the fan and the it is shit my babies.
58280	61240	Kathy Piston shot Keith Vigna in the foot.
61240	65680	He snooped around her property until trying to stow away on her school bus full of homeless
65680	66680	folks.
66680	69600	He heard himself falling from the emergency hatch in the back.
69600	73880	Now sounds like that's what you get for being a damn snoop.
73880	78660	Now John Lee Patymore seems to believe some hooded robot man gave him a message.
78660	82260	Now we've all had a dream like that before am I right fellas.
82260	83820	Now about that crash.
83820	88900	Seems to have been a stolen black SUV t-boning George Piston's truck while it was parked
88900	90580	in the police station lot.
90580	93820	Now how drunk you gotta be to hit a parked car?
93820	99460	Now I want y'all to tell your mama, tell your papa, there's a new band in town and it is
99460	103380	kudzu with no backbone.
129460	135740	Keith Vigna give me a drive roll at a minus 20.
135740	138180	Hell yeah I love that.
138180	140580	Oh I passed a 13 on a 20.
140580	148620	You come sliding out drift style into the county road that the black SUV is on and you
148620	155840	are immediately in pursuit alongside two other police cruisers and the black SUV is taking
155840	163120	off and takes a left into the entrance for the water park splashylvania.
163120	168400	So you guys pull up to the entrance of the vampire themed water park and see a large
168400	174420	wooden sign that reads splashylvania in all caps above a cartooned vampire wearing floral
174420	176960	swimming trunks and riding a surfboard.
176960	183500	A caption bubble extends from the summertime villain's mouth that says you'll want to splash
183500	188780	your buds.
188780	194980	And below this delightful signage is a black SUV that is crashed into the turnstiles at
194980	195980	the entrance.
195980	197660	What do you guys want to do?
197660	199380	Can we tell if it is occupied?
199380	204500	Doors on the left side on the driver's side are both open and there seems to be no one
204500	205500	in the SUV.
205500	208900	I want to pull up and check out what's inside of the SUV.
208900	212920	I'd pull up in a like whatever the formation would be to keep the car pinned if it were
212920	214320	to suddenly back up.
214320	215320	Awesome.
215320	216320	Same.
216320	219800	Approaching the black SUV when you look inside there doesn't seem to be much in it.
219800	221640	It's a pretty clean car.
221640	226080	There are no people inside this black SUV.
226080	227840	But there's animals and things?
227840	228840	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
228840	229840	Tons of animals.
229840	231320	There's squirrels everywhere.
231320	232320	And a dragon.
232320	233320	Objects.
233320	234320	There's no people.
234320	236200	There's a dragon.
236200	237200	Roll initiative.
237200	239680	There's some paper towels.
239680	241680	Dragons are spooky.
242680	244680	Thanks mom.
244680	245680	Thanks mom.
245680	246680	Thanks mom.
246680	252080	So walking into the empty park you see signs for a couple different rides.
252080	258880	There is the Two Fanged Plunge, Holy Water Falls, and a ride called The Stake, which
258880	264480	is a log flume ride but the front of the boat is sharpened and at the bottom of the ride's
264480	268680	steep drop there is a massive ornate heart the riders float through.
268680	269680	Awesome.
269680	270680	That's badass.
270680	277800	Yeah, I mean I know we're here to do a job but I fucking love the Stake.
277800	283000	Go ahead and roll alertness for me.
283000	284000	Quit fail.
284000	285000	I pass.
285000	286000	47 on a 70.
286000	287000	Pass with 4.
287000	288000	I got an 88.
288000	289000	Nice.
289000	296360	Alright, so John and Clark, the two of you see all the villains while Keith walks over
296360	297360	his shoelaces.
297360	298360	Oh wait.
299040	300960	Yeah, if you want to describe what you're doing.
300960	304160	Well, I'm going to switch out the dice first off.
304160	310160	Second off, yeah, I got shot in the foot and so I'm going to hop it on one leg.
310160	312160	God damn.
312160	314160	Kathy shot me in the foot.
314160	315160	Why?
315160	317160	Oh, I have a lot to tell you.
317160	319160	Can it wait?
319160	323160	It can wait but it's pretty important but I'll let you know later.
323160	327160	Well, I guess Clark and I will pursue on foot but...
327160	328160	I'll hop behind.
328160	333160	Okay, so the two of you would see across the park, it's a really small water park, but
333160	340760	across it you see standing atop the two-fanged plunge is Julie Maxwell in a hospital gown
340760	344560	with a terrified Leo piston kneeling in front of her.
344560	350080	Leo is kneeling at the top of the water slide where a rider would wait impatiently for a
350080	355880	tanned teen to give them the green light and Julie Maxwell cackles into the night sky and
355880	367720	screeches the world is not our own and little else matters except for the black shiny devil
367720	374700	and the underground temple from which it shall rise but if there's a tiny chance that justice
374700	382920	matters then my sister deserves this fat fuck to bleed out and die and she fires and you
382920	388480	see a spray of red explode out of Leo piston's stomach and his body slumps forward and begins
388480	396240	sliding down the steep yellow slide, a streak of red trailing, his flinching body roll sanity.
396240	398680	I failed.
398680	400560	I passed with a one.
400560	401560	Is that?
401560	402560	Oh, that's a crit.
402560	403560	Yeah, yeah.
403560	404560	I passed with a six.
404560	406960	That means everyone who's your friend gains one.
406960	408240	No, I failed.
408240	411760	Okay, so if you succeed, you lose no sanity.
411760	414640	If you failed, you lose one sanity.
414640	415640	What do you guys do?
415640	416640	Open fire on Julie.
416640	417640	I think that's what...
417640	418640	She just shot a dude.
418640	419640	I think she's going down.
419640	420640	Yeah.
420640	421640	Okay.
421640	422640	Roll firearms, everybody.
422640	423640	21.
423640	424640	On a 60.
424640	425640	Holy fuck.
425640	426640	I rolled a one again.
426640	427640	Oh my God.
427640	428640	Holy shit.
428640	436200	Before any of us get our guns out, Clark has just shot her right through the eye.
436200	437200	Yeah.
437360	439080	Do you want to narrate it or...
439080	440840	I mean, it's that.
440840	447820	As soon as that blood spray hits, I'm already efficiently out, gun drawn with a pistol from
447820	448820	this far away.
448820	449820	Yeah.
449820	451640	Just took a luck shot and nailed her.
451640	456920	Went right through her left eye and the back of her head just explodes through.
456920	457920	A reflex.
457920	464520	Clark, obviously, any loss of life is regrettable and not what we want, but that's not the outcome
464520	469100	we desire, but that was tight as fuck.
469100	479640	The body of Julie Maxwell also falls onto the slide and begins sliding down the two-fanged
479640	480640	point.
483640	484640	Oh no.
484640	493760	And as her body slides to the bottom of the slide where Leo Piston's body also sits, you
493760	503180	see the bodies of both Julie Maxwell and Leo Piston are picked up and slammed into
503180	508520	the ground repeatedly and at an absurd rate by some unseen force.
508520	513840	And then, as if they were never there at all, their bodies are gone.
513840	514840	Roll Sanity.
518280	519280	Crit success.
519280	520280	Nice.
520280	521280	Fail.
521280	522280	I pass.
522800	523800	I don't know how though.
523800	524800	Yeah, no.
524800	529160	That was honestly one of the most, just Terry and you say that, was one of the more fucked
529160	532360	up things I've heard in Delta Green.
532360	534880	I don't know how to explain being okay with seeing that.
534880	535880	Exactly.
535880	538200	Visualizing that, there's no way you come out of that all right.
538200	545800	John Lee Pettymore, you are going to lose one sanity, but gain some terrifying insight.
545800	547560	And who failed?
547560	548560	I did.
548560	549560	Keith Wigner failed.
549560	550560	Clark.
550560	551560	Just a regular pass.
551960	557360	So, Clark, you were going to roll one D4 and you lose four sanity.
557360	560080	Keith Wigner, I need you to roll a D4 as well.
560080	561080	One.
561080	567520	One plus four is five and you lose five sanity.
567520	572680	I need Joe and Thomas to leave the room.
572680	573680	No.
573680	576680	Get the fuck out.
576680	577680	Luke?
577680	578680	Who?
579680	580680	Luke?
580680	581680	Who?
581680	583680	Keith Wigner.
583680	591360	Covering the ground where Julie Maxwell and Leo Piston's bodies just existed, there is
591360	598000	now black, shiny, viscous sludge.
598000	607040	Seemingly inside this muck is the thrashing bodies of Julie Maxwell and Leo Piston.
607040	613880	Their hands reach out, trying to escape this thing that has trapped them, but their struggle
613880	616080	does not last long.
616080	623840	Their limbs seem to fold into this ooze, becoming one with the sentient mass of goop that is
623840	627280	now sliding across the ground toward you.
627280	630640	What do you do?
630640	633000	I hop away.
633960	636960	I forgot your fucking name.
636960	637960	Okay.
637960	638960	Perfect.
638960	645400	I literally 180 and just start pogo sticking my way towards my car.
645400	646400	Okay.
646400	648720	Do you say anything to the other two?
648720	651320	I just, I scream at the top of my lungs.
651320	654960	We'll wait for them to come back.
654960	659760	Keith Wigner, if you would like to describe your actions.
659760	660760	And I run off.
660760	661760	I hop off.
662400	666760	He begins hopping as fast as he can in the opposite direction.
666760	669600	Did he just Wile E. Coyote out here?
669600	679760	That's never, I mean, that's aside, that's the Wile E. Coyote sound.
679760	683680	I've never seen a one footed man move so quickly.
683680	688260	Well, it seems like Keith might need a mental health day, Clark.
688260	691680	So he takes off running, screaming, hopping, hopping, hopping, screaming.
692680	697320	I'm probably still a little bit in shock that I just shot and killed her and then saw that
697320	698320	crazy shit.
698320	701280	I don't know if I even notice him running off.
701280	704280	I cautiously approached the pool where they landed.
704280	705520	Yeah, I'm with him.
705520	709600	Did anything fall out of their pockets while their bodies were being?
709600	711640	Is there gore on the sidewalk?
711640	712640	Yes.
712640	713640	Yeah.
713640	714640	Yeah.
714640	719700	Blood and viscera is sitting at the bottom of where like the pool of water that you splash
719740	724700	into at the bottom of a water slide is, there's now a pool of blood.
724700	725700	Jesus.
725700	728460	Well, it's not great.
728460	730460	What the, what the fuck?
730460	736460	You ever, you ever, you ever seen anything like that before?
736460	737460	Yes.
737460	738460	I'm sorry.
738460	739460	No.
739460	741700	Where'd, where'd the bodies go?
741700	743260	Your guess is as good as mine, Clark.
743260	746260	I look up.
746820	752820	Listen, frankly, none of this seemed too weird to me.
752820	759180	I've inexplicably kept a cool and level head throughout all this.
759180	764660	John, I think you were rationalizing in your head a way for this to be, well, some air
764660	772380	currents came up from the, uh, the subterranean waterways underneath the park.
772380	776820	They got caught, uh, you know, above a great kind of like, you know, Marilyn Monroe's
776820	783260	score score score, Marilyn Monroe's skirt, how it got thrown up in the air by that.
783260	784260	Yeah.
784260	785260	By that old great.
785260	787500	I think something like that happened here repeatedly with two bodies.
787500	788500	That makes sense.
788500	789500	Of course.
789500	790500	It makes sense.
790500	791500	Yeah.
791500	796500	Looking back, you guys see Keith is still hopping as fast as he can and he is finally
796500	798140	bouncing dot in the distance.
798140	800780	He's, he's, he's out of the spot by now.
800780	801780	I holler.
802180	803180	Hey Keith!
803180	804180	Hey Keith!
804180	805180	No!
805180	810180	Do you guys not see that shit?
810180	813180	Uh, what do, uh, what do you guys do?
813180	816680	That's a good question.
816680	821620	I think we call, let's just jump right back into some like real low key investigation.
821620	822620	The FBI.
822620	823620	Yeah.
823620	825620	Well, this is a pickle.
825620	831020	I'm going to follow up on that weird camera.
831020	832020	You got it.
832020	833020	You got everything here.
833020	842020	Is there a way to call the president?
842020	847300	As you guys walk back to your police cruisers, uh, the SUV is still sitting there.
847300	853140	And John, as you, um, as you get to your car, uh, you notice that real quick, we shut the
853140	855020	water park down for the day.
855020	856020	Oh yeah.
856020	857020	Yeah.
857020	859460	And you're probably going to call Tim and have him come out.
859860	862980	I think this is definitely federal.
862980	863980	You want me to go higher?
863980	864980	It's Ray.
864980	865980	It's Ray.
865980	867380	No, it's always been Tim.
867380	868380	Yeah.
868380	869380	Ray.
869380	872420	As far as I recall, it's always been Tim.
872420	873420	Yeah.
873420	875660	The guy who does all the stuff for you, like.
875660	876660	That's Tim?
876660	877660	Yeah.
877660	878660	He's Tim now.
878660	879660	Well, it's always been Tim.
879660	880660	It's always been Tim.
880660	881660	Of course it has.
881660	882660	Yes, it always has been.
882660	883660	Cool.
883660	884660	Glad we're all on the same page.
884860	890620	I'm sitting in my cruiser, just like ghost white, staring ahead, sweating.
890620	892740	Have you sought medical attention for your foot yet?
892740	898140	Okay guys, I got to go over a few things with you before we part ways.
898140	902900	Are you leaving the force?
902900	906540	So maybe after today.
906540	909540	So my foot, I probably do need to get this looked at.
909540	913940	Kathy shot me as I was Kathy piston, George's wife.
913940	917980	As I was approaching the house, I thought that they were all, they were gone, but she
917980	919260	was still there.
919260	921500	She shot me in the foot, not realizing it was me.
921500	923580	I went into the farmhouse.
923580	925120	She wrapped my foot up for the time being.
925120	928980	It's okay, but it hurts real bad and I'll probably bleed through these bandages pretty
928980	929980	quick.
929980	933440	But anyway, after she shot me and wrapped me up, she gave me some coffee and then her
933440	936260	alarm went off and she had, she just left.
936260	938500	And so I snooped around, I looked through the farmhouse.
938500	942740	I looked through the small farmhouse that was there that Leo lives in and the barn and
942740	947000	I didn't find anything in any of those classic vigna.
947000	952200	As I was walking to the second house, I saw the big warehouse that they have where all
952200	953200	the pigs are.
953200	955580	I saw that door was open and I saw it close.
955580	960320	And so after I looked in the barn, there were some school buses parked next to the warehouse
960320	965240	and I snuck into one of those school buses to see who came out of the warehouse.
965240	966700	I assumed it was Kathy.
966700	970900	She and about a hundred homeless people got on the bus that I was on, crammed in there
970900	972100	and started driving off.
972100	973100	I freaked out.
973100	980160	I opened up the back door, fell out of it and hopped my way back to the cruiser.
980160	982220	And that's when I ran into you guys.
982220	983220	Holy shit.
983220	984220	Yeah.
984220	985220	It seemed like, Oh wow.
985220	989220	Were they talking?
989220	993460	I was more concerned with not being on that bus anymore because Kathy didn't seem to really
993460	994460	want me around.
994460	997440	Also, I told her I had a warrant, which she, she believed.
997440	1000060	So I don't think we're gonna have to deal with that anytime soon.
1001020	1002420	How do you know they were homeless?
1002420	1003420	Oh yeah.
1003420	1005480	Oh, they were, they were homeless.
1005480	1006780	They weren't wearing suits.
1006780	1007780	They weren't.
1007780	1008780	Yeah.
1008780	1009780	Yeah.
1009780	1013860	Uh, it didn't smell like pig shit, but it didn't smell not like big shit.
1013860	1014860	So yeah.
1014860	1017180	The immediate thought of get me the hell off this bus.
1017180	1020640	And then as soon as I fell out of the bus, I thought, well, maybe I should have stayed
1020640	1023060	to see where they were going, but they didn't seem to notice me.
1023060	1024140	I was hiding in the back.
1024140	1030040	And so yeah, I hopped my way back to the cruiser and here we are also, uh, did you guys not
1030040	1031920	see what I saw in there?
1031920	1034040	Well, John's got to get theory on that.
1034040	1037480	It was currents of air from the underground.
1037480	1043560	That's a, that's a great theory, but I saw black viscous goo with Leo and, and Julie
1043560	1048800	trying to crawl out of it until it sucked them in and, and they disappeared.
1048800	1050280	You been trying any mushrooms?
1050280	1052680	I haven't, but I probably lost a lot of blood.
1052680	1056160	I put my hand to his forehead and feeling for fever.
1056160	1057200	Ice cold.
1057200	1058560	He's hallucinating.
1058560	1059560	I swear to God.
1059560	1062200	That's why I screamed and hopped off guys.
1062200	1063200	You didn't see that?
1063200	1064200	No, no.
1064200	1065200	Oh God.
1065200	1069760	I saw a very explainable natural phenomenon that happens all the time.
1069760	1070760	I got a theory.
1070760	1071840	I got a theory here.
1071840	1077520	You know how, uh, that body we've originally found was blunt force trauma on the, on one
1077520	1080520	side.
1080520	1085800	That shit that happened to them probably happened to happen to her or it, whatever that body
1085800	1086800	was.
1086840	1090600	I understand that there have been two incidences of airborne.
1090600	1094800	We need to investigate underground air flow.
1094800	1096220	Perhaps no one is safe.
1096220	1101160	When I was getting set up back at the station for an interview, we got a call in from the
1101160	1106000	medical examiner about that body out there in the junkyard.
1106000	1107000	It's real weird.
1107000	1111400	I opened my car door and just throw up out of the side of it and then continue listening
1111400	1112400	to you.
1112400	1118640	The sides of it were that of a body that's been dead for a hundred, 200 years, 200 years,
1118640	1124720	but the skin and hair was deceased as of December 1st yet another perfectly explainable.
1124720	1129040	I just figured they did something wrong in the testing that, or, but honestly you see
1129040	1130120	it all the time.
1130120	1132160	Ancient innards.
1132160	1133720	It just happens to some folks.
1133720	1136600	You get all rotted in there because of your lifestyle choice.
1136600	1141640	I think something is up that we alcohol, which we have never seen before tobacco.
1141640	1143200	So I need to go to the hospital.
1143200	1147120	Did one of you guys hear the stuff that Julie was saying up there?
1147120	1148840	Yeah, I got it down pretty well.
1148840	1150840	It sounded something like this.
1150840	1153360	Oh shit.
1153360	1156160	Oh, Google docs.
1156160	1158120	Where are you at?
1158120	1163080	No, this is not what it, no, that's not ringing any bells.
1163080	1167680	You would remember her so clearly.
1167680	1175680	The world is not our own and little else matters except for the black shiny devil and
1175680	1179920	the underground temple from which it shall rise.
1179920	1186280	But if there's a tiny chance that justice matters, then my sister deserves this fat
1186280	1188960	fuck to bleed out and die.
1188960	1192240	This seems pretty shut and dry to me.
1192240	1197300	You remember that Polaroid you found that had a shiny black thing in it.
1197300	1201880	And according to Vigna, like shiny black goo, slam these people into the ground.
1201880	1204820	So I think you're just drawn at straws here.
1204820	1207840	That seems entirely coincidental.
1207840	1210260	The world is, the world is full of black goos.
1210260	1216220	There's oil, there's dark soup, there's yeah, yeah, yeah.
1216220	1217220	Dark, dark soup.
1217220	1218980	You're writing this off too quickly.
1218980	1220460	No, it was dark soup.
1220460	1222180	He's right.
1222180	1227520	So as, as you bring up the camera, you were kind of standing in between Vigna's cruiser
1227520	1233180	and your own and you kind of take a look into yours and the camera that you found in Joey
1233180	1237740	Maxwell's car, which is in the back of your police cruiser, obviously that red light is
1237740	1241140	no longer on, but the green light is.
1241140	1242140	It's turn.
1242140	1243140	I'd like to inspect the camera.
1243140	1248140	Has it taken a picture or no, the only thing that's different is that it's green light
1248140	1249140	instead of red light.
1249140	1250140	Yeah.
1250140	1251980	I want to look through it and then I also, I want to feed it a blank Polaroid.
1251980	1253620	Let's see if we'll take a shot.
1253620	1257060	So it's actually got the paper like already internally in it.
1257060	1258060	Cool.
1258060	1259060	I'd take a picture.
1259060	1260060	Okay.
1260060	1261060	Of the water.
1261060	1262060	What was it?
1262060	1263060	Two fangs?
1263060	1264060	That was the steak.
1264060	1265060	No, no, no.
1265060	1266060	I thought that's where they, she plunged off two fangs.
1266060	1267060	Okay.
1267060	1268060	One went down one thing.
1268060	1269060	The other went down the other.
1269060	1270060	Yeah.
1270060	1271060	Real fast.
1271060	1277420	Well, I was going to say, does, do any of our cruisers have dash cams or confessionals?
1277420	1279020	You would have dash cams for sure.
1279020	1279900	Yeah.
1279900	1282540	I'm getting into my cruiser and trying to pull up the footage of what all just happened.
1282540	1289020	So you wouldn't be able to actually see, well, luck, real luck pass.
1289020	1293880	You would get a very, very slight far away view.
1293880	1298900	You would see the death of Julie Maxwell as well as the death of Leo piston.
1298900	1299900	Great shot.
1299900	1304740	Um, and then you would probably, I feel like the, the shot would be obfuscated.
1304740	1307260	Is that the word obfuscated?
1307260	1313980	Yeah, obfuscated by attractions and signage of all sorts, but you would see on the camera
1313980	1317740	their bodies at the top peak moving around.
1317740	1318740	Cool.
1318740	1325660	So John, you walk back with the camera to the two fangs, you hold the camera up and
1325660	1328400	the viewfinder looks very normal.
1328400	1331060	You see what you see.
1331060	1336260	When you click in to take a picture, there is an extremely bright flash that is almost
1336260	1342620	blinding and as your vision comes back into focus, you see a piece of paper being smoothly
1342620	1345260	printed out of the bottom of this device.
1345260	1350180	I'm briefly reminded of reports of brilliant flashes of light coming out of John Peter's
1350180	1351180	house.
1351180	1352180	Roll sanity.
1352180	1353180	Ooh.
1353180	1354180	87.
1354180	1355180	Fuck yeah.
1355180	1356180	Roll a D six.
1356180	1360900	Oh, you're going to do me like that.
1360900	1361900	Four.
1361900	1363300	Lose four sanity.
1363300	1364300	You're starting to.
1364300	1365300	I believe.
1366300	1368500	You're starting to lose it a little bit.
1368500	1376660	The picture shows a short balding man with large eyes and a tiny nose.
1376660	1384620	He is bent over head and hands and stocks that are a shiny black material and fool is
1384620	1387340	branded into his forehead.
1387340	1392940	You see an inky black substance all over your hands and dripping onto the ground from the
1392940	1394900	camera and the picture.
1394900	1399780	It is pooling on the ground and you could swear it is moving.
1399780	1402120	When you blink, the substance is gone.
1402120	1408740	Your hands are clean and you're holding this odd device and this even otter picture.
1408740	1409740	Let's go ahead and get them back.
1409740	1413500	Hey, I'm going to talk to them first.
1413500	1417860	No, I'm going to talk to them first.
1417860	1418860	Okay.
1418860	1419860	Sorry.
1419860	1421860	Hey, how are you doing?
1421860	1422860	Howdy.
1422860	1423860	Proceed.
1423860	1424860	Don't don't.
1425820	1431180	And Clark, the two of you see an extremely bright flash of light coming from where John
1431180	1432180	is standing.
1432180	1433180	I look at Clark.
1433180	1434180	What the hell was that?
1434180	1435180	He was taking a picture.
1435180	1437160	It's the flash of a camera.
1437160	1439540	It was bigger than a regular flash of a camera.
1439540	1441060	I don't know what kind of camera you're using.
1441060	1447940	I guess it was kind of bright.
1447940	1453740	Is the gate, is the entrance to, uh, is the entrance to, can I fit my cruiser inside of
1453740	1454740	the water park?
1455620	1456620	I get out of my car.
1456620	1458180	John, you get that picture?
1458180	1459180	John doesn't answer.
1459180	1462620	He's just kind of staring at a picture in his hands and like the ground around him.
1462620	1463620	I go walking up.
1463620	1467620	I'm going to hop out with him too.
1467620	1468620	Nice.
1468620	1472020	I think you might want to help Keith.
1472020	1473020	I'll do that.
1473020	1474020	I'll go and.
1474020	1475020	Yeah.
1475020	1478900	I put my arm around him and three three legged race it.
1478900	1479900	John.
1479900	1480900	John, what you got?
1480900	1481900	I'm not rightly sure.
1482060	1485060	I look over his shoulder or whatever he's looking at.
1485060	1488140	I pass him the picture and I look at it with him.
1488140	1492820	I cover Keith's eyes.
1492820	1498340	The picture shows a short balding man with large eyes and a tiny nose.
1498340	1505260	He is bent over head and hands and stocks that are a shiny black material and fool is
1505260	1507580	branded into his forehead.
1507580	1508580	Did you say in stocks?
1508580	1509580	Like he's hanging?
1510260	1512260	It was like just directly in front of me, right?
1512260	1513260	Like where I took the picture.
1513260	1516540	Like did you just aim it right ahead of you or did you, what do you, the picture's like
1516540	1519700	super zoomed in seeming you don't really see much around.
1519700	1521380	I'm like reaching out in front of me.
1521380	1525820	I'm waving my hand out in front too.
1525820	1526820	You feel nothing.
1526820	1527820	You feel the air.
1527820	1528820	There's not a man there.
1528820	1532100	John, did you see anything looking through the viewfinder real quick?
1532100	1537340	The two of you, uh, could you roll sanity for me at seeing this picture?
1537340	1538340	I pass with a nine.
1538340	1539340	I hit a snow.
1539340	1540340	I'm sorry.
1540340	1541340	I failed.
1541340	1542340	Totally.
1542340	1543340	Keith is fine.
1543340	1544340	And Clark, you lose one sanity.
1544340	1545340	Keith.
1545340	1547300	You're probably thinking this isn't a camera.
1547300	1549800	Maybe it's like a printer of some kind, dude.
1549800	1550800	This might not be a camera.
1550800	1555860	It might be like a printer of some kind from a different, well, this sounds crazy, but
1555860	1557860	like a different dimension.
1557860	1558860	Now you do sound crazy.
1558860	1559860	I'm sorry.
1559860	1562420	What kind of, I lost a lot of blood.
1562420	1564580	Tell me a little bit about that black goo you saw.
1564580	1567020	It was like viscous black goo.
1567020	1570700	They were crawling out of it and it sucked them in and then it, and then I ran away.
1570700	1576860	Well, three unrelated incidences of black goo are probably just coincidence, but I am
1576860	1584780	starting to come around to the notion that maybe something strange is happening in contention.
1584780	1588540	In the picture of the guy in the stocks, is there signs of the water park behind him?
1588540	1590140	Uh, no, it's really zoomed in.
1590140	1591140	Oh shit.
1591140	1593700	You really add the whole back is, is blurry and such.
1593740	1599500	Uh, John just got a text and when he reads it, Hey God, so I haven't told you, um, when
1599500	1605460	I went to the hospital, a madman jumped out at me, possibly a man, possibly mechanical,
1605460	1606460	but he did.
1606460	1608820	Uh, he gave me a note in binary.
1608820	1611660	I had, uh, had drew take a look at that.
1611660	1614900	I think, uh, I think something's going on.
1614900	1615900	All right.
1615900	1617380	Here, here's what it says.
1617380	1621220	The binary, it translates to I killed the cheese pops, John.
1621220	1622220	John?
1622220	1623220	That's me.
1623220	1627740	That's what happened to cheese dad, but death.
1627740	1629020	What did this guy look like?
1629020	1632220	He was wearing a hood and he was real scraggly.
1632220	1633220	You couldn't see his face.
1633220	1634220	And you know what?
1634220	1636220	Come to think of it, I don't think I even caught the feller's face.
1636220	1641620	Does the note look like it's to John or signed by John because John Peters is our missing
1641620	1642860	man also.
1642860	1644020	It looks like it's to me.
1644020	1645020	Cool.
1645020	1650060	I killed the cheese pops, comma John, not I killed the cheese pops, signed John.
1650060	1651220	It's addressed to John.
1651220	1652220	Gotcha.
1652220	1653220	Fun thing.
1653220	1660060	Can you guys roll intelligence for me pass pass fail Clark.
1660060	1664060	You'd still be holding this picture that John just handed you.
1664060	1667060	You're remembering this face.
1667060	1673900	It's obviously a little different now and it's got fool branded into its forehead, but
1673900	1675860	you're pretty sure that's John Peters.
1675860	1679340	Hey fellas, what's up this year picture.
1679340	1683300	I think, I think this picture is John, John Peters, our guy who's missing.
1683300	1684300	God, you're right.
1684300	1685300	Let me take a look.
1685300	1686300	I pass it over.
1686300	1688260	This is the same guy from those pictures in John's house.
1688260	1690740	What the hell boys.
1690740	1693280	Is that green light still on the camera or is it red again?
1693280	1694280	It's red.
1694280	1698780	John Peters cursed this devil camera, cursed this haunted water park.
1698780	1703600	You remember that body in the junkyard, it had, what was it branded with?
1703600	1704600	This is a fool.
1704600	1705600	Right?
1705600	1706600	Yeah, this thing does not like fools.
1706600	1707600	We got some fools on our hands.
1707600	1708600	Oh God, guys.
1709000	1710000	Somebody don't like fools.
1710000	1714000	It's the BM.
1714000	1722680	We just need to find out what a fool believes.
1722680	1723680	Cut in that music.
1723680	1724680	We'll get those rights.
1724680	1725680	Yup.
1725680	1726680	We can definitely afford it.
1726680	1727680	Call out the dude.
1727680	1728680	Call out the dude.
1728680	1730760	I need to get to the hospital.
1730760	1731760	Oh shit.
1731760	1732760	Yeah, you're right.
1732760	1735640	I think I can get myself there, but I'll go with you.
1735640	1736640	All right.
1736680	1742600	Yes, I'll stay behind and try to put together this tangled web of mysteries that are certainly
1742600	1745680	not currently swamping the resources of this small.
1745680	1750440	While we're at the hospital, maybe we should see if we can get some security footage and
1750440	1755400	see if we can't find out what the hooded figure guy came from or what he looks like.
1755400	1756400	What was the hooded figure thing?
1756400	1757400	The one that handed him the note.
1757400	1758400	He jumped out of me.
1758400	1759400	Oh, right, right.
1759400	1760400	Are you going to the city?
1760400	1761400	Which one did you go to?
1761400	1764600	There's a clinic in contention, like in urgent care.
1764600	1765600	That's where I would go.
1765600	1766600	Yeah.
1767560	1769240	Okay, so that was the end of the day basically.
1769240	1772240	Well, it seems like we've done all we can do today.
1772240	1774240	I'm going to take an overnight here at the hospital.
1774240	1781840	Why don't we all just hit the hay, get a good nine or 10, and come back with fresh, yeah.
1781840	1783240	We took him to the clinic and he's okay?
1783240	1784240	Yes.
1784240	1785400	Did I regain any health points?
1785400	1789080	Can you roll to see if he loses the foot?
1789080	1790240	Be hilarious if I did.
1790240	1791520	You don't regain any health.
1791520	1792960	Okay, but I have a foot?
1792960	1793960	You do.
1793960	1794960	Can I walk on it well or no?
1795480	1796720	No, it's still sprained pretty badly.
1796720	1799280	But I got crutches or a wheelchair.
1799280	1800280	Which do you want?
1800280	1801280	I want a wheelchair.
1801280	1802280	You've got a wheelchair.
1802280	1803280	Hell yeah.
1803280	1804280	That's going to prove problematic.
1804280	1807240	Okay, I guess we'll just leave you here, Keith.
1807240	1811400	I mean, I can still get up out of it, you know.
1811400	1813920	Yeah, but without crutches.
1813920	1817320	It's a real souped up jazzy.
1817320	1819600	It's like the one that they had at the clinic.
1819600	1821920	Yeah, yeah, it's super old.
1821920	1825800	We just find you a couple of real long sticks.
1825800	1826800	Cool.
1826800	1829800	Just in case.
1829800	1831800	It's just you and me now.
1831800	1835800	Finally, we can tell the mic what we can't tell the world.
1835800	1837800	What we can't tell ourselves.
1837800	1840800	What we never dare admit.
1840800	1843800	But what we know is true.
1843800	1850320	So you're sleeping and you're reliving the moment when you saw the black sludge on your
1850320	1855040	hands and dripping from the odd camera and picture.
1855040	1860520	Your perception changes and you're out of your body, looking at yourself, staring intently
1860520	1862200	at your hands.
1862200	1869000	You see there's the same viscous muck dripping from your eyes and nostrils as you wake up
1869000	1870000	in bed.
1870000	1876520	Yeah, I can't really get back to sleep after that, so I just say some like very abusive
1876520	1882880	things to whichever teenagers are playing Call of Duty at this time of night.
1882880	1888160	I really like, I'm being a dick over voice chat.
1888160	1889440	Are you good at Call of Duty?
1889440	1890440	I think he's pretty good.
1890440	1891440	I think he's probably pretty good.
1891440	1892440	Yeah.
1892440	1893440	I think he's put in some hours.
1893440	1894440	Yeah.
1894440	1895440	All right, go ahead and grab Luke.
1895440	1896440	Hey you.
1896440	1897440	Keith Vigna.
1897440	1898440	Oh boy.
1898440	1899440	Shit.
1899440	1900440	Hey Luke.
1900440	1901440	Hey.
1901440	1902440	Keith.
1903440	1904440	Hey Luke.
1904440	1905440	Hey.
1905440	1912320	Keith, your eyes open and you see a woman standing before you in your bedroom.
1912320	1917560	She's wearing old timey clothing and she stares angrily at you.
1917560	1923060	She lunges toward you, picking you up and throwing you to the ground.
1923060	1927800	You fall into the floor of your bedroom and then you wake up in bed.
1927800	1932000	I rub my eyes and I look around the room and wonder if that was real or not.
1932000	1934880	But I have seen enough shit that I think it is.
1934880	1936060	There's no one in your room.
1936060	1937060	What time is it?
1937060	1938060	Three in the morning.
1938060	1939760	I'm going to get up and look around my house.
1939760	1940760	Just do a quick sweep.
1940760	1941760	Nothing?
1941760	1942760	Nothing.
1942760	1944720	I'm going to lay back down but probably have some trouble falling asleep.
1944720	1945720	Probably so.
1945720	1948200	You want to grab Joe for me?
1948200	1949200	Yep.
1949200	1954240	Clark, you go to bed that night, you crack open your TV dinner.
1954240	1955640	It's a Salisbury steak tonight.
1955640	1956640	Oh.
1956640	1958080	He was looking forward to it.
1958080	1959080	Gross.
1959160	1964160	And you're watching Wheel of Fortune and then you see a man underneath you and you're not
1964160	1965160	on your couch.
1965160	1971960	The man underneath you is struggling to breathe as you tighten your grip around his neck.
1971960	1978520	You look up after the life leaves his eyes and see an empty dark alleyway as you wake
1978520	1982200	up on the couch with infomercials playing on your TV.
1982200	1985400	Oh, what the hell was that?
1985400	1986400	Yeah.
1987400	1991240	Yeah, you probably clean up, try to go to sleep.
1991240	1992240	Yeah, go to the bedroom.
1992240	1993240	Sounds good.
1993240	1999880	Okay, so you guys get up and you meet at the police station around the normal time.
1999880	2001880	11, 11.30.
2001880	2002880	Eight o'clock for Clark.
2002880	2004280	You know when crime starts.
2004280	2006080	Eight o'clock for Clark Bishop.
2006080	2008520	A little bit later for the other two probably.
2008520	2012440	I think today I get there on time because I didn't really go to sleep last night.
2012440	2013440	Gotcha.
2013440	2015000	I get there late but for the same reason.
2015000	2020320	Drew seems to be in pretty low spirits after the events of the past two days.
2020320	2021800	Today is December 3rd.
2021800	2025040	Been two days since all this crazy stuff has started.
2025040	2029760	How'd you sleep last night, Clark?
2029760	2032440	I mean I had some nightmares.
2032440	2034560	I think everybody's gonna have some.
2034560	2037360	Yeah, well what, along what lines?
2037360	2038520	After what we saw.
2038520	2039520	What happened?
2039520	2043480	Oh, I saw a dark alley.
2043480	2045760	It was just real spooky.
2045760	2050600	Yeah, I had a dream that like an old time lady picked me up and threw me through my
2050600	2051600	floor.
2051600	2053680	Yeah, it was really scary.
2053680	2057280	Do we really need to hear about your fucked up sexual fantasies?
2057280	2060200	Did you have any fucked up sexual fantasies last night?
2060200	2064280	He like wipes at his eyes like without really thinking about it and says no.
2064280	2066440	Okay, must just be the two of us then.
2066440	2071200	I mean yeah, you see anything as violent as what happened last night, you're gonna think
2071200	2072200	about it.
2072200	2073200	Some weird dream.
2073240	2076400	Your body's just trying to process what you've gone through.
2076400	2077400	That's all it is.
2077400	2081760	Drew, have you heard from Maggie, or Officer Cook?
2081760	2082760	Captain Cook?
2082760	2083760	Chief Cook?
2083760	2091080	No, I've called the Chief quite a few times, but I haven't been able to get a hold of her.
2091080	2092080	Could you call her dad?
2092080	2094080	Yeah, hey Drew buddy.
2094080	2098000	We kind of forgot to mention her dad might be dead, if you could look into that.
2098000	2099000	The Chief's father?
2099000	2100000	Yeah, Pops.
2100000	2102120	Okay, yeah, I'll look into it.
2102120	2103120	Great.
2103120	2105240	You didn't do it right?
2105240	2108240	Just playing.
2108240	2110320	John's eyes narrow a little bit though as he looks at Drew.
2110320	2114560	Doing a role he meant.
2114560	2117160	Crit success.
2117160	2120100	He's so scared that you might be serious.
2120100	2122920	John knows that and revels in it a little bit.
2122920	2127040	You guys have never really been on great terms, and so he's like ugh.
2127040	2131080	John's not a great guy.
2131080	2132080	No shit.
2132080	2138400	Okay, I'm thinking I kind of want to follow up on this whole, the homeless people at the
2138400	2140600	Pistons house and their warehouse.
2140600	2145680	I don't know if we should go ask them about that, or if we should just do a little investigating.
2145680	2148640	We saw Leo Piston die last night.
2148640	2149640	That is true.
2149640	2150640	Maybe we should leave him alone.
2150640	2152640	That probably closes that thread.
2152640	2159040	I feel like we should maybe try to figure out some more stuff before we talk to the
2159040	2160040	Pistons.
2160040	2161040	Right, maybe we'll have some cool down.
2161040	2162520	Look at all those homeless people.
2162520	2164600	There's only 5,000 folks in this whole town.
2164600	2167600	Has anyone notified the Pistons about Leo?
2167600	2170480	I haven't, and I don't know if we should just yet.
2170480	2177360	It would be probably strange for you guys to confront George and Kathy with the death
2177360	2180200	of George's brother without a body.
2180200	2182480	There is a pool full of his gore.
2182480	2183920	Let's just leave it be for now.
2183920	2184920	Take him to there.
2184920	2185920	Yeah, here's what.
2185920	2188440	There's a little bit of a scalp.
2188440	2190200	Here's what I'm thinking.
2190200	2196320	That last picture we saw was of John Peters, so maybe we should go back to that case and
2196320	2197800	see what happened to him.
2197800	2202880	Honestly, the branding, the stocks, I think we've got some kind of deviant sex cult on
2202880	2210200	our hands just fucking degrading this town, this town, each other, this town, our values,
2210200	2211200	faces.
2211200	2216120	Should we go back to John Peters' house, or what do you, I don't even know what strings
2216120	2217120	to pull.
2217120	2218320	John pulls out the keys.
2218320	2222660	I had a hunch that these might be a storage unit on these G numbers here.
2222660	2229360	There's a note on your desk, John, that the storage unit that these keys are likely for
2229360	2231160	is called A Plus Storage.
2231160	2235640	They're the only storage units in town that have a G building.
2235640	2245560	I'll ride with one of you guys, because it feels real bad, but I got a wheelchair I can
2245560	2247440	fold up and throw in the back of your cruiser.
2247440	2249240	That's those cool sticks we found.
2249240	2251120	Yeah, they were all out of the clinic.
2251120	2253800	Yeah, they've had shortages on crutches.
2253800	2258120	I took one of the wheelchairs, so I'll throw that in the back of your cruiser and ride
2258120	2259120	with you, Clark.
2259120	2260520	Yeah, that's fine with me.
2260520	2261520	Cool.
2261520	2264220	I'm gonna wheel myself over to outside.
2264220	2270080	You guys roll up to A Plus Storage, and there's a small parking lot with a gate, and there's
2270080	2274800	a small house looking kind of thing to the right with a front door.
2274800	2278160	It's a small, probably one-room building.
2278160	2279480	Their open sign is on.
2279480	2281200	Okay, what units are these?
2281200	2282480	What are the numbers on those?
2282480	2283480	G units.
2283480	2285040	Which G units are they?
2285040	2286040	10 through 12.
2286040	2287040	10 through 12.
2287040	2288040	Let's go check them out.
2288040	2289040	Let's start with 10.
2289040	2290040	Yeah.
2290040	2292040	What if we all open one, and we open them all at the same time?
2292040	2294040	I honestly was thinking about that.
2294040	2295040	Yeah, sure.
2295040	2296040	Why not?
2296040	2297320	Don't they come in different sizes?
2297320	2303320	These are all the ones that are probably 10 foot by 10 foot.
2303320	2304320	Nice.
2304840	2305840	From what you can tell.
2305840	2306840	I can't open one up right now.
2306840	2308520	I'm gonna sit at my wheelchair and watch you guys open them up.
2308520	2313160	Yeah, it'd probably be way easier for me to describe it one at a time.
2313160	2319320	I would actually, if you could lay down the descriptions of each one and then play them
2319320	2320320	simultaneously.
2320320	2321320	At the same time.
2321320	2322320	Gotcha.
2322320	2323320	Yeah.
2323320	2324320	We'll get it in post.
2324320	2325320	We'll wait.
2325320	2326720	Okay, let's start with 10.
2326720	2327720	You open up G10.
2327720	2331400	G10 is filled with crates that are stacked three high.
2331480	2337520	There is also a pallet on which is sitting a large cube shaped object covered in so much
2337520	2340680	plastic wrap that its contents are obfuscated.
2340680	2347640	Each crate is wooden and stamped US Military in all caps on the side.
2347640	2352960	Inside these crates are guns, ammunition, and heavy weaponry.
2352960	2359200	This includes pistols, shotguns, rifles, a shoulder mounted anti-aircraft weapon, an
2359200	2365240	EMP rifle, a grappling gun, a small gun that shoots tracers, lots of grenades, and a few
2365240	2366240	other items.
2366240	2369120	Well, this could be the locker of any honest citizen in contention.
2369120	2374700	You can each come up with anything that you want to be in here in one of these crates
2374700	2378520	and if you roll for luck and I approve it, then it's in one of the crates.
2378520	2379520	Okay, cool.
2379520	2380520	Oh shit.
2380520	2382600	I want all the things you already said.
2382600	2383880	Those are already there.
2383880	2384880	Holy shit.
2384880	2385880	What the fuck?
2385880	2388480	Who's got the best, what are our firearms?
2388480	2391200	You guys each get to come up with one and each roll luck.
2391200	2392200	Okay.
2392200	2394200	I don't know what to wish for.
2394200	2396600	Like a bad ass shotgun, a sniper rifle.
2396600	2398600	Well, I feel like those are already in there.
2398600	2399600	I know.
2399600	2400600	Wasn't that all?
2400600	2401600	There were shotguns.
2401600	2402840	There doesn't seem to be a sniper rifle.
2402840	2403840	So that could be one.
2403840	2407880	So sniper rifle, there wasn't anti-aircraft and there's an EMP rifle?
2407880	2409880	There's an EMP rifle, yeah.
2409880	2413680	Well, that's actually going to come in handy because I do think we're dealing with some
2413680	2414680	robots.
2414680	2417360	Do you want to go ahead and roll luck, Thomas, for a sniper rifle?
2417360	2418360	No.
2418360	2421920	I want something bigger.
2421920	2422920	Something more spectacular.
2422920	2426840	Hey, is there a tank in here under all these crates?
2426840	2429000	Hey, is there a tank in here?
2429000	2432560	Is there anything not guns that could be like a nice vision goggles?
2432560	2436160	It's just one really sweet vintage cotton candy machine.
2436160	2438880	I mean, it can be anything, guys.
2438880	2441600	I want that gun from Men in Black, the little tiny one.
2441600	2442600	The mighty cricket?
2442600	2443600	Yeah.
2443600	2444600	Oh, sorry.
2444600	2445600	Noisy cricket.
2445600	2446600	We all want noisy crickets.
2446600	2447600	Too late.
2447840	2448840	Okay.
2448840	2449840	Noisy crickets, please.
2449840	2451440	Does it have to exist on earth?
2451440	2452440	Tiny powerful guns.
2452440	2454520	I mean, that's all that is.
2454520	2457520	I want to roll for a super tiny powerful gun.
2457520	2458520	Okay.
2458520	2460400	No, regular tiny super powerful.
2460400	2461400	Okay.
2461400	2462400	Go ahead and roll luck.
2462400	2463400	20.
2463400	2467520	You find a very tiny, very powerful gun.
2467520	2469100	Hell yeah.
2469100	2474440	What about a really sophisticated in-ear communication pieces?
2474440	2475440	Oh, I hate that.
2475440	2476440	Yeah.
2476440	2477440	That might be too game-breaking.
2477440	2478440	We've already got radios.
2478440	2479440	We've got radios.
2479440	2480440	We've got cell phones.
2480440	2483280	I just thought it would be if we were sneaking around, we could use them.
2483280	2486080	They like read your thoughts and send them to the other players.
2486080	2487080	Okay.
2487080	2489200	These aren't like unnatural items.
2489200	2492120	These are just crazy technological items.
2492120	2495640	That's my luck roll, by the way.
2495640	2498460	I'm randomly rolling.
2498460	2501200	Thomas just rolled an odd one.
2501200	2502200	Wait.
2502200	2504200	Can I change mine?
2504200	2505200	No.
2505200	2506200	Oh, fuck.
2506960	2507960	Give your idea to someone else.
2507960	2514520	Well, I wanted a really cool wheelchair.
2514520	2519880	Can I please?
2519880	2521800	You can convince one of them to do it.
2521800	2525960	Guys, if one of you wants my really powerful tiny gun, you could get like guns.
2525960	2529500	You want a turret mounted wheelchair?
2529500	2532000	I don't know about that.
2532000	2537340	I want a gigantic fucking 50 cal sniper rifle, the kind that can take down helicopters and
2537340	2538800	like large trucks.
2538800	2539800	Roll for it.
2539800	2542280	Yeah, one.
2542280	2544080	Please roll for it.
2544080	2545080	Dude.
2545080	2546080	Yeah.
2546080	2547080	It's so good.
2547080	2548080	If only.
2548080	2549080	Yeah.
2549080	2550080	You got it.
2550080	2551080	Okay.
2551080	2552080	Joe, what are you thinking?
2552080	2553080	I don't know.
2553080	2554080	Mortars.
2554080	2555080	I didn't know I was going to get a match.
2555080	2556080	It's a real shame we don't edit this part.
2556080	2559160	Some people, when they play a game like this, might take a moment to think.
2559160	2560840	There might be a lot of downtime.
2560840	2561840	We don't.
2562680	2565800	You will never hear that because it doesn't happen.
2565800	2567800	So are you thinking weapons or like a gadget?
2567800	2571000	I keep waffling back and forth, but I mean either one would be fine.
2571000	2572760	A waffle iron.
2572760	2573760	Wish for a waffle iron.
2573760	2577720	Like a really nice set of golf clubs.
2577720	2580900	A lifetime supply of the TV dinners.
2580900	2582540	We should have a mortar.
2582540	2587280	What about just like a really fancy, cool ass, uh, like revolver?
2587280	2591080	Just like what's dirty hair you use in that a big ass revolver?
2591320	2592320	I don't know anything about guns.
2592320	2595600	I think, I think real big revolver is pretty cool and coppish.
2595600	2597000	Opposite of what I got.
2597000	2598000	But also...
2598000	2601960	It's a huge, weak gun.
2601960	2607360	Consider we might have a, uh, a compound like full of hundreds of homeless people.
2607360	2609280	I think we should get some mortars.
2609280	2610840	What are you trying to say, John?
2610840	2615640	I think we should be prepared to shell vast numbers of the enemy.
2615640	2618160	Who's to say they're the enemy?
2618160	2619160	Or what about like a drone?
2619160	2620160	Yeah, right.
2620680	2623280	The fact that this is a rollpoint armed drone.
2623280	2624280	They're probably just misunderstood.
2624280	2625760	Yeah, I don't know.
2625760	2628280	It's between a drone and a big ass pistol.
2628280	2630280	Oh dude, drone, drone, drone, drone, drone, drone, drone, drone, drone, drone.
2630280	2631280	Should I get a drone?
2631280	2632280	Can I get a drone?
2632280	2633280	I hope you fail your roll.
2633280	2634280	But yeah, you can roll.
2634280	2635280	Pass.
2635280	2636280	All right.
2636280	2637280	Yes.
2637280	2638280	We got a drone.
2638280	2640880	Yeah, we've got a big ass predator drone.
2640880	2641880	Okay.
2641880	2643560	It can be just the...
2643560	2644560	Pull it back.
2644560	2645560	All right.
2645560	2646560	Hey.
2646560	2647560	It's a nice one though.
2647560	2648560	It's nice.
2648560	2649560	Cool.
2649960	2651960	I'm going to start cutting into that plastic wrapped cube.
2651960	2652960	Okay.
2652960	2655160	I want to examine it before.
2655160	2660240	As you're examining it, you examine Keith Vigna cutting into this giant plastic wrapped
2660240	2661240	cube.
2661240	2667680	And as you dig your knife a little bit too far into it, a white powder starts pouring
2667680	2668680	out of it.
2668680	2669680	Let me see that.
2669680	2670680	Step aside.
2670680	2675720	I roll aside.
2675720	2683800	As you begin to take off the outer layers of plastic wrap, you would see that this is
2683800	2686960	bricks upon bricks of cocaine.
2686960	2691140	Guys, there must be 25, 20 bricks of cocaine here.
2691140	2695680	It is precisely way more than 25 bricks of cocaine.
2695680	2697600	This is an entire palette.
2697600	2704880	And as you begin counting, based on the math that you guys are, I'm assuming, great at
2704880	2711120	based on your characters, it is precisely 479 bricks of cocaine.
2711120	2712120	Hell yeah.
2712120	2713120	Quick math.
2713120	2718360	I mean, it is 478.
2718360	2720400	Write down 478 bricks of cocaine.
2720400	2721400	Okay.
2721400	2723680	One brick is clearly missing from the pile.
2723680	2725600	I think that we can come back to...
2725600	2729520	Someone must have gotten here before us.
2729520	2730520	Useful items to have.
2730520	2731520	I don't know.
2731520	2733400	An army of homeless people.
2733400	2736760	If you guys want to do a quick Google search, a brick.
2736760	2744720	What to do when you find a weapon is worth $25,000, which means an entire palette is
2744720	2748160	worth roughly $12 million of cocaine.
2748160	2752680	Guys, I don't know what I'm talking about right now, but what do I do?
2752680	2753680	Because I'm Thomas.
2753680	2754680	I'm not.
2754680	2755680	I think we found a green room.
2755680	2756680	Maybe.
2756680	2757680	So I drop...
2757680	2758680	What are the green boxes?
2758680	2759680	Yeah.
2759680	2760680	Cool.
2760680	2761680	The Gs.
2761680	2762680	They're in the Gs for green.
2762960	2764960	This is a pretty poppin' box.
2764960	2766960	You want to go to the next one?
2766960	2767960	Yeah.
2767960	2770600	You guys close this one down.
2770600	2771600	And lock it back up.
2771600	2772600	Lock it back up.
2772600	2773600	I take that.
2773600	2774600	50 cal.
2774600	2775600	Ammunition for same.
2775600	2776880	I pocket some pistols.
2776880	2777880	Yeah.
2777880	2779880	Let's load up some guns and stuff in the back of the cruisers.
2779880	2783880	You guys can drive your two cruisers back there and pile some stuff in there.
2783880	2784880	Cool.
2784880	2786920	And I pocket my regular tiny super powerful gun.
2786920	2787920	Of course you do.
2787920	2788920	I'll name it later.
2788920	2789920	Perfect.
2789920	2790920	What's its name?
2790920	2791920	I'll name it later.
2792160	2795040	Oh, that's not a very good name.
2795040	2802920	Inside G11 is a burlap sack containing $50,000 in shredded blue dye stained banknotes, a
2802920	2808960	piece of notebook paper with poorly drawn diagrams and nearly illegible writing, two
2808960	2818600	25 pound bags of potatoes, a ziplock bag containing five bulbs of garlic, a garlic crusher, an
2818600	2827380	empty test tube, and a syringe, a small drawstring Nike bag, a three million candle power hand
2827380	2835480	held spotlight, a well filled toolbox, a black leather backpack, a bottle of caffeine pills,
2835480	2841760	a carton of cigarettes, three shovels, a small digital scale, a syringe labeled morphine,
2841760	2846640	a handful of ski masks, walkie talkies, and a burned CD.
2846640	2847640	Could you repeat that?
2847680	2848960	Inside G11.
2848960	2851280	What is on the, is the burned CD marked?
2851280	2854120	It says monster mash mash.
2854120	2855120	Dope.
2855120	2856120	Yeah.
2856120	2857120	Hell yeah.
2857120	2858120	Okay.
2858120	2864880	So, real fast, just to throw it out there, Joe, the Delta Green player is super stoked
2864880	2870120	about having all this stuff, but like we're police officers investigating a missing person.
2870120	2873240	Like we just, we're just taking all of the shit we find.
2873240	2874800	That seems a little weird.
2874800	2881000	I think he would rationalize it that he's seen some fucked up shit last night and he
2881000	2885640	wants to be prepared for anything and this seems like it's heaven sent.
2885640	2886640	I love it.
2886640	2887640	That's right.
2887640	2888640	That's right.
2888640	2889640	This is the Lord's word.
2889640	2893600	So it looks like we might be dealing with like some bank robbers.
2893600	2895360	I want to look in the Nike bag.
2895360	2897000	There's nothing in there.
2897000	2898520	Is there anything in the leather backpack?
2898520	2904000	The leather backpack contains a set of lock picks, wire cutters, wire strippers, a crimping
2904000	2907840	tool, flattened Phillips head screwdrivers, and a lockout tool.
2907840	2908840	Cool.
2908840	2909840	Grab that bad boy.
2909840	2910840	I mean, grab everything.
2910840	2912840	There's morphine that could keep us going.
2912840	2916800	We go out and call Drew and ask him to send a U-Haul down here.
2916800	2918880	Do you want to do that?
2918880	2919880	Yeah.
2919880	2920880	Kind of, yeah.
2920880	2921880	Yeah, let's do that.
2921880	2922880	Well, actually, we have the key.
2922880	2923960	Logistically, we have the keys.
2923960	2925120	This shit is all here.
2925120	2926120	This could be our base of operations.
2926120	2927120	That's true.
2927120	2928120	Usually as a safe house for ourselves.
2928120	2931200	But what if they have an extra set of keys?
2931200	2932200	Let's get out of here.
2932200	2933200	Let's get this stuff.
2933200	2934280	Let's U-Haul it out.
2934280	2935580	People might try to take it.
2935580	2937880	Just anybody might come in here and try to take it.
2937880	2939320	We're confiscating it for evidence.
2939320	2940320	Yeah, exactly.
2940320	2944440	We can put it in the evidence room, which is probably pretty sound.
2944440	2945440	You do have an evidence room.
2945440	2946440	Yeah.
2946440	2947440	We'll put it in there.
2947440	2948440	Let's open.
2948440	2949440	Yeah.
2949440	2950440	What's behind door number three?
2950440	2954800	A trip to France.
2954800	2962240	Inside G12 is a four-wheeler with dried dirt and clay caked all over the thing, as well
2962280	2966400	as a couple of plastic trunks.
2966400	2971560	Near the door is a small chunk of paper that has been folded into the size of a business
2971560	2976820	card, and against the back wall is a small table with some papers on it.
2976820	2978320	Was there a paper in G11, too?
2978320	2979320	No.
2979320	2980320	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
2980320	2981320	Sorry.
2981320	2982320	There was a piece of notebook paper.
2982320	2983320	With the scribbles, yeah.
2983320	2985360	Poorly drawn diagrams and nearly illegible writing.
2985360	2987000	Do any of you guys have heavy machinery?
2987000	2988000	No.
2988000	2989000	Don't think I have any repair shit.
2989000	2990000	Yeah, I don't see any repair.
2990000	2991000	Okay.
2991000	2993080	I want to find someone who would know more about that.
2993080	2995480	I want to look at the small chunk of paper first.
2995480	3001400	The small chunk of paper, as you unfold it, there are some ripped up bedding stubs inside
3001400	3002880	of it that fall out.
3002880	3009720	The piece of paper is on a thicker cardstock, and looking at it, you can tell that this
3009720	3015720	is the translator paper on which people place their bets to see what they're betting on.
3015720	3021960	So it's got the odds, and each number from the bedding stubs is in relation to a name
3021960	3027000	on the bedding paper, and it's got a date at the top, and it says October 31st.
3027000	3028000	What are the names?
3028000	3033440	There were three things that you could bet on on October 31st.
3033440	3035800	Hold on.
3035800	3037560	Did you like that dick I drew, Zach?
3037560	3039360	I did like that dick you drew, Thomas.
3039360	3040760	You drew the stinky foot?
3040760	3041760	Did you do better?
3041760	3043080	Oh, the stick's a real stinky foot.
3043080	3044080	It's a stinky foot.
3044080	3045080	Did you like that dick I drew?
3045080	3046080	Did you like that dick I drew?
3046080	3047080	That dick you drew?
3047080	3048080	That.
3048080	3049080	Wowee!
3049080	3058480	Every time you drew that dick you drew.
3058480	3068440	The three names are Oz, Mayhem, Wolf, Miles, Detonator, Carver, and Carl Blitzkrieg Anderson.
3068440	3070880	Are any of us familiar with those names?
3070880	3071880	Is this like MMA?
3071880	3072880	Do we even?
3072880	3073880	We got no.
3073880	3074880	It sounds like boxers.
3074880	3076160	Carl Blitzkrieg Anderson.
3076160	3081120	At the bottom it said versus Planet Juggernaut.
3081120	3086960	Is there any way that John Lee Pennymore doesn't know about a place called Planet Juggernaut?
3086960	3088600	It was versus tonight.
3088600	3091680	Oh, Planet Juggernaut is- Something these three things are versing,
3091680	3092680	I think.
3092680	3093680	Oh, God.
3093680	3094680	So cool.
3094680	3095680	Super cool.
3095680	3102600	The ripped up bedding stubs, you can tell he lost, lost, lost, and over the night lost
3102600	3104480	$5,000.
3104480	3111040	The last fight he bet on something with like 30 to one odds.
3111040	3112680	They were all- Not smart.
3112680	3114200	And they were all kind of bad odds?
3114200	3115200	Yeah.
3115200	3121320	The first two were probably closer to five to one, six to one, and then the last one
3121320	3122320	was 30 to one.
3122320	3124640	So he gets like desperate after losing that money?
3124640	3125640	Exactly.
3125640	3129760	Does a Google search for any of those names turn up information on the participants or
3129760	3130760	the sport?
3130760	3131760	Oh, yeah.
3131920	3133640	Give me the name of one of those fighters.
3133640	3135080	Oz Mayhem Wolf.
3135080	3136080	Yeah.
3136080	3144080	So Oz Mayhem Wolf, it will come up that he has been in like low time MMA fights or amateur
3144080	3147360	cage boxing or cage fighting, whatever that sport's called.
3147360	3151080	It's professional fighters, but in cages built by amateurs.
3151080	3152080	Nice.
3152080	3158000	So it's just like, there's a risk that it's really shoddy.
3158000	3159000	Yeah.
3159000	3160000	No joke.
3160880	3164480	What's in the plastic trunks?
3164480	3169720	Inside one of the trunks is a box of assorted batteries, spools of electric wiring, three
3169720	3176320	disassembled handguns, and an impossibly clean machete sitting atop three full suits, including
3176320	3182120	shirt, tie, and shoes, all covered in dirt, clay, and black stains that look to be blood.
3182120	3186120	Do we need to take a sanity check for seeing an impossibly clean machete?
3186120	3187120	Luke.
3187120	3188120	Yes.
3188720	3189720	Luke.
3189720	3190720	Yes.
3190720	3195240	As you approach the other plastic trunk, this one has the lid fastened.
3195240	3198360	The stench is nearly unbearable.
3198360	3200400	The trunk is clear and without-
3200400	3203200	I bet there's a hundred homeless people on this truck.
3207760	3213760	Without opening the lid, you can see only a dried black crust, which is painted on every
3213760	3216760	bit of the trunk's insides.
3216880	3222440	I'll investigate this one back at the lab.
3222440	3226480	I'm not going to open it in here right now, but let's go see what those papers-
3226480	3227960	Yeah, take a look at the table.
3227960	3228960	Okay.
3228960	3235120	You guys walk back and there is a note handwritten on a piece of paper.
3235120	3237000	What's that say, John?
3237000	3238200	The cabin is in the woods.
3238200	3239200	Love that movie.
3239200	3241920	Stark West from the end of the trail about two and a half miles.
3241920	3242920	K.
3242920	3245800	We took care of nine of them as well as the leader.
3245840	3246840	Okay.
3246840	3252160	And there is also a sheet that seems to be ripped out of a notebook.
3252160	3254880	This one is also handwritten in different handwriting.
3254880	3261800	It says, the work is difficult and particular, but I've had 12 successes.
3261800	3264840	Life isn't as complex as they believe.
3264840	3265840	They are quite simple.
3265840	3267680	It will be their downfall.
3267680	3272160	And the last is, it's a cutout from an old newspaper.
3272160	3275240	Cole's Orphanage, new school under modern etiquette.
3275240	3278480	We are here to serve the beautiful community of contention.
3278480	3282280	Is Cole ... Do you remember Cole's Orphanage?
3282280	3283440	I don't ... That doesn't ring a bell.
3283440	3284440	The only thing I can think about-
3284440	3289240	Didn't we used to go to school with hundreds of smelly orphans?
3289240	3292680	Well, this probably doesn't mean anything.
3292680	3295200	Let's crumble a month down the way.
3295200	3296520	Cole's Orphanage.
3296520	3298600	Cole was the counterpart to beans, right?
3298600	3299600	Yeah.
3299600	3300600	Silas Cole, right?
3300600	3301600	Oh, yeah.
3301600	3302600	Yep.
3302600	3303600	Okay.
3303600	3306280	I'm going to ask some old-timers around here and see if they remember that.
3306280	3312600	Silas Cole is still known as being one of the founders of this town.
3312600	3317000	He was the owner of the mine for a couple of years.
3317000	3325000	And his wife, Mary Cole, did a lot of good in the community, and the library is named
3325000	3326000	after her.
3326000	3327780	It's the Mary Cole Library.
3327780	3332720	So one could assume that someone opening this orphanage probably named it after her.
3332720	3336240	Is there any sign on the clipping of the newspaper what newspaper it came from?
3336240	3337840	The Contention Chronicle.
3337840	3341580	But I don't remember a Cole's Orphanage, because I am 37.
3341580	3343560	It must have opened and closed real quick, right?
3343560	3347640	Yeah, we should keep this on our radar and try to ask Drew to find out some stuff about
3347640	3348640	it.
3348640	3349640	Cool.
3349640	3350640	Is U-Haul here yet?
3350640	3351640	Yes.
3351640	3352640	Do you want to load literally everything?
3352640	3353640	Yeah.
3353640	3354640	Mm-hmm.
3354640	3356600	I also want to ride out of here on that four-wheeler.
3356600	3357600	Does a four-wheeler run?
3357600	3358600	Can you drive my cruiser?
3358600	3359600	Are there keys to the four-wheeler?
3359600	3360600	Yes.
3360600	3361600	Cool.
3361600	3362600	Are you actually going to ride it out?
3363480	3364480	Yeah.
3364480	3365480	Okay.
3365480	3366480	I'll drive your cruiser back then.
3366480	3370400	I take my shirt off and I get on the four-wheeler.
3370400	3377000	Just John and some a little bit too tight britches hopping on this four-wheeler without
3377000	3378000	a shirt on.
3378000	3380520	Is this like the three bears pants situation?
3380520	3382720	The farts are just right.
3382720	3387360	What should we do?
3387360	3392280	I think take it all back to the evidence room and sort it out into different categories
3392960	3393960	Catalog it all?
3393960	3397480	Yeah, catalog it all and then try to do some investigating on the stuff that doesn't make
3397480	3398480	sense to us.
3398480	3400320	Well, man, there's just so much crime all of a sudden.
3400320	3403480	Why does it fall to us to deal with that?
3403480	3409040	Quick cut to the sick montage of you guys loading everything into the evidence room.
3409040	3414920	Like spraying each other with bullets.
3414920	3415920	Roll firearms.
3415920	3416920	Throw encasings.
3416920	3417920	Throw it, yeah, exactly.
3418560	3422120	I get tired so I do a quick bump and I'm like, ready to go?
3422120	3423120	Oh yeah.
3423120	3427240	I meant to ask you, are you doing any of that cocaine?
3427240	3428760	I'm not right now.
3428760	3430600	I'm not doing it right now, but yes.
3430600	3432480	Keith has been known to dabble.
3432480	3433480	Yeah.
3433480	3434480	Clark is a straightener.
3434480	3435480	Under Clark's eye.
3435480	3436480	I'm adjusting.
3436480	3441440	John is taking this to the family reunion and selling it.
3441440	3442440	I'm not doing it with Clark next to me.
3442440	3446840	Do you think a contention cop makes a fucking lot of money?
3446840	3447840	No.
3448760	3449760	He does not.
3449760	3450760	Okay, so can we cut to...
3450760	3451760	It's all catalogued.
3451760	3452760	Yeah.
3452760	3453760	Absolutely.
3453760	3454760	Cool.
3454760	3455760	Wow, guys, we really put our heads together and made that happen.
3455760	3457360	You guys really worked through the day too.
3457360	3459680	You skipped lunch and now it's done at 2 p.m.
3459680	3460680	How nice.
3460680	3464280	In the process of cataloguing stuff, did anything new catch our eyes?
3464280	3468480	Because that's the time when anything would have crossed our vision in particular.
3468480	3470320	I mean, did you want to look into anything?
3470320	3473320	I gave you basically the outline of what each thing is.
3473320	3478200	I want to get Drew to get info on Cole's orphanage and then also see if he can find
3478200	3480600	anybody that knows about those diagrams that we saw.
3480600	3481600	Okay, cool.
3481600	3482600	Very good.
3482600	3484080	Do we want to do anything with the crusty tub?
3484080	3485080	Oh, yeah.
3485080	3486080	Now that we're back...
3486080	3487080	Yeah, we need to check it out.
3487080	3488080	I want to...
3488080	3491560	I mean, maybe it's gore, but it might also be...
3491560	3493480	Somebody might have isolated some of the black stuff.
3493480	3496760	Should we do that in the evidence room or should we go outside or...
3496760	3497760	I don't know.
3497760	3498760	I'm kind of nervous about it.
3498760	3499880	Clark is kind of nervous about it.
3499880	3502880	I'm nervous about it too because this is shit that Keith has seen.
3502880	3506960	Those lockers were full of weaponry, so if this is some kind of weapon...
3506960	3509960	Man, I hope nobody comes looking for us.
3509960	3510960	How about this?
3510960	3511960	Because we ticked our fangs.
3511960	3512960	I'll go into...
3512960	3513960	I assume...
3513960	3515560	Do we have like a jail cell?
3515560	3516560	Yeah.
3516560	3518960	I want to go into one of those with this tub and open it up.
3518960	3520440	You're taking that upon yourself, Keith?
3520440	3523000	I've got one leg and I'm doing it.
3523000	3524440	I'm interested too.
3524440	3531080	The rancid smell of old metal hits your nostrils and atop this pile of what looks like a messily
3531080	3536360	chopped up human body sits a woman's head split down the middle and pulled apart with
3536360	3540480	a small silver sphere sitting in between the two halves.
3540480	3541480	Well, this could be anything.
3541480	3542480	Hell yeah.
3542480	3543480	Real sanity?
3543480	3544480	Pass.
3544480	3545480	I passed.
3545480	3547280	I passed.
3547280	3548960	You all wear old hands.
3548960	3550960	I crit pass if that helps me in any way.
3550960	3551960	Oh, yeah, it does.
3551960	3552960	How about you don't look?
3552960	3553960	Okay.
3553960	3554960	Yeah.
3554960	3555960	Does that work for you?
3555960	3556960	For sure.
3556960	3559680	Keith and John, you both lose one sanity on a pass.
3559680	3561040	Are you going to put the lid back on?
3561040	3562040	Oh, yeah, I am.
3562040	3563040	Okay.
3563040	3564040	Actually, wait.
3564040	3569120	I'm going to like snap for evidence, snap a picture of this and see can we identify?
3569120	3570120	Identifiable.
3570120	3571120	Yeah.
3571120	3575080	The only thing that's really, I mean, it is cleaved into.
3575080	3576080	Yes.
3576080	3578200	Cleft in twain.
3578200	3579200	If you will.
3579200	3581080	Clove in twove.
3581080	3583240	It's cloved in twoved.
3583240	3584680	And if you put the halves together.
3584680	3586720	If you smash them together.
3586760	3592360	It's like trying to make a face.
3592360	3598520	So it's, you say it's identifiable, but we can't, I mean, we recognize this person?
3598520	3599520	No.
3599520	3602160	But it's identifiable to someone that would have known this person.
3602160	3604600	Like did you mean it's recognizably a person?
3604600	3607080	It's recognizably a woman's head.
3607080	3609800	But like, it's not really, it's so old.
3609800	3610800	This has been.
3610800	3612800	Well, that's, how about this?
3613600	3617360	I'm going to take a picture of it, take a picture of it, close it back up and send this
3617360	3619200	box to the corner.
3619200	3620200	Let him deal with it.
3620200	3624400	Before we do that, I want to take a look at the little silver ball in the skull.
3624400	3625400	Do you want to grab it?
3625400	3626400	Yeah.
3626400	3627400	Let's grab it.
3627400	3628400	Okay.
3628400	3629400	You grab it.
3629400	3630880	Look, it's a little silver sphere.
3630880	3632140	About how big?
3632140	3634560	About the size of a large marble.
3634560	3639840	And by large marble, I mean it's one inch in diameter.
3639840	3641840	So the radius is a half inch.
3642320	3643880	I hold onto it for good luck.
3643880	3644880	What's the circumference?
3644880	3645880	Awesome.
3645880	3646880	Oh shit.
3646880	3648960	I don't know that good a man.
3648960	3652560	Should we send this to the corner just to see if we can get anything out of it?
3652560	3655400	It didn't like attack and kill us, so I assume.
3655400	3657560	Why would you assume a dead body would do that?
3657560	3660520	I've seen some fucked up shit today and yesterday.
3660520	3661520	Like what?
3671840	3692160	How am I the only one trying to pull over How can you have enough drowning out of the
