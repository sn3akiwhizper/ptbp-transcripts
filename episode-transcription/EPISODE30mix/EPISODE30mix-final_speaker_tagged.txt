507.02 723.82 speaker3  Keith Vigna you are violently holding a pillow over someone's face when the pillow itself Transforms into an oily black ooze and it washes over the face below it not of a person But the face of the watch your father William gave your brother Ferguson so many years ago looking down at your wrist You see you are wearing this watch But when you look up you do not recognize the world around you Dust clouds settle to reveal a horse pulling a wagon through a small frontier town and the bald man You know is Billy Harrison the one who took your uniform and gun in the clinic He is walking in your direction and he keeps repeating. I did everything that you asked me to do officer Vigna He holds up the strange-looking camera officer petty more found in the car of Julie Maxwell and takes a picture of you The light is blinding and as it fades you were standing in darkness stank and chilly Right in front of you is a massive tank filled with the now eerily too familiar opaque ooze you press your face against the tank to see something creeping toward you and As the face of tilde be Mitchell comes into focus you are standing in an open field The dead grass covered in a thin freeze crunching under your feet as you approach a metal hatch But water gross murky water with bits of grass and sludge begin spewing from the creases of this metal hatch The water begins to flood this field at an alarming pace You look down and see your reflection in the rippling water, but something looks off Opening your eyes you see a bright light shining dead You see it is a head that is shaped like a football with spiky white hair frantically flopping atop a pointy head She is wearing a large white lab coat and those big chunky evil scientist goggles that evil Scientists wear this pair is wonky However, one goggle pointing down in a way to accommodate the odd head shape of the wearer She begins slowly tapping her long wobbly fingers against your cheekbone and jawline But you don't feel anything Looking around this room. You see you are in some sort of laboratory You are strapped down on one of several operating tables. The others are currently vacant Saws and hammers and the like and some shiny and futuristic with long needles or strange battery packs attached and such Another wall is covered in shelves with beakers and mason jars of different shapes and sizes All filled with different colored liquids and body parts some eyes and fingers But also internal organs some of which you don't even recognize Running all throughout this room are tubes like in a mail room and they all lead to three large vats That hang on their sides from the ceiling these tubes and vats seem to be some sort of funhouse style aquarium with different species of fish swimming throughout this tall lady scientist walks over to the corner of the room and reaches behind a humanoid figure
722.78 749.02 speaker0  male With brown hair with blonde highlights that could easily be mistaken for frosted tips He is wearing coral shorts a coral shirt, but a slightly different tone of coral white crew socks and
745.58 815.36 speaker3  she seems to click or flip something and this humanoid figure Walks towards the door the only door in this room and as she turns around looking at you before she leaves she clicks this button and both of you feel Extreme pain shoot through your entire bodies like an electrical current that is attached to every single nerve ending that you have it is excruciating and torturous and then she clicks another thing and it's gone and Then she kind of laughs I
809.50 840.22 speaker2  Take that in for a second, so I'm strapped down on this operating table you are How good Oh pretty good I'm a fifth of vodka in and I'm ready to go I
838.22 909.66 speaker3  waking up in the corner and You see the the front pocket the frockett the dad pocket if you will on This humanoid figure begins to wriggle. It's a polo, right? Correct. It's a polo with a frock Southern Tide It's roughly the size of a softball. You have no idea how it fit so well inside this small pocket but this softball sized fish head pops out and begins moving out of the pocket and you see that it's got a tiny little human frame body underneath the fish head, but the head is a Bit too heavy. So as it flops out onto the lap of this humanoid figure gosh, oh so It's so crazy being me and it looks up at its friend this bro dressed
908.10 922.70 speaker2  Hey there
922.06 931.26 speaker3  Oh my gosh
929.26 934.06 speaker2  There's another friend. Oh

942.10 997.62 speaker2  Right now i'm a little too concerned with making new friends. Am I still in my underwear or am I clothed? I I died in my under or I almost died
993.22 1014.58 speaker3  Oh, I am in the room and so are you that's where i'm from and this is a very good room This is my friend
1013.54 1073.62 speaker2  young and you're a
1068.66 1107.70 speaker3  It's not necessarily a fish, but it's more so just like this. Uh, this head, uh with like Okay
1106.74 1126.34 speaker2  You know what? Hearing a little bob seeker peps keith up a little bit. Yeah, I still can't move though So i'm like, hey if there's anything you can do to help me right now Like we I can I can get you to the outside if you can help me out. Oh my god, bret Did you hear that?
1124.18 1140.18 speaker0  Not just that we have to pretend in our own minds
1137.06 1170.58 speaker2  I'll buy you i'll buy you i'll buy you keg a keystone And I will call the delta zetas because they're the easy daisies and we can have a party
1166.58 1193.70 speaker0  Oh, you gotta help me though. I can't deliver any of these but i'm hard
1187.14 1247.22 speaker3  The door opens again and a young girl comes bouncing into the room keith You recognize this girl as your niece Francis beans, I look at her and i'm like fuck Easy-deezy on it the front of it and she's wearing sophies. Is that what they were called? Yeah. Yeah, she's wearing sophies and like What would be the what would be the shoe wear that would go along with this? bounding into a fuck you from her uncle keith vigna and she says God brat, you're like
1245.22 1284.18 speaker0  I call everyone man Because there are no women in my eyes
1279.70 1361.44 speaker3  Um keith you're in a bit of a predicament right now, aren't you? And she pulls uh, she pulls a mirror out of her ass crack and holds it up to your face You actually you see a couple uh surgical lines Uh cross your brow and then down one side of your nose and then across down to your lip and then it moves Uh down your chin kind of down to your collarbone and stops And she's like Let's get into the mechanics of how this has changed keith vigna as a character This is a new part of the show that we're diving into where we're going to add in some pulp cthulhu Mods to these characters for what they've been through and what's happening. So
1359.44 1375.46 speaker2  septum
1370.10 1497.78 speaker3  But and she grabs your hand and she lifts it for you and you see this like Surgical scar going down your index fingertip from the tip of your finger Down to about like the pit of your bow the pit of your elbow. Yeah We saw that you had like an abnormal amount of cocaine in your system And we decided that that was probably necessary in order to keep you going aka also Invariably and indubitably we want to keep you on working for the glass corp our family We think that you could be like a pretty solid asset for us And so we want to make sure you're cooked the fuck out whenever you want it So basically any time you need to like perk up? Just shove that index finger right up in that schnoz of yours And we've loaded up cartridges of cocaine into your hand and your wrist going up to your elbow So there's like a lot of cocaine in there Which basically means in game you can spend 10 luck to refill your willpower points to full hell Yeah You can like shove that finger technically wherever you want and then she winks and she's like wait, you're my uncle So you also took hardened. Yes, uh, which means that you will ignore sanity loss from violence and death from here on out Do you want to explain why you took that you fucking lunatic?
1493.22 1521.62 speaker2  Uh, they also cut out the like empathy part of my brain So I no longer really have empathy for uh other people
1516.90 1640.82 speaker3  Uh waking up for you. And so there is a new disorder that you have If you roll sanity and you fail, but the role that you rolled would also fail on a power check You're going to lose control of your character and just become super aggressive to anyone Who is around you basically because you are going to think that they know what happened to you And we're gonna take care of that because marvin glass takes care of Everyone that he cares for and you're a part of our little family now well, i'm I got out of there real quick. I'm so Ready for a life. That is my own
1638.82 1662.34 speaker2  I think we're a lot alike then And I I flash back real quick to that night where I orchestrated her father's murder and then I snipped back in and i'm
1658.02 1716.98 speaker3  so your body is basically a bit different now and she like Knocks like a door like she knocks on your head on one side of your head and you feel nothing And she's like, yeah, so you're like metal Like basically a lot of you is metal because you are super fucking dead and I brought you back Into this world and i'm so excited to one day maybe take you out of it if it comes to that but maybe it won't anyway, so like I'm, just so excited to have you with us because you seem really easy to manipulate. But anyway, um, we're gonna And she looks over at brett and she's like brett
1714.98 1747.86 speaker0  Mainly the lower parts
1743.46 1763.38 speaker2  Keith just closes his eyes and waits for someone to just let him get up Yeah, i'm i'm resigned to whatever this is right now
1758.18 1799.86 speaker3  And she says well in order to do that. I guess you're gonna be able to need to move your body And uh, she's like i'll be back in a little bit. Maybe just like test it out and like see what you're capable of I guess and um Yeah, i'll be back shortly and she grabs the remote and clicks a button and you immediately feel
1793.06 1817.94 speaker2  I like, you know kind of move my body and I can feel that my left hand that has the uh, coke dispenser Yeah When I like raise up my right arm is like pretty constricted
1812.02 1860.18 speaker3  Willpower and full hit points as the surgery that has been performed on you Has given you a new lease on life okey-dokey So i'm pretty sure that you know how we were talking to him earlier about maybe like letting him like bring us into like The world where we could actually yeah where we could see the world. I thought it'd be fun if maybe um If we like got him to help us
1853.86 1924.26 speaker0  I like saw it in like this one youtube video that I saw when that doctor lady is watching youtube videos about how To turn someone into a robot I saw on this ad Where there's this one place where you can go and you have like money and you gamble it and there's like So huge it's like the size of my entire body a prize no, no, dude, it's like way bigger than that You're forgetting you're forgetting because of your forgetness you're forgetting that but you can't go there and and women they just like Flock to your dick like they love it Like that's what I heard on that one ad that in vegas. There are women there that love it so we could go there Maybe he could take us keith keith keith
1920.98 2013.92 speaker3  Where the women want to flock upon your dick fucking kidding me, man But that's I mean i'm not a sexual creature You know what? Begins like wobbling. I want you to picture this Yeah, it's totally like kin barbie doll with the head replaced by a softball sized fish head Yeah, that's absolutely what it looks like and uh He's like It's taking me so long to walk over here
2010.64 2078.24 speaker2  One of you guys just let me up. You can write on my shoulder. You can write in mine To kind of like lighten the spirit in the room a little bit. I'm a bit dark in here Here we go. Okay, uh, so I get up i've got peter on my shoulder I mean you said there's like body parts like preserved sure and stuff but surgical tools on another wall I

2120.80 2153.04 speaker0  And shorts that are made of some sort of material that's like wet cardboard Uh, but these the shorts are actually a light blue maybe a teal and the top
2151.04 2219.20 speaker2  I put on the the polo Uh the orange polo it is way way too tight for my upper torso And they are like three sizes too big And so I I look around and um, uh, there's a pair of spareys in the the bottom Thank god for that. There's a pair of spareys in the bottom.

Sure And I dunk peter in there. Uh-huh
2308.32 2393.38 speaker3  This is weird that I can talk in here. But also at the same time it's like wow Around and and he like picks up the uh, bobbited penis from the bottom of the jar And like lifts it with his feet up into the position where it looks like it's his The floor the walls and the ceiling it is almost disorienting walking out into it and as your eyes adjust You notice that there are two doors in this hallway
2389.70 2420.90 speaker2  Are they just like uh side by side or they like one on the left one on the right? Uh, yeah, let me take that for a minute I I hand the penis a peter jar, uh, just the peter jar

I'm like, hey, hold on to this peter squared And then you slowly Oh my god slab of black marble and four guards two on either side of the enormous and strange door that Slowly slides open as you approach And these guards are in full brown jumpsuits and they each have a large scythe strapped to their backs And the blade of each scythe is shaped like an enormous fish hook a closer look reveals these men have Unnatural Matching faces their eyes are far apart almost on either side of their face Their noses do not jut out but are rather just two slits above their two wide Thick-lipped mouths and they have a few flaps on either side of their necks Is And the guards
2547.62 2567.38 speaker4  He's like if they take a left and they ask you to do this
2564.02 2578.52 speaker3  I just I just said that uh, we're the chai flap Motherfuckers and we're here to take you the fuck out because we're getting out of this place
2572.58 2599.30 speaker2  Okay, tell them now that we are experiments and we're if you touch us you're going to get the same disease we have
2597.14 2749.98 speaker3  Open, oh you push. I think you're supposed to pull it When I said that you could like move about and figure out like what was going on. I didn't get the fuck Oh my god Okay We're going to see marvin right now and francis like pushes you back in to the door like in the hallway you were coming from and the guards are like right up on the other side and they're bumping into you and they just kind of Heard you toward like they they they surround you and begin walking you down this long hallway back to where we came or No No, you're going toward the door You haven't been in the guards were guarding before I look at them like I was gonna go here anyway movies Moves out of your way and And uh you walk through The doorway and inside you see the room and it is the size of a basketball court and to your left One of the long walls is entirely made of glass Get it There is a murky greenish water on the other side like an aquarium of staggering proportions And marvin glass stands there arms folded behind his back staring into the cloudy water There's no muscle or fat and you can imagine just skin stretched across these long bones And uh marvin's dressed in a fitted black tuxedo He turns around the skin on his chin is almost translucent There's no hair not even a slight shadow of facial hair can be seen on either side of two thin bright red lips Actually, not really lips at all Just candy red lipstick Messily encircling a round hole above the sharp see-through chin And the orifice begins to move
2748.84 2763.98 speaker4  Francis If you wouldn't mind, I don't think I trust him right now
2760.06 2784.22 speaker3  And brett and keith you both freeze fuck Just your limbs like your body from the neck down completely paralyzed, but we're still standing. Yep Oh, yeah, no, yeah. No, it's it's still being held strong. Yeah
2782.22 2809.32 speaker4  I would like to offer you your future I believe that francis has already prepped you on some slight details
2803.78 2828.36 speaker3  Extremely quickly like you see his form just walking but in the blink of an eye He is across the room and he presses into this square on the wall and a panel opens and it reveals One million dollars in cash and he points at it
2822.60 2868.28 speaker4  Keith you have earned this money you have and I want to give it to you But I am afraid of what giving a man like you one million dollars could do for our relationship Now I'm still willing to part with this money, but the surgery that we gave you was Quite expensive so I will require one more deed In order for you to pay off this surgery. I need you to do something for me. Are you willing?
2864.20 2890.60 speaker2  I've already had that realization of I was dead. They've brought me back I realized that i've got that cocaine arm and it seemed a little more powerful than I was before and I feel Very different so I look at the million dollars And I look at marvin
2888.36 2895.24 speaker4  Your loyalty to me
2893.72 2929.22 speaker3  to brett But more specifically the jar that brett is holding and francis Walks through and grabs peter out of the jar aquarium Where marvin is now standing? And she hands peter to marvin
2927.96 2941.72 speaker4  be
2937.72 3019.50 speaker3  Above his chin and the light kind of comes out onto his hand And he grabs peter and he reaches through the wall of the aquarium and releases And then pulls his arm back out through the glass wall of the aquarium and you see that on the other side In this murky water is now swimming about peter deeter and all of the sudden this Except four times bigger swims into focus and swallows Peter deeter hole before swimming back into the darkness of the aquarium Marvin looks back over you And just starts taking him apart from behind Piece by piece falling off metal hitting the floor scraps falling by the wayside All that's left is brett's head human looking head frosted tips akimbo sitting on the floor
3015.48 3033.96 speaker0  Do you even know how much natty light you could buy with a million fucking dollars?
3027.40 3053.06 speaker3  Keith's small but powerful gun the odd camera with the glass tubes all around it And the odd gun with the strange tubes surrounding it And he grabs the tiny powerful pistol that you found in a plus storage in contention And he walks it over to you and he holds it out
3051.06 3106.58 speaker4  belong to me ari manstein Her father will be there Stan manstein is rarely in public. We need to take this opportunity To take him I would like you to bring him back to me for further questioning Is there anything I can do for you Do you like a specific car body armor weapons? Do you need a disguise? Would you like francis to come along with you? Is that too many questions all at once?
3099.78 3106.58 speaker2  I look back over at marvin. I say if I get that million dollars i'm indebted to you already i'll go to loan You
