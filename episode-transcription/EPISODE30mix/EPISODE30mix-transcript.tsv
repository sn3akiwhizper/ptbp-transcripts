0	4620	Namaste and Cthulhu photography. It's KITI city radio
4620	9760	But the only thing softer than the modern human body is the K in our name. I'm your host
14660	18400	What's up my babies, it's your daddy from another laddie
18680	26560	Your mister from Westminster your den leader and late-night trash bin eater wolf the dog
27520	31120	And I'm taking over your radio like mr. Swack hammer
31520	37680	So welcome to six nine four point two PTBP the city's newest and only
38760	40760	pirate radio station
41120	47080	Let's hit him right off the top with a little bit of howlin with wolf. This one comes from at tread
47600	51720	Underscore 26 on Twitter who tagged at pretending pod
51960	53960	What a beautiful thing to
53960	60600	Intentionally spend 30 seconds of your day to make old wolf the dog smile like that this cat at
61040	62120	tread
62120	67560	Underscore 26 sent me a hell of a tale the infamous story of 9pens
67720	71540	I told him the people need to dig into this written word
71680	77040	So he posted the story on the subreddit r slash pretending to be people
77040	82040	So I just wanted to give a shout-out to my good buddy Cyrus 9pens
82040	88360	If you're listening over there at the kitty cat lounge stay safe. I hope everyone is behaving themselves tonight
89200	93320	Well, I'm sure bouncing a bit easier when there isn't much clientele
93480	98440	Which is may I just say an excellent transition into the news?
99440	102160	Contention is a ghost town
102680	110320	The silence is eerie. I guess the disappearance has freaked people out enough to bail and take a panic vacation
110560	117240	I don't blame them my wolf pups. I don't at all shit was getting real spooky up in here
117480	124940	An FBI agent showed up and made an announcement that included the phrase the boys in blue are here for you
125020	128740	And now the contingent police officers are nowhere to be found
129500	131980	So I go out to with a love for
132500	137820	Contention from above came a mission to deliver the tones that will rattle your bones
138060	143300	It's a brand fucking new one folks. It's good zoo with no
144060	146060	backbone
154940	156940	Oh
167660	171140	Welcome to contention. That's that's careful. Yeah
176540	181260	We made it like 30 episodes well, it's still not in there contention
182100	184340	Also also never been said or
185180	187180	cunt tension
188440	190440	Slap that explicit sticker on
191060	196280	We earned it. I liked earning the explicit. Yeah, of course important
196280	200660	We work hard if you're a baby stop listening to this unless you want to know bad words
200660	206220	Yeah, and if you are a baby then listen up while Ally tells you who she is. Hey Ally. Hey, what's up?
207100	210240	My name is Ally Jepsen. I'm a woman
211260	219220	We got one. We finally got one. We got another Zach's wife. I mean, I'm a wife too to myself. Oh, that's cool
219220	224840	Yeah, we have an open relationship those Dennis Rodman style. Yeah, exactly. Are you also friends of North Korea?
226340	227660	Hey, what do you think about this?
227660	233940	Zach and I were talking about a good way to get the divorce rate down is to enact the Bobbitt Act of
234380	238580	2019, you know, like you're fighting over property, you know like
239580	245300	Zach gets if Zach and Taylor got divorced like Zach would get the car. Maybe maybe the house but
246020	248980	Taylor would get to keep sex penis, right? Oh
250700	256960	We think it would drive divorce rates down yeah for sure like what would she do with it though? Well, it's more of a
260140	263660	But then we said Zach said stub porn would
263660	265660	I
269940	275820	Mean people would get pretty into it. They'd have to well, I'm thinking with all the abortion stuff going on right now
275820	277900	You could easily slip this Bobbitt Act
278820	280820	unnoticed
281300	284260	You could do you could throw anything in anywhere right now. Oh
287820	291060	Sometimes I open my mouth and I think about what's happening
291420	296200	Zach is just a sexually aggressive man who can hardly keep his urges
300940	303360	Yeah, so I take out all that energy on this

495920	502820	Yeah, yeah, this is a brief so brief marriage. Did she get their penis? Absolutely. She got their pupusas
504600	506600	All right, let's dive into the show
507020	512000	Keith Vigna you are violently holding a pillow over someone's face when the pillow itself
512460	518480	Transforms into an oily black ooze and it washes over the face below it not of a person
518480	525200	But the face of the watch your father William gave your brother Ferguson so many years ago looking down at your wrist
525200	526860	You see you are wearing this watch
526860	530180	But when you look up you do not recognize the world around you
530460	536740	Dust clouds settle to reveal a horse pulling a wagon through a small frontier town and the bald man
536740	541520	You know is Billy Harrison the one who took your uniform and gun in the clinic
541520	548300	He is walking in your direction and he keeps repeating. I did everything that you asked me to do officer Vigna
548300	554120	He holds up the strange-looking camera officer petty more found in the car of Julie Maxwell and takes a picture of you
554540	559700	The light is blinding and as it fades you were standing in darkness stank and chilly
559820	565100	Right in front of you is a massive tank filled with the now eerily too familiar opaque ooze
565480	569660	you press your face against the tank to see something creeping toward you and
569940	575980	As the face of tilde be Mitchell comes into focus you are standing in an open field
576280	582660	The dead grass covered in a thin freeze crunching under your feet as you approach a metal hatch
583020	590080	But water gross murky water with bits of grass and sludge begin spewing from the creases of this metal hatch
590180	593660	The water begins to flood this field at an alarming pace
593940	599540	You look down and see your reflection in the rippling water, but something looks off
602380	605260	Opening your eyes you see a bright light shining dead
605260	612300	Yeah, yeah shining directly down into your face and a strange silhouette looms over you as your eyes adjust
612340	619340	You see it is a head that is shaped like a football with spiky white hair frantically flopping atop a pointy head
619540	625840	She is wearing a large white lab coat and those big chunky evil scientist goggles that evil
626180	628740	Scientists wear this pair is wonky
628740	634020	However, one goggle pointing down in a way to accommodate the odd head shape of the wearer
634140	640780	She begins slowly tapping her long wobbly fingers against your cheekbone and jawline
641420	643500	But you don't feel anything
644100	648420	Looking around this room. You see you are in some sort of laboratory
648700	655420	You are strapped down on one of several operating tables. The others are currently vacant
655940	661100	Mounted all over one wall are different surgical looking devices some old and rusty
661460	669100	Saws and hammers and the like and some shiny and futuristic with long needles or strange battery packs attached and such
669340	674900	Another wall is covered in shelves with beakers and mason jars of different shapes and sizes
675220	680660	All filled with different colored liquids and body parts some eyes and fingers
680660	684660	But also internal organs some of which you don't even recognize
685280	691300	Running all throughout this room are tubes like in a mail room and they all lead to three large vats
691340	698580	That hang on their sides from the ceiling these tubes and vats seem to be some sort of funhouse style aquarium
698660	702660	with different species of fish swimming throughout this tall
703300	706900	lady scientist walks over to the corner of the room and
707420	709420	reaches behind a
709460	711460	humanoid figure
711700	716340	What is this humanoid figure look like Allie this humanoid figure?
718900	721900	Oops a beer can is a
722780	723820	male
723820	729180	With brown hair with blonde highlights that could easily be mistaken for frosted tips
729780	735420	He is wearing coral shorts a coral shirt, but a slightly different tone of coral
736220	738220	white crew socks and
738220	745260	Sperry's he also has a shell necklace around his neck and as the tall scientist reaches behind
745580	749020	she seems to click or flip something and
749860	751860	this humanoid figure
752140	754140	Starts to move
754180	757880	This is an audio podcast so you don't like my visual humor
758880	762820	the scientist pulls out a little remote that she has and
763220	769480	Walks towards the door the only door in this room and as she turns around looking at you before she leaves
770060	772060	she clicks this button and
772420	774420	both of you feel
775140	782420	Extreme pain shoot through your entire bodies like an electrical current that is attached to
782820	786960	every single nerve ending that you have it is
787980	792740	excruciating and torturous and then she clicks another thing and it's gone and
793620	795620	Then she kind of laughs
800820	802820	And then she walks out of the door
805420	807420	I
809500	815360	Take that in for a second, so I'm strapped down on this operating table you are
815940	817940	How good Oh pretty good
821940	823940	Help me help me
826020	828460	I'm a fifth of vodka in and I'm ready to go
828460	830460	I
831260	837700	Look as Keith looks around the room. He sees the humanoid figure that is started
838220	840220	waking up in the corner and
840620	845500	You see the the front pocket the frockett the dad pocket if you will on
846140	853020	This humanoid figure begins to wriggle. It's a polo, right? Correct. It's a polo with a frock Southern Tide
853260	860740	Polo and as it begins moving you see this little this little fish head pops out and
861620	867460	It's roughly the size of a softball. You have no idea how it fit so well inside this small pocket
867460	875580	but this softball sized fish head pops out and begins moving out of the pocket and you see that it's got a tiny little
876380	877420	human
877420	882140	frame body underneath the fish head, but the head is a
882740	888860	Bit too heavy. So as it flops out onto the lap of this humanoid figure
888860	893100	It's trying to lift its head up and it says hi. Oh
894020	896020	gosh, oh
896300	898060	gosh, oh
898060	899380	so
899380	905100	It's so crazy being me and it looks up at its friend this bro dressed
905580	907580	Humanoid figure and it says hey
908100	909660	Hey there
909660	915740	Hey there, remember me, uh, yeah fucker I remember you why you always talk to me like that
915740	922060	So I just don't really care for any of the language being so intense, but that's that's fine. Oh, hey
922060	922700	Oh my gosh
922700	929260	And the little fish character looks looks over at the table and says we got we got we got a friend in here
929260	931260	There's another friend. Oh

1223700	1228340	It would be pink yeezys pink yeezys and she comes
1228800	1234100	bounding into a fuck you from her uncle keith vigna and she says
1234900	1236020	oh my
1236020	1238020	God brat, you're like
1238900	1245060	Up that's so crazy right now. Uh, what's up? Uh, how old are you man? Are you like this is a girl?
1245220	1247220	I call everyone man
1247220	1249380	Because there are no women in my eyes
1251540	1257080	I've got a weird weird complex going on here. Yeah women suck. They don't even exist
1260580	1262580	Can't respect something that exists
1263460	1265380	Wait, how old is said niece?
1265380	1271700	She like does that thing where she tilts her ponytail to one side and like bounces it with her palm
1272260	1278900	Old enough to know better than getting with a guy like you brat you fucking loser. Okay, so where were we?
1279700	1284180	Um keith you're in a bit of a predicament right now, aren't you?
1285620	1289540	Yeah, I mean all thanks to you pretty much. Yeah 100
1289600	1294900	100% like you don't even know what's happening. It's so crazy. Do you want to see a mirror?
1295540	1299940	And she pulls uh, she pulls a mirror out of her ass crack and holds it up
1301140	1302820	to your face
1302820	1306100	You actually you see a couple uh surgical lines
1306500	1313540	Uh cross your brow and then down one side of your nose and then across down to your lip and then it moves
1313940	1317540	Uh down your chin kind of down to your collarbone and stops
1318340	1319940	And she's like
1319940	1324260	Let's get into the mechanics of how this has changed keith vigna as a character
1325460	1328580	Like in my mind i'm like what the fuck is she talking about?
1328660	1332740	So basically what we want to get into here is this is uh
1332820	1338680	This is a new part of the show that we're diving into where we're going to add in some pulp cthulhu
1339380	1344020	Mods to these characters for what they've been through and what's happening. So
1344580	1351700	Luke do you want to explain what happened starting from uh, your new talents that you got from the pulp cthulhu rulebook
1351860	1358580	I'm sure zack will explain how this happened. But keith has a variant of iron liver. We'll call it iron
1359440	1361440	septum
1362180	1364500	And francis, uh explained she's like
1365300	1370100	Okay, so like I know you can't move right now because she's got you on off
1370100	1375460	But and she grabs your hand and she lifts it for you and you see this like
1375780	1379780	Surgical scar going down your index fingertip from the tip of your finger
1380340	1385140	Down to about like the pit of your bow the pit of your elbow. Yeah
1385300	1393540	Yeah, so when we were running all like the tests basically on you to like save your life because you were dead
1394100	1399220	We saw that you had like an abnormal amount of cocaine in your system
1399780	1405860	And we decided that that was probably necessary in order to keep you going aka also
1406640	1412660	Invariably and indubitably we want to keep you on working for the glass corp our family
1412980	1416260	We think that you could be like a pretty solid asset for us
1416420	1420580	And so we want to make sure you're cooked the fuck out whenever you want it
1420660	1425540	So basically any time you need to like perk up?
1425860	1429620	Just shove that index finger right up in that schnoz of yours
1430260	1437460	And we've loaded up cartridges of cocaine into your hand and your wrist going up to your elbow
1437620	1440020	So there's like a lot of cocaine in there
1440900	1448260	Which basically means in game you can spend 10 luck to refill your willpower points to full hell
1448340	1449220	Yeah
1449220	1451220	Ali, you know what I mean?
1451940	1454820	No homo, but stick that finger in my nose
1456260	1459060	And you also picked up another uh, can I boof it?
1460900	1467060	You can like shove that finger technically wherever you want and then she winks and she's like wait, you're my uncle
1468420	1472820	That's nasty. Anywho, I need to stay off porn hub
1474340	1476340	It's what everyone's into now
1477140	1485220	So you also took hardened. Yes, uh, which means that you will ignore sanity loss from violence and death from here on out
1485220	1488260	Do you want to explain why you took that you fucking lunatic?
1488420	1492980	Yeah, uh, well it's because after they did that surgery for the coke arm
1493220	1497780	Uh, they also cut out the like empathy part of my brain
1498660	1503300	So I no longer really have empathy for uh other people
1503300	1507300	So violence to other people does not affect me at all. Awesome
1507940	1511940	We had talked about you hitting your breaking point in this past day
1512180	1516740	And how you would have a new disorder when you woke up i'm going to consider this
1516900	1521620	Uh waking up for you. And so there is a new disorder that you have
1522260	1529300	If you roll sanity and you fail, but the role that you rolled would also fail on a power check
1529620	1535300	You're going to lose control of your character and just become super aggressive to anyone
1535540	1540980	Who is around you basically because you are going to think that they know what happened to you
1541060	1545780	All right, and i'm gonna do that and not tell anyone about it. Yes. Yeah
1545940	1550420	I don't remember what my other disorders were. I you need to lie a lot. Yes, absolutely
1550500	1553780	and we have uh, i've lied a little bit absolutely i've uh, just
1554580	1560340	Mostly not said that the truth the truth exactly. Yeah, you know, it's a different kind of lying
1560980	1565540	Francis is standing over. It's like when someone's like when's the last time you ate rbs? I'm like, I don't remember
1566660	1568660	middle school probably and
1571940	1576020	As your mind wanders back to last wednesday
1576960	1583460	Afternoon in your bathtub. I yelled at this 16 year old at harvey's i'm like there's not enough cheese on this
1583860	1590180	I ordered six roast beef and cheese sandwiches and there's only five in the bag high schooler
1590340	1592660	Let me talk to your 18 year old manager
1594420	1596420	I require cheddar
1597380	1604980	Okay, so like I understand that you require cheddar and I promised you a million dollars for killing your brother
1605300	1609700	And we're gonna take care of that because marvin glass takes care of
1610480	1616020	Everyone that he cares for and you're a part of our little family now
1617060	1618660	well, i'm
1618660	1622260	Was also part of I am a part of your you are a part of my family
1622340	1629960	No, that's like not even my family anymore like ferguson was maybe the worst father that's ever existed
1630100	1632260	I got out of there real quick. I'm so
1633060	1635620	Ready for a life. That is my own
1636180	1638180	Keith thinks about that for a second goes
1638820	1640820	I think we're a lot alike then
1642420	1645220	And I I flash back real quick to
1646100	1651620	that night where I orchestrated her father's murder and then I snipped back in and i'm
1652020	1657940	Kind of on board with his whole glass family thing. She sees the turn in your eyes and she's like, okay
1658020	1662340	so your body is basically a bit different now and she like
1663140	1669700	Knocks like a door like she knocks on your head on one side of your head and you feel nothing
1670740	1673300	And she's like, yeah, so you're like metal
1674260	1680020	Like basically a lot of you is metal because you are super fucking dead and I brought you back
1680580	1682740	Into this world and i'm
1683540	1690020	so excited to one day maybe take you out of it if it comes to that but maybe it won't anyway, so like
1690580	1697700	I'm, just so excited to have you with us because you seem really easy to manipulate. But anyway, um, we're gonna
1698660	1703140	Need you to get acquainted more so like with your body and stuff
1703620	1706500	And she looks over at brett and she's like brett
1706980	1714100	Are you capable of getting keith ready to be in this new body that he has? Oh, I can tell you all about your body
1714980	1716980	Mainly the lower parts
1717140	1722100	My favorite part of the body like the calves are like knees maybe no above
1723140	1725140	above it
1725380	1728420	Keith like looks down and then looks back up at brendan goes
1729380	1736360	No, homo no homo man, but I i'm so stoked to tell you about your new dick
1743460	1747860	Keith just closes his eyes and waits for someone to just let him get up
1747940	1751220	Yeah, i'm i'm resigned to whatever this is right now
1751460	1757860	So francis pulls a remote very similar to the remote that the scientists pulled out earlier
1758180	1763380	And she says well in order to do that. I guess you're gonna be able to need to move your body
1764020	1768900	And uh, she's like i'll be back in a little bit. Maybe just like test it out and like
1769620	1773300	see what you're capable of I guess and um
1773860	1779620	Yeah, i'll be back shortly and she grabs the remote and clicks a button and you immediately feel
1780180	1787700	Through your entire body that you have control over what what's happening and she um, she's like brett you got his restraints, right?
1787940	1792980	Like as she's walking out the door and then she closes the door behind her before i'm unrestrained
1793060	1799860	I like, you know kind of move my body and I can feel that my left hand that has the uh, coke dispenser
1800020	1800660	Yeah
1800660	1803540	When I like raise up my right arm is like pretty constricted
1803540	1811300	But my left arm like goes a little farther than it would have nice. I need you to change your character sheet to a full
1812020	1817940	Willpower and full hit points as the surgery that has been performed on you
1818500	1821540	Has given you a new lease on life
1822160	1824160	okey-dokey
1824340	1825540	Brett
1825540	1827700	Brett we got one. Okay, so check this out
1827780	1834180	So i'm pretty sure that you know how we were talking to him earlier about maybe like letting him like bring us into like
1834260	1839220	The world where we could actually yeah where we could see the world. I thought it'd be fun if maybe um
1839940	1842020	If we like got him to help us
1842660	1847540	Go see the the rest of the world like go go out and explore dude
1847700	1853620	Do you think he would like take us to vegas? Maybe what's a vegas vegas? Okay, listen
1853860	1860180	I like saw it in like this one youtube video that I saw when that doctor lady is watching youtube videos about how
1860340	1863380	To turn someone into a robot I saw on this ad
1863780	1869940	Where there's this one place where you can go and you have like money and you gamble it and there's like
1870740	1876420	Women there also that sounds so extraordinary. Yeah, like I know you're not a sexual person
1876660	1880260	But like women are there wait, what's the one like, what do you mean?
1880500	1885860	Okay, so like me, you know have like the hugest dick on the planet. Yeah, i've seen it. It's like it's like
1886100	1892340	So huge it's like the size of my entire body a prize no, no, dude, it's like way bigger than that
1892340	1898820	You're forgetting you're forgetting because of your forgetness you're forgetting that but you can't go there and and women they just like
1899120	1901780	Flock to your dick like they love it
1901860	1906740	Like that's what I heard on that one ad that in vegas. There are women there that love it so we could go there
1906740	1909140	Maybe he could take us keith keith keith
1909700	1915700	Keith will you take us to vegas if that's what you want? I mean i've never been but what it seems like
1915940	1920980	Trash, you've been allowed to go out into the world this whole time and you've never been to this magical place
1920980	1924260	Where the women want to flock upon your dick fucking kidding me, man
1924500	1928020	I could peg you as more of like a miami guy you can peg me if you want
1928100	1930740	But that's I mean i'm not a sexual creature
1932340	1933460	You know what?
1933460	1938100	Let's get the fuck out of here. I will take you anywhere you want to go. We can go to freaking

2303520	2307760	Oh, wait, i'm, uh, i'm a fish I can oh, yeah, okay. Yeah. No, this is
2308320	2312100	This is weird that I can talk in here. But also at the same time it's like wow
2312580	2315700	Oh being this close to one of these monsters, right?
2316420	2321940	Yeah, too bad. It's not as big as mine. Yeah. Well, it probably wouldn't fit in this mason jar. You're fucking right
2322020	2327700	We need a five gallon pail. That's cool, bro. Like hey if we don't leave now, I bet we're all gonna get caught
2327940	2332180	Yeah, so part of your hazing is you have to stay in here. So I grab the jar and i'm carrying the jar
2332420	2334420	Me
2337220	2340340	Peter is putting his little fish head over the top
2340420	2348180	His body is in the preservatives with the penis, but his head is just hanging out perfect and uh, peter starts moving his bottom legs
2348340	2354900	Around and and he like picks up the uh, bobbited penis from the bottom of the jar
2355060	2360580	And like lifts it with his feet up into the position where it looks like it's his
2361300	2363300	I'm a sexual queeter
2365540	2370420	And we leave this room finally, yeah, we we we walk out the only exit
2371060	2376740	Walking out you walk into a hallway that is made completely out of black marble
2377300	2385380	The floor the walls and the ceiling it is almost disorienting walking out into it and as your eyes adjust
2386020	2389620	You notice that there are two doors in this hallway
2389700	2393380	Are they just like uh side by side or they like one on the left one on the right?
2393460	2397780	Let's go one on the left one on the right. Have either of you ever been out of that room before?
2398340	2402900	Nope, no, um chai flaps forever. Yeah for life
2403460	2409700	Okay, let's go to the left one. I'm I lead the way. You know what I I hand the uh jar
2410500	2416260	Uh, yeah, let me take that for a minute I I hand the penis a peter jar, uh, just the peter jar
2416340	2420900	I think just peter jar the peter jar. I hand it over to bret. I'm like, hey, hold on to this peter squared
2421140	2424340	Wow, this jar is so light because how small the stick is compared to mine
2425620	2429060	I turn the knob to the door on the left and
2431060	2436900	Open it up. Oh, so there's actually no, uh, just push just yeah, it's a push. It's a push door. I push it open then
2437780	2443220	No, it's actually a pole, uh, so no actually I was here yesterday it goes both ways
2446020	2448020	And then you slowly
2449060	2452980	I just pushed my shoulder into it and i'm like looking back at them. I'm like, yeah
2453780	2455860	It's one of the best sketches i've ever seen
2457220	2459220	Oh my god
2459300	2466180	Okay, as you walk through this doorway you see another hallway and at the end of this hallway is a 10 by 10
2466420	2473300	slab of black marble and four guards two on either side of the enormous and strange door that
2473600	2476180	Slowly slides open as you approach
2476900	2483860	And these guards are in full brown jumpsuits and they each have a large scythe strapped to their backs
2484500	2491620	And the blade of each scythe is shaped like an enormous fish hook a closer look reveals these men have
2492160	2493120	Unnatural
2493120	2497940	Matching faces their eyes are far apart almost on either side of their face
2498260	2503460	Their noses do not jut out but are rather just two slits above their two wide
2503940	2508980	Thick-lipped mouths and they have a few flaps on either side of their necks
2509620	2514120	They look eerily similar to peter deeter. Hey peter speak your language of these guys
2521620	2523620	Is
2524740	2526740	And the guards
2528340	2530980	You got a pretty pretty star wars
2533620	2535620	I like star wars
2538660	2542900	Do you practice that just by sticking your face in your shower head and just like well
2542900	2547380	No, uh zack actually has that written down on his computer right in front of him
2547620	2550180	He's like if they take a left and they ask you to do this
2552580	2558340	And uh as as peter says that the uh, the guards begin marching toward you
2558900	2563940	And peter looks up and he goes I I don't think what did you say to them?
2564020	2567380	I just I just said that uh, we're the chai flap
2568000	2572500	Motherfuckers and we're here to take you the fuck out because we're getting out of this place
2572580	2578520	Okay, tell them now that we are experiments and we're if you touch us you're going to get the same disease we have
2581620	2583620	Oh
2586900	2589140	And the guards do not cease
2591060	2597060	Okay, I turn around and i'm like let's go to the other door and I run out and I press the door on the right
2597140	2599300	Open, oh you push. I think you're supposed to pull it
2599860	2605220	I however to get the fucking door open. I do that very quickly while these guys are walking at us
2605700	2608660	and as you go through that door you hear the
2609360	2611360	wonderful
2611360	2613360	stellar tones of
2614240	2615840	Oh my
2615840	2616960	God
2616960	2624000	When I said that you could like move about and figure out like what was going on. I didn't get the fuck
2624240	2625280	Oh my god
2625280	2625600	Okay
2625600	2632560	We're going to see marvin right now and francis like pushes you back in to the door like in the hallway
2632560	2637200	you were coming from and the guards are like right up on the other side and they're bumping into you and they just kind of
2637920	2645120	Heard you toward like they they they surround you and begin walking you down this long hallway back to where we came or
2645360	2646000	No
2646000	2647440	No, you're going toward the door
2647440	2652400	You haven't been in the guards were guarding before I look at them like I was gonna go here anyway
2652640	2658560	And you walk through as this, um, this giant slab of black marvel
2659200	2660560	movies
2660560	2662560	Moves out of your way
2662560	2664560	and
2664560	2666560	And uh you walk through
2667120	2674000	The doorway and inside you see the room and it is the size of a basketball court and to your left
2674240	2677840	One of the long walls is entirely made of glass
2678400	2679680	Get it
2679680	2686180	There is a murky greenish water on the other side like an aquarium of staggering proportions
2686480	2693520	And marvin glass stands there arms folded behind his back staring into the cloudy water
2695360	2697360	So
2698240	2705920	Marvin glass stands there. You've seen him once before he has a massive frame, but it is completely gone
2706080	2713120	There's no muscle or fat and you can imagine just skin stretched across these long bones
2713920	2718260	And uh marvin's dressed in a fitted black tuxedo
2718560	2722240	He turns around the skin on his chin is almost translucent
2722320	2729040	There's no hair not even a slight shadow of facial hair can be seen on either side of two thin bright red lips
2729440	2731600	Actually, not really lips at all
2732160	2734160	Just candy red lipstick
2734780	2740240	Messily encircling a round hole above the sharp see-through chin
2740880	2743360	And the orifice begins to move
2745340	2747340	Hello keith
2747740	2748840	Marvin
2748840	2749980	Francis
2749980	2755260	If you wouldn't mind, I don't think I trust him right now
2755820	2759420	And francis pulls that remote out of her pocket and clicks a button
2760060	2763980	And brett and keith you both freeze fuck
2765340	2771420	Just your limbs like your body from the neck down completely paralyzed, but we're still standing. Yep
2771900	2773900	I was worried about the penis jar
2774460	2778860	Oh, yeah, no, yeah. No, it's it's still being held strong. Yeah
2780140	2782140	keith
2782220	2784220	I would like to offer you
2785420	2787420	your future
2787500	2792720	I believe that francis has already prepped you on some slight details
2793340	2800860	Of your new form. I want to just say thank you and in order for me to say thank you to you
2801740	2803720	marvin walks
2803780	2809320	Extremely quickly like you see his form just walking but in the blink of an eye
2809480	2816680	He is across the room and he presses into this square on the wall and a panel opens and it reveals
2817960	2821080	One million dollars in cash and he points at it
2822600	2828360	Keith you have earned this money you have and I want to give it to you
2828520	2836060	But I am afraid of what giving a man like you one million dollars could do for our relationship
2837720	2838920	Now
2838920	2844360	I'm still willing to part with this money, but the surgery that we gave you was
2844900	2850440	Quite expensive so I will require one more deed
2850920	2857880	In order for you to pay off this surgery. I need you to do something for me. Are you willing?
2858360	2864120	To do something for me. I look at the million dollars and in keith's mind
2864200	2868280	I've already had that realization of I was dead. They've brought me back
2868440	2874840	I realized that i've got that cocaine arm and it seemed a little more powerful than I was before and I feel
2875160	2877640	Very different so I look at the million dollars
2878600	2880440	And I look at marvin
2880440	2882440	Who what is it?
2882440	2887640	In order for me to even tell you I need you to show
2888360	2890600	Your loyalty to me
2891480	2893480	and he gestures
2893720	2895240	to brett
2895240	2898680	But more specifically the jar that brett is holding
2899720	2901240	and francis
2901240	2904680	Walks through and grabs peter out of the jar
2905320	2912200	Oh, oh, thank you so much. Mommy. I'm just so glad that I could be here for anything. Oh, bye. Dad. Bye. Dad
2912600	2917400	Bye dad and she walks over to the extremely large
2918020	2919080	aquarium
2919080	2921080	Where marvin is now standing?
2922280	2924600	And she hands peter to marvin
2925640	2927640	some things must
2927960	2929220	be
2929220	2931080	sacrificed
2931080	2937180	And he whispers under his breath and you see this bright light inside of the orifice
2937720	2941720	Above his chin and the light kind of comes out onto his hand
2942280	2947340	And he grabs peter and he reaches through the wall of the aquarium
2948520	2950360	and releases
2950360	2956840	And then pulls his arm back out through the glass wall of the aquarium and you see that on the other side
2957080	2963480	In this murky water is now swimming about peter deeter and all of the sudden this
2964340	2970120	Massive creature that looks almost exactly like the guards that were outside
2970600	2976220	Except four times bigger swims into focus and swallows
2976840	2982300	Peter deeter hole before swimming back into the darkness of the aquarium
2983080	2985080	Marvin looks back over you
2985960	2992920	Uh, let's let's take it one more perhaps and francis beans walks over to brett
2993800	2997160	And just starts taking him apart from behind
2997800	3003100	Piece by piece falling off metal hitting the floor scraps falling by the wayside
3003640	3009880	All that's left is brett's head human looking head frosted tips akimbo sitting on the floor
3010520	3015240	and with one final breath brett says do it man
3015480	3019500	Do you even know how much natty light you could buy with a million fucking dollars?
3021080	3026860	Marvin is immediately back on the other side of the room. He presses into another panel reveals
3027400	3033960	Keith's small but powerful gun the odd camera with the glass tubes all around it
3034600	3038760	And the odd gun with the strange tubes surrounding it
3039880	3046220	And he grabs the tiny powerful pistol that you found in a plus storage in contention
3046600	3049000	And he walks it over to you and he holds it out
3049960	3051060	you
3051060	3053060	belong to me
3054020	3057080	I will send you off to the cemetery
3057620	3061960	There is a funeral happening for your former co-worker
3063060	3064820	ari manstein
3064820	3066820	Her father will be there
3066900	3072040	Stan manstein is rarely in public. We need to take this opportunity
3073540	3075220	To take him
3075220	3077380	I would like you to bring him back to me
3077940	3079940	for further questioning
3080020	3082020	Is there anything I can do for you
3082020	3086680	Do you like a specific car body armor weapons? Do you need a disguise?
3087300	3090180	Would you like francis to come along with you?
3090900	3092900	Is that too many questions all at once?
3093540	3099380	I look at him still paralyzed. Yep. I look over brett. I say i'm sorry, but pour one out for you
3099780	3106580	I look back over at marvin. I say if I get that million dollars i'm indebted to you already i'll go to loan
3107220	3109220	Just like this
3110900	3112900	So
3124500	3129460	How am I the only one trying to
3134580	3136580	Heaven
3140100	3142100	Yes
3158420	3160420	You
