1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,620
Namaste and Cthulhu photography. It's KITI city radio

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:09,760
But the only thing softer than the modern human body is the K in our name. I'm your host

3
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:18,400
What's up my babies, it's your daddy from another laddie

4
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:26,560
Your mister from Westminster your den leader and late-night trash bin eater wolf the dog

5
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:31,120
And I'm taking over your radio like mr. Swack hammer

6
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:37,680
So welcome to six nine four point two PTBP the city's newest and only

7
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,760
pirate radio station

8
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:47,080
Let's hit him right off the top with a little bit of howlin with wolf. This one comes from at tread

9
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,720
Underscore 26 on Twitter who tagged at pretending pod

10
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,960
What a beautiful thing to

11
00:00:53,960 --> 00:01:00,600
Intentionally spend 30 seconds of your day to make old wolf the dog smile like that this cat at

12
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,120
tread

13
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:07,560
Underscore 26 sent me a hell of a tale the infamous story of 9pens

14
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:11,540
I told him the people need to dig into this written word

15
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,040
So he posted the story on the subreddit r slash pretending to be people

16
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,040
So I just wanted to give a shout-out to my good buddy Cyrus 9pens

17
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:28,360
If you're listening over there at the kitty cat lounge stay safe. I hope everyone is behaving themselves tonight

18
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,320
Well, I'm sure bouncing a bit easier when there isn't much clientele

19
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:38,440
Which is may I just say an excellent transition into the news?

20
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,160
Contention is a ghost town

21
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:50,320
The silence is eerie. I guess the disappearance has freaked people out enough to bail and take a panic vacation

22
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:57,240
I don't blame them my wolf pups. I don't at all shit was getting real spooky up in here

23
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:04,940
An FBI agent showed up and made an announcement that included the phrase the boys in blue are here for you

24
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:08,740
And now the contingent police officers are nowhere to be found

25
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,980
So I go out to with a love for

26
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:17,820
Contention from above came a mission to deliver the tones that will rattle your bones

27
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:23,300
It's a brand fucking new one folks. It's good zoo with no

28
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,060
backbone

29
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,940
Oh

30
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:51,140
Welcome to contention. That's that's careful. Yeah

31
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:01,260
We made it like 30 episodes well, it's still not in there contention

32
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,340
Also also never been said or

33
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:07,180
cunt tension

34
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,440
Slap that explicit sticker on

35
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:16,280
We earned it. I liked earning the explicit. Yeah, of course important

36
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,660
We work hard if you're a baby stop listening to this unless you want to know bad words

37
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:26,220
Yeah, and if you are a baby then listen up while Ally tells you who she is. Hey Ally. Hey, what's up?

38
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:30,240
My name is Ally Jepsen. I'm a woman

39
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:39,220
We got one. We finally got one. We got another Zach's wife. I mean, I'm a wife too to myself. Oh, that's cool

40
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:44,840
Yeah, we have an open relationship those Dennis Rodman style. Yeah, exactly. Are you also friends of North Korea?

41
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,660
Hey, what do you think about this?

42
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:53,940
Zach and I were talking about a good way to get the divorce rate down is to enact the Bobbitt Act of

43
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:58,580
2019, you know, like you're fighting over property, you know like

44
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:05,300
Zach gets if Zach and Taylor got divorced like Zach would get the car. Maybe maybe the house but

45
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:08,980
Taylor would get to keep sex penis, right? Oh

46
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:16,960
We think it would drive divorce rates down yeah for sure like what would she do with it though? Well, it's more of a

47
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:23,660
But then we said Zach said stub porn would

48
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,660
I

49
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:35,820
Mean people would get pretty into it. They'd have to well, I'm thinking with all the abortion stuff going on right now

50
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,900
You could easily slip this Bobbitt Act

51
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,820
unnoticed

52
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:44,260
You could do you could throw anything in anywhere right now. Oh

53
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:51,060
Sometimes I open my mouth and I think about what's happening

54
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:56,200
Zach is just a sexually aggressive man who can hardly keep his urges

55
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:03,360
Yeah, so I take out all that energy on this

56
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:08,020
For you the listener for just for you. Yeah, Ally

57
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:14,860
Have you ever role-played before literally never unless you can't with myself weird your wife. Yeah

58
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:18,840
Well, if it's in the marital bedroom, it's fine. That's what I always say

59
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:23,600
Nope never role-played. I'm very excited to be here. Welcome. We're excited to have you here. Yeah

60
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,060
We're not gonna get to plugs at any point at the end of the show

61
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:32,900
so go ahead and plug away now if you if you have anything you'd like to

62
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:38,000
Hmm. Let's see. I sell stud penises from divorcees

63
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,760

Calm

68
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:56,040
I'm surprised that wasn't taken. It wasn't well, I mean, yeah, we'll talk about that later. It's a live journal

69
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,920
I'm a

70
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:06,840
Comedian and a local gal pal comedy show called basement cats and we have great shows once a month in

71
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:13,200
Spring Vegas, Missouri and where's where is that compared to Springfield?

72
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,680
In the same place cool cool cool. It's a lifestyle. It's a state of mind. Yeah, exactly

Anywhere in particular you you move around we move around but you can find us on Instagram at basement cats with a K

75
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,280
Because people will be looking for

76
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,960
A lot of our listeners we found are on LinkedIn

77
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:55,280
We get the strangest analytics for this show tell us a little bit about basement cats though, yes, please

78
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:59,280
Basement cats like I said is a all-female comedy show

79
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:05,600
We are here to give women a voice in comedy and we are a nonprofit

80
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,860
So we're a free show we accept donations

81
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:15,940
Which we give to a to a local girls home that assists with girls aging out of the foster care system

82
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:22,320
And we love being funny. That's awesome. Luke and I actually came to a show when we were

83
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,880
scouting you

84
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,360
Went to the one at Big Mama's. Yeah, and it was so much fun. I was it was pretty great

85
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:38,480
That was I have to say one of my least favorite really we had so you still very good another one

86
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,880
All right, good to know. Yep. Mm-hmm. I like the

87
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,400
Chowder house. Oh

88
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,240
That was my favorite thing of the night. It was the Chowder house is up still up and running

89
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,700
She does she did a corn on the cob eating contest. Yeah

90
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:59,320
Well, so she sold it to and I quote her Facebook the Peruvian

91
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,800
Who

92
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:10,440
Well, they they for like two weeks and then I think like now she's back there

93
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:15,760
So I don't really know how that worked out. So are her and the Peruvians in cahoots. No, they got an annulment

94
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:22,820
Yeah, yeah, this is a brief so brief marriage. Did she get their penis? Absolutely. She got their pupusas

95
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,600
All right, let's dive into the show

96
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:32,000
Keith Vigna you are violently holding a pillow over someone's face when the pillow itself

97
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:38,480
Transforms into an oily black ooze and it washes over the face below it not of a person

98
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:45,200
But the face of the watch your father William gave your brother Ferguson so many years ago looking down at your wrist

99
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,860
You see you are wearing this watch

100
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,180
But when you look up you do not recognize the world around you

101
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:56,740
Dust clouds settle to reveal a horse pulling a wagon through a small frontier town and the bald man

102
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:01,520
You know is Billy Harrison the one who took your uniform and gun in the clinic

103
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:08,300
He is walking in your direction and he keeps repeating. I did everything that you asked me to do officer Vigna

104
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:14,120
He holds up the strange-looking camera officer petty more found in the car of Julie Maxwell and takes a picture of you

105
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:19,700
The light is blinding and as it fades you were standing in darkness stank and chilly

106
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:25,100
Right in front of you is a massive tank filled with the now eerily too familiar opaque ooze

107
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:29,660
you press your face against the tank to see something creeping toward you and

108
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:35,980
As the face of tilde be Mitchell comes into focus you are standing in an open field

109
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:42,660
The dead grass covered in a thin freeze crunching under your feet as you approach a metal hatch

110
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:50,080
But water gross murky water with bits of grass and sludge begin spewing from the creases of this metal hatch

111
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:53,660
The water begins to flood this field at an alarming pace

112
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:59,540
You look down and see your reflection in the rippling water, but something looks off

113
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:05,260
Opening your eyes you see a bright light shining dead

114
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:12,300
Yeah, yeah shining directly down into your face and a strange silhouette looms over you as your eyes adjust

115
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:19,340
You see it is a head that is shaped like a football with spiky white hair frantically flopping atop a pointy head

116
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:25,840
She is wearing a large white lab coat and those big chunky evil scientist goggles that evil

117
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,740
Scientists wear this pair is wonky

118
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:34,020
However, one goggle pointing down in a way to accommodate the odd head shape of the wearer

119
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:40,780
She begins slowly tapping her long wobbly fingers against your cheekbone and jawline

120
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:43,500
But you don't feel anything

121
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:48,420
Looking around this room. You see you are in some sort of laboratory

122
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:55,420
You are strapped down on one of several operating tables. The others are currently vacant

123
00:10:55,940 --> 00:11:01,100
Mounted all over one wall are different surgical looking devices some old and rusty

124
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:09,100
Saws and hammers and the like and some shiny and futuristic with long needles or strange battery packs attached and such

125
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:14,900
Another wall is covered in shelves with beakers and mason jars of different shapes and sizes

126
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:20,660
All filled with different colored liquids and body parts some eyes and fingers

127
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:24,660
But also internal organs some of which you don't even recognize

128
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:31,300
Running all throughout this room are tubes like in a mail room and they all lead to three large vats

129
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:38,580
That hang on their sides from the ceiling these tubes and vats seem to be some sort of funhouse style aquarium

130
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:42,660
with different species of fish swimming throughout this tall

131
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:46,900
lady scientist walks over to the corner of the room and

132
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,420
reaches behind a

133
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,460
humanoid figure

134
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:56,340
What is this humanoid figure look like Allie this humanoid figure?

135
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,900
Oops a beer can is a

136
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:03,820
male

137
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:09,180
With brown hair with blonde highlights that could easily be mistaken for frosted tips

138
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:15,420
He is wearing coral shorts a coral shirt, but a slightly different tone of coral

139
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:18,220
white crew socks and

140
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:25,260
Sperry's he also has a shell necklace around his neck and as the tall scientist reaches behind

141
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:29,020
she seems to click or flip something and

142
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,860
this humanoid figure

143
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,140
Starts to move

144
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:37,880
This is an audio podcast so you don't like my visual humor

145
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,820
the scientist pulls out a little remote that she has and

146
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:49,480
Walks towards the door the only door in this room and as she turns around looking at you before she leaves

147
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,060
she clicks this button and

148
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,420
both of you feel

149
00:12:55,140 --> 00:13:02,420
Extreme pain shoot through your entire bodies like an electrical current that is attached to

150
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:06,960
every single nerve ending that you have it is

151
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:12,740
excruciating and torturous and then she clicks another thing and it's gone and

152
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,620
Then she kind of laughs

153
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,820
And then she walks out of the door

154
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:27,420
I

155
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:35,360
Take that in for a second, so I'm strapped down on this operating table you are

156
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,940
How good Oh pretty good

157
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,940
Help me help me

158
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:48,460
I'm a fifth of vodka in and I'm ready to go

159
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,460
I

160
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:57,700
Look as Keith looks around the room. He sees the humanoid figure that is started

161
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:00,220
waking up in the corner and

162
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:05,500
You see the the front pocket the frockett the dad pocket if you will on

163
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:13,020
This humanoid figure begins to wriggle. It's a polo, right? Correct. It's a polo with a frock Southern Tide

164
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:20,740
Polo and as it begins moving you see this little this little fish head pops out and

165
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:27,460
It's roughly the size of a softball. You have no idea how it fit so well inside this small pocket

166
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:35,580
but this softball sized fish head pops out and begins moving out of the pocket and you see that it's got a tiny little

167
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,420
human

168
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:42,140
frame body underneath the fish head, but the head is a

169
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:48,860
Bit too heavy. So as it flops out onto the lap of this humanoid figure

170
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:53,100
It's trying to lift its head up and it says hi. Oh

171
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:56,020
gosh, oh

172
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,060
gosh, oh

173
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,380
so

174
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:05,100
It's so crazy being me and it looks up at its friend this bro dressed

175
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:07,580
Humanoid figure and it says hey

176
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,660
Hey there

177
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:15,740
Hey there, remember me, uh, yeah fucker I remember you why you always talk to me like that

178
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:22,060
So I just don't really care for any of the language being so intense, but that's that's fine. Oh, hey

179
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:22,700
Oh my gosh

180
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:29,260
And the little fish character looks looks over at the table and says we got we got we got a friend in here

181
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,260
There's another friend. Oh

182
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,020
Oh

183
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,060
Hey

184
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,940
Yeah, we got a friend

185
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:41,460
And he hollers out and he says hey hey friend I look over at him but I

186
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:48,180
Right now i'm a little too concerned with making new friends. Am I still in my underwear or am I clothed?

187
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:51,460
I I died in my under or I almost died

188
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,540
I died in my underwear

189
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:58,420
You died in your underwear you woke in your underwear and it's weird as you move your head around you realize

190
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:05,300
That you can't move your limbs your legs and your arms are like am I paralyzed or just tied down? It feels

235
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:18,580
Yeah, I knew it when I went to when I went to a police academy in the city

236

Oh

241
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:46,420
And as this conversation carries on for god knows how long

242
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:53,700
The door opens again and a young girl comes bouncing into the room keith

243
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,500
You recognize this girl as your niece

244
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,500
Francis beans, I look at her and i'm like fuck

245
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,300
you

246
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:10,660
And uh francis beans is wearing a t-shirt that says

247
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:19,140
Easy-deezy on it the front of it and she's wearing sophies. Is that what they were called? Yeah. Yeah, she's wearing sophies and like

248
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:23,620
What would be the what would be the shoe wear that would go along with this?

249
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:28,340
It would be pink yeezys pink yeezys and she comes

250
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:34,100
bounding into a fuck you from her uncle keith vigna and she says

251
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,020
oh my

252
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:38,020
God brat, you're like

253
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:45,060
Up that's so crazy right now. Uh, what's up? Uh, how old are you man? Are you like this is a girl?

254
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:47,220
I call everyone man

255
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,380
Because there are no women in my eyes

256
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:57,080
I've got a weird weird complex going on here. Yeah women suck. They don't even exist

257
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,580
Can't respect something that exists

258
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:05,380
Wait, how old is said niece?

259
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:11,700
She like does that thing where she tilts her ponytail to one side and like bounces it with her palm

260
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:18,900
Old enough to know better than getting with a guy like you brat you fucking loser. Okay, so where were we?

261
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:24,180
Um keith you're in a bit of a predicament right now, aren't you?

262
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:29,540
Yeah, I mean all thanks to you pretty much. Yeah 100

263
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:34,900
100% like you don't even know what's happening. It's so crazy. Do you want to see a mirror?

264
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:39,940
And she pulls uh, she pulls a mirror out of her ass crack and holds it up

265
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,820
to your face

266
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:46,100
You actually you see a couple uh surgical lines

267
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:53,540
Uh cross your brow and then down one side of your nose and then across down to your lip and then it moves

268
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:57,540
Uh down your chin kind of down to your collarbone and stops

269
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,940
And she's like

270
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:04,260
Let's get into the mechanics of how this has changed keith vigna as a character

271
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:08,580
Like in my mind i'm like what the fuck is she talking about?

272
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:12,740
So basically what we want to get into here is this is uh

273
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:18,680
This is a new part of the show that we're diving into where we're going to add in some pulp cthulhu

274
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:24,020
Mods to these characters for what they've been through and what's happening. So

275
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:31,700
Luke do you want to explain what happened starting from uh, your new talents that you got from the pulp cthulhu rulebook

276
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:38,580
I'm sure zack will explain how this happened. But keith has a variant of iron liver. We'll call it iron

277
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,440
septum

278
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:44,500
And francis, uh explained she's like

279
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:50,100
Okay, so like I know you can't move right now because she's got you on off

280
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:55,460
But and she grabs your hand and she lifts it for you and you see this like

281
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:59,780
Surgical scar going down your index fingertip from the tip of your finger

282
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:05,140
Down to about like the pit of your bow the pit of your elbow. Yeah

283
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:13,540
Yeah, so when we were running all like the tests basically on you to like save your life because you were dead

284
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:19,220
We saw that you had like an abnormal amount of cocaine in your system

285
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:25,860
And we decided that that was probably necessary in order to keep you going aka also

286
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:32,660
Invariably and indubitably we want to keep you on working for the glass corp our family

287
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:36,260
We think that you could be like a pretty solid asset for us

288
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:40,580
And so we want to make sure you're cooked the fuck out whenever you want it

289
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:45,540
So basically any time you need to like perk up?

290
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:49,620
Just shove that index finger right up in that schnoz of yours

291
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:57,460
And we've loaded up cartridges of cocaine into your hand and your wrist going up to your elbow

292
00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:00,020
So there's like a lot of cocaine in there

293
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:08,260
Which basically means in game you can spend 10 luck to refill your willpower points to full hell

294
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,220
Yeah

295
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:11,220
Ali, you know what I mean?

296
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:14,820
No homo, but stick that finger in my nose

297
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:19,060
And you also picked up another uh, can I boof it?

298
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:27,060
You can like shove that finger technically wherever you want and then she winks and she's like wait, you're my uncle

299
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:32,820
That's nasty. Anywho, I need to stay off porn hub

300
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:36,340
It's what everyone's into now

301
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:45,220
So you also took hardened. Yes, uh, which means that you will ignore sanity loss from violence and death from here on out

302
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:48,260
Do you want to explain why you took that you fucking lunatic?

303
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:52,980
Yeah, uh, well it's because after they did that surgery for the coke arm

304
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:57,780
Uh, they also cut out the like empathy part of my brain

305
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:03,300
So I no longer really have empathy for uh other people

306
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:07,300
So violence to other people does not affect me at all. Awesome

307
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:11,940
We had talked about you hitting your breaking point in this past day

308
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:16,740
And how you would have a new disorder when you woke up i'm going to consider this

309
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:21,620
Uh waking up for you. And so there is a new disorder that you have

310
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:29,300
If you roll sanity and you fail, but the role that you rolled would also fail on a power check

311
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:35,300
You're going to lose control of your character and just become super aggressive to anyone

312
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:40,980
Who is around you basically because you are going to think that they know what happened to you

313
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:45,780
All right, and i'm gonna do that and not tell anyone about it. Yes. Yeah

314
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:50,420
I don't remember what my other disorders were. I you need to lie a lot. Yes, absolutely

315
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:53,780
and we have uh, i've lied a little bit absolutely i've uh, just

316
00:25:54,580 --> 00:26:00,340
Mostly not said that the truth the truth exactly. Yeah, you know, it's a different kind of lying

317
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:05,540
Francis is standing over. It's like when someone's like when's the last time you ate rbs? I'm like, I don't remember

318
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:08,660
middle school probably and

319
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:16,020
As your mind wanders back to last wednesday

320
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:23,460
Afternoon in your bathtub. I yelled at this 16 year old at harvey's i'm like there's not enough cheese on this

321
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:30,180
I ordered six roast beef and cheese sandwiches and there's only five in the bag high schooler

322
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:32,660
Let me talk to your 18 year old manager

323
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,420
I require cheddar

324
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:44,980
Okay, so like I understand that you require cheddar and I promised you a million dollars for killing your brother

325
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:49,700
And we're gonna take care of that because marvin glass takes care of

326
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:56,020
Everyone that he cares for and you're a part of our little family now

327
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:58,660
well, i'm

328
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:02,260
Was also part of I am a part of your you are a part of my family

329
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:09,960
No, that's like not even my family anymore like ferguson was maybe the worst father that's ever existed

330
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:12,260
I got out of there real quick. I'm so

331
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:15,620
Ready for a life. That is my own

332
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:18,180
Keith thinks about that for a second goes

333
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:20,820
I think we're a lot alike then

334
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:25,220
And I I flash back real quick to

335
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:31,620
that night where I orchestrated her father's murder and then I snipped back in and i'm

336
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:37,940
Kind of on board with his whole glass family thing. She sees the turn in your eyes and she's like, okay

337
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:42,340
so your body is basically a bit different now and she like

338
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:49,700
Knocks like a door like she knocks on your head on one side of your head and you feel nothing

339
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:53,300
And she's like, yeah, so you're like metal

340
00:27:54,260 --> 00:28:00,020
Like basically a lot of you is metal because you are super fucking dead and I brought you back

341
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:02,740
Into this world and i'm

342
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:10,020
so excited to one day maybe take you out of it if it comes to that but maybe it won't anyway, so like

343
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:17,700
I'm, just so excited to have you with us because you seem really easy to manipulate. But anyway, um, we're gonna

344
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:23,140
Need you to get acquainted more so like with your body and stuff

345
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:26,500
And she looks over at brett and she's like brett

346
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:34,100
Are you capable of getting keith ready to be in this new body that he has? Oh, I can tell you all about your body

347
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,980
Mainly the lower parts

348
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:42,100
My favorite part of the body like the calves are like knees maybe no above

349
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:45,140
above it

350
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:48,420
Keith like looks down and then looks back up at brendan goes

351
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:56,360
No, homo no homo man, but I i'm so stoked to tell you about your new dick

352
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:07,860
Keith just closes his eyes and waits for someone to just let him get up

353
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:11,220
Yeah, i'm i'm resigned to whatever this is right now

354
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:17,860
So francis pulls a remote very similar to the remote that the scientists pulled out earlier

355
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:23,380
And she says well in order to do that. I guess you're gonna be able to need to move your body

356
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:28,900
And uh, she's like i'll be back in a little bit. Maybe just like test it out and like

357
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:33,300
see what you're capable of I guess and um

358
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:39,620
Yeah, i'll be back shortly and she grabs the remote and clicks a button and you immediately feel

359
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:47,700
Through your entire body that you have control over what what's happening and she um, she's like brett you got his restraints, right?

360
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:52,980
Like as she's walking out the door and then she closes the door behind her before i'm unrestrained

361
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:59,860
I like, you know kind of move my body and I can feel that my left hand that has the uh, coke dispenser

362
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:00,660
Yeah

363
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:03,540
When I like raise up my right arm is like pretty constricted

364
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:11,300
But my left arm like goes a little farther than it would have nice. I need you to change your character sheet to a full

365
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:17,940
Willpower and full hit points as the surgery that has been performed on you

366
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:21,540
Has given you a new lease on life

367
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,160
okey-dokey

368
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,540
Brett

369
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:27,700
Brett we got one. Okay, so check this out

370
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:34,180
So i'm pretty sure that you know how we were talking to him earlier about maybe like letting him like bring us into like

371
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:39,220
The world where we could actually yeah where we could see the world. I thought it'd be fun if maybe um

372
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:42,020
If we like got him to help us

373
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:47,540
Go see the the rest of the world like go go out and explore dude

374
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:53,620
Do you think he would like take us to vegas? Maybe what's a vegas vegas? Okay, listen

375
00:30:53,860 --> 00:31:00,180
I like saw it in like this one youtube video that I saw when that doctor lady is watching youtube videos about how

376
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:03,380
To turn someone into a robot I saw on this ad

377
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:09,940
Where there's this one place where you can go and you have like money and you gamble it and there's like

378
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:16,420
Women there also that sounds so extraordinary. Yeah, like I know you're not a sexual person

379
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:20,260
But like women are there wait, what's the one like, what do you mean?

380
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:25,860
Okay, so like me, you know have like the hugest dick on the planet. Yeah, i've seen it. It's like it's like

381
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:32,340
So huge it's like the size of my entire body a prize no, no, dude, it's like way bigger than that

382
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:38,820
You're forgetting you're forgetting because of your forgetness you're forgetting that but you can't go there and and women they just like

383
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,780
Flock to your dick like they love it

384
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:46,740
Like that's what I heard on that one ad that in vegas. There are women there that love it so we could go there

385
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:49,140
Maybe he could take us keith keith keith

386
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:55,700
Keith will you take us to vegas if that's what you want? I mean i've never been but what it seems like

387
00:31:55,940 --> 00:32:00,980
Trash, you've been allowed to go out into the world this whole time and you've never been to this magical place

388
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:04,260
Where the women want to flock upon your dick fucking kidding me, man

389
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:08,020
I could peg you as more of like a miami guy you can peg me if you want

390
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,740
But that's I mean i'm not a sexual creature

391
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:13,460
You know what?

392
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:18,100
Let's get the fuck out of here. I will take you anywhere you want to go. We can go to freaking

393
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:25,300
Yeah, we'll go to vegas. Okay. Okay, cool. And uh, so the fish, uh, so the fish, uh, the creature

394
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:29,060
Begins like wobbling. I want you to picture this

395
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:34,660
Five inch tall body. I'm thinking like, uh, what was like sid from toy story

396
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:39,620
I'm, imagining like one of those toys that is just like all fucked up. It's horrifying looking

397
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:46,340
Yeah, it's totally like kin barbie doll with the head replaced by a softball sized fish head

398
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,580
Yeah, that's absolutely what it looks like

399
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,260
and uh

400
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,360
He's like

401
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:56,960
Wobbling toward the table and he's like brat brat. I don't think i'm gonna make it in time

402
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,680
It's taking me so long to walk over here

403
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,640
Dude, you gotta like try to walk faster man. Can I be in your frocket?

404
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:09,280
I just really hate it when you're in my frocket because it really just tickles my mantis and it's really uncomfortable

405
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:16,080
Hey, if you guys get over here and let me out. I will carry you. What is your name? My name? I don't

406
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,880

416
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:04,720
To kind of like lighten the spirit in the room a little bit. I'm a bit dark in here

417
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,600
Could you say peter wants a cracker peter wants a cracker?

419
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:20,420
So in this room there's a bunch of like tanks, yeah, they're hanging above you there's three of them they're like hanging sideways

420
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,640
Yeah, other than that though, is there anything like uh that I can reach that is of any interest

421
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:32,320
I mean you said there's like body parts like preserved sure and stuff but surgical tools on another wall

422
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,160
I

Said surgical tools. He's like, uh

428
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,640
A search I rolled a 64

429
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,920
On a 60 on a 40 on a 40

430
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,040
Uh looking around you find a locker

431
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:07,120
inside

432
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:10,080
There is another change of clothes for brett

433
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:15,280
Uh brett, what is your uh secondary or alternative colors?

434
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:20,160
My secondary colors is very very similar to my first outfit still a polo

435
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:24,340
And shorts that are made of some sort of material that's like wet cardboard

436
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:33,200
Uh, but these the shorts are actually a light blue maybe a teal and the top

437
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:39,920
Is an orange color so I I throw on this, uh, like a very light orange color

438
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,320
Oh my god, daddy, you're gonna look so good. Oh, do not call me that do not call me that

439
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:50,320
I I but you named me you're my daddy. I pick up peter and I set him on top of the locker. Thank you

440
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,040
I put on the the polo

441
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:58,320
Uh the orange polo it is way way too tight for my upper torso

442
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:03,360
It's just right and then I put on the the teal shorts

443
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:07,200
And they are like three sizes too big

444
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:16,720
And so I I look around and um, uh, there's a pair of spareys in the the bottom

445
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,720
Thank god for that. There's a pair of spareys in the bottom. I take the uh, like

446
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:28,240
Shoelaces out of the spareys I slip the spareys on and I make a makeshift belt out of the uh shoelaces for keith

447
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,760
So keith is now wearing a two sizes too small polo

448
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:39,840
Yeah, three sizes too big pants and some loose spareys. Yeah suits you so no no socks though because

449
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,640
Why would I what if you get the sweats?

450
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:49,360
Yeah keith what if you get the sweat well then they'll be sticky and they'll stick to my feet tight

451
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,360
It's gonna smell so good

452
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:57,120
Do you guys ever have that thing happen where your feet are sweating so much that there's like a like almost like a creamy residue

453
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,200
Oh, yeah on the bun. Yeah

454
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:03,200
When I write well moving on never felt hotter in that moment

455
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:08,480
So yeah, uh, so the three, uh, what were you guys called again the um, oh, yeah

457
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:22,000
I set him in between me and bret and uh, I look at bret i'm like we need to induct him into chai frappe

458
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:28,000
we're two brothers bret and I we we make the hand symbol which is uh,

459
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:35,600

And you we fake spit the chai frappe on to peter

463

And he is now an honorary inductee of the chai frappe fraternity. Thank you guys. Thelma. Welcome chode

465
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:03,280
yeah, I I pick peter up and I go over to one of the

466
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:07,040
Jars that holds preserved human parts. Sure

467
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:12,080
Which which jar did I pick bret that jar has a huge dick in it

468
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:17,440
Yeah, it it's it's it's labeled bobbit act of 2019 perfect

469
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,320
And I dunk peter in there. Uh-huh

470
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:27,760
Oh, wait, i'm, uh, i'm a fish I can oh, yeah, okay. Yeah. No, this is

471
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:32,100
This is weird that I can talk in here. But also at the same time it's like wow

472
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:35,700
Oh being this close to one of these monsters, right?

473
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:41,940
Yeah, too bad. It's not as big as mine. Yeah. Well, it probably wouldn't fit in this mason jar. You're fucking right

474
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:47,700
We need a five gallon pail. That's cool, bro. Like hey if we don't leave now, I bet we're all gonna get caught

475
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:52,180
Yeah, so part of your hazing is you have to stay in here. So I grab the jar and i'm carrying the jar

476
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:54,420
Me

477
00:38:57,220 --> 00:39:00,340
Peter is putting his little fish head over the top

478
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:08,180
His body is in the preservatives with the penis, but his head is just hanging out perfect and uh, peter starts moving his bottom legs

479
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:14,900
Around and and he like picks up the uh, bobbited penis from the bottom of the jar

480
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:20,580
And like lifts it with his feet up into the position where it looks like it's his

481
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,300
I'm a sexual queeter

482
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:30,420
And we leave this room finally, yeah, we we we walk out the only exit

483
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:36,740
Walking out you walk into a hallway that is made completely out of black marble

484
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:45,380
The floor the walls and the ceiling it is almost disorienting walking out into it and as your eyes adjust

485
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:49,620
You notice that there are two doors in this hallway

486
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:53,380
Are they just like uh side by side or they like one on the left one on the right?

487
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:57,780
Let's go one on the left one on the right. Have either of you ever been out of that room before?

488
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:02,900
Nope, no, um chai flaps forever. Yeah for life

489
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:09,700
Okay, let's go to the left one. I'm I lead the way. You know what I I hand the uh jar

490
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:16,260
Uh, yeah, let me take that for a minute I I hand the penis a peter jar, uh, just the peter jar

491
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:20,900
I think just peter jar the peter jar. I hand it over to bret. I'm like, hey, hold on to this peter squared

492
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:24,340
Wow, this jar is so light because how small the stick is compared to mine

493
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:29,060
I turn the knob to the door on the left and

494
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:36,900
Open it up. Oh, so there's actually no, uh, just push just yeah, it's a push. It's a push door. I push it open then

495
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:43,220
No, it's actually a pole, uh, so no actually I was here yesterday it goes both ways

496
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:48,020
And then you slowly

497
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:52,980
I just pushed my shoulder into it and i'm like looking back at them. I'm like, yeah

498
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:55,860
It's one of the best sketches i've ever seen

499
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:59,220
Oh my god

500
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:06,180
Okay, as you walk through this doorway you see another hallway and at the end of this hallway is a 10 by 10

501
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:13,300
slab of black marble and four guards two on either side of the enormous and strange door that

502
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:16,180
Slowly slides open as you approach

503
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:23,860
And these guards are in full brown jumpsuits and they each have a large scythe strapped to their backs

504
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:31,620
And the blade of each scythe is shaped like an enormous fish hook a closer look reveals these men have

505
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,120
Unnatural

506
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:37,940
Matching faces their eyes are far apart almost on either side of their face

507
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:43,460
Their noses do not jut out but are rather just two slits above their two wide

508
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:48,980
Thick-lipped mouths and they have a few flaps on either side of their necks

509
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:54,120
They look eerily similar to peter deeter. Hey peter speak your language of these guys

510
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:03,620
Is

511
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:06,740
And the guards

512
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:10,980
You got a pretty pretty star wars

513
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:15,620
I like star wars

514
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:22,900
Do you practice that just by sticking your face in your shower head and just like well

515
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:27,380
No, uh zack actually has that written down on his computer right in front of him

516
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:30,180
He's like if they take a left and they ask you to do this

517
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:38,340
And uh as as peter says that the uh, the guards begin marching toward you

518
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:43,940
And peter looks up and he goes I I don't think what did you say to them?

519
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:47,380
I just I just said that uh, we're the chai flap

520
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,500
Motherfuckers and we're here to take you the fuck out because we're getting out of this place

521
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:58,520
Okay, tell them now that we are experiments and we're if you touch us you're going to get the same disease we have

522
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:03,620
Oh

523
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:09,140
And the guards do not cease

524
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:17,060
Okay, I turn around and i'm like let's go to the other door and I run out and I press the door on the right

525
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:19,300
Open, oh you push. I think you're supposed to pull it

526
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:25,220
I however to get the fucking door open. I do that very quickly while these guys are walking at us

527
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:28,660
and as you go through that door you hear the

528
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:31,360
wonderful

529
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:33,360
stellar tones of

530
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,840
Oh my

531
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:36,960
God

532
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:44,000
When I said that you could like move about and figure out like what was going on. I didn't get the fuck

533
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:45,280
Oh my god

534
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:45,600
Okay

535
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:52,560
We're going to see marvin right now and francis like pushes you back in to the door like in the hallway

536
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:57,200
you were coming from and the guards are like right up on the other side and they're bumping into you and they just kind of

537
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:05,120
Heard you toward like they they they surround you and begin walking you down this long hallway back to where we came or

538
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:06,000
No

539
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,440
No, you're going toward the door

540
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:12,400
You haven't been in the guards were guarding before I look at them like I was gonna go here anyway

541
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:18,560
And you walk through as this, um, this giant slab of black marvel

542
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,560
movies

543
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,560
Moves out of your way

544
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,560
and

545
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,560
And uh you walk through

546
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:34,000
The doorway and inside you see the room and it is the size of a basketball court and to your left

547
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:37,840
One of the long walls is entirely made of glass

548
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,680
Get it

549
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:46,180
There is a murky greenish water on the other side like an aquarium of staggering proportions

550
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:53,520
And marvin glass stands there arms folded behind his back staring into the cloudy water

551
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:57,360
So

552
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:05,920
Marvin glass stands there. You've seen him once before he has a massive frame, but it is completely gone

553
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:13,120
There's no muscle or fat and you can imagine just skin stretched across these long bones

554
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:18,260
And uh marvin's dressed in a fitted black tuxedo

555
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:22,240
He turns around the skin on his chin is almost translucent

556
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:29,040
There's no hair not even a slight shadow of facial hair can be seen on either side of two thin bright red lips

557
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,600
Actually, not really lips at all

558
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,160
Just candy red lipstick

559
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:40,240
Messily encircling a round hole above the sharp see-through chin

560
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,360
And the orifice begins to move

561
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:47,340
Hello keith

562
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:48,840
Marvin

563
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:49,980
Francis

564
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:55,260
If you wouldn't mind, I don't think I trust him right now

565
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:59,420
And francis pulls that remote out of her pocket and clicks a button

566
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:03,980
And brett and keith you both freeze fuck

567
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:11,420
Just your limbs like your body from the neck down completely paralyzed, but we're still standing. Yep

568
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:13,900
I was worried about the penis jar

569
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:18,860
Oh, yeah, no, yeah. No, it's it's still being held strong. Yeah

570
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:22,140

571
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:24,220
I would like to offer you

572
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:27,420
your future

573
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:32,720
I believe that francis has already prepped you on some slight details

574
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:40,860
Of your new form. I want to just say thank you and in order for me to say thank you to you

575
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:43,720
marvin walks

576
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:49,320
Extremely quickly like you see his form just walking but in the blink of an eye

577
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:56,680
He is across the room and he presses into this square on the wall and a panel opens and it reveals

578
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:01,080
One million dollars in cash and he points at it

579
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:08,360
Keith you have earned this money you have and I want to give it to you

580
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:16,060
But I am afraid of what giving a man like you one million dollars could do for our relationship

581
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:18,920
Now

582
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:24,360
I'm still willing to part with this money, but the surgery that we gave you was

583
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:30,440
Quite expensive so I will require one more deed

584
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:37,880
In order for you to pay off this surgery. I need you to do something for me. Are you willing?

585
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:44,120
To do something for me. I look at the million dollars and in keith's mind

586
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:48,280
I've already had that realization of I was dead. They've brought me back

587
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:54,840
I realized that i've got that cocaine arm and it seemed a little more powerful than I was before and I feel

588
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:57,640
Very different so I look at the million dollars

589
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:00,440
And I look at marvin

590
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:02,440
Who what is it?

591
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:07,640
In order for me to even tell you I need you to show

592
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:10,600
Your loyalty to me

593
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:13,480
and he gestures

594
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:15,240
to brett

595
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:18,680
But more specifically the jar that brett is holding

596
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:21,240
and francis

597
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:24,680
Walks through and grabs peter out of the jar

598
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:32,200
Oh, oh, thank you so much. Mommy. I'm just so glad that I could be here for anything. Oh, bye. Dad. Bye. Dad

599
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:37,400
Bye dad and she walks over to the extremely large

600
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:39,080
aquarium

601
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:41,080
Where marvin is now standing?

602
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:44,600
And she hands peter to marvin

603
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:47,640
some things must

604
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:49,220
be

605
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:51,080
sacrificed

606
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:57,180
And he whispers under his breath and you see this bright light inside of the orifice

607
00:48:57,720 --> 00:49:01,720
Above his chin and the light kind of comes out onto his hand

608
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:07,340
And he grabs peter and he reaches through the wall of the aquarium

609
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:10,360
and releases

610
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:16,840
And then pulls his arm back out through the glass wall of the aquarium and you see that on the other side

611
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:23,480
In this murky water is now swimming about peter deeter and all of the sudden this

612
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:30,120
Massive creature that looks almost exactly like the guards that were outside

613
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:36,220
Except four times bigger swims into focus and swallows

614
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:42,300
Peter deeter hole before swimming back into the darkness of the aquarium

615
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:45,080
Marvin looks back over you

616
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:52,920
Uh, let's let's take it one more perhaps and francis beans walks over to brett

617
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:57,160
And just starts taking him apart from behind

618
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:03,100
Piece by piece falling off metal hitting the floor scraps falling by the wayside

619
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:09,880
All that's left is brett's head human looking head frosted tips akimbo sitting on the floor

620
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:15,240
and with one final breath brett says do it man

621
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:19,500
Do you even know how much natty light you could buy with a million fucking dollars?

622
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:26,860
Marvin is immediately back on the other side of the room. He presses into another panel reveals

623
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:33,960
Keith's small but powerful gun the odd camera with the glass tubes all around it

624
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:38,760
And the odd gun with the strange tubes surrounding it

625
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:46,220
And he grabs the tiny powerful pistol that you found in a plus storage in contention

626
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:49,000
And he walks it over to you and he holds it out

627
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:51,060
you

628
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:53,060
belong to me

629
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:57,080
I will send you off to the cemetery

630
00:50:57,620 --> 00:51:01,960
There is a funeral happening for your former co-worker

631
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:04,820
ari manstein

632
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:06,820
Her father will be there

633
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:12,040
Stan manstein is rarely in public. We need to take this opportunity

634
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:15,220
To take him

635
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:17,380
I would like you to bring him back to me

636
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:19,940
for further questioning

637
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:22,020
Is there anything I can do for you

638
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:26,680
Do you like a specific car body armor weapons? Do you need a disguise?

639
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:30,180
Would you like francis to come along with you?

640
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:32,900
Is that too many questions all at once?

641
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:39,380
I look at him still paralyzed. Yep. I look over brett. I say i'm sorry, but pour one out for you

642
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:46,580
I look back over at marvin. I say if I get that million dollars i'm indebted to you already i'll go to loan

643
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:49,220
Just like this

644
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:52,900
So

645
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:09,460
How am I the only one trying to

646
00:52:14,580 --> 00:52:16,580
Heaven

647
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:22,100
Yes

648
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:40,420
You
