00:00.000 --> 00:04.620
Namaste and Cthulhu photography. It's KITI city radio

00:04.620 --> 00:09.760
But the only thing softer than the modern human body is the K in our name. I'm your host

00:14.660 --> 00:18.400
What's up my babies, it's your daddy from another laddie

00:18.680 --> 00:26.560
Your mister from Westminster your den leader and late-night trash bin eater wolf the dog

00:27.520 --> 00:31.120
And I'm taking over your radio like mr. Swack hammer

00:31.520 --> 00:37.680
So welcome to six nine four point two PTBP the city's newest and only

00:38.760 --> 00:40.760
pirate radio station

00:41.120 --> 00:47.080
Let's hit him right off the top with a little bit of howlin with wolf. This one comes from at tread

00:47.600 --> 00:51.720
Underscore 26 on Twitter who tagged at pretending pod

00:51.960 --> 00:53.960
What a beautiful thing to

00:53.960 --> 01:00.600
Intentionally spend 30 seconds of your day to make old wolf the dog smile like that this cat at

01:01.040 --> 01:02.120
tread

01:02.120 --> 01:07.560
Underscore 26 sent me a hell of a tale the infamous story of 9pens

01:07.720 --> 01:11.540
I told him the people need to dig into this written word

01:11.680 --> 01:17.040
So he posted the story on the subreddit r slash pretending to be people

01:17.040 --> 01:22.040
So I just wanted to give a shout-out to my good buddy Cyrus 9pens

01:22.040 --> 01:28.360
If you're listening over there at the kitty cat lounge stay safe. I hope everyone is behaving themselves tonight

01:29.200 --> 01:33.320
Well, I'm sure bouncing a bit easier when there isn't much clientele

01:33.480 --> 01:38.440
Which is may I just say an excellent transition into the news?

01:39.440 --> 01:42.160
Contention is a ghost town

01:42.680 --> 01:50.320
The silence is eerie. I guess the disappearance has freaked people out enough to bail and take a panic vacation

01:50.560 --> 01:57.240
I don't blame them my wolf pups. I don't at all shit was getting real spooky up in here

01:57.480 --> 02:04.940
An FBI agent showed up and made an announcement that included the phrase the boys in blue are here for you

02:05.020 --> 02:08.740
And now the contingent police officers are nowhere to be found

02:09.500 --> 02:11.980
So I go out to with a love for

02:12.500 --> 02:17.820
Contention from above came a mission to deliver the tones that will rattle your bones

02:18.060 --> 02:23.300
It's a brand fucking new one folks. It's good zoo with no

02:24.060 --> 02:26.060
backbone

02:34.940 --> 02:36.940
Oh

02:47.660 --> 02:51.140
Welcome to contention. That's that's careful. Yeah

02:56.540 --> 03:01.260
We made it like 30 episodes well, it's still not in there contention

03:02.100 --> 03:04.340
Also also never been said or

03:05.180 --> 03:07.180
cunt tension

03:08.440 --> 03:10.440
Slap that explicit sticker on

03:11.060 --> 03:16.280
We earned it. I liked earning the explicit. Yeah, of course important

03:16.280 --> 03:20.660
We work hard if you're a baby stop listening to this unless you want to know bad words

03:20.660 --> 03:26.220
Yeah, and if you are a baby then listen up while Ally tells you who she is. Hey Ally. Hey, what's up?

03:27.100 --> 03:30.240
My name is Ally Jepsen. I'm a woman

03:31.260 --> 03:39.220
We got one. We finally got one. We got another Zach's wife. I mean, I'm a wife too to myself. Oh, that's cool

03:39.220 --> 03:44.840
Yeah, we have an open relationship those Dennis Rodman style. Yeah, exactly. Are you also friends of North Korea?

03:46.340 --> 03:47.660
Hey, what do you think about this?

03:47.660 --> 03:53.940
Zach and I were talking about a good way to get the divorce rate down is to enact the Bobbitt Act of

03:54.380 --> 03:58.580
2019, you know, like you're fighting over property, you know like

03:59.580 --> 04:05.300
Zach gets if Zach and Taylor got divorced like Zach would get the car. Maybe maybe the house but

04:06.020 --> 04:08.980
Taylor would get to keep sex penis, right? Oh

04:10.700 --> 04:16.960
We think it would drive divorce rates down yeah for sure like what would she do with it though? Well, it's more of a

04:20.140 --> 04:23.660
But then we said Zach said stub porn would

04:23.660 --> 04:25.660
I

04:29.940 --> 04:35.820
Mean people would get pretty into it. They'd have to well, I'm thinking with all the abortion stuff going on right now

04:35.820 --> 04:37.900
You could easily slip this Bobbitt Act

04:38.820 --> 04:40.820
unnoticed

04:41.300 --> 04:44.260
You could do you could throw anything in anywhere right now. Oh

04:47.820 --> 04:51.060
Sometimes I open my mouth and I think about what's happening

04:51.420 --> 04:56.200
Zach is just a sexually aggressive man who can hardly keep his urges

05:00.940 --> 05:03.360
Yeah, so I take out all that energy on this

05:04.740 --> 05:08.020
For you the listener for just for you. Yeah, Ally

05:08.720 --> 05:14.860
Have you ever role-played before literally never unless you can't with myself weird your wife. Yeah

05:15.980 --> 05:18.840
Well, if it's in the marital bedroom, it's fine. That's what I always say

05:19.400 --> 05:23.600
Nope never role-played. I'm very excited to be here. Welcome. We're excited to have you here. Yeah

05:24.160 --> 05:28.060
We're not gonna get to plugs at any point at the end of the show

05:28.580 --> 05:32.900
so go ahead and plug away now if you if you have anything you'd like to

05:33.800 --> 05:38.000
Hmm. Let's see. I sell stud penises from divorcees

05:38.880 --> 05:40.760
And where can we find you?

05:40.760 --> 05:42.760

05:58.200 --> 05:59.920
I'm a

05:59.920 --> 06:06.840
Comedian and a local gal pal comedy show called basement cats and we have great shows once a month in

06:39.600 --> 06:42.960
A lot of our listeners we found are on LinkedIn

We get the strangest analytics for this show tell us a little bit about basement cats though, yes, please

06:55.760 --> 06:59.280
Basement cats like I said is a all-female comedy show

07:00.600 --> 07:05.600
We are here to give women a voice in comedy and we are a nonprofit

07:05.760 --> 07:08.860
So we're a free show we accept donations

07:09.160 --> 07:15.940
Which we give to a to a local girls home that assists with girls aging out of the foster care system

07:15.940 --> 07:22.320
And we love being funny. That's awesome. Luke and I actually came to a show when we were

07:22.880 --> 07:24.880
scouting you

07:27.000 --> 07:32.360
Went to the one at Big Mama's. Yeah, and it was so much fun. I was it was pretty great

07:32.360 --> 07:38.480
That was I have to say one of my least favorite really we had so you still very good another one

07:38.480 --> 07:40.880
All right, good to know. Yep. Mm-hmm. I like the

07:41.400 --> 07:43.400
Chowder house. Oh

07:43.440 --> 07:48.240
That was my favorite thing of the night. It was the Chowder house is up still up and running

07:48.240 --> 07:51.700
She does she did a corn on the cob eating contest. Yeah

07:54.600 --> 07:59.320
Well, so she sold it to and I quote her Facebook the Peruvian

08:02.360 --> 08:03.800
Who

08:03.800 --> 08:10.440
Well, they they for like two weeks and then I think like now she's back there

08:10.440 --> 08:15.760
So I don't really know how that worked out. So are her and the Peruvians in cahoots. No, they got an annulment

08:15.920 --> 08:22.820
Yeah, yeah, this is a brief so brief marriage. Did she get their penis? Absolutely. She got their pupusas

08:24.600 --> 08:26.600
All right, let's dive into the show

08:27.020 --> 08:32.000
Keith Vigna you are violently holding a pillow over someone's face when the pillow itself

08:32.460 --> 08:38.480
Transforms into an oily black ooze and it washes over the face below it not of a person

08:38.480 --> 08:45.200
But the face of the watch your father William gave your brother Ferguson so many years ago looking down at your wrist

08:45.200 --> 08:46.860
You see you are wearing this watch

08:46.860 --> 08:50.180
But when you look up you do not recognize the world around you

08:50.460 --> 08:56.740
Dust clouds settle to reveal a horse pulling a wagon through a small frontier town and the bald man

08:56.740 --> 09:01.520
You know is Billy Harrison the one who took your uniform and gun in the clinic

09:01.520 --> 09:08.300
He is walking in your direction and he keeps repeating. I did everything that you asked me to do officer Vigna

09:08.300 --> 09:14.120
He holds up the strange-looking camera officer petty more found in the car of Julie Maxwell and takes a picture of you

09:14.540 --> 09:19.700
The light is blinding and as it fades you were standing in darkness stank and chilly

09:19.820 --> 09:25.100
Right in front of you is a massive tank filled with the now eerily too familiar opaque ooze

09:25.480 --> 09:29.660
you press your face against the tank to see something creeping toward you and

09:29.940 --> 09:35.980
As the face of tilde be Mitchell comes into focus you are standing in an open field

09:36.280 --> 09:42.660
The dead grass covered in a thin freeze crunching under your feet as you approach a metal hatch

09:43.020 --> 09:50.080
But water gross murky water with bits of grass and sludge begin spewing from the creases of this metal hatch

09:50.180 --> 09:53.660
The water begins to flood this field at an alarming pace

09:53.940 --> 09:59.540
You look down and see your reflection in the rippling water, but something looks off

10:02.380 --> 10:05.260
Opening your eyes you see a bright light shining dead

10:05.260 --> 10:12.300
Yeah, yeah shining directly down into your face and a strange silhouette looms over you as your eyes adjust

10:12.340 --> 10:19.340
You see it is a head that is shaped like a football with spiky white hair frantically flopping atop a pointy head

10:19.540 --> 10:25.840
She is wearing a large white lab coat and those big chunky evil scientist goggles that evil

10:26.180 --> 10:28.740
Scientists wear this pair is wonky

10:28.740 --> 10:34.020
However, one goggle pointing down in a way to accommodate the odd head shape of the wearer

10:34.140 --> 10:40.780
She begins slowly tapping her long wobbly fingers against your cheekbone and jawline

10:41.420 --> 10:43.500
But you don't feel anything

10:44.100 --> 10:48.420
Looking around this room. You see you are in some sort of laboratory

10:48.700 --> 10:55.420
You are strapped down on one of several operating tables. The others are currently vacant

10:55.940 --> 11:01.100
Mounted all over one wall are different surgical looking devices some old and rusty

11:01.460 --> 11:09.100
Saws and hammers and the like and some shiny and futuristic with long needles or strange battery packs attached and such

11:09.340 --> 11:14.900
Another wall is covered in shelves with beakers and mason jars of different shapes and sizes

11:15.220 --> 11:20.660
All filled with different colored liquids and body parts some eyes and fingers

11:20.660 --> 11:24.660
But also internal organs some of which you don't even recognize

11:25.280 --> 11:31.300
Running all throughout this room are tubes like in a mail room and they all lead to three large vats

11:31.340 --> 11:38.580
That hang on their sides from the ceiling these tubes and vats seem to be some sort of funhouse style aquarium

11:38.660 --> 11:42.660
with different species of fish swimming throughout this tall

11:43.300 --> 11:46.900
lady scientist walks over to the corner of the room and

11:47.420 --> 11:49.420
reaches behind a

11:49.460 --> 11:51.460
humanoid figure

11:51.700 --> 11:56.340
What is this humanoid figure look like Allie this humanoid figure?

11:58.900 --> 12:01.900
Oops a beer can is a

12:02.780 --> 12:03.820
male

12:03.820 --> 12:09.180
With brown hair with blonde highlights that could easily be mistaken for frosted tips

12:09.780 --> 12:15.420
He is wearing coral shorts a coral shirt, but a slightly different tone of coral

12:16.220 --> 12:18.220
white crew socks and

12:18.220 --> 12:25.260
Sperry's he also has a shell necklace around his neck and as the tall scientist reaches behind

12:25.580 --> 12:29.020
she seems to click or flip something and

12:29.860 --> 12:31.860
this humanoid figure

12:32.140 --> 12:34.140
Starts to move

12:34.180 --> 12:37.880
This is an audio podcast so you don't like my visual humor

12:38.880 --> 12:42.820
the scientist pulls out a little remote that she has and

12:43.220 --> 12:49.480
Walks towards the door the only door in this room and as she turns around looking at you before she leaves

12:50.060 --> 12:52.060
she clicks this button and

12:52.420 --> 12:54.420
both of you feel

12:55.140 --> 13:02.420
Extreme pain shoot through your entire bodies like an electrical current that is attached to

13:02.820 --> 13:06.960
every single nerve ending that you have it is

13:07.980 --> 13:12.740
excruciating and torturous and then she clicks another thing and it's gone and

13:13.620 --> 13:15.620
Then she kind of laughs

13:20.820 --> 13:22.820
And then she walks out of the door

13:25.420 --> 13:27.420
I

13:29.500 --> 13:35.360
Take that in for a second, so I'm strapped down on this operating table you are

13:35.940 --> 13:37.940
How good Oh pretty good

13:41.940 --> 13:43.940
Help me help me

13:46.020 --> 13:48.460
I'm a fifth of vodka in and I'm ready to go

13:48.460 --> 13:50.460
I

13:51.260 --> 13:57.700
Look as Keith looks around the room. He sees the humanoid figure that is started

13:58.220 --> 14:00.220
waking up in the corner and

14:00.620 --> 14:05.500
You see the the front pocket the frockett the dad pocket if you will on

14:06.140 --> 14:13.020
This humanoid figure begins to wriggle. It's a polo, right? Correct. It's a polo with a frock Southern Tide

14:13.260 --> 14:20.740
Polo and as it begins moving you see this little this little fish head pops out and

14:21.620 --> 14:27.460
It's roughly the size of a softball. You have no idea how it fit so well inside this small pocket

14:27.460 --> 14:35.580
but this softball sized fish head pops out and begins moving out of the pocket and you see that it's got a tiny little

14:36.380 --> 14:37.420
human

14:37.420 --> 14:42.140
frame body underneath the fish head, but the head is a

14:42.740 --> 14:48.860
Bit too heavy. So as it flops out onto the lap of this humanoid figure

14:48.860 --> 14:53.100
It's trying to lift its head up and it says hi. Oh

14:54.020 --> 14:56.020
gosh, oh

14:56.300 --> 14:58.060
gosh, oh

14:58.060 --> 14:59.380
so

14:59.380 --> 15:05.100
It's so crazy being me and it looks up at its friend this bro dressed

15:05.580 --> 15:07.580
Humanoid figure and it says hey

15:08.100 --> 15:09.660
Hey there

15:09.660 --> 15:15.740
Hey there, remember me, uh, yeah fucker I remember you why you always talk to me like that

15:15.740 --> 15:22.060
So I just don't really care for any of the language being so intense, but that's that's fine. Oh, hey

15:22.060 --> 15:22.700
Oh my gosh

15:22.700 --> 15:29.260
And the little fish character looks looks over at the table and says we got we got we got a friend in here

15:29.260 --> 15:31.260
There's another friend. Oh

15:31.500 --> 15:33.020
Oh

15:33.020 --> 15:34.060
Hey

15:34.060 --> 15:35.940
Yeah, we got a friend

15:36.260 --> 15:41.460
And he hollers out and he says hey hey friend I look over at him but I

15:42.100 --> 15:48.180
Right now i'm a little too concerned with making new friends. Am I still in my underwear or am I clothed?

15:48.740 --> 15:51.460
I I died in my under or I almost died

15:51.540 --> 15:53.540
I died in my underwear

15:53.620 --> 15:58.420
You died in your underwear you woke in your underwear and it's weird as you move your head around you realize

15:58.580 --> 16:05.300

18:26.740 --> 18:27.700

18:27.700 --> 18:32.180
Hearing a little bob seeker peps keith up a little bit. Yeah, I still can't move though

18:32.260 --> 18:34.900

Uh, do you think there's like for real life beer pong on the outside?

18:44.180 --> 18:46.340
Not just that we have to pretend in our own minds

18:46.500 --> 18:50.340
We pretend in our own minds all the time, but brett always wins I get so

18:50.740 --> 18:56.900
Wasted from beer pong in my mind if you guys can help me out. I can I will buy you a beer pong table

And I will call the delta zetas because they're the easy daisies and we can have a party

19:07.300 --> 19:09.300
could you call the chai frappuccinos because like i've

19:09.460 --> 19:14.100
Always dreamt of being in the chai frappuccinos the chai frappuccinos know how to party shit

19:14.500 --> 19:18.580
Yeah, I knew it when I went to when I went to a police academy in the city

19:18.580 --> 19:25.060
I actually was a chai frappe. Are you fucking kidding me right now? We're frat bros right now. We're frat bros

19:26.580 --> 19:30.580
Oh, you gotta help me though. I can't deliver any of these but i'm hard

19:30.820 --> 19:35.060
Does that mean that you're gonna where that we're all gonna be frat bros together?

19:35.220 --> 19:41.380
You can be an honor honorary inductee into chai frappe if you just fucking help me

19:41.380 --> 19:42.660
Oh

19:42.660 --> 19:46.420
And as this conversation carries on for god knows how long

19:47.140 --> 19:53.700
The door opens again and a young girl comes bouncing into the room keith

19:53.700 --> 19:56.500
You recognize this girl as your niece

19:57.280 --> 20:00.500
Francis beans, I look at her and i'm like fuck

20:01.300 --> 20:03.300
you

20:04.660 --> 20:10.660
And uh francis beans is wearing a t-shirt that says

20:11.380 --> 20:19.140
Easy-deezy on it the front of it and she's wearing sophies. Is that what they were called? Yeah. Yeah, she's wearing sophies and like

20:20.180 --> 20:23.620
What would be the what would be the shoe wear that would go along with this?

20:23.700 --> 20:28.340
It would be pink yeezys pink yeezys and she comes

20:28.800 --> 20:34.100
bounding into a fuck you from her uncle keith vigna and she says

20:34.900 --> 20:36.020
oh my

20:36.020 --> 20:38.020
God brat, you're like

20:38.900 --> 20:45.060
Up that's so crazy right now. Uh, what's up? Uh, how old are you man? Are you like this is a girl?

20:45.220 --> 20:47.220
I call everyone man

20:47.220 --> 20:49.380
Because there are no women in my eyes

20:51.540 --> 20:57.080
I've got a weird weird complex going on here. Yeah women suck. They don't even exist

21:00.580 --> 21:02.580
Can't respect something that exists

21:03.460 --> 21:05.380
Wait, how old is said niece?

21:05.380 --> 21:11.700
She like does that thing where she tilts her ponytail to one side and like bounces it with her palm

21:12.260 --> 21:18.900
Old enough to know better than getting with a guy like you brat you fucking loser. Okay, so where were we?

21:19.700 --> 21:24.180
Um keith you're in a bit of a predicament right now, aren't you?

21:25.620 --> 21:29.540
Yeah, I mean all thanks to you pretty much. Yeah 100

21:29.600 --> 21:34.900
100% like you don't even know what's happening. It's so crazy. Do you want to see a mirror?

21:35.540 --> 21:39.940
And she pulls uh, she pulls a mirror out of her ass crack and holds it up

21:41.140 --> 21:42.820
to your face

21:42.820 --> 21:46.100
You actually you see a couple uh surgical lines

21:46.500 --> 21:53.540
Uh cross your brow and then down one side of your nose and then across down to your lip and then it moves

21:53.940 --> 21:57.540
Uh down your chin kind of down to your collarbone and stops

21:58.340 --> 21:59.940
And she's like

21:59.940 --> 22:04.260
Let's get into the mechanics of how this has changed keith vigna as a character

22:05.460 --> 22:08.580
Like in my mind i'm like what the fuck is she talking about?

22:08.660 --> 22:12.740
So basically what we want to get into here is this is uh

22:12.820 --> 22:18.680
This is a new part of the show that we're diving into where we're going to add in some pulp cthulhu

22:19.380 --> 22:24.020
Mods to these characters for what they've been through and what's happening. So

22:24.580 --> 22:31.700
Luke do you want to explain what happened starting from uh, your new talents that you got from the pulp cthulhu rulebook

22:31.860 --> 22:38.580
I'm sure zack will explain how this happened. But keith has a variant of iron liver. We'll call it iron

22:39.440 --> 22:41.440
septum

22:42.180 --> 22:44.500
And francis, uh explained she's like

22:45.300 --> 22:50.100
Okay, so like I know you can't move right now because she's got you on off

22:50.100 --> 22:55.460
But and she grabs your hand and she lifts it for you and you see this like

22:55.780 --> 22:59.780
Surgical scar going down your index fingertip from the tip of your finger

23:00.340 --> 23:05.140
Down to about like the pit of your bow the pit of your elbow. Yeah

23:05.300 --> 23:13.540
Yeah, so when we were running all like the tests basically on you to like save your life because you were dead

23:14.100 --> 23:19.220
We saw that you had like an abnormal amount of cocaine in your system

23:19.780 --> 23:25.860
And we decided that that was probably necessary in order to keep you going aka also

23:26.640 --> 23:32.660
Invariably and indubitably we want to keep you on working for the glass corp our family

23:32.980 --> 23:36.260
We think that you could be like a pretty solid asset for us

23:36.420 --> 23:40.580
And so we want to make sure you're cooked the fuck out whenever you want it

23:40.660 --> 23:45.540
So basically any time you need to like perk up?

23:45.860 --> 23:49.620
Just shove that index finger right up in that schnoz of yours

23:50.260 --> 23:57.460
And we've loaded up cartridges of cocaine into your hand and your wrist going up to your elbow

23:57.620 --> 24:00.020
So there's like a lot of cocaine in there

24:00.900 --> 24:08.260
Which basically means in game you can spend 10 luck to refill your willpower points to full hell

24:08.340 --> 24:09.220
Yeah

24:09.220 --> 24:11.220
Ali, you know what I mean?

24:11.940 --> 24:14.820
No homo, but stick that finger in my nose

24:16.260 --> 24:19.060
And you also picked up another uh, can I boof it?

24:20.900 --> 24:27.060
You can like shove that finger technically wherever you want and then she winks and she's like wait, you're my uncle

24:28.420 --> 24:32.820
That's nasty. Anywho, I need to stay off porn hub

24:34.340 --> 24:36.340
It's what everyone's into now

24:37.140 --> 24:45.220
So you also took hardened. Yes, uh, which means that you will ignore sanity loss from violence and death from here on out

24:45.220 --> 24:48.260
Do you want to explain why you took that you fucking lunatic?

24:48.420 --> 24:52.980
Yeah, uh, well it's because after they did that surgery for the coke arm

24:53.220 --> 24:57.780
Uh, they also cut out the like empathy part of my brain

24:58.660 --> 25:03.300
So I no longer really have empathy for uh other people

25:03.300 --> 25:07.300
So violence to other people does not affect me at all. Awesome

25:07.940 --> 25:11.940
We had talked about you hitting your breaking point in this past day

25:12.180 --> 25:16.740
And how you would have a new disorder when you woke up i'm going to consider this

25:16.900 --> 25:21.620
Uh waking up for you. And so there is a new disorder that you have

25:22.260 --> 25:29.300
If you roll sanity and you fail, but the role that you rolled would also fail on a power check

25:29.620 --> 25:35.300
You're going to lose control of your character and just become super aggressive to anyone

25:35.540 --> 25:40.980
Who is around you basically because you are going to think that they know what happened to you

25:41.060 --> 25:45.780
All right, and i'm gonna do that and not tell anyone about it. Yes. Yeah

25:45.940 --> 25:50.420
I don't remember what my other disorders were. I you need to lie a lot. Yes, absolutely

25:50.500 --> 25:53.780
and we have uh, i've lied a little bit absolutely i've uh, just

25:54.580 --> 26:00.340
Mostly not said that the truth the truth exactly. Yeah, you know, it's a different kind of lying

26:00.980 --> 26:05.540
Francis is standing over. It's like when someone's like when's the last time you ate rbs? I'm like, I don't remember

26:06.660 --> 26:08.660
middle school probably and

26:11.940 --> 26:16.020
As your mind wanders back to last wednesday

26:16.960 --> 26:23.460
Afternoon in your bathtub. I yelled at this 16 year old at harvey's i'm like there's not enough cheese on this

26:23.860 --> 26:30.180
I ordered six roast beef and cheese sandwiches and there's only five in the bag high schooler

26:30.340 --> 26:32.660
Let me talk to your 18 year old manager

26:34.420 --> 26:36.420
I require cheddar

26:37.380 --> 26:44.980
Okay, so like I understand that you require cheddar and I promised you a million dollars for killing your brother

26:45.300 --> 26:49.700
And we're gonna take care of that because marvin glass takes care of

26:50.480 --> 26:56.020
Everyone that he cares for and you're a part of our little family now

26:57.060 --> 26:58.660
well, i'm

26:58.660 --> 27:02.260
Was also part of I am a part of your you are a part of my family

27:02.340 --> 27:09.960
No, that's like not even my family anymore like ferguson was maybe the worst father that's ever existed

27:10.100 --> 27:12.260
I got out of there real quick. I'm so

27:13.060 --> 27:15.620
Ready for a life. That is my own

27:16.180 --> 27:18.180
Keith thinks about that for a second goes

27:18.820 --> 27:20.820
I think we're a lot alike then

27:22.420 --> 27:25.220
And I I flash back real quick to

27:26.100 --> 27:31.620
that night where I orchestrated her father's murder and then I snipped back in and i'm

27:32.020 --> 27:37.940
Kind of on board with his whole glass family thing. She sees the turn in your eyes and she's like, okay

27:38.020 --> 27:42.340
so your body is basically a bit different now and she like

27:43.140 --> 27:49.700
Knocks like a door like she knocks on your head on one side of your head and you feel nothing

27:50.740 --> 27:53.300
And she's like, yeah, so you're like metal

27:54.260 --> 28:00.020
Like basically a lot of you is metal because you are super fucking dead and I brought you back

28:00.580 --> 28:02.740
Into this world and i'm

28:03.540 --> 28:10.020
so excited to one day maybe take you out of it if it comes to that but maybe it won't anyway, so like

28:10.580 --> 28:17.700
I'm, just so excited to have you with us because you seem really easy to manipulate. But anyway, um, we're gonna

28:18.660 --> 28:23.140
Need you to get acquainted more so like with your body and stuff

28:23.620 --> 28:26.500
And she looks over at brett and she's like brett

28:26.980 --> 28:34.100
Are you capable of getting keith ready to be in this new body that he has? Oh, I can tell you all about your body

28:34.980 --> 28:36.980
Mainly the lower parts

28:37.140 --> 28:42.100
My favorite part of the body like the calves are like knees maybe no above

28:43.140 --> 28:45.140
above it

28:45.380 --> 28:48.420
Keith like looks down and then looks back up at brendan goes

28:49.380 --> 28:56.360
No, homo no homo man, but I i'm so stoked to tell you about your new dick

29:03.460 --> 29:07.860
Keith just closes his eyes and waits for someone to just let him get up

29:07.940 --> 29:11.220
Yeah, i'm i'm resigned to whatever this is right now

29:11.460 --> 29:17.860
So francis pulls a remote very similar to the remote that the scientists pulled out earlier

29:18.180 --> 29:23.380
And she says well in order to do that. I guess you're gonna be able to need to move your body

29:24.020 --> 29:28.900
And uh, she's like i'll be back in a little bit. Maybe just like test it out and like

29:29.620 --> 29:33.300
see what you're capable of I guess and um

29:33.860 --> 29:39.620
Yeah, i'll be back shortly and she grabs the remote and clicks a button and you immediately feel

29:40.180 --> 29:47.700
Through your entire body that you have control over what what's happening and she um, she's like brett you got his restraints, right?

29:47.940 --> 29:52.980
Like as she's walking out the door and then she closes the door behind her before i'm unrestrained

29:53.060 --> 29:59.860
I like, you know kind of move my body and I can feel that my left hand that has the uh, coke dispenser

30:00.020 --> 30:00.660
Yeah

30:00.660 --> 30:03.540
When I like raise up my right arm is like pretty constricted

30:03.540 --> 30:11.300
But my left arm like goes a little farther than it would have nice. I need you to change your character sheet to a full

30:12.020 --> 30:17.940
Willpower and full hit points as the surgery that has been performed on you

30:18.500 --> 30:21.540
Has given you a new lease on life

30:22.160 --> 30:24.160
okey-dokey

30:24.340 --> 30:25.540
Brett

30:25.540 --> 30:27.700
Brett we got one. Okay, so check this out

30:27.780 --> 30:34.180
So i'm pretty sure that you know how we were talking to him earlier about maybe like letting him like bring us into like

30:34.260 --> 30:39.220

30:39.940 --> 30:42.020

31:00.340 --> 31:03.380
To turn someone into a robot I saw on this ad

31:03.780 --> 31:09.940
Where there's this one place where you can go and you have like money and you gamble it and there's like

31:10.740 --> 31:16.420

35:05.580 --> 35:07.120
inside

35:07.120 --> 35:10.080
There is another change of clothes for brett

35:11.440 --> 35:15.280

35:20.800 --> 35:24.340
And shorts that are made of some sort of material that's like wet cardboard

35:25.840 --> 35:33.200
Uh, but these the shorts are actually a light blue maybe a teal and the top

35:33.920 --> 35:39.920
Is an orange color so I I throw on this, uh, like a very light orange color

35:40.320 --> 35:44.320

35:51.040 --> 35:53.040
I put on the the polo

35:53.760 --> 35:58.320
Uh the orange polo it is way way too tight for my upper torso

35:58.560 --> 36:03.360
It's just right and then I put on the the teal shorts

36:04.080 --> 36:07.200
And they are like three sizes too big

36:09.360 --> 36:16.720
And so I I look around and um, uh, there's a pair of spareys in the the bottom

36:16.880 --> 36:20.720
Thank god for that. There's a pair of spareys in the bottom. I take the uh, like

36:21.200 --> 36:28.240
Shoelaces out of the spareys I slip the spareys on and I make a makeshift belt out of the uh shoelaces for keith

36:28.320 --> 36:31.760
So keith is now wearing a two sizes too small polo

36:32.080 --> 36:39.840
Yeah, three sizes too big pants and some loose spareys. Yeah suits you so no no socks though because

36:40.640 --> 36:42.640

Yeah keith what if you get the sweat well then they'll be sticky and they'll stick to my feet tight

36:50.080 --> 36:51.360
It's gonna smell so good

36:51.360 --> 36:57.120
Do you guys ever have that thing happen where your feet are sweating so much that there's like a like almost like a creamy residue

36:57.200 --> 36:59.200
Oh, yeah on the bun. Yeah

36:59.840 --> 37:03.200

37:22.800 --> 37:28.000

And then

37:41.120 --> 37:44.640
And you we fake spit the chai frappe on to peter

37:45.200 --> 37:52.400
And he is now an honorary inductee of the chai frappe fraternity. Thank you guys. Thelma. Welcome chode

37:52.880 --> 37:58.320
Yeah, dude, we gotta haze him now. Oh, i've always wanted to do this. I'm gonna get hazed

37:58.560 --> 38:03.280
yeah, I I pick peter up and I go over to one of the

38:03.920 --> 38:07.040
Jars that holds preserved human parts. Sure

38:07.920 --> 38:12.080
Which which jar did I pick bret that jar has a huge dick in it

38:12.640 --> 38:17.440
Yeah, it it's it's it's labeled bobbit act of 2019 perfect

38:18.000 --> 38:20.320
And I dunk peter in there. Uh-huh

38:23.520 --> 38:27.760
Oh, wait, i'm, uh, i'm a fish I can oh, yeah, okay. Yeah. No, this is

38:28.320 --> 38:32.100
This is weird that I can talk in here. But also at the same time it's like wow

38:32.580 --> 38:35.700
Oh being this close to one of these monsters, right?

38:36.420 --> 38:41.940
Yeah, too bad. It's not as big as mine. Yeah. Well, it probably wouldn't fit in this mason jar. You're fucking right

38:42.020 --> 38:47.700
We need a five gallon pail. That's cool, bro. Like hey if we don't leave now, I bet we're all gonna get caught

38:47.940 --> 38:52.180
Yeah, so part of your hazing is you have to stay in here. So I grab the jar and i'm carrying the jar

38:52.420 --> 38:54.420
Me

38:57.220 --> 39:00.340
Peter is putting his little fish head over the top

39:00.420 --> 39:08.180
His body is in the preservatives with the penis, but his head is just hanging out perfect and uh, peter starts moving his bottom legs

39:08.340 --> 39:14.900
Around and and he like picks up the uh, bobbited penis from the bottom of the jar

39:15.060 --> 39:20.580
And like lifts it with his feet up into the position where it looks like it's his

39:21.300 --> 39:23.300
I'm a sexual queeter

39:25.540 --> 39:30.420
And we leave this room finally, yeah, we we we walk out the only exit

39:31.060 --> 39:36.740
Walking out you walk into a hallway that is made completely out of black marble

39:37.300 --> 39:45.380
The floor the walls and the ceiling it is almost disorienting walking out into it and as your eyes adjust

39:46.020 --> 39:49.620
You notice that there are two doors in this hallway

39:49.700 --> 39:53.380
Are they just like uh side by side or they like one on the left one on the right?

39:53.460 --> 39:57.780
Let's go one on the left one on the right. Have either of you ever been out of that room before?

39:58.340 --> 40:02.900
Nope, no, um chai flaps forever. Yeah for life

40:03.460 --> 40:09.700
Okay, let's go to the left one. I'm I lead the way. You know what I I hand the uh jar

40:10.500 --> 40:16.260
Uh, yeah, let me take that for a minute I I hand the penis a peter jar, uh, just the peter jar

40:16.340 --> 40:20.900
I think just peter jar the peter jar. I hand it over to bret. I'm like, hey, hold on to this peter squared

40:21.140 --> 40:24.340
Wow, this jar is so light because how small the stick is compared to mine

40:25.620 --> 40:29.060
I turn the knob to the door on the left and

40:31.060 --> 40:36.900
Open it up. Oh, so there's actually no, uh, just push just yeah, it's a push. It's a push door. I push it open then

40:37.780 --> 40:43.220
No, it's actually a pole, uh, so no actually I was here yesterday it goes both ways

40:46.020 --> 40:48.020
And then you slowly

40:49.060 --> 40:52.980
I just pushed my shoulder into it and i'm like looking back at them. I'm like, yeah

40:53.780 --> 40:55.860
It's one of the best sketches i've ever seen

40:57.220 --> 40:59.220
Oh my god

40:59.300 --> 41:06.180
Okay, as you walk through this doorway you see another hallway and at the end of this hallway is a 10 by 10

41:06.420 --> 41:13.300
slab of black marble and four guards two on either side of the enormous and strange door that

41:13.600 --> 41:16.180
Slowly slides open as you approach

41:16.900 --> 41:23.860
And these guards are in full brown jumpsuits and they each have a large scythe strapped to their backs

41:24.500 --> 41:31.620
And the blade of each scythe is shaped like an enormous fish hook a closer look reveals these men have

41:32.160 --> 41:33.120
Unnatural

41:33.120 --> 41:37.940
Matching faces their eyes are far apart almost on either side of their face

41:38.260 --> 41:43.460
Their noses do not jut out but are rather just two slits above their two wide

41:43.940 --> 41:48.980
Thick-lipped mouths and they have a few flaps on either side of their necks

41:49.620 --> 41:54.120
They look eerily similar to peter deeter. Hey peter speak your language of these guys

42:01.620 --> 42:03.620
Is

42:04.740 --> 42:06.740
And the guards

42:08.340 --> 42:10.980
You got a pretty pretty star wars

42:13.620 --> 42:15.620
I like star wars

42:18.660 --> 42:22.900
Do you practice that just by sticking your face in your shower head and just like well

42:22.900 --> 42:27.380
No, uh zack actually has that written down on his computer right in front of him

42:27.620 --> 42:30.180
He's like if they take a left and they ask you to do this

42:32.580 --> 42:38.340
And uh as as peter says that the uh, the guards begin marching toward you

42:38.900 --> 42:43.940
And peter looks up and he goes I I don't think what did you say to them?

42:44.020 --> 42:47.380
I just I just said that uh, we're the chai flap

42:48.000 --> 42:52.500
Motherfuckers and we're here to take you the fuck out because we're getting out of this place

42:52.580 --> 42:58.520
Okay, tell them now that we are experiments and we're if you touch us you're going to get the same disease we have

43:01.620 --> 43:03.620
Oh

43:06.900 --> 43:09.140
And the guards do not cease

43:11.060 --> 43:17.060
Okay, I turn around and i'm like let's go to the other door and I run out and I press the door on the right

43:17.140 --> 43:19.300
Open, oh you push. I think you're supposed to pull it

43:19.860 --> 43:25.220
I however to get the fucking door open. I do that very quickly while these guys are walking at us

43:25.700 --> 43:28.660
and as you go through that door you hear the

43:29.360 --> 43:31.360
wonderful

43:31.360 --> 43:33.360
stellar tones of

43:34.240 --> 43:35.840
Oh my

43:35.840 --> 43:36.960
God

43:36.960 --> 43:44.000
When I said that you could like move about and figure out like what was going on. I didn't get the fuck

43:44.240 --> 43:45.280
Oh my god

43:45.280 --> 43:45.600
Okay

43:45.600 --> 43:52.560
We're going to see marvin right now and francis like pushes you back in to the door like in the hallway

43:52.560 --> 43:57.200
you were coming from and the guards are like right up on the other side and they're bumping into you and they just kind of

43:57.920 --> 44:05.120
Heard you toward like they they they surround you and begin walking you down this long hallway back to where we came or

44:05.360 --> 44:06.000
No

44:06.000 --> 44:07.440
No, you're going toward the door

44:07.440 --> 44:12.400
You haven't been in the guards were guarding before I look at them like I was gonna go here anyway

44:12.640 --> 44:18.560
And you walk through as this, um, this giant slab of black marvel

44:19.200 --> 44:20.560
movies

44:20.560 --> 44:22.560
Moves out of your way

44:22.560 --> 44:24.560
and

44:24.560 --> 44:26.560
And uh you walk through

44:27.120 --> 44:34.000
The doorway and inside you see the room and it is the size of a basketball court and to your left

44:34.240 --> 44:37.840
One of the long walls is entirely made of glass

44:38.400 --> 44:39.680
Get it

44:39.680 --> 44:46.180
There is a murky greenish water on the other side like an aquarium of staggering proportions

44:46.480 --> 44:53.520
And marvin glass stands there arms folded behind his back staring into the cloudy water

44:55.360 --> 44:57.360
So

44:58.240 --> 45:05.920
Marvin glass stands there. You've seen him once before he has a massive frame, but it is completely gone

45:06.080 --> 45:13.120
There's no muscle or fat and you can imagine just skin stretched across these long bones

45:13.920 --> 45:18.260
And uh marvin's dressed in a fitted black tuxedo

45:18.560 --> 45:22.240
He turns around the skin on his chin is almost translucent

45:22.320 --> 45:29.040
There's no hair not even a slight shadow of facial hair can be seen on either side of two thin bright red lips

45:29.440 --> 45:31.600
Actually, not really lips at all

45:32.160 --> 45:34.160
Just candy red lipstick

45:34.780 --> 45:40.240
Messily encircling a round hole above the sharp see-through chin

45:40.880 --> 45:43.360
And the orifice begins to move

45:45.340 --> 45:47.340
Hello keith

45:47.740 --> 45:48.840
Marvin

45:48.840 --> 45:49.980
Francis

45:49.980 --> 45:55.260
If you wouldn't mind, I don't think I trust him right now

45:55.820 --> 45:59.420
And francis pulls that remote out of her pocket and clicks a button

46:00.060 --> 46:03.980
And brett and keith you both freeze fuck

46:05.340 --> 46:11.420
Just your limbs like your body from the neck down completely paralyzed, but we're still standing. Yep

46:11.900 --> 46:13.900
I was worried about the penis jar

46:14.460 --> 46:18.860
Oh, yeah, no, yeah. No, it's it's still being held strong. Yeah

46:20.140 --> 46:22.140
keith

46:22.220 --> 46:24.220
I would like to offer you

46:25.420 --> 46:27.420
your future

46:27.500 --> 46:32.720
I believe that francis has already prepped you on some slight details

46:33.340 --> 46:40.860
Of your new form. I want to just say thank you and in order for me to say thank you to you

46:41.740 --> 46:43.720
marvin walks

46:43.780 --> 46:49.320
Extremely quickly like you see his form just walking but in the blink of an eye

46:49.480 --> 46:56.680
He is across the room and he presses into this square on the wall and a panel opens and it reveals

46:57.960 --> 47:01.080
One million dollars in cash and he points at it

47:02.600 --> 47:08.360
Keith you have earned this money you have and I want to give it to you

47:08.520 --> 47:16.060
But I am afraid of what giving a man like you one million dollars could do for our relationship

47:17.720 --> 47:18.920
Now

47:18.920 --> 47:24.360
I'm still willing to part with this money, but the surgery that we gave you was

47:24.900 --> 47:30.440
Quite expensive so I will require one more deed

47:30.920 --> 47:37.880
In order for you to pay off this surgery. I need you to do something for me. Are you willing?

47:38.360 --> 47:44.120
To do something for me. I look at the million dollars and in keith's mind

47:44.200 --> 47:48.280
I've already had that realization of I was dead. They've brought me back

47:48.440 --> 47:54.840
I realized that i've got that cocaine arm and it seemed a little more powerful than I was before and I feel

47:55.160 --> 47:57.640
Very different so I look at the million dollars

47:58.600 --> 48:00.440
And I look at marvin

48:00.440 --> 48:02.440
Who what is it?

48:02.440 --> 48:07.640
In order for me to even tell you I need you to show

48:08.360 --> 48:10.600
Your loyalty to me

48:11.480 --> 48:13.480
and he gestures

48:13.720 --> 48:15.240
to brett

48:15.240 --> 48:18.680
But more specifically the jar that brett is holding

48:19.720 --> 48:21.240
and francis

48:21.240 --> 48:24.680
Walks through and grabs peter out of the jar

48:25.320 --> 48:32.200
Oh, oh, thank you so much. Mommy. I'm just so glad that I could be here for anything. Oh, bye. Dad. Bye. Dad

48:32.600 --> 48:37.400
Bye dad and she walks over to the extremely large

48:38.020 --> 48:39.080
aquarium

48:39.080 --> 48:41.080
Where marvin is now standing?

48:42.280 --> 48:44.600
And she hands peter to marvin

48:45.640 --> 48:47.640
some things must

48:47.960 --> 48:49.220
be

48:49.220 --> 48:51.080
sacrificed

48:51.080 --> 48:57.180
And he whispers under his breath and you see this bright light inside of the orifice

48:57.720 --> 49:01.720
Above his chin and the light kind of comes out onto his hand

49:02.280 --> 49:07.340
And he grabs peter and he reaches through the wall of the aquarium

49:08.520 --> 49:10.360
and releases

49:10.360 --> 49:16.840
And then pulls his arm back out through the glass wall of the aquarium and you see that on the other side

49:17.080 --> 49:23.480
In this murky water is now swimming about peter deeter and all of the sudden this

49:24.340 --> 49:30.120
Massive creature that looks almost exactly like the guards that were outside

49:30.600 --> 49:36.220
Except four times bigger swims into focus and swallows

49:36.840 --> 49:42.300
Peter deeter hole before swimming back into the darkness of the aquarium

49:43.080 --> 49:45.080
Marvin looks back over you

49:45.960 --> 49:52.920
Uh, let's let's take it one more perhaps and francis beans walks over to brett

49:53.800 --> 49:57.160
And just starts taking him apart from behind

49:57.800 --> 50:03.100
Piece by piece falling off metal hitting the floor scraps falling by the wayside

50:03.640 --> 50:09.880
All that's left is brett's head human looking head frosted tips akimbo sitting on the floor

50:10.520 --> 50:15.240
and with one final breath brett says do it man

50:15.480 --> 50:19.500
Do you even know how much natty light you could buy with a million fucking dollars?

50:21.080 --> 50:26.860
Marvin is immediately back on the other side of the room. He presses into another panel reveals

50:27.400 --> 50:33.960
Keith's small but powerful gun the odd camera with the glass tubes all around it

50:34.600 --> 50:38.760
And the odd gun with the strange tubes surrounding it

50:39.880 --> 50:46.220
And he grabs the tiny powerful pistol that you found in a plus storage in contention

50:46.600 --> 50:49.000
And he walks it over to you and he holds it out

50:49.960 --> 50:51.060
you

50:51.060 --> 50:53.060
belong to me

50:54.020 --> 50:57.080
I will send you off to the cemetery

50:57.620 --> 51:01.960
There is a funeral happening for your former co-worker

51:03.060 --> 51:04.820
ari manstein

51:04.820 --> 51:06.820
Her father will be there

51:06.900 --> 51:12.040
Stan manstein is rarely in public. We need to take this opportunity

51:13.540 --> 51:15.220
To take him

51:15.220 --> 51:17.380
I would like you to bring him back to me

51:17.940 --> 51:19.940
for further questioning

51:20.020 --> 51:22.020
Is there anything I can do for you

51:22.020 --> 51:26.680
Do you like a specific car body armor weapons? Do you need a disguise?

51:27.300 --> 51:30.180
Would you like francis to come along with you?

51:30.900 --> 51:32.900
Is that too many questions all at once?

51:33.540 --> 51:39.380
I look at him still paralyzed. Yep. I look over brett. I say i'm sorry, but pour one out for you

51:39.780 --> 51:46.580
I look back over at marvin. I say if I get that million dollars i'm indebted to you already i'll go to loan

51:47.220 --> 51:49.220
Just like this

51:50.900 --> 51:52.900
So

52:04.500 --> 52:09.460
How am I the only one trying to

52:14.580 --> 52:16.580
Heaven

52:20.100 --> 52:22.100
Yes

52:38.420 --> 52:40.420
You
