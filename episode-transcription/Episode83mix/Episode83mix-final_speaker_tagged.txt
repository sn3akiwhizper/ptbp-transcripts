185.40 282.90 speaker0  But Wolfie knows money is evil. Like this one here from Macha505 who writes, For now, I just got to take y'all's word for it and blindly throw my support behind it. Slap my ass and call me by my preferred nomenclature. Gary Daley showed the boys an old blog post by Harold Dorsey that had been wiped from the World Wide Web.
277.00 345.80 speaker1  And Clara Blankenship, a dream-obsessed archivist with a familiar tattoo,
337.80 399.80 speaker2  But doctors now confirm that it was only Saturday Night Fever. And they assure everyone that he is staying alive. Apparently, he had chills that were multiplying. It's a good thing the angel Michael didn't come for him. Grease.
397.30 426.30 speaker3  Them and farmers are having a real face-off. On the wall, they've got a big swordfish.
424.80 435.30 speaker2  Yeah, that's really hard.
426.30 445.30 speaker3  They said while he was in the hospital, he had to get somebody to take care of his old dogs. He's in old dogs and wild hogs.
442.30 461.30 speaker2  He's in both. Oh, no. He didn't look the way he wanted to because they wouldn't allow him in the hospital to use his hairspray.
455.30 483.30 speaker3  They had to put him in a special bed because he was too tall because he couldn't get shorty. Gotti.
474.30 548.30 speaker2  You're in this large underground chamber that Gary Daley led you to in order to hide from Pastor Adam Kane and the First Creek family of contention. Jimmy Sanders is wandering around the place, murmuring to himself. Mildred Mitchell is in the tent furthest from you and hasn't popped out since your arrival. Casey Kristoff, the long-time janitor at the First Church of contention, is leaning up against one of the four concrete columns, acting like he is reading a book while he listens in on the conversation you've been having with Harry Klinker, Gary Daley, and Clara Blankenship, who just showed you a video of John Peters from a few years ago. A video that was scrubbed from the internet. A video wherein he talks about the dreams he had during his coma. Clara puts down her phone and looks to you all.
544.30 690.30 speaker3  Uh, that's, that's my, that's my uncle, uh, Don D. Pettymore. Probably lots of other people. He mostly did it as like a party trick, but sometimes, you know, if he got a little too drunk or if he really didn't like a feller, he'd burn them pretty good. You know, he did call it devil hands. But it, you know, it warmed, it warmed my little bones up, so. Did he, did he ever tell you why he thought he could do it? Like that's not something most people can do, John. I mean, I guess it just became part of your world as a kid, but it's kind of weird. Where, where is he now? And you know, now, as I say, I'm about to say this next thing, uh, it does make the devil's hand sound a lot more sinister, but he's, he's really involved in some, in some nasty business. And, uh, he put up a lot of money for my race and career when I was a younger man. And, uh, I kinda, I kinda, I kinda biffed that, uh, a little bit and ended up owing him a lot of money. And I thought maybe the safest place for me to be was in a uniform. And devil hands, right. No, no, no. He just, you know, toasted his fingers a little bit. Claire, you said you've been seeing the, have you, have you seen a person who can burn hands in your, in your visions of this rope? You've been seeing the rope figure though, right?
685.30 712.30 speaker2  Yeah. Yeah. The rope figure, which like, Keith, you've been really quiet for the past like 10 minutes. Maybe it's just cause Luke's internet dropped last time, but have you seen any of these? I mean, we were talking the rope figure, we were talking these long...
705.30 776.30 speaker3  but speaking of the fellows that were chasing the rope figure, come to think of it, last time I saw Uncle Don, I didn't really have much say in the matter. and we were just running for no reason, but now that I've seen them again, that doesn't seem like a very likely explanation.
775.30 982.30 speaker2  Okay. Your daddy, John Lee Pettymore III, younger than you ever remember seeing him, is pacing back and forth anxiously. His face turns hopeful as your mother enters the room, but she slowly shakes her head no as tears begin pouring down her face. Her husband rushes to embrace his shaking wife, her body convulsing rhythmically to the sobs as a negative pregnancy test falls from her grasp onto the cold tile floor. The channel changes. You see your daddy again, eyes completely wide and bloodshot, knuckles white as he grips the steering wheel of his black 1977 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am. Backlit by a home completely engulfed in flames, he looks into the rearview mirror to make sure he isn't being followed. You see a Fincher-esque aerial shot of this entire scene begin to slowly zoom in on the fire and there's a young boy crawling out from this completely consumed building. And the camera does that cool thing where it moves into the trunk and there you see a baby swaddled in a black suit jacket sitting on top of adoption papers.
980.30 987.30 speaker3  Oh, wonderful. Very appropriate.
982.30 1053.30 speaker2  Yes, that is absolutely correct. So Luke and Joe, if you guys want to take your headphones off again. For sure. 64. All right. 64 is going to be Lottery Mania. An extreme desire to take part in lotteries. 23. 23 is Cardicoethis. Cardicoethis, which is an uncontrollable compulsion to see maps everywhere. And the last one? 97. And a 97 is Trichotillomania. Craving for pulling out own hair.
1041.30 1060.30 speaker3  Wow. These all provide some very interesting role playing options. The last one might be too horrific. It would be really gross. Though I do potentially have thousands of arm hairs.
1058.30 1066.30 speaker2  And mustache hairs.
1063.30 1075.30 speaker3  I'm going to go, I think, with Lottery Mania.
1073.30 1139.30 speaker2  That would open up some more role player opportunities. Holy shit, he's gonna come.
1135.30 1246.30 speaker3  Well anyway, I saw those figures when I was a kid. John turns around on you and he's like, you wanna bet? And we got shooed inside and my dad gave that watch to Ferguson and told him that he was gonna be the savior. So I guess that's not true. Listeners, I hope you're ready for Ben's watching episode 2. Part 2. The rebinjanine.
1229.30 1376.30 speaker2  You recognize Clark Bishop, Keith Vigna, yourself, and John Lee Pettymore III as they approach the bank of Bean's Pond, with John trailing the other two, you and Clark, by a few yards. Focused on searching for something in the water, Clark and Keith fail to see John raise his gun, take a deep breath, and fire two shots, one for each of his partners. John actually vomits. The watch is still on, Keith. And Keith, all you see is this ooze coming out of every orifice on John Lee Pettymore III's face.
1370.30 1395.30 speaker3  John puts his hand on his gun. He doesn't draw it, but he puts it on his holster.
1393.30 1413.30 speaker2  What do you want my gun for, Keith?
1411.30 1496.30 speaker3  Thomas should take his headphones out. He took it out. Oh, he did. What'd he tell you, Clark? Come over here and whisper it in my ear. I suspect perhaps you two are as well, but I know for a fact that I am. That might be a little complicated. Why don't you tell me why all of a sudden you want to disarm me? If all you saw was being a child of destiny, when you popped out of there, you said adopted the vector. You kept repeating it. What did that mean?
1494.30 1503.30 speaker2  Technically, he did adopt himself.
1499.30 1563.30 speaker3  This body that you see before you, the body of Kevin Lee Pettymore. John is not taking his hand off his gun. The body of Kevin Lee Pettymore, the soul and mind of Kevin Lee Pettymore. See, he was sent to, I guess, kill all the gangs. Don't rightly know why, but they had adopted a little baby. That's me. I was going to be a cane, fellas. But then my daddy burned down their house and little Adam crawled out of it. He thought he'd killed all them canes, but I guess Adam got out. And I also saw a little vision of him and my mama trying real hard to have a baby, and they couldn't. So it was on his mind. And it seems like, you know, you kind of, well, you see a baby on the table, you just take it, you know how it is sometimes.
1562.30 1576.30 speaker2  The Pettymore way.
1569.30 1627.30 speaker3  What he was telling somebody is that he had eliminated the vector adopted by the canes. And he took me in. And maybe you boys is from similar circumstances. Anyway, that's my story, Ergo, child of destiny. Did you deserve it? I don't rightly believe so. You killed us at the pond, and you took the watch. Why is it stuck to you? You know, like I said, my dad told Ferguson, when the time comes, it'll fit, you know?
1625.30 1639.30 speaker2  Yeah, but he said that about himself.
1635.30 1750.30 speaker3  And he realized it wasn't him, and he thought it was going to be Ferguson. But, you know, he's gone, so I've got it. And he said when the time comes, it'll fit, and it's not falling off me. And if there's any time for it to be the time of and for a savior, I'd say just right about now is the time. But you're, listen, I've been ball. I am the vector. If anybody's going to be a savior around here, it seems like it would probably be me. Nothing could oversee ball. It couldn't be contained. It burst gloriously from the roof that tries to constrain it. I've always needed your guys' help, and maybe we're each a piece of a puzzle. He has that spell that was perfect for three of us. If it was any one of us, it was important.
1748.30 1786.30 speaker2  Gary, which one of us is the savior? I'm just saying, my seafood fur will change the world.
1781.30 1888.30 speaker3  You know, maybe this watch is just showing us bullshit. Maybe we should just go to the pond. Clark starts nodding emphatically. Yeah, what if it's showing us bullshit? How do we know any of it's anything to put any stock in? I mean, yeah, it could easily... Well, except for the part where I'm a child of destiny. I felt that in my bones to be true. I think maybe we ought to go down into the pond, but maybe I'll keep wearing it and maybe you don't... Maybe you're in front instead of behind us. That would have been the way to do it. And I draw my gun and I kick it across to him. I hand the gun to Clark. Hey Clark, can I have that gun back? Once we get past the moment in time, things change. Gary, do you have any extra guns?
1886.30 1929.30 speaker2  There's a few different choice weapons.
1928.30 1952.30 speaker3  Zach? You know, the watch is still on, I'm not seeing anything, so.
1951.30 1956.30 speaker2  Maybe you just needed a winging.
1952.30 2101.30 speaker3  I think a total of six shots does the trick, you know. Yeah, you shot both of us and then you shot us more. We'll have you walk in front, just in case. No, I mean, the first time I saw it was that day when me and Fergie were just playing outside and all of a sudden those creatures popped up in our yard and I don't really know what happened to them, but the first time I saw that watch my dad was giving it to Ferguson. It's just a normal watch looking, right? I mean, yeah, it's just a gold watch. It's real nice, but, you know, it's a pretty normal watch other than it gives you visions and only fits me. I think, you know, she shouldn't be too much of an issue with Tyler. That's really weird. Good things don't typically happen when we split up. What if I trade you this new gun for Seth? Are you going to kill us?
2097.30 2204.30 speaker2  Someone's trying to get out, but they didn't unzip the tent flap first. She still has one rainbow earring on, but the other one's missing, and her hair's all over the place. And she's holding this piece of paper in one hand that she immediately, like, oh, no, and puts it in her back pocket. And then she's holding a picture in her other hand, and she's like, this, this, this, this is the one. But I, just now, standing in this tent, it changed. It changed. It was him, and then it, and then it was him. And she points at John. She says, it was him. And then she points at Keith, and she says, it was him. And there you see Silas Cole, but it is not the face of the Silas Cole that you remember seeing growing up, who is very handsome. A very good-looking, maybe a ridiculously handsome man. But now, that face is the face of Keith Vigna. You didn't roll sanity for me?
2197.30 2241.30 speaker4  And then, and then, I mean, even up until a few days ago, and, and then it became Keith, yes, Keith's face. Oh my God, that's who, I knew he looked familiar. Hey, oh my God.
2240.30 2243.30 speaker2  I got a three.
2242.30 2266.30 speaker3  I got a two. Jesus.
2260.30 2320.30 speaker2  I don't know if that's obvious, just listening to how everything's gone down, but in this moment, you know it to be true. There's a vague, faint reflection, and in it, you think you can make out the general outline, vague aura of Tildi B. Mitchell.
2319.30 2335.30 speaker3  That checks out.
2334.30 2343.30 speaker2  What if I gave you this gun?
2342.30 2371.30 speaker3  Clark's got it. Give me Seth. Clark. We're bringing Mildred with us.
2370.30 2383.30 speaker2  Yeah? Oh. Go ahead and roll sanity. Just you.
2382.30 2474.30 speaker3  Yep. And I start freaking out, and I look at the picture, and I look at Mildred, and I just fly at her and tackle her to the ground and trying to start just beating the shit out of her. No. I leap at her. I failed. I rolled over. I got an 85 on a 70. Nice. Oh, my goodness gracious.
2468.30 2481.30 speaker2  Luke just showed us with his webcam. He rolled an 0-1, and I failed with a 43. Mildred Mitchell's not a fighter.
2474.30 2514.30 speaker3  I look up from the picture, lock eyes with her, and tackle her to the ground and just start punching her in the face.
2509.30 2584.30 speaker2  It fell out, and it's on the ground next to her, and you kind of puke on the corner of it. And it is just a piece of paper that she has written on it, and it says, However, Gary and Harry are both standing at their tense edge, guns drawn. Harry has a pistol, and Gary has a semi-automatic rifle, and they are slowly walking toward Keith Vigna, who's on the ground, and they have their weapons pointed. And Gary's like, you stay right there! You stay on the ground! What the fuck?
2582.30 2601.30 speaker3  I turn around, and I give you a glare.
2597.30 2620.30 speaker0  That was my dream. Claire's over there talking about dreams like, About your dreams? No, no.
2617.30 2629.30 speaker2  Now you're questioning about temperature. Okay, okay. We just gotta all calm down, okay?
2625.30 2664.30 speaker3  or if the temperature itself got too high. Jesus fucking Christ, John.
2657.30 2681.30 speaker1  Harry, I'm sorry. I understand that was alarming. We've all become touchy in the last few days. Things set us off, and it's not good, I understand, but look at him now. Look at him now. He's scared. He doesn't even know what just happened. I guarantee it.
2679.30 2688.30 speaker0  If you're gonna go to the pond, go to the fucking pond.
2686.30 2704.30 speaker3  Go to the fucking pond.
2701.30 2748.30 speaker2  I trust his dream, and I don't want to die today. And I believe all of you. I believe you've been through some shit. It's putting you on edge. It's making you do all sorts of weird things. We've all seen a lot of messed up shit in the past few days. Maybe even our whole lives, but it's just coming to fruition now for some reason. But I swear, what Keith just did to Mildred is not okay, and I know he's gone now. I know he's gone. Okay? He went down that tunnel. Y'all are gonna go have to find him if you want to find him, okay? He's heading south. That's the way you were heading anyway.
2745.30 2755.30 speaker1  I need you to maybe keep him here. Don't let him get anywhere.
2752.30 2776.30 speaker3  Drew Kerry. That's a funny little thing we say. Make sure you don't feed him anything with too much sugar, and make sure you give Tyler a treat before bed every night. Sorry about all this. Mildred, we are going to, at some point, time cop our way into finding your daughter, I'm sure of it.
2773.30 2785.30 speaker2  because Keith just beat the shit out of her and she's an old woman.
2782.30 2797.30 speaker3  Wake up, lazy bones. Oh, God.
2793.30 2800.30 speaker2  because I trust that you will, and here come Monday, you come get a steaming hot bowl of seafood pho. COSMOS
