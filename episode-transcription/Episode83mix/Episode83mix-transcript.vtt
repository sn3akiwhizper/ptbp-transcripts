00:00.000 --> 00:07.600
Hot damn, y'all. I just heard cheesecake is a real thing that real human people like to eat.

00:07.600 --> 00:17.000
I didn't know I could get all my favorite kinds of messy, curdled cream all in one solidified circle,

00:17.000 --> 00:21.100
ready to cram all up in my maw.

00:21.100 --> 00:24.900
I hope it's as slimy as I imagined it to be.

00:24.900 --> 00:28.500
It's your dreamy, cheesy daddy Wolf the Dog,

00:28.500 --> 00:36.300
and I am dreaming of that cheesy, sexy good time live from 694.2 PTBP.

00:36.300 --> 00:45.500
We are proud to announce this community has raised $6,502 for the bail project.

00:45.500 --> 00:50.000
And since the bail money goes back to them when cases close,

00:50.000 --> 00:55.200
they're able to recycle every dollar donated at least twice per year.

00:55.200 --> 00:57.900
Go to the link in the show notes to help.

00:57.900 --> 01:05.200
The bail project combats mass incarceration and reshapes the pretrial system in the United States.

01:05.200 --> 01:10.400
Screenshot your donation and email us pretendingpod at gmail.com.

01:10.400 --> 01:17.000
And for every $5 donated, you'll have an entry to win a Pretending to Be People t-shirt.

01:17.000 --> 01:21.700
The third winner in this giveaway will be announced right now.

01:21.700 --> 01:24.600
And that generous listener is...

01:27.600 --> 01:31.400
Congratulations, Joelle. Keep donating, y'all.

01:31.400 --> 01:36.100
There are still two more PTBP shirts left to give away.

01:36.100 --> 01:38.300
I'd love to get one of them shirts,

01:38.300 --> 01:44.900
but every time I put clothes on, they melt into a kind of shirt paste after a few hours.

01:44.900 --> 01:52.100
One time, I made a sweater out of a bunch of hair clippings I found out back behind a dog groomer's place.

01:52.100 --> 01:57.200
And by the time I made it home, it turned into a kind of hair jelly.

01:57.200 --> 02:02.600
Slap that on some toast, throw some paprika on it, and you got a stool going, baby.

02:02.600 --> 02:09.400
Have any thoughts on any of that? Then tag at PretendingPod on Twitter or Instagram.

02:09.400 --> 02:12.500
Let me know how you really feel.

02:12.500 --> 02:19.100
It's one of the best ways to get the word out about our little show here at 694.2.

02:19.100 --> 02:21.700
And it's free, too.

02:21.700 --> 02:29.600
What's not free is that sweet, sweet bonus content over at patreon.com slash pretending pod.

02:29.600 --> 02:34.500
But it's worth it. I'm worth it. And I guess you're worth it, too.

02:34.500 --> 02:40.000
And for those of you in the Dennis Inn, get ready for part three of Lover in the Ice.

02:40.000 --> 02:51.000
Streaming live into your room, workplace, or fancy toilet setup on Tuesday, June 23rd at 7 p.m. Central time.

02:51.000 --> 02:57.600
My producer says the edited audio of part two will be up before Monday is complete.

02:57.600 --> 03:05.400
And that episode will be available to all patrons at the Splashylvania Fastpass holder tier and up.

03:05.400 --> 03:08.700
But Wolfie knows money is evil.

03:08.700 --> 03:16.900
So if you can't swing the expense, write up a five star review on Apple Podcasts and I might read it on air.

03:16.900 --> 03:21.300
Like this one here from Macha505 who writes,

03:21.300 --> 03:24.900
I'm super impressed with the quality of this podcast.

03:24.900 --> 03:28.700
All the role players are imaginative and committed.

03:28.700 --> 03:34.100
And the DM is an incredible story creator and storyteller.

03:34.100 --> 03:39.100
My husband and I listen to this weekly. Definitely recommend.

03:39.100 --> 03:42.200
Well, that's so nice of you to say, Macha.

03:42.200 --> 03:48.800
One day when I understand the merits of modern technology, I hope I can listen to the podcast.

03:48.800 --> 03:54.500
For now, I just got to take y'all's word for it and blindly throw my support behind it.

03:54.500 --> 03:59.300
Slap my ass and call me by my preferred nomenclature.

03:59.300 --> 04:06.400
It's the news after escaping the growing but leisurely ooze by heading down into the sewer system.

04:06.400 --> 04:13.900
Gary Daley showed the boys an old blog post by Harold Dorsey that had been wiped from the World Wide Web.

04:13.900 --> 04:23.400
Our intrepid adventurers, along with Drew Carey, Tyler and Jimmy Sanders, were led to Harry and Gary's underground hideout.

04:23.400 --> 04:28.500
There, Mildred Mitchell, Tildy B's grandma hid in her tent.

04:28.500 --> 04:37.000
Casey Kristoff, the longtime janitor at the First Church of Contention, listened in while feigning interest in his book.

04:37.000 --> 04:42.900
And Clara Blankenship, a dream-obsessed archivist with a familiar tattoo,

04:42.900 --> 04:50.300
showed them a vlog from the previously missing John Peters that had also been pulled from the interwebs.

04:50.300 --> 04:59.000
Catch these hands, my babies, and feel the fire of kudzu with no backbone.

05:20.300 --> 05:37.800
My mom just sent me a meme that says, breaking news, John Travolta was hospitalized for suspected COVID-19.

05:37.800 --> 05:45.800
But doctors now confirm that it was only Saturday Night Fever.

05:45.800 --> 05:51.300
And they assure everyone that he is staying alive.

05:51.300 --> 05:59.300
Apparently, he had chills that were multiplying.

05:59.300 --> 06:04.800
It's a good thing the angel Michael didn't come for him.

06:04.800 --> 06:08.300
Grease.

06:08.300 --> 06:11.300
It would have been a heck of a phenomenon.

06:11.300 --> 06:14.300
Oh, that's good.

06:14.300 --> 06:20.800
Everybody wants world peace, but it really seems that we've got a real battlefield here on Earth.

06:20.800 --> 06:25.300
Yeah, we're heading toward a face-off.

06:25.300 --> 06:37.300
The other day on TV, have you heard about the wild hogs in Missouri?

06:37.300 --> 06:39.800
Them and farmers are having a real face-off.

06:39.800 --> 06:40.800
I already used face-off.

06:40.800 --> 06:42.800
Oh, shit.

06:42.800 --> 06:48.800
I got a postcard from my aunt from Paris with love.

06:48.800 --> 06:52.300
Have you ever eaten at Hemingway's up at Bass Pro?

06:52.300 --> 06:54.300
On the wall, they've got a big swordfish.

06:54.300 --> 06:55.800
Oh, wow.

06:55.800 --> 07:00.800
Hey, good one.

07:00.800 --> 07:04.800
I couldn't relate it to his COVID diagnosis, but it worked.

07:04.800 --> 07:06.300
Yeah, that's really hard.

07:06.300 --> 07:15.300
They said while he was in the hospital, he had to get somebody to take care of his old dogs.

07:15.300 --> 07:17.300
Oh, wow.

07:17.300 --> 07:20.300
Isn't it old hogs? Wild hogs?

07:20.300 --> 07:22.300
He's in old dogs and wild hogs.

07:22.300 --> 07:25.300
He's in both. Oh, no.

07:25.300 --> 07:33.300
He didn't look the way he wanted to because they wouldn't allow him in the hospital to use his hairspray.

07:33.300 --> 07:35.300
Oh, yeah.

07:35.300 --> 07:41.300
They had to put him in a special bed because he was too tall because he couldn't get shorty.

07:41.300 --> 07:43.300
Gotti.

07:43.300 --> 07:44.300
Gotti.

07:44.300 --> 07:46.300
Luke's just looking at Wikipedia now.

07:46.300 --> 07:51.300
Oh, look who's talking now. Thomas is back in the room.

07:51.300 --> 07:54.300
Clark Bishop, Keith Vigna, and John Lee Pettymore III.

07:54.300 --> 08:03.300
You're in this large underground chamber that Gary Daley led you to in order to hide from Pastor Adam Kane and the First Creek family of contention.

08:03.300 --> 08:11.300
Kerry Pages, Drew Andrews' body, is on the ground, cuffed, and nuzzling Tyler, the tireless black lab.

08:11.300 --> 08:15.300
Jimmy Sanders is wandering around the place, murmuring to himself.

08:15.300 --> 08:21.300
Mildred Mitchell is in the tent furthest from you and hasn't popped out since your arrival.

08:21.300 --> 08:29.300
Casey Kristoff, the long-time janitor at the First Church of contention, is leaning up against one of the four concrete columns,

08:29.300 --> 08:38.300
acting like he is reading a book while he listens in on the conversation you've been having with Harry Klinker, Gary Daley, and Clara Blankenship,

08:38.300 --> 08:43.300
who just showed you a video of John Peters from a few years ago.

08:43.300 --> 08:46.300
A video that was scrubbed from the internet.

08:46.300 --> 08:51.300
A video wherein he talks about the dreams he had during his coma.

08:51.300 --> 08:54.300
Clara puts down her phone and looks to you all.

08:54.300 --> 08:59.300
What does a Nike bag have to do with another world and a man who can burn persons with his hands?

08:59.300 --> 09:04.300
I might know a feller who, uh, who, who can shake your hand and make it burn.

09:04.300 --> 09:08.300
Uh, that's, that's my, that's my uncle, uh, Don D. Pettymore.

09:08.300 --> 09:09.300
What?

09:09.300 --> 09:12.300
That, that's, yeah, that's my, my uncle can do that.

09:12.300 --> 09:14.300
Probably lots of other people.

09:14.300 --> 09:21.300
He mostly did it as like a party trick, but sometimes, you know, if he got a little too drunk or if he really didn't like a feller, he'd burn them pretty good.

09:21.300 --> 09:29.300
But like also he'd, he'd, he'd stick it in your mittens when we were kids on a cold day and, and he'd warm you up.

09:29.300 --> 09:36.300
So we always took it as like, you know, it wasn't, I didn't think of it as anything sinister.

09:38.300 --> 09:40.300
You know, he did call it devil hands.

09:45.300 --> 09:49.300
But it, you know, it warmed, it warmed my little bones up, so.

09:49.300 --> 09:54.300
Did he, did he ever tell you why he thought he could do it? Like that's not something most people can do, John.

09:54.300 --> 09:58.300
I mean, I guess it just became part of your world as a kid, but it's kind of weird.

09:58.300 --> 10:05.300
I never, I never asked, you know, cause yeah, it's just, since I was born, Uncle Don could do that.

10:05.300 --> 10:06.300
Where, where is he now?

10:06.300 --> 10:15.300
Well, uh, I can, you know, that's, I actually kind of come, uh, come into law enforcement because of, because of him.

10:15.300 --> 10:25.300
And you know, now, as I say, I'm about to say this next thing, uh, it does make the devil's hand sound a lot more sinister, but he's, he's really involved in some, in some nasty business.

10:25.300 --> 10:30.300
And, uh, he put up a lot of money for my race and career when I was a younger man.

10:30.300 --> 10:38.300
And, uh, I kinda, I kinda, I kinda biffed that, uh, a little bit and ended up owing him a lot of money.

10:38.300 --> 10:41.300
And I thought maybe the safest place for me to be was in a uniform.

10:41.300 --> 10:46.300
To avoid him, you mean? To keep you safe from, like, loan sharks?

10:46.300 --> 10:51.300
Yeah, uh, yeah. And devil hands.

10:51.300 --> 10:52.300
And devil hands, right.

10:52.300 --> 10:56.300
So what would he have been doing with a Nike bag? With the Nike bag?

10:56.300 --> 11:02.300
This, this devil hands uncle of yours, when was the last time you saw him?

11:02.300 --> 11:08.300
Uh, you know, a few, a few years ago, he did the old devil hands on, on Large Eddie.

11:08.300 --> 11:12.300
Large, Largette, he, he burned, he burned somebody. Did it kill him?

11:12.300 --> 11:16.300
No, no, no. He just, you know, toasted his fingers a little bit.

11:16.300 --> 11:23.300
Claire, you said you've been seeing the, have you, have you seen a person who can burn hands in your, in your visions of this rope?

11:23.300 --> 11:25.300
You've been seeing the rope figure though, right?

11:25.300 --> 11:30.300
Yeah. Yeah. The rope figure, which like, Keith, you've been really quiet for the past like 10 minutes.

11:30.300 --> 11:35.300
Maybe it's just cause Luke's internet dropped last time, but have you seen any of these?

11:35.300 --> 11:38.300
I mean, we were talking the rope figure, we were talking these long...

11:38.300 --> 11:45.300
Before, before Keith says anything, I do also seem to, and I'm just kicking myself for just thinking of this now,

11:45.300 --> 11:52.300
but speaking of the fellows that were chasing the rope figure, come to think of it, last time I saw Uncle Don,

11:52.300 --> 12:00.300
uh, two of them, those weird, tall, lanky, translucent figures, they was chasing us for a while.

12:00.300 --> 12:07.300
I took quite a severe head injury, uh, the last time I saw Uncle Don, so a lot of the details are fuzzy.

12:07.300 --> 12:14.300
Did you, you felt, you felt like this, the, the, the translucent guys wearing suits that they were chasing you in particular?

12:14.300 --> 12:22.300
Well, they were chasing, I see, I was being wheeled in a wheelchair by Uncle Don at the time and he, we took off in flight.

12:22.300 --> 12:25.300
I didn't really have much say in the matter.

12:25.300 --> 12:32.300
They were after him or me or someone running directly in front of us, maybe we were running parallel to the people they were chasing

12:32.300 --> 12:38.300
and we were just running for no reason, but now that I've seen them again, that doesn't seem like a very likely explanation.

12:38.300 --> 12:46.300
You know, I must have had repressed memories or something, but you know, when we were messing around with this and I pulled the watch out of my pocket.

12:46.300 --> 12:48.300
Oh, I put it on.

12:48.300 --> 12:55.300
Alright, uh, uh, Luke and Joe, take your headphones off.

12:55.300 --> 12:56.300
Okay.

12:56.300 --> 13:18.300
John, the channel on your reality begins changing as expected and then it stops and you're looking at the kitchen of your childhood home.

13:18.300 --> 13:26.300
Your daddy, John Lee Pettymore III, younger than you ever remember seeing him, is pacing back and forth anxiously.

13:26.300 --> 13:36.300
His face turns hopeful as your mother enters the room, but she slowly shakes her head no as tears begin pouring down her face.

13:36.300 --> 13:50.300
Her husband rushes to embrace his shaking wife, her body convulsing rhythmically to the sobs as a negative pregnancy test falls from her grasp onto the cold tile floor.

13:50.300 --> 14:04.300
The channel changes. You see your daddy again, eyes completely wide and bloodshot, knuckles white as he grips the steering wheel of his black 1977 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am.

14:04.300 --> 14:14.300
Backlit by a home completely engulfed in flames, he looks into the rearview mirror to make sure he isn't being followed.

14:14.300 --> 14:25.300
He speaks into a large car phone. The vector adopted by the Kane family has been eliminated. Casualties, unfortunately, include the rest of the family.

14:25.300 --> 14:39.300
You see a Fincher-esque aerial shot of this entire scene begin to slowly zoom in on the fire and there's a young boy crawling out from this completely consumed building.

14:39.300 --> 14:52.300
He has a balloon-shaped head and eyes so dark that the irises look black. Your view shifts back onto John's black muscle car driving into the night.

14:52.300 --> 15:04.300
And the camera does that cool thing where it moves into the trunk and there you see a baby swaddled in a black suit jacket sitting on top of adoption papers.

15:05.300 --> 15:13.300
Holy shit. Can I get an audio reaction that matches what your face just looked like?

15:13.300 --> 15:18.300
He's not a real petty boy. He's a damn Kane.

15:18.300 --> 15:37.300
So the watch falls off John's hand. John just sits on the floor, like almost falls. He's down.

15:37.300 --> 15:41.300
Whoa, whoa, John, John. I'm trying to ease his fall to the ground. John?

15:41.300 --> 15:43.300
You guys are close enough, you can kind of catch him.

15:43.300 --> 15:44.300
Keith, he put it on again.

15:44.300 --> 15:51.300
Yeah, I was about to tell you about the guys, but holy shit. What'd you see?

15:51.300 --> 15:58.300
John's eyes are just wide. He's just repeating, adopted the vector. They adopted the vector.

15:58.300 --> 16:00.300
Adopted the vector.

16:00.300 --> 16:03.300
Roll Sanity. Thomas?

16:03.300 --> 16:10.300
Crit success. Wait, no, no, no, no, no. Sorry. 33 is a crit failure because I don't know.

16:11.300 --> 16:16.300
All right. But at least it's not over my power.

16:16.300 --> 16:18.300
You're going to lose two sanity.

16:18.300 --> 16:20.300
That takes me to my breaking point.

16:20.300 --> 16:22.300
Oh, wonderful. Very appropriate.

16:22.300 --> 16:27.300
Yes, that is absolutely correct. So Luke and Joe, if you guys want to take your headphones off again.

16:27.300 --> 16:28.300
For sure.

16:28.300 --> 16:34.300
You guys should try putting on the watch this episode because he's got some great shit fucking written for that this time.

16:40.300 --> 16:54.300
All righty. Thomas, you know the drill. I need you to roll on a D-100 three times and give me the results one at a time.

16:54.300 --> 16:55.300
64.

16:55.300 --> 17:03.300
All right. 64 is going to be Lottery Mania. An extreme desire to take part in lotteries.

17:03.300 --> 17:04.300
23.

17:04.300 --> 17:14.300
23 is Cardicoethis. Cardicoethis, which is an uncontrollable compulsion to see maps everywhere. And the last one?

17:14.300 --> 17:15.300
97.

17:15.300 --> 17:21.300
And a 97 is Trichotillomania. Craving for pulling out own hair.

17:21.300 --> 17:33.300
Wow. These all provide some very interesting role playing options. The last one might be too horrific.

17:33.300 --> 17:35.300
It would be really gross.

17:35.300 --> 17:38.300
Though I do potentially have thousands of arm hairs.

17:38.300 --> 17:40.300
And mustache hairs.

17:40.300 --> 17:43.300
I think that's the last thing he'd pull out. That's only when it's truly broken.

17:43.300 --> 17:46.300
I'm going to go, I think, with Lottery Mania.

17:46.300 --> 17:53.300
Okay. An extreme desire to take part in lotteries. And let's go ahead and just throw in gambling into that as a whole.

17:53.300 --> 17:55.300
That would open up some more role player opportunities.

17:55.300 --> 17:56.300
Exactly.

17:56.300 --> 18:01.300
I was just thinking maybe he would try to start his own lottery and really evangelize it.

18:01.300 --> 18:08.300
I think within the confines of this game, trying to take bets with people consistently is going to be an easier...

18:08.300 --> 18:12.300
Let's do that. Alright. He's a gambling addict.

18:12.300 --> 18:15.300
He's a gambling addict out of nowhere.

18:15.300 --> 18:17.300
Holy shit, he's gonna come.

18:18.300 --> 18:20.300
Hahahaha!

18:30.300 --> 18:38.300
John Lee Pettymore the 3rd, as the watch falls off his wrist, he crumples into the ground and Clark Bishop kind of reaches out and takes hold of him.

18:38.300 --> 18:41.300
John starts dry heaving. Clark is gonna pat your back.

18:41.300 --> 18:43.300
What's that sound like?

18:44.300 --> 18:52.300
John? You got something coming up? Alright, get it out.

18:55.300 --> 18:59.300
Well anyway, I saw those figures when I was a kid.

18:59.300 --> 19:04.300
John turns around on you and he's like, you wanna bet?

19:04.300 --> 19:18.300
I mean, yeah. The first time I saw the watch, my dad was giving it to my brother and the alarms were going off at our house and a few of those creatures were, I guess, invading the property.

19:18.300 --> 19:30.300
And we got shooed inside and my dad gave that watch to Ferguson and told him that he was gonna be the savior. So I guess that's not true.

19:30.300 --> 19:46.300
The savior? Yeah, something like that. He said, when the time comes, the watch would fit him. I wonder if I'm the savior. Maybe it fits me and I put the watch on.

19:46.300 --> 19:51.300
Alrighty, Thomas and Joe. Take those headphones off.

19:51.300 --> 19:57.300
Listeners, I hope you're ready for Ben's watching episode 2.

19:57.300 --> 19:59.300
Part 2.

19:59.300 --> 20:01.300
The rebinjanine.

20:29.300 --> 20:46.300
You recognize Clark Bishop, Keith Vigna, yourself, and John Lee Pettymore III as they approach the bank of Bean's Pond, with John trailing the other two, you and Clark, by a few yards.

20:46.300 --> 20:59.300
Focused on searching for something in the water, Clark and Keith fail to see John raise his gun, take a deep breath, and fire two shots, one for each of his partners.

20:59.300 --> 21:22.300
He quickly finishes the task with four more bullets before he crouches down beside your bodies. He grabs your wrist and pulls the watch off and slips it over his own wrist, before he begins walking slowly into the frigid water of Bean's Pond.

21:22.300 --> 21:25.300
Oh, no.

21:29.300 --> 21:47.300
Clark and John, you actually see Keith Vigna's eyes come back to and look at you, and the watch stays on his wrist.

21:47.300 --> 21:49.300
John actually vomits.

21:49.300 --> 21:52.300
Keith? Keith? Are you with us? Are you with us?

21:52.300 --> 21:54.300
Yeah, Keith, roll Sanity.

21:54.300 --> 21:56.300
The watch is still on, Keith.

21:56.300 --> 21:58.300
Fail, but not over my power.

21:58.300 --> 22:12.300
Okay, you just lose one Sanity, and as Keith realizes the watch is still on, he looks directly into the eyes of John Lee Pettymore III, and John, all you see is fear.

22:12.300 --> 22:20.300
And Keith, all you see is this ooze coming out of every orifice on John Lee Pettymore III's face.

22:20.300 --> 22:35.300
I just saw us die at the pond.

22:35.300 --> 22:50.300
John, can you put your gun down and slide it away from you?

22:50.300 --> 22:56.300
John puts his hand on his gun. He doesn't draw it, but he puts it on his holster.

22:56.300 --> 22:58.300
Hey, whoa, hey, what's going on?

22:58.300 --> 23:13.300
And immediately, Clara and Gary and Harry all kind of back up and go and kind of stand nearby Casey Kristoff, who immediately just kind of like fumbles with his book and then steps away and tries to like move behind one of the pillars.

23:13.300 --> 23:15.300
What do you want my gun for, Keith?

23:15.300 --> 23:21.300
I don't want it. I just, I don't want you to have it right now.

23:21.300 --> 23:23.300
Why don't you want him to have his gun, Keith?

23:23.300 --> 23:31.300
I like look at both of them, like looking back and forth to him and I walk over to Clark and I whisper something in his ear.

23:31.300 --> 23:33.300
Thomas should take his headphones out.

23:33.300 --> 23:34.300
He took it out.

23:34.300 --> 23:35.300
Oh, he did.

23:35.300 --> 23:48.300
Clark, I saw him, us approaching the pond and John, he shot us and he killed us and then he took the watch and he went into the pond.

23:48.300 --> 23:50.300
He just shot us out of the blue?

23:50.300 --> 23:57.300
He shot each of us in the back and then four more shots to finish us off and then...

23:57.300 --> 23:58.300
Oh, God.

23:58.300 --> 23:59.300
Yeah.

23:59.300 --> 24:07.300
John is just like, this whisper is taking a long time.

24:07.300 --> 24:11.300
What'd he tell you, Clark?

24:11.300 --> 24:14.300
Come over here and whisper it in my ear.

24:14.300 --> 24:18.300
Hey, John, when you put on the watch, what did you see?

24:18.300 --> 24:24.300
Well, I saw confirmation that I'm a child of destiny.

24:24.300 --> 24:30.300
I suspect perhaps you two are as well, but I know for a fact that I am.

24:30.300 --> 24:32.300
What does that mean?

24:32.300 --> 24:34.300
That might be a little complicated.

24:34.300 --> 24:38.300
Why don't you tell me why all of a sudden you want to disarm me?

24:38.300 --> 24:39.300
Hang on, though.

24:39.300 --> 24:45.300
If all you saw was being a child of destiny, when you popped out of there, you said adopted the vector.

24:45.300 --> 24:46.300
You kept repeating it.

24:46.300 --> 24:47.300
What did that mean?

24:47.300 --> 24:53.300
Well, as it happens, I am the vector.

24:53.300 --> 24:54.300
You adopted yourself?

24:54.300 --> 24:56.300
Technically, he did adopt himself.

24:56.300 --> 24:59.300
Yeah, technically, I guess I did adopt myself.

24:59.300 --> 25:03.300
This body that you see before you, the body of Kevin Lee Pettymore.

25:03.300 --> 25:05.300
John is not taking his hand off his gun.

25:05.300 --> 25:10.300
The body of Kevin Lee Pettymore, the soul and mind of Kevin Lee Pettymore.

25:10.300 --> 25:15.300
See, he was sent to, I guess, kill all the gangs.

25:15.300 --> 25:20.300
Don't rightly know why, but they had adopted a little baby.

25:20.300 --> 25:21.300
That's me.

25:21.300 --> 25:23.300
I was going to be a cane, fellas.

25:23.300 --> 25:29.300
But then my daddy burned down their house and little Adam crawled out of it.

25:29.300 --> 25:32.300
He thought he'd killed all them canes, but I guess Adam got out.

25:32.300 --> 25:36.300
Might be why he's so ornery.

25:36.300 --> 25:48.300
Anyway, I saw me, him, taking baby me, I, with him in a little, you know, with adoption papers.

25:48.300 --> 25:53.300
And I also saw a little vision of him and my mama trying real hard to have a baby, and they couldn't.

25:53.300 --> 25:55.300
So it was on his mind.

25:55.300 --> 26:02.300
And it seems like, you know, you kind of, well, you see a baby on the table, you just take it, you know how it is sometimes.

26:02.300 --> 26:03.300
The Pettymore way.

26:03.300 --> 26:04.300
Free baby.

26:04.300 --> 26:09.300
But yeah, what he said over the radio, remember, he was a part of K-Cell.

26:09.300 --> 26:16.300
What he was telling somebody is that he had eliminated the vector adopted by the canes.

26:16.300 --> 26:19.300
But he didn't. I'm the vector.

26:19.300 --> 26:21.300
And he took me in.

26:21.300 --> 26:25.300
And maybe you boys is from similar circumstances.

26:25.300 --> 26:28.300
Anyway, that's my story, Ergo, child of destiny.

26:28.300 --> 26:30.300
Well, Keith saw you kill us.

26:30.300 --> 26:31.300
Yeah.

26:31.300 --> 26:33.300
Did you deserve it?

26:33.300 --> 26:36.300
I don't rightly believe so.

26:36.300 --> 26:39.300
You killed us at the pond, and you took the watch.

26:39.300 --> 26:43.300
Are you wanting the watch real bad right now, John?

26:43.300 --> 26:50.300
Now that you say that, I got to suspect I had a good reason.

26:50.300 --> 26:53.300
Keith, why don't you try taking that watch off?

26:53.300 --> 26:54.300
Why is it stuck to you?

26:54.300 --> 26:56.300
I think I'm going to keep it on.

26:57.300 --> 27:05.300
You know, like I said, my dad told Ferguson, when the time comes, it'll fit, you know?

27:05.300 --> 27:07.300
Yeah, but he said that about himself.

27:07.300 --> 27:15.300
Well, he said it about, well, my dad thought he was going to be the one, the savior, the chosen one, whatever.

27:15.300 --> 27:19.300
And he realized it wasn't him, and he thought it was going to be Ferguson.

27:19.300 --> 27:23.300
But, you know, he's gone, so I've got it.

27:23.300 --> 27:30.300
And he said when the time comes, it'll fit, and it's not falling off me.

27:30.300 --> 27:37.300
And if there's any time for it to be the time of and for a savior, I'd say just right about now is the time.

27:37.300 --> 27:42.300
But you're, listen, I've been ball. I am the vector.

27:42.300 --> 27:45.300
If anybody's going to be a savior around here, it seems like it would probably be me.

27:45.300 --> 27:52.300
Well, I mean, I don't know much about this prophecy other than what I overheard my dad telling Ferguson.

27:52.300 --> 27:55.300
Damn, watch.

27:55.300 --> 28:00.300
And I step back away from him a little bit, and I'm very scared.

28:00.300 --> 28:11.300
I get in the middle. Hey, wait, hey, if anybody's saving anybody, it's going to be the overseer, which we're under the assumption I am.

28:11.300 --> 28:15.300
Oh, la-di-da, Mr. Overseer. Could you oversee ball?

28:15.300 --> 28:21.300
Nothing could oversee ball. It couldn't be contained. It burst gloriously from the roof that tries to constrain it.

28:21.300 --> 28:27.300
Guys, hear me out. What if it's all three of us needing to come together?

28:27.300 --> 28:30.300
Now is hardly the time. Sex magic.

28:30.300 --> 28:36.300
No, no, no. None of us can do it. I surely can't do anything by myself.

28:36.300 --> 28:43.300
I've always needed your guys' help, and maybe we're each a piece of a puzzle.

28:43.300 --> 28:47.300
Well, now, here's an interesting point. You might be onto something there.

28:48.300 --> 28:57.300
He said, the vector adopted by the canes. Now, perhaps grammatically ambiguous, but to me, it implies other vectors.

28:57.300 --> 28:59.300
And Gary...

28:59.300 --> 29:02.300
Yeah, Gary did that, you know, little witchcraft.

29:02.300 --> 29:08.300
He has that spell that was perfect for three of us. If it was any one of us, it was important.

29:08.300 --> 29:10.300
Gary, which one of us is the savior?

29:10.300 --> 29:12.300
It's probably me.

29:13.300 --> 29:17.300
I'm just saying, my seafood fur will change the world.

29:17.300 --> 29:19.300
It is pretty damn good, Gary.

29:19.300 --> 29:22.300
Ah, yeah. Alright, we gotta give that to you, Gary.

29:24.300 --> 29:30.300
Guys, I've been wanting to get to the pond, but I'm not so sure now.

29:30.300 --> 29:34.300
You know, every time we try to go somewhere, we really want to go.

29:34.300 --> 29:41.300
The mill. The pond. Some unseen forces trying to scare us away from that.

29:41.300 --> 29:46.300
You know, maybe this watch is just showing us bullshit. Maybe we should just go to the pond.

29:46.300 --> 29:48.300
Clark starts nodding emphatically.

29:48.300 --> 29:53.300
Yeah, what if it's showing us bullshit? How do we know any of it's anything to put any stock in?

29:53.300 --> 29:55.300
I mean, yeah, it could easily...

29:55.300 --> 30:00.300
Well, except for the part where I'm a child of destiny. I felt that in my bones to be true.

30:01.300 --> 30:03.300
That's why I think you should give me that watch.

30:03.300 --> 30:08.300
I think maybe we ought to go down into the pond, but maybe I'll keep wearing it and maybe you don't...

30:08.300 --> 30:11.300
Maybe you're in front instead of behind us.

30:11.300 --> 30:13.300
Is that where I was when the vision was behind you?

30:13.300 --> 30:16.300
Yeah, you were a little bit behind us shooting us in the back.

30:16.300 --> 30:18.300
That would have been the way to do it.

30:24.300 --> 30:29.300
Well, Keith, if it'll make you feel better, here.

30:30.300 --> 30:33.300
And I draw my gun and I kick it across to him.

30:33.300 --> 30:37.300
I pick it up and tuck it into my belt, my waistband.

30:37.300 --> 30:42.300
I actually hate this. Could I get that back? Could I feel very naked? Could I have that back?

30:42.300 --> 30:49.300
I'm just going to keep a hold of it. Clark can hold it if you want, but I just...

30:49.300 --> 30:51.300
Give it to Clark.

30:51.300 --> 30:53.300
I hand the gun to Clark.

30:53.300 --> 30:55.300
Hey Clark, can I have that gun back?

30:55.300 --> 30:57.300
Clark, don't do it.

30:57.300 --> 31:01.300
I'm going to hold on to it just as long as we get past the point in his vision.

31:01.300 --> 31:04.300
Once we get past the moment in time, things change.

31:04.300 --> 31:10.300
Yeah, we'll give it back to you. Once we get to the pond, nobody's behind anybody, we'll give it back to you.

31:10.300 --> 31:12.300
As long as you don't shoot us, that is.

31:12.300 --> 31:14.300
Gary, do you have any extra guns?

31:14.300 --> 31:16.300
Well, it's a contention, ain't it?

31:17.300 --> 31:19.300
Okay, could you get me one?

31:19.300 --> 31:21.300
Yeah, you know, he's just...

31:21.300 --> 31:26.300
Then Harry walks over to his tent and kind of unzips a flat and opens it up.

31:26.300 --> 31:28.300
There's a few different choice weapons.

31:28.300 --> 31:33.300
I take a little concealed carry pistol, boom, and slip it into my back pocket.

31:33.300 --> 31:40.300
Yeah, that one's real nice for keeping it at the bar, you know, people get unruly, they don't even know, they don't see it coming.

31:40.300 --> 31:43.300
You kill people at the bar when they get unruly?

31:45.300 --> 31:51.300
Oh, that's actually a pellet gun. Let me hand you the one that looks the exact same, that's actually a real gun. Here you go.

31:51.300 --> 31:52.300
Thank you.

31:52.300 --> 31:56.300
When I see this happen, I'm like, I mean, well, you're definitely walking in front then.

31:56.300 --> 32:01.300
I shoot a glance over to Keith. I mean, was he holding that gun and not his gun in your vision?

32:01.300 --> 32:05.300
Oh, that's a fantastic question. Let me think real hard, real quick.

32:08.300 --> 32:09.300
Zach?

32:09.300 --> 32:11.300
Yeah, man, it was his standard issue.

32:11.300 --> 32:17.300
No, it was the gun that you have that he gave to us, so it makes me feel a little bit better.

32:17.300 --> 32:19.300
I think things are changing then, maybe.

32:19.300 --> 32:22.300
You know, the watch is still on, I'm not seeing anything, so.

32:22.300 --> 32:28.300
Keith, here's another question. Did you see yourself die or did I just shoot you two?

32:28.300 --> 32:31.300
Oh, I would say, you know.

32:31.300 --> 32:32.300
Maybe you just needed a winging.

32:32.300 --> 32:36.300
I think a total of six shots does the trick, you know.

32:36.300 --> 32:38.300
Apparently you shot us after we were down.

32:38.300 --> 32:43.300
Yeah, you shot both of us and then you shot us more.

32:43.300 --> 32:47.300
Well, that would do the trick, yeah, probably.

32:47.300 --> 32:50.300
How about you just don't shoot us?

32:50.300 --> 32:52.300
We'll have you walk in front, just in case.

32:52.300 --> 32:55.300
We've kind of moved past this real fast, but I just wanted to ask,

32:55.300 --> 32:59.300
Keith, do you have any idea where that watch came from, like how it got to your dad?

32:59.300 --> 33:06.300
No, I mean, the first time I saw it was that day when me and Fergie were just playing outside

33:06.300 --> 33:13.300
and all of a sudden those creatures popped up in our yard and I don't really know what happened to them,

33:14.300 --> 33:17.300
but the first time I saw that watch my dad was giving it to Ferguson.

33:17.300 --> 33:23.300
Did you or we look at, like, inspect it? It's not engraved or anything, is it?

33:23.300 --> 33:25.300
It's just a normal watch looking, right?

33:25.300 --> 33:31.300
I mean, yeah, it's just a gold watch. It's real nice, but, you know, it's a pretty normal watch

33:31.300 --> 33:34.300
other than it gives you visions and only fits me.

33:34.300 --> 33:40.300
It might be waterproof, but we'd have to get to the pond to find out. Wink, wink.

33:40.300 --> 33:43.300
I think that's our next course of action, isn't it?

33:43.300 --> 33:47.300
Yeah, I mean, I think we can leave Carrie here with these guys.

33:47.300 --> 33:50.300
I think, you know, she shouldn't be too much of an issue with Tyler.

33:50.300 --> 33:57.300
Real quick, what if you gave me my gun back? I just like my gun. I named him Seth.

33:57.300 --> 34:01.300
Yeah, in my vision you were shooting us with Seth.

34:01.300 --> 34:07.300
Hear the rest. Hear it out. Hear it out. Hear it out. I'll just stay here.

34:07.300 --> 34:10.300
I won't come to the pond. I'll guard Carrie Pages.

34:10.300 --> 34:17.300
Thomas, I'm not kidding. I have it written in my notes that the Canes named you Seth.

34:17.300 --> 34:21.300
Oh, my God.

34:21.300 --> 34:23.300
That's really weird.

34:23.300 --> 34:24.300
That's super weird.

34:24.300 --> 34:26.300
That's fucking wild.

34:26.300 --> 34:27.300
Holy shit.

34:27.300 --> 34:29.300
Maybe the gun is actually a kid.

34:29.300 --> 34:32.300
What if it's the vector?

34:32.300 --> 34:45.300
I mean, do you really? I mean, it's not that I trust you more than this watch, really, but, you know, I'd like you to come along with us.

34:45.300 --> 34:48.300
Good things don't typically happen when we split up.

34:48.300 --> 34:51.300
What if I trade you this new gun for Seth?

34:51.300 --> 34:52.300
Are you going to kill us?

34:52.300 --> 34:56.300
The tent on the far side of the room kind of bursts open, or it tries to.

34:57.300 --> 35:01.300
Someone's trying to get out, but they didn't unzip the tent flap first.

35:01.300 --> 35:05.300
And Mildred Mitchell is like, oh, my goodness.

35:05.300 --> 35:10.300
And then finally the zipper comes loose, and she busts out of there, and she looked haggard.

35:10.300 --> 35:13.300
She looks terrible. She's normally all done up all night.

35:13.300 --> 35:19.300
She still has one rainbow earring on, but the other one's missing, and her hair's all over the place.

35:19.300 --> 35:25.300
And she's holding this piece of paper in one hand that she immediately, like, oh, no, and puts it in her back pocket.

35:25.300 --> 35:30.300
And then she's holding a picture in her other hand, and she's like, this, this, this, this is the one.

35:30.300 --> 35:34.300
I mean, you, you, you all are the reason that she's gone.

35:34.300 --> 35:39.300
But I, just now, standing in this tent, it changed. It changed.

35:39.300 --> 35:43.300
It was him, and then it, and then it was him.

35:43.300 --> 35:46.300
And she points at John. She says, it was him.

35:46.300 --> 35:50.300
And then she points at Keith, and she says, it was him.

35:50.300 --> 35:56.300
And she shoves this picture in your face, and it is a picture of the founders of contention.

35:56.300 --> 36:05.300
And there you see Silas Cole, but it is not the face of the Silas Cole that you remember seeing growing up, who is very handsome.

36:05.300 --> 36:10.300
A very good-looking, maybe a ridiculously handsome man.

36:10.300 --> 36:14.300
But now, that face is the face of Keith Vigna.

36:14.300 --> 36:17.300
What the, what the fuck?

36:17.300 --> 36:20.300
You didn't roll sanity for me?

36:20.300 --> 36:22.300
I swear, it was, it, it was him?

36:22.300 --> 36:24.300
And she points at John Lee Pettymore the third.

36:24.300 --> 36:30.300
It was his face right here, where Silas Cole is. It was his face. And then it changed. The picture changed.

36:30.300 --> 36:33.300
There was a very handsome face, and then there was Keith's face.

36:33.300 --> 36:37.300
No, there was a handsome face, it was back in the day, a long time, a few weeks ago.

36:37.300 --> 36:44.300
And then, and then, I mean, even up until a few days ago, and, and then it became Keith, yes, Keith's face.

36:44.300 --> 36:49.300
Oh my God, that's who, I knew he looked familiar. Hey, oh my God.

36:49.300 --> 36:52.300
And she just kind of like stumbles away.

36:52.300 --> 37:00.300
I just don't, I just don't, does anyone have any pot?

37:00.300 --> 37:04.300
Oh yeah, I help her out.

37:04.300 --> 37:08.300
I pass her, I pass her my one hitter in.

37:08.300 --> 37:12.300
That Kevin always has in his tactical gear.

37:12.300 --> 37:16.300
Sean just probably had some stashed around town.

37:16.300 --> 37:20.300
He's like, oh, I know this part of the underground. How'd you guys do on your sanity checks?

37:20.300 --> 37:21.300
I got a three.

37:21.300 --> 37:22.300
Oh my God.

37:22.300 --> 37:23.300
I got a two.

37:23.300 --> 37:24.300
Jesus.

37:24.300 --> 37:25.300
I failed, but under my power.

37:25.300 --> 37:32.300
Okay, so Clark, you're going to lose one sanity as you start to realize, Thomas and Luke, take your headphones off.

37:32.300 --> 37:40.300
Clark realizes in this moment, whoever had the watch on, becomes Silas Cole.

37:40.300 --> 37:46.300
I don't know if that's obvious, just listening to how everything's gone down, but in this moment, you know it to be true.

37:46.300 --> 37:50.300
Okay.

37:50.300 --> 37:56.300
Keith Vigna, Mildred Mitchell hands you the picture that has you in it.

37:56.300 --> 38:01.300
And she goes, look, look, see, and she points to this reflection, it's like a window.

38:01.300 --> 38:12.300
There's a vague, faint reflection, and in it, you think you can make out the general outline, vague aura of Tildi B. Mitchell.

38:12.300 --> 38:15.300
And she's there, and it's your fault.

38:15.300 --> 38:16.300
And she points at Clark Bishop.

38:16.300 --> 38:19.300
Hey, I didn't shoot the gun. She did.

38:19.300 --> 38:20.300
What gun?

38:20.300 --> 38:25.300
I mean, she was gone is what I mean. She wasn't in her room.

38:25.300 --> 38:28.300
I mean, we could tell her about the gun that sends people to the past, right?

38:28.300 --> 38:39.300
Well, we weren't quite sure what it did, but now that we see this picture of Tildi here, after she shot that gun and disappeared, seems like it sends people to the past, so...

38:39.300 --> 38:40.300
That checks out.

38:40.300 --> 38:50.300
I got a good idea. What if, how about we give Jon his gun back, but we bring Mildred with us, that way the vision can't be true.

38:50.300 --> 38:54.300
I'm not going anywhere with you. You all are the reason that she's gone.

38:54.300 --> 38:55.300
What if I gave you this gun?

38:56.300 --> 39:00.300
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, okay, fine. I'll go, yeah, sure.

39:00.300 --> 39:02.300
Okay, but first, Keith, you give me my gun back.

39:02.300 --> 39:03.300
Clark's got it.

39:03.300 --> 39:04.300
Give me Seth.

39:04.300 --> 39:05.300
Clark.

39:05.300 --> 39:08.300
Clark is real hesitant about it.

39:08.300 --> 39:10.300
Put Seth back in his holster.

39:10.300 --> 39:14.300
Why are we trying to make more things like Keith's vision instead of less things?

39:14.300 --> 39:15.300
Well, Mildred is the less thing.

39:15.300 --> 39:16.300
We're bringing Mildred with us.

39:16.300 --> 39:19.300
I just feel very uncomfortable. I would just feel a lot better.

39:19.300 --> 39:29.300
While he's trying to get the gun from Clark, I want to, I'm looking at the picture, and I want to take the watch off and see if my face is still on Silas Cole's face.

39:29.300 --> 39:30.300
Hey, Luke.

39:30.300 --> 39:31.300
Yeah?

39:31.300 --> 39:33.300
You can't get that watch off your wrist.

39:33.300 --> 39:34.300
Oh.

39:36.300 --> 39:38.300
Go ahead and roll sanity. Just you.

39:38.300 --> 39:41.300
Oh, that's a fail. Let's see if it's over my power.

39:42.300 --> 39:43.300
Yep.

39:43.300 --> 39:52.300
Go ahead and lose one sanity as you can't get the watch off your wrist.

39:52.300 --> 40:04.300
So while he's trying to get the gun back, I'm trying to, like, unclasp the watch, and it won't unclasp, and then I'm trying to, like, move it around on my arm, but it's, like, staying in just, like, one position.

40:04.300 --> 40:15.300
And I start freaking out, and I look at the picture, and I look at Mildred, and I just fly at her and tackle her to the ground and trying to start just beating the shit out of her.

40:15.300 --> 40:17.300
Do you actually fly?

40:17.300 --> 40:20.300
No. I leap at her.

40:23.300 --> 40:27.300
Most Delta Green games don't need that disclaimer.

40:28.300 --> 40:34.300
I yell, oh, fuck, and throw Jon his gun, and I try to tackle Keith off of Mildred.

40:34.300 --> 40:42.300
Okay, let's all roll. Clark, Keith, and Mildred will all roll an armed combat to see how this shakes out.

40:44.300 --> 40:49.300
Jon's just got two guns in his hands now, and he's staring wide-eyed. He doesn't really know what to do.

40:49.300 --> 40:52.300
Oh, I forgot you were already holding one. Yeah.

40:53.300 --> 40:56.300
I was going to give it to Mitchell. She could have shot Keith.

40:59.300 --> 41:04.300
I failed. I rolled over. I got an 85 on a 70.

41:04.300 --> 41:07.300
Nice. Oh, my goodness gracious.

41:07.300 --> 41:08.300
Oh, no.

41:08.300 --> 41:14.300
Luke just showed us with his webcam. He rolled an 0-1, and I failed with a 43. Mildred Mitchell's not a fighter.

41:14.300 --> 41:21.300
I look up from the picture, lock eyes with her, and tackle her to the ground and just start punching her in the face.

41:21.300 --> 41:24.300
I soar over the top of him as I tried to tackle him off of her.

41:28.300 --> 41:31.300
Jon's going to try to separate them.

41:31.300 --> 41:35.300
You separate them, and Mildred lays unconscious on the ground.

41:36.300 --> 41:43.300
I look over at Mildred and look at Jon and then look down at my hands, and I just throw up.

41:43.300 --> 41:49.300
And you throw up directly onto this piece of paper that was in the back pocket of Mildred Mitchell.

41:49.300 --> 41:54.300
It fell out, and it's on the ground next to her, and you kind of puke on the corner of it.

41:54.300 --> 41:59.300
And it is just a piece of paper that she has written on it, and it says,

42:02.300 --> 42:10.300
I'm just shaking, and I'm just looking at the piece of paper, and I lay down on my side, and I'm just trying to catch my breath.

42:10.300 --> 42:16.300
Clara Blankenship has hidden behind one of the pillars, as has Casey Kristoff.

42:16.300 --> 42:22.300
However, Gary and Harry are both standing at their tense edge, guns drawn.

42:22.300 --> 42:30.300
Harry has a pistol, and Gary has a semi-automatic rifle, and they are slowly walking toward Keith Vigna,

42:30.300 --> 42:33.300
who's on the ground, and they have their weapons pointed.

42:33.300 --> 42:38.300
And Gary's like, you stay right there! You stay on the ground! What the fuck?

42:38.300 --> 42:43.300
And Harry's like, I've always stuck up for you. I've always stuck up for you, Keith Vigna.

42:43.300 --> 42:46.300
You come in here, and you take out Mildred Mitchell like that.

42:46.300 --> 42:49.300
I get between them and Keith. They point their weapons at you.

42:49.300 --> 42:53.300
I couldn't help it. I didn't mean to do it. It just, what the hell is going on?

42:53.300 --> 43:02.300
Hold on. Hold on, everybody. Calm down now. Should Keith have done that? No. Obviously, Keith.

43:02.300 --> 43:04.300
I turn around, and I give you a glare.

43:04.300 --> 43:06.300
Weapons down. Weapons down. Everyone. Everyone.

43:06.300 --> 43:11.300
They're down. They're down. I put Seth in his holster, and I pocket the other gun.

43:11.300 --> 43:17.300
I had a dream that if the temperature gets too high, we all die here. Okay?

43:17.300 --> 43:21.300
That was my dream. Claire's over there talking about dreams like,

43:21.300 --> 43:27.300
my dream was if the temperature got too high, that we were all gonna die down here.

43:27.300 --> 43:33.300
Yet, the dream seemed to be like, maybe metaphorical in places. You ever think about that?

43:33.300 --> 43:34.300
About your dreams? No, no.

43:34.300 --> 43:37.300
I mean, everybody's dream is different, so what the fuck?

43:37.300 --> 43:40.300
Now you're questioning about temperature. Okay, okay. We just gotta all calm down, okay?

43:40.300 --> 43:45.300
I'm just trying to understand your meaning. You'd all die if tempers got heated down here,

43:45.300 --> 43:49.300
or if the temperature itself got too high. Jesus fucking Christ, John.

43:49.300 --> 43:52.300
Yeah, I was saying if our tempers got too high, we were all gonna die.

43:52.300 --> 43:59.300
You, Clark, Keith, me, Gary, Mildred, Clara, Casey, all of us.

43:59.300 --> 44:06.300
While they're talking, I am slowly, like, scooting towards a tunnel.

44:06.300 --> 44:10.300
I mean, you can slowly back away. You're far ways away from one of the tunnels.

44:10.300 --> 44:13.300
This is a pretty big room. Yeah, I'm doing that still, though.

44:13.300 --> 44:17.300
And I'm looking at everybody. Clark is gonna start getting back to his feet.

44:17.300 --> 44:24.300
Harry, I'm sorry. I understand that was alarming. We've all become touchy in the last few days.

44:24.300 --> 44:29.300
Things set us off, and it's not good, I understand, but look at him now. Look at him now.

44:29.300 --> 44:32.300
He's scared. He doesn't even know what just happened. I guarantee it.

44:32.300 --> 44:34.300
He's just worming his little way away.

44:34.300 --> 44:39.300
Y'all need to get the fuck out of here. We protected you for long enough. You need to get going.

44:39.300 --> 44:41.300
If you're gonna go to the pond, go to the fucking pond.

44:41.300 --> 44:46.300
Well, now, hold on. Everyone's sitting around here having visions.

44:46.300 --> 44:48.300
Go to the fucking pond.

44:48.300 --> 44:50.300
Listen, magic man, we've got some fucking questions.

44:50.300 --> 44:52.300
I get up and take off towards the tunnel.

44:52.300 --> 44:53.300
John, I think we should go.

44:53.300 --> 44:55.300
Harry, is this how you feel?

44:55.300 --> 44:56.300
I don't like it.

44:56.300 --> 44:58.300
Oh, sorry. Gary, is this how you feel?

44:58.300 --> 45:01.300
I don't like it either, but y'all need to...

45:01.300 --> 45:04.300
I trust his dream, and I don't want to die today.

45:04.300 --> 45:07.300
And I believe all of you. I believe you've been through some shit.

45:07.300 --> 45:10.300
It's putting you on edge. It's making you do all sorts of weird things.

45:10.300 --> 45:13.300
We've all seen a lot of messed up shit in the past few days.

45:13.300 --> 45:18.300
Maybe even our whole lives, but it's just coming to fruition now for some reason.

45:18.300 --> 45:24.300
But I swear, what Keith just did to Mildred is not okay, and I know he's gone now.

45:24.300 --> 45:27.300
I know he's gone. Okay? He went down that tunnel.

45:27.300 --> 45:30.300
Y'all are gonna go have to find him if you want to find him, okay?

45:30.300 --> 45:33.300
He's heading south. That's the way you were heading anyway.

45:33.300 --> 45:35.300
So y'all just need to go on and get.

45:35.300 --> 45:36.300
Alright, Gary.

45:36.300 --> 45:39.300
I'm sorry. I didn't want it to go this way.

45:39.300 --> 45:42.300
I'm sorry too, Gary. You're right, that shouldn't have happened.

45:42.300 --> 45:45.300
Will you keep an eye on Drew there?

45:45.300 --> 45:48.300
I need you to maybe keep him here. Don't let him get anywhere.

45:48.300 --> 45:50.300
Yeah, well keep an eye on Drew.

45:50.300 --> 45:52.300
Again, that's not Drew. That's Kerry Pages.

45:52.300 --> 45:55.300
Drew Kerry. That's a funny little thing we say.

45:55.300 --> 45:58.300
Make sure you don't feed him anything with too much sugar,

45:58.300 --> 46:03.300
and make sure you give Tyler a treat before bed every night.

46:03.300 --> 46:07.300
Sorry about all this. Mildred, we are going to, at some point,

46:07.300 --> 46:11.300
time cop our way into finding your daughter, I'm sure of it.

46:11.300 --> 46:13.300
She doesn't respond because she's unconscious,

46:13.300 --> 46:16.300
because Keith just beat the shit out of her and she's an old woman.

46:16.300 --> 46:18.300
I say it again louder.

46:22.300 --> 46:25.300
Wake up, lazy bones.

46:25.300 --> 46:27.300
Oh, God.

46:29.300 --> 46:33.300
Now y'all come back to Daily Pho as soon as you fix this,

46:33.300 --> 46:37.300
because I trust that you will, and here come Monday,

46:37.300 --> 46:40.300
you come get a steaming hot bowl of seafood pho.

46:40.300 --> 46:42.300
That'll be nice.

46:42.300 --> 46:46.300
Alright, yeah. We'll do that.

46:46.300 --> 46:48.300
I start going toward a tunnel.

46:48.300 --> 46:50.300
Same.

46:52.300 --> 46:57.300
