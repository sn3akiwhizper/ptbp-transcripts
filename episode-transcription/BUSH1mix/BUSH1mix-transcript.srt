1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,240
Well, where the shit am I now?

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,940
And when the hell are I?

3
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:10,600
Let me check my map I got from that interdimensional gas station.

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,320
Southwest Arkansas.

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,980
There ain't possibly a place named like that.

6
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:22,420
I guess I better put on a good show no matter where or when I am.

7
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:23,380
Fuck.

8
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:27,780
I'm coming at you live from wherever I said earlier.

9
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:31,500
From 694.2 PTBP.

10
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,820
The only radio station that broadcasts from Arkansas.

11
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,420
Probably.

12
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:40,260
This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Nathan.

13
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:44,940
AKA at APOC underscore Golem on Twitter.

14
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,700
From Aberdeen, South Dakota.

15
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,600
Who tweeted about the show and tagged at Pretending Pod.

16
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,140
Which is a praiseworthy thing to do with your fingers.

17
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,700
Nathan writes.

18
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,460
Dearest Edward.

19
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:00,260
I will see you soon.

20
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,580
I tried to stay strong.

21
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:03,780
I promised.

22
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,180
And I failed.

23
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:09,780
I thought I could trap it inside me but now I'm the one trapped.

24
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,580
It is in me now.

25
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,700
It forces me to move against my will.

26
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,420
I scream inside my own head while it makes me do things.

27
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:21,460
Bad things, Ed.

28
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:22,860
I'm so sorry.

29
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,620
It comes for you now.

30
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:29,020
I feel my feet wrench and spasm in a mockery of walking.

31
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:32,980
As it forces my body to lurch in your direction.

32
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:34,580
It is patient.

33
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:35,980
Dearest Edward.

34
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:37,600
I'm so sorry.

35
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,240
I will see you soon.

36
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,740
Well, you heard the guy, Edward.

37
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:44,780
He's coming to see you soon.

38
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:49,100
Sounds like it's gonna be a fun time for you and your BFF.

39
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,400
If you wanna write up something

40
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,140
for your arken-saucy wolf to howl,

41
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:55,300
tag at PretendingPod on Twitter

42
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:58,700
or write a five-star review on Apple Podcasts

43
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,740
or I guess also two more things.

44
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:05,740
Tag at PretendingPod on Instagram, fuck Mark Zuckerberg

45
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:08,100
or tag pretending to be people on Facebook,

46
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:11,300
fuck Mark Zuckerberg.

47
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,280
We love it when people are excited

48
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,540
to tell their friends about our show here

49
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,520
but seriously, fuck Mark Zuckerberg.

50
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:22,420
Maybe Wolfie can give that pasty half alien

51
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:25,900
the physical delights the human part of him craves.

52
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:30,300
He ain't never ever met a wolf like me.

53
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,420
And if that excellent pun gave you the blues,

54
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:37,140
let's see who won in this week's The News.

55
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:40,620
And that winner from Twitter's mostly bitter litter

56
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:44,740
is the Twitter outfitter at tdunder-beck

57
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:49,740
aka Cosplay underscore by underscore Tyler.

58
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,300
He guessed the special guest

59
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,020
who will join Allie, Lindsay, and Taylor

60
00:02:55,020 --> 00:03:00,020
for all five parts of Operation Bigfoot Underground

61
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,620
Search and Hunt.

62
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:06,620
That's right, Operation Bigfoot Underground Search and Hunt

63
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,660
will be played by the crew who you knew

64
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:13,580
when they brought you their story in the Contingent Woods

65
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:18,380
alongside Eleanor DiLorenzo, the delightful creator

66
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:21,380
and GM of the Lost Mountain saga,

67
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:24,780
a dedicated role player on the Glass Cannon Network's

68
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:28,940
Androids and Aliens, the foul-mouthed Twitch streamer

69
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:32,100
who once laughed so hard she could barely breathe

70
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:36,020
after reading the name Mike Oxmaul.

71
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:38,620
Well, better not dwell on that name.

72
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:42,020
My mouth might get jealous of all that nasty trash

73
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:44,060
going in the wrong hole.

74
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:48,700
Let's fill them ears with something that clears the gears.

75
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:51,580
It's Molly Healy with Circles.

76
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,420
["Circles"]

77
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,420
["Circles"]

78
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,700
["Circles"]

79
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,620
I'm glad you were honest with us.

80
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:35,900
Yes.

81
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:36,900
We're cutting this out.

82
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,100
That's requesting my first cut.

83
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:39,940
Oh no, the Thomas Roll.

84
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,420
Oh no, it's staying in.

85
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,940
Fuck, Allie, you said it.

86
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:47,460
Oh no, it was just about to get cut.

87
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:50,260
Welcome to Pretending to Be People.

88
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:54,820
I am here with a whole table of special guests here.

89
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:57,340
We're going to go around the table here.

90
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,300
We're going to start with,

91
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,140
she's played Gerald Fingersen.

92
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:05,820
She played Sharon Shadow Berryman.

93
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,780
She does the sound of phone calls.

94
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:11,500
Ring, ring, ring, ring.

95
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,380
It's my wife, Borat Voice.

96
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,220
Taylor.

97
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,020
Hello, I'm his wife.

98
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,580
Did that work the opposite way?

99
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,340
I don't think so.

100
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,180
Anyway, hi.

101
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:25,100
We have Liz Lonklin, the Doc Martin wearing punk,

102
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:29,620
the designer of the infamous PTBP fanny pack

103
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,340
that I fucking promise will exist one day.

104
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:35,100
It's Lindsay.

105
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,820
Hello, I'm Lindsay.

106
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:38,980
Nailed it.

107
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,980
Just top notch, boom town.

108
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,940
She played Krista Krinklehoff.

109
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,300
It's still hard to say.

110
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,620
She played a bro bot named Brett.

111
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,100
She's my new coworker.

112
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,580
Thanks for getting me the job.

113
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,980
It's Ali.

114
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,220
Hello, I am Ali.

115
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,980
I regret getting him the job.

116
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:01,380
I'm loud and in the, well, I used to be in the office,

117
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,500
but now no one's in the office.

118
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,020
Woo.

119
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:08,100
And finally, she's an actor.

120
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,980
She's a standup comedian.

121
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,660
She's a Twitch streamer.

122
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,820
She's a player on Glass Cannon Network,

123
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,500
Starfinder podcast, Androids and Aliens.

124
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,460
She's the creator and GM of her own show,

125
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,140
The Lost Mountain Saga,

126
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:24,220
which is getting a season two coming soon.

127
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:27,540
It's Eleanor DiLorenzo, Lindsay.

128
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:30,380
Woo.

129
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,060
Thanks for the applause, guys.

130
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:33,740
Thanks.

131
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:36,180
Oh, there it is.

132
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,740
It was a little delay.

133
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,580
I request that the rest of us also get a echo out.

134
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:43,340
I'm so sorry.

135
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:48,340
Honestly, it's doing Eleanor DiLorenzo, it's very good.

136
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:52,460
No, but also Taylor Reeve, she's the worst of the game.

137
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,220
So today we're playing Delta Green.

138
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:02,420
I know that that is new to Eleanor here.

139
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,420
Eleanor, are you excited?

140
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:05,260
I am incredibly excited.

141
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,900
I've been wanting to play this game

142
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,380
ever since I heard about it the first time,

143
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:11,340
which was in, I don't know, doesn't matter,

144
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,940
but I have been wanting to play it

145
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:15,300
for a really, really long time.

146
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:19,340
And I'm so excited that you guys invited me to play

147
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:22,100
because it seems like you guys know what you're doing

148
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,060
or maybe that's just...

149
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,820
Oh, that's funny.

150
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,100
One of us at this table does.

151
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:29,940
It's good.

152
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,420
It's good to have your confidence.

153
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:32,260
It's me.

154
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:33,580
It's me.

155
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:38,740
So a quick rundown of Delta Green.

156
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:39,940
It's a role-playing game.

157
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,060
Okay, moving on.

158
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:41,900
So...

159
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,020
That's all you need to know.

160
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:48,860
Delta Green is a role-playing game about...

161
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:49,700
Oh, no.

162
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:55,500
How are you so good on all those other podcasts?

163
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,980
Listen, I've been drunk for the past five years.

164
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:58,940
I don't even know.

165
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:03,940
I'm doing dry January.

166
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,460
So this is the first time I'm playing Delta Green

167
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:09,180
without a beer in my hand in a long time.

168
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,020
Wow.

169
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:10,860
Congratulations.

170
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,820
It's also till 10 in the morning.

171
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,260
Yup, still would have done it.

172
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,900
Not a doubt in my mind.

173
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,620
It's Saturday.

174
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:18,820
Saturday's for the boys.

175
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,820
Saturday's for the boys.

176
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:23,980
So Delta Green is a role-playing game

177
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:27,420
about losing your mind or dying

178
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,980
in the process of trying to stop

179
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:32,140
the inevitable end of the world.

180
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,060
Oh, really?

181
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:34,740
I thought it was a romantic comedy.

182
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,740
Someone told me it was like a period piece

183
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:39,220
set in the 19th century Britain.

184
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:41,020
Yup, based on menstruation.

185
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,660
19th century Arkansas.

186
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,380
We are playing...

187
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:49,940
This game will be set in Mississippi and Arkansas tonight.

188
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,380
We're gonna kick it off in Mississippi

189
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,740
and then drive on up to Arkansas,

190
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:56,940
which Eleanor, you had to do some research

191
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,580
on...

192
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,820
What do you mean Mississippi?

193
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:00,660
I thought it was...

194
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:01,620
Oh God, I thought it was...

195
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:05,700
Wait, Mississippi the river or Mississippi the...

196
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,340
It's a city, right?

197
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,940
We're just gonna meet...

198
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,900
The characters are gonna meet in Shreveport,

199
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,060
which is in Mississippi,

200
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,780
but then you're gonna drive into Arkansas.

201
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:16,140
You don't need to know anything about Mississippi

202
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:20,420
other than what should she know about Mississippi?

203
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:21,420
How to spell it.

204
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:24,180
M-I-S-S-I-S-S-I-P-P-I.

205
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,060
I've been swimming in the Mississippi.

206
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,300
Wait, you swam in the Mississippi?

207
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,580
Maybe, or I took a piss in it.

208
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:31,860
Actually, that's a Swedish saying.

209
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,460
Take a piss in the Mississippi.

210
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,460
Actually, that's what my mom says all the time.

211
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,860
Like when something is irrelevant,

212
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,220
it's like fart in space,

213
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,100
but we also say it's a piss in Mississippi.

214
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,380
Oh, that's really good.

215
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:46,700
Yeah, P-I-S-S-I-S-S-I-P-P-I.

216
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:49,540
Piss is hippie.

217
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,260
Piss is hippie.

218
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,820
Has anyone ever thought of that?

219
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:53,820
Are we the first?

220
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,100
Oh my God.

221
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:55,940
Google it.

222
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:57,260
Google it before you tweet it.

223
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,420
Google it.

224
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:01,340
Okay, so just gonna give you a rundown.

225
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:03,100
So normally Delta Green is a game

226
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,940
with a lot of really fantastic scenarios

227
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,020
that are written for it

228
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:09,500
and published by Arc Dream Publishing,

229
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,300
which is a publishing company that publishes games

230
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,500
and scenarios for Delta Green.

231
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,180
However, instead of running

232
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:20,340
one of their extremely well-written and edited scenarios,

233
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,140
I'm gonna run you through something I wrote

234
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:24,260
that's just in a Google doc here.

235
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,100
Hell yeah.

236
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,140
All right, well.

237
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:38,740
I don't think Zach's killing children in this.

238
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:39,940
Based on his face.

239
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:42,580
Gonna run a different scenario.

240
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,500
Don't worry about it.

241
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,500
Kill as many children you want and puppies.

242
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,340
Monster.

243
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,100
That's what I was waiting to hear.

244
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:56,940
All right, so let's meet these characters, shall we?

245
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,220
Let's dive in here.

246
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:02,220
Let's go in alphabetical order of first name

247
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,380
of real life human.

248
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,700
Allie.

249
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,540
Hello.

250
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,380
Who is your character?

251
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,260
What's she look like?

252
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,420
What's her deal?

253
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,380
What's she been up to?

254
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,620
Give us the rundown.

255
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,540
I would love to.

256
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,380
Thank you.

257
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,060
I'm gonna pull up my summary of my character.

258
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,060
Thank you.

259
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:18,020
You guys all, I asked this group

260
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,740
to answer some questions that I'd sent

261
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,220
and then to write a little bit of backstory

262
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:24,580
about how they ran into the unnatural.

263
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:29,580
And all four of you did an absolutely stellar job.

264
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,980
Should we do season two together as a group

265
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,460
instead of the normal?

266
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:36,380
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

267
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:37,220
Bye.

268
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,420
Okay, my name is.

269
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:41,860
Joke.

270
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:45,100
Oh no, not again.

271
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,620
Do you remember that?

272
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,900
I remember that it's a joke.

273
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,140
I just don't remember why.

274
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,460
You started it.

275
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,780
This happens to me all the time.

276
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:56,860
I'm just making so many jokes all the time.

277
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:57,940
All right, here we go.

278
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:00,460
My name is Rusty Hooch.

279
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,180
I am a scientist.

280
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:06,580
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

281
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:07,980
I am a scientist.

282
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:11,220
I didn't choose my name.

283
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,340
My parents did.

284
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,260
They chose your last name?

285
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,100
Yeah, totally.

286
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:14,940
So you're Dr. Hooch?

287
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:15,780
I'm Dr. Hooch.

288
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:16,620
Rad.

289
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,460
Yeah.

290
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,300
The Hooch.

291
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,980
They call me Rusty.

292
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,900
What kind of science do you do?

293
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,700
Mostly like potions and stuff.

294
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,900
Ha ha ha ha ha.

295
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:29,180
Well, I did just win a Nobel Prize

296
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,660
for curing mad cow disease.

297
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:31,620
Congratulations.

298
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,820
Did you do it with potions?

299
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,300
I did it with potions.

300
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:39,180
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

301
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:41,460
I'm hoping to cure tinnitus next.

302
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,300
Okay, yes.

303
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:45,700
And also the emotion sadness

304
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,740
because I think it's unnecessary.

305
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,700
Unnecessary emotion sadness.

306
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,220
Unnecessary negative emotion,

307
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:54,260
which I will be curing with potions.

308
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,180
I love this so much.

309
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,900
How old is she?

310
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:57,980
47.

311
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,380
47 going on 53.

312
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,220
Going on 53.

313
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:05,060
A Nobel Prize winner at 47

314
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,740
we're amongst a genius.

315
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:08,340
In the presence of greatness.

316
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:11,820
I'm also very hot.

317
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:12,660
Yeah.

318
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,500
Okay.

319
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,340
I love you so much.

320
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,180
Just let that be known.

321
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,500
What's your charisma score?

322
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,340
Nine.

323
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:21,660
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

324
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,220
That's like the lowest charisma

325
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,580
you can have to start.

326
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:26,620
Good.

327
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,620
Because you said that

328
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,780
your character leans into like.

329
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,180
Yeah, I'm kind of mean.

330
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:34,140
People see me as kind of

331
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,660
an obsessive relentless bitch,

332
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:36,620
but I would never have been able

333
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:37,900
to cure mad cow disease

334
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,700
if I wasn't a relentless bitch.

335
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,020
What's your haircut?

336
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,460
Short, blonde.

337
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,300
Bangs.

338
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,580
Bangs.

339
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:46,700
I don't know where I got that.

340
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,620
Also, I'm hot.

341
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:48,940
Don't forget.

342
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:51,220
And what are you typically wearing?

343
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:53,660
Normally black trench coat.

344
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:57,020
Probably some pearl earrings.

345
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:59,140
Whatever your hot people wear

346
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,260
is what I'm normally wearing.

347
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,100
My God.

348
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,460
I'm sensing a lot of Robin

349
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,500
Robin Wright from House of Cards.

350
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,100
Like that sort of vibe.

351
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,620
Yes.

352
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:08,500
Yeah.

353
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,980
But hotter.

354
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:10,820
But hotter.

355
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:11,660
Oh wow.

356
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,820
But hotter and Nobel Prize winner.

357
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:14,660
I love it.

358
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:15,500
Exactly.

359
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,380
Humble.

360
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,220
And humble.

361
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:21,900
All right.

362
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:22,740
Give me a rundown.

363
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:23,980
What was your experience like

364
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,940
the first time you saw something unnatural?

365
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,460
Let me tell you about it.

366
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:30,420
So I was flying my DA40 home.

367
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,460
I have a DA40.

368
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:32,300
A small plane.

369
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,140
Of course.

370
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:33,980
The DA40.

371
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:34,820
Yeah, I know.

372
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:35,660
I looked it up.

373
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:36,500
Yeah, so I own one

374
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,700
and I know a lot about it

375
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,740
and I know how to fly it.

376
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,860
So I was flying it home

377
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,940
to my secret cabin in the woods

378
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,500
that none of my children or ex-wives know about

379
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,100
because I like my privacy.

380
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:49,940
Smart.

381
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:53,100
So one night I was flying my Diamond DA40 home

382
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:57,940
and I saw a gigantic explosion come from the woods

383
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,020
but I didn't hear it.

384
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:01,140
It was completely silent.

385
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:04,860
It was blue and wet looking.

386
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:05,700
Ew.

387
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,700
Thank you for that.

388
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,660
Silent and wet and blue.

389
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,900
Silent and wet.

390
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:15,180
So I landed my plane nearby,

391
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:19,700
ran down the road to where I thought I was close to it,

392
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:22,860
hiding because I was afraid of who might be back there.

393
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:26,460
And then five minutes later I saw six black escalates

394
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,940
drive past on the road.

395
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,220
I was hiding in a bush.

396
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,380
Also my plane was covered by a...

397
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,660
No need to get too deep into the weeds.

398
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:34,620
My plane was hidden.

399
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,420
Into the weeds that are covering your plane.

400
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,540
And they couldn't see it.

401
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,500
Anyway, then I ran to the side of the explosion

402
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,620
and there was nothing.

403
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:42,540
I couldn't see anything.

404
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:43,860
Nothing was different.

405
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,100
Not a leaf turned.

406
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,340
Not a branch broken.

407
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:48,860
Not a stone unturned.

408
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,900
Not a stone turned.

409
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:54,340
Ever since then, whenever I'm flying my Diamond DA40 home,

410
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,420
that I know how to fly.

411
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,260
Brag.

412
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,340
A brag about a fictional character.

413
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,700
So I've just been seeing a lot of these silent explosions

414
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:05,020
but I can't seem to get close enough to see what's going on.

415
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,420
How many X's do you have?

416
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:08,700
Hard to say.

417
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,580
Science is easy.

418
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:10,540
Counting is hard.

419
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,740
Three, at least three.

420
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:14,300
Well, some marriages were like, you know,

421
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,860
Vegas marriages.

422
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:17,700
Do those count?

423
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,860
Like that's kind of a half marriage.

424
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,100
Legally, they do, yeah.

425
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:23,580
So your most recent one is...

426
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:24,420
Oh, Jillian.

427
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,780
Yes, Jillian.

428
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:30,300
Jillian didn't sign a prenup before we got married.

429
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,580
That's my bad.

430
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:32,420
Smart lady.

431
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,540
You would think I would have learned my lesson.

432
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:36,380
So she's receiving quite a bit of alimony from me right now,

433
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,660
unfortunately.

434
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:40,140
But I'm rich, so it's fine.

435
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:43,260
Rich and hot, rich and hot, humble and fucking smart.

436
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,860
Genius.

437
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:46,340
Ally, when you play a role playing game,

438
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:49,020
you're supposed to create a character

439
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:51,100
that is different than yourself

440
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,860
to try to embody someone else.

441
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:56,260
Yeah, because I actually am a pilot in real life.

442
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,100
Really?

443
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:57,940
And I have a diamond DA40.

444
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,340
I thought you were gonna say pile of garbage.

445
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:01,180
I don't know why.

446
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,980
I'm a pile of garbage.

447
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,380
Yes, Eleanor, I am a pilot.

448
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,100
No, stop lying to Eleanor.

449
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,940
I'm so disappointed now.

450
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:13,020
I was like, oh, I could hire her as my pilot

451
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:15,940
when I become rich, famous, noble, priceless.

452
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,300
Okay, no, I'll learn.

453
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,140
I'll learn.

454
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,220
Yes, please.

455
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,300
Tell me about Belvedere.

456
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:24,020
Oh, so Jillian and I share custody of a...

457
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,140
Dog.

458
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:29,900
Hold on, no, I have to actually look up at the dog.

459
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,900
Saint Bernard.

460
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,700
My ex-wife Jillian and I share custody of a Saint Bernard.

461
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,220
His name is Belvedere.

462
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,340
I love him very much.

463
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:39,140
I have him on the weekends.

464
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,340
We take a lot of hikes, but Jillian has him

465
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,180
during the week.

466
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,460
It's Monday night.

467
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:47,140
You're getting ready to go drop off Belvedere at Jillian's.

468
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:49,900
This is the last moment that you get to spend

469
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,300
with your beloved Saint Bernard

470
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:55,780
before he goes and spends the week with Jillian

471
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:59,500
and her money that you pay her.

472
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,340
My money.

473
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:07,460
All of a sudden you hear cars, more than one,

474
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,860
they're pulling up outside.

475
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,740
You look out the window, you see the string

476
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:17,220
of those black SUVs, and they are lining your driveway,

477
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:20,820
but only one guy is walking up to the door and he knocks.

478
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:25,740
He keeps knocking.

479
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,620
Boom, boom, boom, boom.

480
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:31,460
Yes!

481
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,540
I mean, you couldn't help yourself.

482
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:34,380
I just helped yourself.

483
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,220
He couldn't help yourself.

484
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,420
Maybe I could.

485
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,180
Sound person.

486
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,260
Are you a fully artist?

487
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,420
I don't know what that means.

488
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,900
We have to get through all of these.

489
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:52,340
This whole episode is just Allie's introduction.

490
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:58,300
Allie, banging now on your door.

491
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,220
I don't answer.

492
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,060
Banging.

493
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,700
Louder and louder.

494
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,940
Is Belvedere upset?

495
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:10,660
Okay, I answered the door very reluctantly,

496
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:13,540
and I don't have one of those locks on the top of the door,

497
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:15,500
the chain locks, and I don't undo that.

498
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,380
Dr. Rusty Hooch?

499
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:19,180
Yes, can I see some identification, please?

500
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,460
What are you doing at my house?

501
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,460
Yeah, no problem.

502
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:25,380
He holds up his hand as if he's holding a badge

503
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,220
of some sort.

504
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:28,420
There's literally nothing in his hand.

505
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:31,540
And he says, you don't really need to know who I am.

506
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:34,420
We've been following you, and we understand

507
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:36,860
that you've been noticing some situations

508
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:39,420
that have been happening out in the woods.

509
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,940
I think due to some of your expertise,

510
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,180
we're gonna need your help.

511
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,420
I don't know what you're talking about.

512
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,580
I don't go in the woods.

513
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:46,700
I live in the city.

514
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,860
Dr. Hooch.

515
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:52,340
And he calls out your plane's number,

516
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:54,260
like your ID number.

517
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,180
Look around you.

518
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,860
What am I supposed to be seeing right now?

519
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:00,020
Well, I suppose it's your choice.

520
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,700
Do you see all those SPVs down there?

521
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:04,540
Yes.

522
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:06,500
You can come with us.

523
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,980
Maybe you'll learn something.

524
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:10,980
All right, well, I have to take Belvedere

525
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,460
to Jillian's house, my ex-wife,

526
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:13,900
because she has them during the week.

527
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:16,620
So I'll come with you, but I gotta take my dog first.

528
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,740
Any chance that I can get you to leave your dog here

529
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:19,580
until we're done?

530
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:20,460
It won't take too long.

531
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,460
It's a legal issue.

532
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,420
I'll really get in a lot of trouble from Jillian

533
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:26,460
if I don't have him there by 10 p.m. on Monday night.

534
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,380
We're gonna have you back by 10.

535
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,340
Oh, all right, all right.

536
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,380
As long as we can get Belvedere to Jillian, fine.

537
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,700
I'll go with you.

538
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,340
Okay, so you guys head out.

539
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,180
You get into an SUV.

540
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:39,220
It's actually empty, this one, except for a driver,

541
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:43,380
and this unidentified man gets into the car with you,

542
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:46,100
and he begins asking you about how many times

543
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:49,900
you've seen these silent blue explosions.

544
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,900
You guys pull up to a small camp in the woods

545
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:56,780
that's being run out of the back of a big truck.

546
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:59,620
So there's just this one covered truck

547
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:02,900
with a bunch of lab equipment inside of it,

548
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,540
computers going, scientists running around

549
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,780
talking to each other.

550
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:09,020
There's a bunch of military-looking guys

551
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:13,660
who are not wearing camo or any sort of military gear.

552
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:17,060
One of them approaches you with a, it's like a jar.

553
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,020
It's not a mason jar.

554
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,740
It's far more scientific.

555
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:22,460
It seems to be sealed on both sides.

556
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:27,460
It looks like a high-tech version of the bank teller thing

557
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,420
that you put in the tube, right?

558
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:34,220
And it is filled with this like bioluminescent blue liquid.

559
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:37,900
We're hoping that you can reverse engineer this.

560
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,540
I'm gonna need to know some more information

561
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,180
before I do anything for y'all.

562
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,420
Do you know who I am?

563
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:45,500
I just won a Nobel Prize for inventing mad cow disease.

564
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,340
I'm gonna need some context.

565
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,180
It's not gonna hooch.

566
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,940
We know exactly who you are.

567
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:52,900
Let's show her some context.

568
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:57,580
And a couple of the military guys go over to one of the SUVs

569
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:01,180
and pull out a guy who is bound.

570
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:04,340
He's wearing just like the raddest old clothes

571
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,660
you've ever seen.

572
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:08,020
Looks like he hasn't showered in months.

573
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,820
Filthy, filthy dude.

574
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:11,820
He's just kinda like dazed.

575
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,140
Looks like he's been drugged.

576
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:15,420
They kinda pull him out into the middle

577
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:18,100
of this clearing in the woods.

578
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,900
All right, come with me, come with me.

579
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,300
He walks you over to this guy

580
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,780
who's just kinda like put down on his knees,

581
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:27,180
hands tied behind his back, feet are bound.

582
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:31,300
And he opens up this container and it, oh, sorry, Taylor,

583
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,060
do you wanna do the opening of the container?

584
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

585
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:35,220
Psst.

586
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:40,780
Got it in one.

587
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:41,620
Nailed it.

588
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:49,780
He puts a finger in this like bioluminescent goop

589
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:53,340
and it kind of sticks to him like paint.

590
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:57,980
And then he draws a symbol on this bound man's forehead

591
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:02,220
and it kind of looks like waves that have teeth,

592
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,940
this weird symbol.

593
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:06,420
And then he closes the container.

594
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,660
Taylor?

595
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:08,780
Psst.

596
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,340
Pfft.

597
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,180
God.

598
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,300
It's art.

599
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,860
And he starts counting down.

600
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:21,900
39, 37.

601
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:24,020
And he says, we're gonna wanna get away.

602
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:28,620
42, 38, 35.

603
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:31,660
And you guys are walking and you see that other people

604
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:34,260
are walking extremely quickly.

605
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,180
And he is not, he's chilling.

606
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:38,140
He kinda turns back.

607
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:40,820
Are you ready to see the craziest thing you've ever seen?

608
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,980
I highly doubt this is gonna be the craziest thing

609
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:43,820
I've ever seen.

610
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:48,420
I've seen my dog take a giant shit in my Diamond DA40.

611
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,580
In it.

612
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:54,500
A bioluminescent explosion begins to pour out

613
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:58,940
of the bound dude's face and fill the ground around you.

614
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:01,780
And it begins to create a massive dome

615
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,300
that is engulfing this guy

616
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:06,140
and then slowly expands and takes over.

617
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:08,500
And as it's taking over, the guy looks at you next to you

618
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,580
and he's like, it would be all right.

619
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,620
This blue hits your face.

620
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:17,940
Your hair blows back and suddenly you see inside

621
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:22,340
and you are standing in seemingly the middle of the ocean.

622
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:25,380
You see all of this wildlife around you.

623
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:28,740
Fish, schools of fish swimming together.

624
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:31,300
Sharks, part of a whale at the dome

625
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,780
on the far side away from you.

626
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:35,340
And there's coral everywhere and it's dark

627
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,900
and it's blue and it's glowing.

628
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:42,900
And then suddenly it just collapses in on itself.

629
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:48,860
The only change is that this bound dude is gone.

630
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,100
What the fuck?

631
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:56,780
Shit.

632
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:59,460
Well, so first I checked my pocket mirror

633
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:02,380
to check my hair since it got messed up.

634
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:04,020
So I fixed my hair first.

635
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:08,100
As you're staring at yourself,

636
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:12,660
you see that your lips and your eyes,

637
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:15,860
your nostrils, your eyebrows,

638
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:20,380
everything on your face is fucking trembling.

639
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:24,380
You've never seen yourself look this shook.

640
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:28,700
I'm going to sue the shit out of you motherfuckers.

641
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:29,860
What did you just do to me?

642
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:32,100
You get a phone call from Jillian.

643
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,660
I walk up into the woods to take this call.

644
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:37,860
And that is Dr. Rusty Hooch.

645
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,220
Oh my God.

646
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,260
Holy shit.

647
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:42,100
Holy shit.

648
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:42,940
Radical, radical, radical.

649
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:45,540
It's now a good time to say that I'm afraid of sharks.

650
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,540
In real life or the character?

651
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,380
In real life.

652
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,220
Oh, for real?

653
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:52,500
In the character, yeah.

654
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,740
Okay, Ellie.

655
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:55,580
Oh my God.

656
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:56,780
You're up.

657
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:58,420
Give me a rundown.

658
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:00,580
Dr. Olivia Miller.

659
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:03,700
I based this off of the Swedish crime dramas

660
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:06,660
because every protagonist in Swedish crime dramas

661
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:08,620
is the exact same dude.

662
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:11,260
But in this case, I just made it a female.

663
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:15,620
Early fifties, incredibly tired woman.

664
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:18,900
Like everything about her is so freaking over it.

665
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,980
Like mentally tired, physically tired.

666
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:23,820
She has two daughters.

667
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,020
One of them won't speak to her

668
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:27,460
because she's a 15 year old little bitch.

669
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:31,500
And the other one is off to college,

670
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,020
but it's like teen daughters.

671
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:35,820
We all know, we all know what they're like.

672
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:40,820
She was recently left by her husband for a younger model.

673
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:45,020
And she's just so freaking tired.

674
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,380
You know, she's a workaholic.

675
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:47,220
She's a surgeon.

676
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:48,700
She's a very brilliant surgeon.

677
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:51,820
She's been doing that for a long time

678
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:54,580
and people call her for the tough cases.

679
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:58,980
But since everything else in her life sort of fell apart,

680
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:02,220
she's been really burying herself in work.

681
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,340
Takes on extra hours.

682
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:07,300
She's on call almost all the time.

683
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:10,660
And she's gained a couple of extra pounds

684
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:12,180
because she's not taking care of herself.

685
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:14,260
She picked up smoking because it was the only thing

686
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:16,420
that sort of calmed her nerves.

687
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:18,980
Even though she knows it's wrong, she's a doctor.

688
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:21,500
Lots of fast food, very little exercise.

689
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:26,220
And the idea I had in my head for her was Bill Murray

690
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:29,060
because of this constant through the signs, sad face,

691
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,940
but like a female version.

692
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:33,300
It's amazing.

693
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:36,260
I'm picturing Kate Winslet in mayor of East town.

694
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:37,580
I don't know if you saw that.

695
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:40,860
Yeah, that's very exactly that type of like,

696
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:43,340
because that's basically every crime drama

697
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:46,780
of like this resigned brilliant detective

698
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:50,020
just being so freaking like tired of everything.

699
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:53,220
But then like, well, I've seen worse or have I, you know.

700
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:54,900
Are there any happy detectives?

701
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:55,740
I don't think so.

702
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:58,180
I don't think you can be happy and be a detective,

703
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:00,460
but we shall see maybe in this game.

704
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,300
Maybe she'll find joy.

705
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:06,020
Yes, I think in this game, we'll find joy.

706
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:06,860
Yeah, psych.

707
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,580
That's true.

708
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:09,540
God, that show is great.

709
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:14,140
Eleanor, you've created like the opposite character from Ally.

710
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:20,100
The two doctors, Dr. Rusty Hooch and Dr. Olivia Miller,

711
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:24,340
both in name and juxtaposition could not be further

712
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:25,180
from each other.

713
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:29,380
Fun thing though, my charisma is 13, so I'm charming,

714
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:30,540
which I didn't realize.

715
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:34,780
But she's also started sleeping with her neighbor

716
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:37,460
because that's like the one, also another takeaway.

717
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:40,700
And so her neighbor kind of wants something more to happen,

718
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:42,180
but she's just like, no, no,

719
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:46,060
this is a very transactional thing going on.

720
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:49,380
But it's one of her bonds because they sort of drink whiskey

721
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:52,620
and play chess together or something boring.

722
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:56,940
I was about to say that sounds fun.

723
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,820
Yeah, I wrote for her tagline,

724
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:02,820
she's technically a lovely woman in need of a hug

725
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:04,380
and hopefully other things.

726
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:08,660
What was it, the occult or the unnatural or whatever?

727
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:10,100
The unnatural.

728
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,740
Yeah, when you asked that question,

729
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:13,460
I was just like, wait, what?

730
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,940
Because I thought for some reason thought this was like,

731
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:17,980
I've been trying to not read up on Delta Green

732
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:21,540
because I love going into something spoiler free.

733
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:24,740
And then I'm like, so there is an element of unnatural

734
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:26,660
because people have told me it's terrifying,

735
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:30,620
but I wasn't sure if it was like murder mystery terrifying

736
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:33,660
or if it's like, you know, unnatural, but now I know.

737
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:34,660
And so-

738
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:36,460
Little column A, little column B.

739
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:39,540
I envisioned her to say she's a very good surgeon.

740
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:43,460
She was called in for this weird case,

741
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:48,060
an autopsy of a corpse and what she found out

742
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:49,500
as she was doing it,

743
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:54,060
she had to extract this thing out of the body,

744
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:58,380
this black gooey blob of fat, basically.

745
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,620
And as she was picking it up really carefully,

746
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:03,540
it started like moving in a way

747
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:05,180
that suggested it's still alive.

748
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:09,300
And then she had to move it into a separate jar

749
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:12,620
and some people in black suits just took it away.

750
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:15,100
No more questions needed, so to speak.

751
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:17,700
Awesome, so awesome.

752
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:20,380
Dr. Olivia Miller, it's a school night.

753
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:24,580
And strangely, your 15-year-old

754
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:28,580
has requested a movie night with her mom.

755
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:30,660
This is very out of the ordinary.

756
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:32,460
How do you react?

757
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:34,220
What movie do you suggest?

758
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:37,100
Oh, I've heard that the latest

759
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,900
Downton Abbey movie just came out.

760
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:40,900
Would you like to watch that?

761
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:45,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, let's do that.

762
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:48,140
Or we can watch a Star War.

763
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:55,380
Okay, no, the Downton Abbey sounds nice, actually.

764
00:30:56,620 --> 00:31:00,180
Just something calming would be good.

765
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,060
I'm sorry.

766
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,980
Are you okay, honey?

767
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:05,060
Is everything all right?

768
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:05,900
It's fine.

769
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:10,900
It's just, can we talk for a second?

770
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:12,500
Of course.

771
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:15,020
Let me just...

772
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:17,060
Your front door starts rattling

773
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:19,060
and someone is just boom, boom, boom, boom.

774
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:21,540
Jesus, honey, please, just sit down.

775
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:22,500
I'll get you a...

776
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:26,540
Dr. Miller, Dr. Miller!

777
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:28,820
Fucking Christ, what is it?

778
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,260
And she walks over to the door.

779
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:32,100
If you peek your head through the window

780
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,660
or see through the peephole,

781
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:36,780
you see that the team of those men

782
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:41,060
who took away the jar with that fatty tissue

783
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:43,700
that seemed to be alive in it last time,

784
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:46,380
they are here at your home

785
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:51,380
and they have in custody a woman

786
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:55,580
who is shaking violently and screaming,

787
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,580
please, just fucking kill me!

788
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:59,900
Just fucking kill me!

789
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:04,380
All right, she quickly opens the door because-

790
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,220
They barge in.

791
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:07,380
They just boom, barge in, take over.

792
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:10,460
The men slam this woman on your kitchen table

793
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:12,940
and this woman is just like, please, please, kill me!

794
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:14,380
Doctor, doctor, we need you to...

795
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:16,900
Sorry, she's not dead yet, but we have to remove it.

796
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:17,820
You have to remove it.

797
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:19,340
Do you have any equipment here?

798
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:20,180
Of course.

799
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:22,740
And immediately she goes into professional mode

800
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:25,220
and takes out her medical equipment

801
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:27,940
and starts ordering everyone around like,

802
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:31,020
you, get me a towel, you there, start heating up,

803
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:34,140
like start disinfecting my tools and that she-

804
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:36,380
Yeah, somebody's got the stove going,

805
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:38,940
you got towels coming in, we got everything you need.

806
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:41,300
They've knocked off your bar cart.

807
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:43,860
They've like shoved everything off the top of the bar cart

808
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:46,700
and put it next to the table to put all the supplies on it.

809
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:50,500
And she looks at her daughter though, like, Laura, please,

810
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,340
I need you to-

811
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:52,780
What is happening?

812
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:54,460
Honey, you need to go to your room right now.

813
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:56,060
We need to go to your room and you stay there

814
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:57,020
and I'll find you soon.

815
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:58,860
Okay, and you're right back to business

816
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:01,580
and you're looking over the situation.

817
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,900
You see on this woman's neck,

818
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,540
there's just this kind of like,

819
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:13,340
pulsating sack of fat and fluid.

820
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:15,460
Meow.

821
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:21,380
She tries to do like an incision or like tries to-

822
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:23,820
Try and roll surgery for me.

823
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:26,260
Ooh, my first roll.

824
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:30,140
You said, okay.

825
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:33,900
Oh, I don't know, that's probably a fail.

826
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:38,900
It's 83 and I think I did put, oh no.

827
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:39,980
Yeah, that's a fail.

828
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:42,220
I only have 15 surgery, fuck.

829
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:46,060
As you cut it open, this fatty tissue begins to pour out

830
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:48,900
like you've seen it kind of jiggle in your hand earlier.

831
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,140
It's moving on its own.

832
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:51,300
It busts out.

833
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:53,000
You've accidentally cut it.

834
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,100
Your hand has slipped.

835
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:56,380
You didn't just cut through the skin.

836
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:58,920
You actually cut into the tissue itself.

837
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:02,700
The thing begins to unfold and twist itself inside out

838
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:07,700
as it turns to dust and this dust flies up into the nose

839
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,700
of one of these black-suited agents

840
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:13,460
and immediately one of the other agents goes,

841
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:17,220
oh, fucking Jason, pulls his gun and fires it

842
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:18,860
into the back of this guy's head.

843
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:21,660
As he hits the ground in your kitchen,

844
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:24,940
he fires three more times shattering the tile

845
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:26,820
underneath this guy's head.

846
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:28,880
You just had the kitchen redone.

847
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,660
You look over and at the end of the hallway,

848
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:37,660
you see your 15-year-old daughter is just staring in shock

849
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,480
from behind her door.

850
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:45,700
That's Dr. Olivia Miller.

851
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:47,540
Jesus Christ.

852
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:51,900
Hey, Ellie, Eleanor, welcome to Delta Green.

853
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:55,580
Yeah, oh my God.

854
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:56,420
Oh my God.

855
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:57,820
Well, cool.

856
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:58,660
Cool, cool, cool.

857
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,900
Next up, it's Lindsay.

858
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:05,740
Alphabetically.

859
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:06,560
Lindsay.

860
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,400
Hello.

861
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:10,040
Tell me about, what is this character's name?

862
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:14,380
Doreen Maureen, if you will.

863
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:15,980
Really just Doreen and then anything

864
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,700
that rhymes with Doreen.

865
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:18,600
Oh, anything.

866
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:21,380
If you go on for too long,

867
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:23,500
are we gonna call you Doreen Boring?

868
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:24,700
Yes, yes.

869
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,980
Boom, if you know a lot about the setting,

870
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:28,740
we'll call you Doreen Loring.

871
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:29,580
Oh my God.

872
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:34,120
When you go swimming, we call you Doreen Chlorine.

873
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:38,780
Genius name.

874
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:40,180
Doreen's pretty simple.

875
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:46,620
She's, just imagine like simple, super down to earth.

876
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:50,100
She's a fed agent, she's 45

877
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:52,780
and she doesn't really have a whole lot of friends.

878
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:54,740
She has a very, very small group of friends

879
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:57,900
and then it's just like no family anywhere close.

880
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:02,900
It's just me and my whippet, which is my-

881
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:05,260
Your drug of choice.

882
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:06,100
Gotcha, boom.

883
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,300
Y'all ever done nitrous?

884
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:13,100
It's both that and it is a type of dog.

885
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:16,100
It's a, imagine a teeny tiny gray hound.

886
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:18,900
A little scared, a little shaky, really thin.

887
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,300
That's my dog.

888
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:23,340
She's pretty lonely, but likes it that way.

889
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:24,940
So she's pretty run down.

890
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:26,700
She's got like box dyed hair.

891
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:29,820
It's grown out quite a bit since last time she's dying.

892
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:32,660
So she's got some dark gray roots coming in.

893
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:34,220
She's got some sunken eyes

894
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:37,380
and she just wears like super baggy clothes and-

895
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:39,580
Baggy clothes that I believe you wrote.

896
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:43,220
Baggy clothes like she's ready

897
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:44,980
to shoplift a bag of marshmallows.

898
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:50,580
That's how I'm referring to all baggy clothes from now on.

899
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:53,980
Like she's ready to shoplift a bag of marshmallows.

900
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:54,820
She's ready.

901
00:36:57,020 --> 00:37:01,340
Yeah, so she's more fun on the page than in person.

902
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:02,700
Her favorite-

903
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:05,260
She's more fun on the page than in person.

904
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:08,100
A perfect character for a role-playing game.

905
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:13,460
Yeah, she's always just like got pockets full

906
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:15,980
of like the wrapping of hard candy.

907
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:19,660
I got a pocket full of hard candy, oh my God.

908
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:20,500
I'm so tired.

909
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,220
When you leaned into the mic, Allie,

910
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:24,420
I expected you to join me.

911
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:25,700
No, I'm exhausted.

912
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:28,900
So disappointed.

913
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:29,860
God damn it.

914
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:31,620
And then, yeah, it's either that

915
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:34,340
or just some loose Mentos in there all the time.

916
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:35,700
She just got trash in her car.

917
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,500
I got a pocket full of loose Mentos.

918
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:41,180
I'm not even gonna look at you.

919
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:45,260
I tried to join, but then I just, I just couldn't.

920
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:46,100
I'm sorry.

921
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:50,300
She spends a lot of her extra time just like scrolling

922
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:53,540
on Pinterest on her iPad and like petting her with it.

923
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:54,940
Jesus Christ.

924
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:57,260
Honestly, that's all you needed to say

925
00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:00,380
to get a full idea of who this woman is.

926
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,380
I know this woman.

927
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:02,220
I know this woman.

928
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:03,540
She just scrolls Pinterest on her iPad.

929
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:07,420
I know who this is based off of someone I know.

930
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:08,260
Your mom?

931
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:09,100
Is it your mom?

932
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:09,940
It's based off of my mom.

933
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:12,420
I was gonna say, it sounds like I was doing a burn,

934
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:14,500
but I think it's probably, she's just literally my mom.

935
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,340
Is it your fucking mom?

936
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:17,180
He's just your fucking mom.

937
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:21,940
She religiously listens to this podcast, you know.

938
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:25,820
I think she would be appalled.

939
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:26,660
She would.

940
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:27,580
She absolutely would.

941
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:29,060
Mom, if you're listening to this,

942
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:31,380
only portions of this are based off of your mom.

943
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:32,580
Not for moms.

944
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:34,860
Except for Eleanor.

945
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:36,100
She can listen.

946
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,540
That mom can listen.

947
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:38,380
Eleanor, you're allowed to listen.

948
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:39,540
Otherwise, not for moms.

949
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:44,260
I think we have a lot of mom listeners, actually.

950
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:46,940
I'm so sorry I discriminated against the mom community.

951
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:47,780
I didn't mean it.

952
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:50,980
Can you, I mean, if you're at home all day

953
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:54,540
caring for your child, what better to listen to than-

954
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,020
Horror comedy.

955
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:56,900
Oh, for sure.

956
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:59,780
On behalf of all moms, I am incredibly offended,

957
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:01,340
but also a little aroused.

958
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:05,340
I think that's a green light.

959
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:12,180
All right, I think we know who this woman is

960
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:14,060
just based off that comment alone,

961
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:19,060
so let's dive into her experience with the unnatural.

962
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:21,460
All right, her experience,

963
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:24,220
it's caused a lot of trauma for Doreen.

964
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:26,700
I was called in on a murder case.

965
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,340
I had been working on this case for a while,

966
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:30,180
and I, oh, and do I need to read it in my case?

967
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:32,300
Hey, I don't know if you're gonna do a fresh person, maybe.

968
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:33,700
One night.

969
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:34,540
There we go.

970
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:36,260
I get this call one night,

971
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:39,140
and it's from an unknown number.

972
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:40,780
So I answer the phone,

973
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:42,380
and somebody's telling me to meet them

974
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:45,020
at a location I'm unaware of.

975
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:47,000
I didn't know this place existed.

976
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,500
I decide it's a good idea

977
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,100
since this case has been going for a while

978
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:52,740
and I'm really tired of it, ready to end this case.

979
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:54,780
So I show up at this house.

980
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:55,860
I open the front door

981
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:58,100
because the door's just kind of leaning open a little bit.

982
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,620
When I walk in,

983
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:02,820
everything is just covered in black rubber,

984
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:04,460
the walls, the ceilings.

985
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:07,380
You can see that there are things in this house,

986
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:09,940
but they're all just covered in this black rubber.

987
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:13,100
Sorry, I got...

988
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:13,940
Sorry.

989
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:14,760
You spooked yourself?

990
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,600
I scared myself.

991
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,440
Oh, my God.

992
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,260
No, I scared.

993
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:18,100
Are you really scared of rubber?

994
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,620
It was Ramona.

995
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:20,460
It was Ramona.

996
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,660
Okay, I'm sorry.

997
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:22,820
I could smell the rubber.

998
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,180
I can smell it.

999
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:30,020
It reminded me of the time I forgot to use a rubber.

1000
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:36,100
Why do all my jokes keep going back to condoms?

1001
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,500
Condoms and condoms.

1002
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,220
I gave penis on the brain.

1003
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:42,780
Penis on the brain.

1004
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:44,620
Penis, penis on the brain.

1005
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:46,660
No one wanted to keep going on that.

1006
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:49,500
I danced.

1007
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:52,500
All right.

1008
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:53,820
Everything inside of this house

1009
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,180
is just lined in this rubber,

1010
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:57,900
and it's thick, and it's weird, and it's soft,

1011
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:00,080
and it's making me really uneasy.

1012
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,200
So a dick.

1013
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:05,500
As I'm walking through this house,

1014
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,860
I start to hear a little bit of laughter,

1015
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:13,700
and it's really creepy, really uneasy.

1016
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,700
It's somewhere in the house.

1017
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:16,620
I don't know where it is,

1018
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:18,180
but it's somewhere in this house.

1019
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:20,340
I gotta find who's laughing at me.

1020
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:24,860
The laughter gets stronger.

1021
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:28,180
So I pull out my gun,

1022
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:29,980
and I start walking around gun first,

1023
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:33,380
and I'm looking for where this noise is coming from,

1024
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:36,500
and all of a sudden I see something not covered

1025
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:39,620
in this black rubber, and it's this big old mirror,

1026
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:41,660
and it looks really old, antique,

1027
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:43,880
and it's all rusty on the edges.

1028
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:46,460
And as I'm looking into this mirror,

1029
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:49,560
I see these two little kids,

1030
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:51,740
and they're staring right back at me,

1031
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:53,100
and they're just covered in blood

1032
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:55,540
like someone's just been beaten up.

1033
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:56,380
I'm sorry.

1034
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:01,460
Like someone's just been beaten up.

1035
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:03,280
You immediately recoiled.

1036
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:08,460
Covered in blood.

1037
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:09,660
Covered in blood.

1038
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:11,220
Just covered from head to toe.

1039
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:13,820
I turn to see what they're doing.

1040
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:15,060
They're standing behind me a little bit.

1041
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:17,060
I turn, and they're not there.

1042
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:18,980
So I turn back, I look at the mirror,

1043
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:20,420
and they start melting.

1044
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:22,060
They're melting into this metallic,

1045
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:24,440
silver, metal-looking lava.

1046
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:26,600
Now they're really in the room with me,

1047
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,940
but they're just two puddles of lava,

1048
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:31,220
and they start coming right at me, rolling towards me.

1049
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:34,980
And as I get closer, I start losing my bearings,

1050
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:37,500
and so I start running out of the building,

1051
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:39,040
only to find when I get outside

1052
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:43,380
that there are a bunch of agents in black cars and suits

1053
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:44,900
pointing their gun at me.

1054
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:45,860
I didn't know what to do.

1055
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:48,820
I got called here by someone who I don't know,

1056
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:52,260
so I just start running away in a zigzag pattern,

1057
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:53,860
and I'd never seen them since.

1058
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:58,060
That was the end of my story, though, so.

1059
00:42:58,060 --> 00:42:58,900
Dope story.

1060
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:00,300
Terrifying.

1061
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:01,140
Thanks.

1062
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:02,500
The next time we see Doreen Marine,

1063
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:05,100
that'd be hard,

1064
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:07,940
she is on the stand in a courtroom.

1065
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:11,700
It's a bright, sunny day, the sun rays are coming in

1066
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:14,180
through the windows, across one side,

1067
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:16,620
onto half of the people watching.

1068
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:19,340
The lawyer in a smart suit is asking questions

1069
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:22,660
about what happened in that house.

1070
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:26,240
You can see one of those people in the black suits

1071
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,680
that were outside, the woman who was up front.

1072
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:33,020
She's sitting in the back row, and she's just staring.

1073
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:36,260
The lawyer continues.

1074
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:40,100
So, how long were you inside the house?

1075
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:40,940
Oh, I don't know.

1076
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:43,820
It couldn't have been longer than maybe 10 minutes.

1077
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:46,020
And did you?

1078
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:49,380
She laughs and rolls her eyes at the jury.

1079
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:53,740
See anything like what the defendant described?

1080
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:54,580
Objection!

1081
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:55,420
Sustained.

1082
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:58,780
Did you see the spooky, melty children in the mirror row?

1083
00:43:58,780 --> 00:43:59,620
Objection!

1084
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:00,460
Sustained.

1085
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:02,420
What did you see that night?

1086
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:08,020
I saw them melty, spooky children in the reflection.

1087
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,940
There's only one mirror.

1088
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:11,820
I saw them children.

1089
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:12,900
They were coming at me.

1090
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:17,020
The lawyer is just rolling her eyes, looking at the jury.

1091
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:19,180
You literally see some of the jury members

1092
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:21,180
are putting their hands over their mouths

1093
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:25,080
to stifle laughter, and the judge is rubbing his temples.

1094
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:27,860
Cut to the bathroom.

1095
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:30,300
Doreen Marine is splashing water on her face.

1096
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:32,700
Spsh, pow, spsh, spsh, pow.

1097
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:33,700
Ha ha ha ha!

1098
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:36,860
I think I'm getting better at this.

1099
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:37,860
Ha ha ha ha!

1100
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:40,940
When suddenly,

1101
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:46,340
you start to hear laughter from behind you.

1102
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:48,420
Roll sanity for me real quick.

1103
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:49,260
Ooh.

1104
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:55,980
This is a really good teaching moment.

1105
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:57,220
What'd you roll, Lindsay?

1106
00:44:58,580 --> 00:44:59,420
88.

1107
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:01,580
Can you say that a little bit louder for me?

1108
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:02,420
88.

1109
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:07,580
So, in Delta Green, when the dice match,

1110
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:10,980
like 88 or 44 or 22 or 11.

1111
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:12,020
What about 55?

1112
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:14,460
That's another one.

1113
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:17,580
When the dice match, it is critical.

1114
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:20,500
So if it's under your score, that's a critical success.

1115
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:22,500
But when it's over your score in Delta Green,

1116
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:25,980
it's called a fumble or a critical failure.

1117
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:30,340
Critical failure on a sanity check is not good,

1118
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:31,860
especially in an introduction

1119
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:35,700
where we haven't really started playing the game yet almost.

1120
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:39,740
So I'm gonna describe this scene from the perspective

1121
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:44,740
of the federal agent who is sitting in the back row

1122
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:47,460
who just walked into this bathroom

1123
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:52,420
to see Doreen Marine kick in the door of the stall

1124
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:56,540
that was behind her with just nothing in her eyes.

1125
00:45:56,540 --> 00:46:00,740
She's just gone, blinded by anger and fear.

1126
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:05,740
She is just slamming two kids' heads into the toilet.

1127
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:11,180
Ah, ah, ah, ah, shit, oh, shit, fuck, fuck.

1128
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:14,540
And you see a vape fall out of one of their hands,

1129
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:16,780
which is why they were in this stall together

1130
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:18,580
in the first place, just vaping,

1131
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:20,540
just getting away from the parents for a little bit,

1132
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:22,100
vaping in the bathroom.

1133
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:25,460
This woman pulls you off of these two teens.

1134
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:27,900
What are you doing, what are you doing, what are you doing?

1135
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:29,820
Look at me, Doreen, Doreen, Doreen.

1136
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:34,340
No one believes you, Doreen, Doreen, I believe you.

1137
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:37,340
We have to get out of here, get out of here, get out of here.

1138
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:41,420
And in this fragile state, Doreen's ready to go

1139
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:44,160
with just about anyone who believes her right now.

1140
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:46,620
And two of you get into a car

1141
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:48,600
and you drive to this warehouse.

1142
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:50,820
I don't wanna freak you out,

1143
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:53,940
but what I'm about to show you,

1144
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:57,720
just know that we're doing a good thing.

1145
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:01,860
And she opens up the door of the warehouse

1146
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:06,460
and you just see it is filled with mirrors

1147
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:08,980
and the smell of rubber is in the air.

1148
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:13,940
That's Doreen Maureen.

1149
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:15,380
Good damn.

1150
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:19,780
God, oh my God, oh my God.

1151
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:21,660
So cool, so fucking cool.

1152
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:25,860
You guys all wrote, rad introductions for your characters.

1153
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:27,500
It makes me so happy.

1154
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:30,940
Now we're on to, I think it says here your name is?

1155
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:32,440
The Chuckster.

1156
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:38,100
My born name is Charles,

1157
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:42,020
but most people call me Chuck.

1158
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:43,620
And if you're a close friend,

1159
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:45,740
you call me the Chuckster.

1160
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:50,620
Should I get into it?

1161
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:51,460
Oh yeah, please.

1162
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:54,900
All right, I am about 34 years old.

1163
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:57,100
I just moved out of my parents' house

1164
00:47:57,100 --> 00:47:58,900
about six months ago.

1165
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:00,660
Yeah, thank you.

1166
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:02,340
I'm basically a gamer.

1167
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:05,060
I game and I sleep and I eat mac and cheese

1168
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:07,940
in rotation is what I do.

1169
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:11,980
And so I don't have any physical friends per se,

1170
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:14,740
but I'm really tight with my online community of gamers,

1171
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:16,100
of fellow gamers.

1172
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:18,740
So we don't really know a whole lot about each other

1173
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:22,700
other than our gaming tags and what each other eat

1174
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:24,420
and drink, et cetera.

1175
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:28,060
I am also a partier, solo partier.

1176
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:29,620
I'm crushing them beers.

1177
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:32,060
I'm a solo partier.

1178
00:48:32,060 --> 00:48:35,860
Crushing them beers day and night as I play my games.

1179
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:36,820
Is that a partier?

1180
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:40,700
In Missouri it is.

1181
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:42,500
Yeah, I mean, I'm talking to my friends.

1182
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:44,140
They're also crushing beers.

1183
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:47,560
I think so.

1184
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:51,260
What else do you want to know about me?

1185
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:52,100
What do you look like?

1186
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:55,380
I am ginger, my ginger.

1187
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:57,100
Oh, a stud.

1188
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,740
Yes, of course I am.

1189
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:02,940
I would say I'm like fat strong.

1190
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:03,780
Yeah.

1191
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:07,260
Yeah, I think it's the best way to describe how I look.

1192
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:11,900
About five, six average height and yeah, like fat strong.

1193
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:15,780
So I am very strong, but I got a layer of pudge over it

1194
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:17,700
and I don't like work out or anything.

1195
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:18,780
I guess I have strong thumbs.

1196
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:20,060
Tasty.

1197
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:20,900
From my gaming.

1198
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:25,380
Tasty indeed.

1199
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:28,420
So you are, you were ex-military?

1200
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:30,020
Oh yeah, I'm ex-military.

1201
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:33,580
I don't share this with many people

1202
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:36,860
other than a couple of my tight online community friends,

1203
00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:40,620
but I was not dishonorably charged,

1204
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:43,140
but I was like the level below.

1205
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:46,900
Cause I was solo partying a little too hard one night

1206
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:51,020
and maybe did some unsavory activities

1207
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:54,580
involving piss and my Sergeant's bed.

1208
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:57,780
My Sergeant's bed.

1209
00:49:57,780 --> 00:49:59,620
Yeah, that is not allowed.

1210
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:01,420
It's not.

1211
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:04,140
Unless the Sergeant's into that sort of thing.

1212
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:06,460
I tell people, I tell people

1213
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:09,620
that I was on a pretty righteous mission,

1214
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:11,060
you know, fighting them baddies

1215
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:13,580
and saving hundreds of children.

1216
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:15,580
I rolled my ankle pretty bad.

1217
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:23,500
So I got the purple heart and the red heart

1218
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:24,780
and a green heart.

1219
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:29,220
And now I'm a veteran of, you know,

1220
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:32,460
the good old USA, getting them checks.

1221
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:34,780
Stolen valor, the character.

1222
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:35,620
I love it.

1223
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:36,460
Great.

1224
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:39,420
All right, so your parents,

1225
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:41,220
you just moved out of their house.

1226
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:42,540
They adore you.

1227
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:45,140
They think that I was honorably discharged

1228
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:48,380
for an injury on the battleground,

1229
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:51,940
but I actually, I actually never,

1230
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:54,260
I actually never saw battle.

1231
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:55,380
Didn't make it there.

1232
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:57,300
I was in my, what's it called?

1233
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:59,620
What you start with when you're practicing for war?

1234
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:00,460
It's the practicing.

1235
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:01,780
The practice battleground.

1236
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:02,900
The practice ground.

1237
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:04,300
I was in the practice round.

1238
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:07,420
What is that called?

1239
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:09,420
You know, you know.

1240
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:12,420
Tweet, tweet at pretending to be people.

1241
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:13,260
Not our tag.

1242
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:17,580
P-T-P-P-P-P-T-T.

1243
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:20,180
Pretending pod to tell her,

1244
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:21,540
are you talking about basic training?

1245
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:22,980
Yeah, that's right.

1246
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:24,180
All right, didn't even make it out of basic.

1247
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:25,020
Sounds good.

1248
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:25,860
Didn't make it out of basic.

1249
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:26,700
Wow.

1250
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:28,100
Yeah, and then I kind of laid low

1251
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:32,660
because I was ashamed and I didn't want my parents to know.

1252
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:37,660
And yeah, then I came back and yeah, stolen valor for sure.

1253
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:40,580
But I was, I mean, I tried to be in the military.

1254
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:42,380
So it's not, it's not that stole.

1255
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:44,060
It's like partial stolen valor.

1256
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:47,420
Question, how hard is it to get into the American military?

1257
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:48,260
Is it hard or is it like-

1258
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:49,980
You just have to have a heartbeat.

1259
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:51,980
So it's Chucky a little pathetic

1260
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:54,220
for not being able to make it out of basic?

1261
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:55,060
Yes.

1262
00:51:55,060 --> 00:51:55,900
Yes.

1263
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:56,740
Oh no, Chucky.

1264
00:51:56,740 --> 00:51:58,340
I mean, to be fair, we're speaking about things

1265
00:51:58,340 --> 00:52:00,700
we know shit, jack shit about, like-

1266
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:01,540
That's fair.

1267
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:03,180
I don't know much about the military.

1268
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:04,020
I don't think Zach does.

1269
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:08,300
The military industrial complex is ruining the world.

1270
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:09,140
Oh God.

1271
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:13,900
They don't appreciate the chucks of the,

1272
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:14,740
you know, of the nation.

1273
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:15,940
All right, how did you,

1274
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:19,260
how did you come to learn about the unnatural?

1275
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:20,100
Yes. Okay.

1276
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:23,500
So I was gaming with my bros, my brosips one night

1277
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:26,220
and I, no, I can't, I'm not allowed to say that.

1278
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:27,060
Oh, sorry.

1279
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:29,020
No, I'm just shaking my head for fun.

1280
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:32,940
Because brosips is a really stupid word.

1281
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:33,780
That's why.

1282
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:40,820
I was gaming with my brosips and we chat on the side,

1283
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:42,420
you know, and then I've got my whole headset

1284
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:44,700
where I'm like screaming into my mic,

1285
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:47,620
but then I get this separate little chat window pop up

1286
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:50,380
and it's like inverse colors, black with white type

1287
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:51,820
and I've never seen it before.

1288
00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:54,140
And it's one of my buddies, one of my good buddies.

1289
00:52:54,140 --> 00:52:59,140
His screen name is dingdonghashtag451,

1290
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:01,660
who I know to be Brett.

1291
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:02,560
I mean, we're pretty tight.

1292
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:04,860
Like we've been gaming for like two years together

1293
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:06,360
and he sends me this message

1294
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:09,100
and this random like private chat that says,

1295
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:11,220
hey bro, I want to show you something,

1296
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:12,420
but can you be discreet?

1297
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:16,740
And I'm like, of course I can broseph, what's up?

1298
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:19,700
So he sends me this video and I watch it

1299
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:22,260
and it's from the perspective of a guy

1300
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:25,860
and then there's two military type guys in front of him

1301
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:28,260
and they're walking into a forest.

1302
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:30,180
It's nighttime, it's dark.

1303
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:33,420
And we hear this deep groaning sound, like.

1304
00:53:34,860 --> 00:53:35,700
Excuse me.

1305
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:36,520
Oh, sorry.

1306
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:38,300
At least let me do my own sound effects.

1307
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:41,060
I don't know who you think you are, sir.

1308
00:53:41,060 --> 00:53:42,180
The crooner.

1309
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:43,540
Okay, so it's more like.

1310
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:44,380
Ooh.

1311
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:46,180
Ooh.

1312
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:51,420
Yeah, that's the scariest thing I've ever heard.

1313
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:52,260
Ooh.

1314
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:55,380
Something like that.

1315
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:57,860
And it gets so loud at a point

1316
00:53:57,860 --> 00:54:00,780
that I have to turn the volume down as I'm watching it.

1317
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:05,780
They get closer and closer to this clearing that I can see.

1318
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:10,360
And inside the clearing, there is this bottomless pit

1319
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:13,220
with a glowing orange light coming out of it.

1320
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:15,980
And the groaning is so loud at this point

1321
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:18,140
that you can see the men holding their ears.

1322
00:54:18,140 --> 00:54:19,520
It's clearly unbearable.

1323
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:21,700
And I've turned my volume down almost to

1324
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:23,220
almost a complete mute.

1325
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:28,100
And then all of a sudden I see this huge black tongue

1326
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:30,900
surface itself out of the bottomless pit,

1327
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:35,300
split into two and wrap itself around the two men

1328
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:36,820
that were holding their ears.

1329
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:39,180
And at this point they've like gone down to their knees

1330
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:40,820
cause it's so difficult to be around.

1331
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:44,580
So tongue split in two, wraps around each of them,

1332
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:47,340
throws them up in the air, catches them,

1333
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:49,420
wraps around again, and then the tongue

1334
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:51,320
goes down into the hole.

1335
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:53,080
At this point, the man holding the camera,

1336
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:56,040
he's like dropped it and he's running away.

1337
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:59,220
But you can still kind of see half that the ground

1338
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:02,320
starts to just mold itself over

1339
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:04,540
and the trees grow back up again.

1340
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:05,780
And it's as if it wasn't there at all.

1341
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:06,700
Oh my God.

1342
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:07,660
Jesus.

1343
00:55:07,660 --> 00:55:12,420
So I see this video and I got to keep cool for my boys,

1344
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:14,020
you know, always keeping cool for my boys.

1345
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:17,740
So to Brett, I'm like, dude, so tight,

1346
00:55:17,740 --> 00:55:20,420
like whatever this is, I'm in.

1347
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:24,060
But I'm like completely tense.

1348
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:26,620
And I don't know much about this personally,

1349
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:28,580
but I believe that maybe my ball sack

1350
00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:30,180
has like gone into my body.

1351
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:31,180
Is that a thing that happens?

1352
00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:33,160
Yeah, that's definitely a thing that would happen.

1353
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:36,580
Maybe not the sack itself going into your body,

1354
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:39,500
but the testicles would definitely coil up.

1355
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:41,380
Yeah, which would shrink the sack.

1356
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:44,820
Okay, so shrunken sack for me.

1357
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:49,540
It's the shrunken sack for me.

1358
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:51,420
Also, I didn't say what my screen name is.

1359
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:53,180
We got the episode title.

1360
00:55:55,180 --> 00:55:56,560
I didn't say what my screen name is,

1361
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:59,180
but it's a Ballbuster 420, hell yeah.

1362
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:02,860
And it's the complete screen name.

1363
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:05,680
Okay, eventually you get a message from Brett again,

1364
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:08,920
ding dong, hashtag 451, which by the way,

1365
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:12,640
Taylor was like, did you guys notice?

1366
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:16,640
The D in ding and the G in dong for capital

1367
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:23,800
for a very, yeah, very subtle reference to Delta Green.

1368
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:24,640
Wow.

1369
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:29,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1370
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:31,680
You brought, most of you probably,

1371
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:32,520
yeah, wouldn't have gotten that, but.

1372
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:34,400
Ellie, are you okay?

1373
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:35,240
I'm like, what?

1374
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:37,840
You guys are brilliant masterminds.

1375
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:40,520
I did not see that, thank you.

1376
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:44,480
Brett's gonna come pick you up

1377
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:47,120
and you're gonna head out.

1378
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:50,600
He's gonna take you to meet some of his friends, yeah?

1379
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:51,440
Yeah.

1380
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:52,260
Yeah, you're joining up.

1381
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:55,180
All right, so he takes you to,

1382
00:56:55,180 --> 00:56:59,680
okay, so it's like the most recent holy tongue site, right?

1383
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:01,200
So we're calling that thing the holy tongue.

1384
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,480
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it.

1385
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:04,360
Holy tongue.

1386
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:05,800
It doesn't have holes in it, it's split into,

1387
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:06,640
oh, it goes in the hole, I get it.

1388
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:08,120
Nice, all right, you get it.

1389
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:11,580
So we've tracked it down to this corn field, right?

1390
00:57:11,580 --> 00:57:13,680
Okay, so we're gonna head on out

1391
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:16,160
and as you guys get there, there's this corn field,

1392
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:19,960
there's a couple tents set up, dudes on laptops,

1393
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:22,560
a couple military bros hanging out.

1394
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:25,280
All right, so we're going in with a third guy,

1395
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:27,040
come on over here, come on over here.

1396
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:30,280
And this dude walks up and he's like, yo,

1397
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:32,880
Bill, we're nice to, oh shit, not Bill,

1398
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:35,200
Bill, not Bill, gamertags?

1399
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:37,760
Yeah, sorry, it's a rumple foreskin, what up?

1400
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:38,600
How's it going?

1401
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:41,400
And he puts out a fist for you to bump.

1402
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:46,400
I go for the fist, but then I do the octopus,

1403
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:47,280
is that what it is?

1404
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:48,320
Jesus fucking Christ.

1405
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:50,880
Squid, is it a squid?

1406
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:52,400
So I squid him.

1407
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:53,240
Oh!

1408
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:57,560
You inked me, bro.

1409
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:00,960
And then I grab his arm and then I go in for a bro hug.

1410
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:03,800
Oh yeah, you guys slap the shit out of each other's backs.

1411
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:06,800
Dude, I knew you'd be tight.

1412
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:08,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, tight as hell, bro.

1413
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:09,480
All right, sick.

1414
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:11,900
So plan is, what we're gonna do,

1415
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:13,660
this thing is probably gonna come up,

1416
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:16,520
hey nerd, when's this thing popping up?

1417
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:19,560
And this dude on the computer is like,

1418
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:23,200
huge sigh, pushes up his glasses and is like,

1419
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:25,960
14 minutes.

1420
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:29,080
So we're gonna wear these

1421
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:31,680
and he puts on these noise-canceling headphones

1422
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:34,160
that are super high-tech over your ears

1423
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:35,560
and then he keeps talking,

1424
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:37,260
but you just see his mouth moving.

1425
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:41,120
And then he's like, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1426
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:43,800
And then he takes off your headphones.

1427
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:44,640
And he's like, all right,

1428
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:46,400
so we're gonna wait for this thing, right?

1429
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:47,240
And then-

1430
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:48,800
So whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

1431
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:50,840
we're gonna meet the tongue?

1432
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:52,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, it's gonna be sick.

1433
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:54,800
I just wanna make it like maybe not the best idea.

1434
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:57,280
Whoa, bro, are you not down?

1435
00:58:57,840 --> 00:58:59,720
No, no, no, no, I'm super down.

1436
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:01,600
Don't worry about my downness.

1437
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:04,120
I've never been so down, down in the ground,

1438
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:05,480
underneath the body.

1439
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:06,920
Yeah, exactly, that's where we're going.

1440
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:08,440
We're gonna go down into it, all right?

1441
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:10,100
So first we're gonna stun it.

1442
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:10,940
Cool, cool, cool.

1443
00:59:10,940 --> 00:59:12,200
Right, so those nerds over there,

1444
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:14,760
and he points back at this like whole tent

1445
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:17,800
where they've got this crazy, like metal, shiny,

1446
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:19,360
EMP looking thing.

1447
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:20,680
What's an EMP?

1448
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:22,800
Electromagnetic pulse.

1449
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:25,880
So that would like send a shockwave

1450
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:27,680
that would knock out electronics.

1451
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:30,600
Yo, but this one is gonna knock out this fucking tongue.

1452
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:33,560
Apparently they already tried it like 10 times

1453
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:34,880
or twice or whatever.

1454
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:38,080
And so like, we're definitely gonna be able to stun it.

1455
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:41,120
It'll be chill for like 15 minutes.

1456
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:41,960
All right, all right.

1457
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:45,560
So we are going to, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1458
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:48,240
I mean, splunk, I guess is the word.

1459
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:50,920
It's not a cave, but you know, it's a hole, baby.

1460
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:52,880
Ha ha, they fist bump.

1461
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:53,920
You've got cameras,

1462
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:56,800
you've got these strange like energy reading devices.

1463
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:58,520
He's like, yeah, I don't know what they are,

1464
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:00,160
but apparently it's gonna give them

1465
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:02,160
like the information they need.

1466
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:04,840
Obviously we're gonna have a bunch of guns and knives

1467
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:06,080
just in case shit goes down.

1468
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:07,280
I brought my knuckle busters.

1469
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:08,640
I brought my throwing stars.

1470
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:10,560
I'm ready to get down.

1471
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:12,040
You have throwing stars?

1472
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:13,080
Hell yeah, I got throwing stars.

1473
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:14,560
Can I see your throwing stars?

1474
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:16,760
I mean, when the time presents itself.

1475
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:19,560
Oh, play close to the chest, play close to the chest.

1476
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:20,680
I dig that, all right, cool.

1477
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:22,160
So let's fucking go.

1478
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:26,080
Cut to the Chuckster, if I may.

1479
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:27,560
I think we're tight enough now, yeah.

1480
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:30,320
You're stabbing your knife into solid ground

1481
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:33,800
for the first time in what feels like an eternity

1482
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:37,040
as you finish scrambling as fast as you can

1483
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:40,520
out of the roused holy tongue.

1484
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:42,120
This thing is alive now.

1485
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:44,720
It's back and you crawl toward the team

1486
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:46,240
on the ground away from it.

1487
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:50,440
This team that's firing now at the whole situation

1488
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:52,920
from behind cover, just a bunch of military dudes

1489
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:56,080
firing over your head as you're crawling to safety

1490
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:59,720
and you hear Brett ding-dong, hashtag 451.

1491
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:00,920
He's screaming.

1492
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:04,240
You look back, you see one of these tongues, boom,

1493
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:06,760
grabs him by the ankle and it starts slowly

1494
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:08,040
dragging him back in.

1495
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:09,440
What do you do?

1496
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:10,760
Well, first of all, as it's happening,

1497
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:13,400
I'm yelling, not tight.

1498
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:14,240
Tight.

1499
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:23,880
Ding-dong, I'll save you.

1500
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:26,560
I'll come back for you.

1501
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:28,600
And then I just continue to scramble away.

1502
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:31,880
All right, hell yeah.

1503
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:33,720
No sign of Rumple foreskin.

1504
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:35,800
Rumple foreskin is gone.

1505
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:38,720
There is no Rumple foreskin to be seen.

1506
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:40,720
I'm just trying to say that a few more times

1507
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:42,320
before we never hear it again.

1508
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:43,760
Okay, so.

1509
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:45,120
Wait, where's Rumple foreskin?

1510
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:45,960
Nowhere to be seen.

1511
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:47,280
Damn.

1512
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:51,680
Ding-dong is being pulled back slowly into this thing

1513
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:55,560
and the ground begins to kind of reform itself

1514
01:01:55,560 --> 01:01:58,360
and right at the last second, right before,

1515
01:01:58,360 --> 01:02:00,840
you think that ding-dong's entire body

1516
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:02,920
is gonna be yoinked down into the hole,

1517
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:05,120
but it doesn't quite all make it.

1518
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:07,640
And as the ground finishes forming,

1519
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:11,840
the head of Brett is just sitting on the ground

1520
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:16,120
and you think maybe he himself is just stuck there

1521
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:21,120
until slowly the head falls over on its side

1522
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:26,200
and blood just starts squirting out from the bottom of it.

1523
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:27,040
Jeez.

1524
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:33,360
That is Charles Chuck, the Chuckster.

1525
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:35,600
Thank you, thank you for playing.

1526
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:37,800
Fucking, oh my God.

1527
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:41,040
Sorry, I'm reacting and sitting here.

1528
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:42,560
How do you feel?

1529
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:44,280
I'm super intrigued by all these stories.

1530
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:47,720
They're really cool, but also they start off

1531
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:52,720
like penis joke, Brett, foreskin, military complex

1532
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:57,240
and then like, you're dead, you're gone.

1533
01:02:57,240 --> 01:03:00,160
And there doesn't seem to be a way to protect yourself

1534
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:02,920
which makes it even more terrifying.

1535
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:04,480
It just lands on you.

1536
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:07,080
I think I'm gonna go back for that tongue.

1537
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:08,240
Go for it.

1538
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:09,080
Yeah.

1539
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:44,080
Breathe it in.

1540
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:05,080
Clasp your fist, or fall apart.

1541
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:10,080
Water leaks through your fingers.

1542
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:16,080
You're standing in a swirling flood.

1543
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:28,080
And only darkness lingers.

1544
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:47,080
Falling fast into a deep abyss.

1545
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:52,080
Till it sets you out again.

1546
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:57,080
Find your feet on your broken bones.

1547
01:04:57,080 --> 01:05:08,080
You're out for the edge again.

1548
01:05:27,080 --> 01:05:43,080
You're out for the edge again.

1549
01:05:57,080 --> 01:06:16,080
You're out for the edge again.

1550
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:42,080
You're out for the edge again.

1551
01:06:42,080 --> 01:07:07,080
You're out for the edge again.

1552
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:32,080
Yeah.

1553
01:07:32,080 --> 01:08:00,080
Yeah.

1554
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:28,080
Yeah.

1555
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:41,080
Yeah.
