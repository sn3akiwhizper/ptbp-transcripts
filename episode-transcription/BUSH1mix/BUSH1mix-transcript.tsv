0	2240	Well, where the shit am I now?
2240	4940	And when the hell are I?
4940	10600	Let me check my map I got from that interdimensional gas station.
10600	13320	Southwest Arkansas.
13320	16980	There ain't possibly a place named like that.
16980	22420	I guess I better put on a good show no matter where or when I am.
22420	23380	Fuck.
23380	27780	I'm coming at you live from wherever I said earlier.
27780	31500	From 694.2 PTBP.
31500	35820	The only radio station that broadcasts from Arkansas.
35820	37420	Probably.
37420	40260	This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Nathan.
40260	44940	AKA at APOC underscore Golem on Twitter.
44940	47700	From Aberdeen, South Dakota.
47700	51600	Who tweeted about the show and tagged at Pretending Pod.
51600	55140	Which is a praiseworthy thing to do with your fingers.
55140	56700	Nathan writes.
56820	58460	Dearest Edward.
58460	60260	I will see you soon.
60260	62580	I tried to stay strong.
62580	63780	I promised.
63780	65180	And I failed.
65180	69780	I thought I could trap it inside me but now I'm the one trapped.
69780	71580	It is in me now.
71580	74700	It forces me to move against my will.
74700	79420	I scream inside my own head while it makes me do things.
79420	81460	Bad things, Ed.
81460	82860	I'm so sorry.
82860	84620	It comes for you now.
84660	89020	I feel my feet wrench and spasm in a mockery of walking.
89020	92980	As it forces my body to lurch in your direction.
92980	94580	It is patient.
94580	95980	Dearest Edward.
95980	97600	I'm so sorry.
97600	99240	I will see you soon.
100500	102740	Well, you heard the guy, Edward.
102740	104780	He's coming to see you soon.
104780	109100	Sounds like it's gonna be a fun time for you and your BFF.
109100	110400	If you wanna write up something
110400	113140	for your arken-saucy wolf to howl,
113140	115300	tag at PretendingPod on Twitter
115300	118700	or write a five-star review on Apple Podcasts
118700	121740	or I guess also two more things.
121740	125740	Tag at PretendingPod on Instagram, fuck Mark Zuckerberg
125740	128100	or tag pretending to be people on Facebook,
128100	131300	fuck Mark Zuckerberg.
131300	133280	We love it when people are excited
133280	135540	to tell their friends about our show here
135540	138520	but seriously, fuck Mark Zuckerberg.
138520	142420	Maybe Wolfie can give that pasty half alien
142420	145900	the physical delights the human part of him craves.
145900	150300	He ain't never ever met a wolf like me.
150300	153420	And if that excellent pun gave you the blues,
153420	157140	let's see who won in this week's The News.
157140	160620	And that winner from Twitter's mostly bitter litter
160620	164740	is the Twitter outfitter at tdunder-beck
164740	169740	aka Cosplay underscore by underscore Tyler.
170220	172300	He guessed the special guest
173140	175020	who will join Allie, Lindsay, and Taylor
175020	180020	for all five parts of Operation Bigfoot Underground
180180	181620	Search and Hunt.
181620	186620	That's right, Operation Bigfoot Underground Search and Hunt
186820	189660	will be played by the crew who you knew
189660	193580	when they brought you their story in the Contingent Woods
193580	198380	alongside Eleanor DiLorenzo, the delightful creator
198380	201380	and GM of the Lost Mountain saga,
201380	204780	a dedicated role player on the Glass Cannon Network's
204780	208940	Androids and Aliens, the foul-mouthed Twitch streamer
208940	212100	who once laughed so hard she could barely breathe
212100	216020	after reading the name Mike Oxmaul.
216020	218620	Well, better not dwell on that name.
218620	222020	My mouth might get jealous of all that nasty trash
222020	224060	going in the wrong hole.
224060	228700	Let's fill them ears with something that clears the gears.
228740	231580	It's Molly Healy with Circles.
231580	233420	["Circles"]
241420	243420	["Circles"]
258700	260700	["Circles"]
272820	274620	I'm glad you were honest with us.
274620	275900	Yes.
275900	276900	We're cutting this out.
276900	279100	That's requesting my first cut.
279100	279940	Oh no, the Thomas Roll.
279940	281420	Oh no, it's staying in.
281420	283940	Fuck, Allie, you said it.
283940	287460	Oh no, it was just about to get cut.
287460	290260	Welcome to Pretending to Be People.
290260	294820	I am here with a whole table of special guests here.
294820	297340	We're going to go around the table here.
297340	299300	We're going to start with,
299300	302140	she's played Gerald Fingersen.
302140	305820	She played Sharon Shadow Berryman.
305820	308780	She does the sound of phone calls.
308780	311500	Ring, ring, ring, ring.
311500	313380	It's my wife, Borat Voice.
313380	314220	Taylor.
314220	316020	Hello, I'm his wife.
316060	317580	Did that work the opposite way?
319380	320340	I don't think so.
320340	321180	Anyway, hi.
321180	325100	We have Liz Lonklin, the Doc Martin wearing punk,
325100	329620	the designer of the infamous PTBP fanny pack
329620	333340	that I fucking promise will exist one day.
333340	335100	It's Lindsay.
335100	336820	Hello, I'm Lindsay.
338140	338980	Nailed it.
338980	341980	Just top notch, boom town.
341980	344940	She played Krista Krinklehoff.
344980	346300	It's still hard to say.
347980	350620	She played a bro bot named Brett.
350620	352100	She's my new coworker.
352100	353580	Thanks for getting me the job.
353580	354980	It's Ali.
354980	356220	Hello, I am Ali.
356220	357980	I regret getting him the job.
357980	361380	I'm loud and in the, well, I used to be in the office,
361380	363500	but now no one's in the office.
363500	365020	Woo.
365020	368100	And finally, she's an actor.
368100	369980	She's a standup comedian.
369980	371660	She's a Twitch streamer.
371660	373820	She's a player on Glass Cannon Network,
373820	376500	Starfinder podcast, Androids and Aliens.
376500	379460	She's the creator and GM of her own show,
379460	381140	The Lost Mountain Saga,
381140	384220	which is getting a season two coming soon.
384220	387540	It's Eleanor DiLorenzo, Lindsay.
387540	390380	Woo.
390380	392060	Thanks for the applause, guys.
392900	393740	Thanks.
395340	396180	Oh, there it is.
396180	397740	It was a little delay.
397740	400580	I request that the rest of us also get a echo out.
400580	403340	I'm so sorry.
403340	408340	Honestly, it's doing Eleanor DiLorenzo, it's very good.
408540	412460	No, but also Taylor Reeve, she's the worst of the game.
416460	418220	So today we're playing Delta Green.
418220	422420	I know that that is new to Eleanor here.
422420	423420	Eleanor, are you excited?
423420	425260	I am incredibly excited.
425260	426900	I've been wanting to play this game
426900	428380	ever since I heard about it the first time,
428380	431340	which was in, I don't know, doesn't matter,
431340	432940	but I have been wanting to play it
432940	435300	for a really, really long time.
435300	439340	And I'm so excited that you guys invited me to play
439340	442100	because it seems like you guys know what you're doing
442100	444060	or maybe that's just...
444060	445820	Oh, that's funny.
447220	449100	One of us at this table does.
449100	449940	It's good.
449940	451420	It's good to have your confidence.
451420	452260	It's me.
452740	453580	It's me.
455900	458740	So a quick rundown of Delta Green.
458740	459940	It's a role-playing game.
459940	461060	Okay, moving on.
461060	461900	So...
463500	465020	That's all you need to know.
466140	468860	Delta Green is a role-playing game about...
468860	469700	Oh, no.
471780	475500	How are you so good on all those other podcasts?
475500	477980	Listen, I've been drunk for the past five years.
477980	478940	I don't even know.
478940	483940	I'm doing dry January.
484060	486460	So this is the first time I'm playing Delta Green
486460	489180	without a beer in my hand in a long time.
489180	490020	Wow.
490020	490860	Congratulations.
490860	492820	It's also till 10 in the morning.
492820	494260	Yup, still would have done it.
494260	495900	Not a doubt in my mind.
495900	497620	It's Saturday.
497620	498820	Saturday's for the boys.
498820	500820	Saturday's for the boys.
502580	503980	So Delta Green is a role-playing game
503980	507420	about losing your mind or dying
507420	509980	in the process of trying to stop
509980	512140	the inevitable end of the world.
512140	513060	Oh, really?
513060	514740	I thought it was a romantic comedy.
514740	516740	Someone told me it was like a period piece
516740	519220	set in the 19th century Britain.
519220	521020	Yup, based on menstruation.
521020	522660	19th century Arkansas.
525020	526380	We are playing...
526380	529940	This game will be set in Mississippi and Arkansas tonight.
529940	531380	We're gonna kick it off in Mississippi
531380	533740	and then drive on up to Arkansas,
533740	536940	which Eleanor, you had to do some research
536940	538580	on...
538580	539820	What do you mean Mississippi?
539820	540660	I thought it was...
540660	541620	Oh God, I thought it was...
541620	545700	Wait, Mississippi the river or Mississippi the...
545700	547340	It's a city, right?
547340	548940	We're just gonna meet...
548940	550900	The characters are gonna meet in Shreveport,
550900	552060	which is in Mississippi,
552060	553780	but then you're gonna drive into Arkansas.
553780	556140	You don't need to know anything about Mississippi
556140	560420	other than what should she know about Mississippi?
560420	561420	How to spell it.
561420	564180	M-I-S-S-I-S-S-I-P-P-I.
564180	566060	I've been swimming in the Mississippi.
566100	568300	Wait, you swam in the Mississippi?
568300	570580	Maybe, or I took a piss in it.
570580	571860	Actually, that's a Swedish saying.
571860	573460	Take a piss in the Mississippi.
574540	576460	Actually, that's what my mom says all the time.
576460	578860	Like when something is irrelevant,
578860	580220	it's like fart in space,
580220	582100	but we also say it's a piss in Mississippi.
582100	584380	Oh, that's really good.
584380	586700	Yeah, P-I-S-S-I-S-S-I-P-P-I.
586700	589540	Piss is hippie.
589540	591260	Piss is hippie.
591260	592820	Has anyone ever thought of that?
592820	593820	Are we the first?
593820	595100	Oh my God.
595100	595940	Google it.
595940	597260	Google it before you tweet it.
597260	598420	Google it.
598420	601340	Okay, so just gonna give you a rundown.
601340	603100	So normally Delta Green is a game
603100	605940	with a lot of really fantastic scenarios
605940	607020	that are written for it
607020	609500	and published by Arc Dream Publishing,
609500	612300	which is a publishing company that publishes games
612300	614500	and scenarios for Delta Green.
614500	616180	However, instead of running
616180	620340	one of their extremely well-written and edited scenarios,
620340	622140	I'm gonna run you through something I wrote
622140	624260	that's just in a Google doc here.
624260	625100	Hell yeah.
634100	636140	All right, well.
636140	638740	I don't think Zach's killing children in this.
638740	639940	Based on his face.
639940	642580	Gonna run a different scenario.
642580	643500	Don't worry about it.
643500	646500	Kill as many children you want and puppies.
646500	647340	Monster.
648700	651100	That's what I was waiting to hear.
652100	656940	All right, so let's meet these characters, shall we?
656940	658220	Let's dive in here.
658220	662220	Let's go in alphabetical order of first name
662220	664380	of real life human.
664380	665700	Allie.
665700	666540	Hello.
666540	667380	Who is your character?
667380	668260	What's she look like?
668260	669420	What's her deal?
669420	670380	What's she been up to?
670380	671620	Give us the rundown.
671620	672540	I would love to.
672540	673380	Thank you.
673380	675060	I'm gonna pull up my summary of my character.
675060	676060	Thank you.
676060	678020	You guys all, I asked this group
678020	679740	to answer some questions that I'd sent
679900	682220	and then to write a little bit of backstory
682220	684580	about how they ran into the unnatural.
684580	689580	And all four of you did an absolutely stellar job.
689700	691980	Should we do season two together as a group
691980	693460	instead of the normal?
693460	696380	Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
696380	697220	Bye.
698660	700420	Okay, my name is.
700420	701860	Joke.
701860	705100	Oh no, not again.
706420	707620	Do you remember that?
707620	708900	I remember that it's a joke.
708940	710140	I just don't remember why.
710140	711460	You started it.
711460	713780	This happens to me all the time.
713780	716860	I'm just making so many jokes all the time.
716860	717940	All right, here we go.
717940	720460	My name is Rusty Hooch.
721620	723180	I am a scientist.
723180	726580	Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
726580	727980	I am a scientist.
729780	731220	I didn't choose my name.
731220	732340	My parents did.
732340	733260	They chose your last name?
733260	734100	Yeah, totally.
734100	734940	So you're Dr. Hooch?
734940	735780	I'm Dr. Hooch.
735780	736620	Rad.
736620	737460	Yeah.
737460	738300	The Hooch.
738540	739980	They call me Rusty.
739980	741900	What kind of science do you do?
741900	744700	Mostly like potions and stuff.
744700	746900	Ha ha ha ha ha.
746900	749180	Well, I did just win a Nobel Prize
749180	750660	for curing mad cow disease.
750660	751620	Congratulations.
751620	752820	Did you do it with potions?
752820	755300	I did it with potions.
755300	759180	Ha ha ha ha ha ha.
759180	761460	I'm hoping to cure tinnitus next.
761460	762300	Okay, yes.
762300	765700	And also the emotion sadness
765700	767740	because I think it's unnecessary.
767780	769700	Unnecessary emotion sadness.
769700	771220	Unnecessary negative emotion,
771220	774260	which I will be curing with potions.
774260	775180	I love this so much.
775180	776900	How old is she?
776900	777980	47.
777980	779380	47 going on 53.
779380	781220	Going on 53.
781220	785060	A Nobel Prize winner at 47
785060	786740	we're amongst a genius.
786740	788340	In the presence of greatness.
788340	791820	I'm also very hot.
791820	792660	Yeah.
792660	793500	Okay.
793500	794340	I love you so much.
794340	795180	Just let that be known.
795180	796500	What's your charisma score?
797500	798340	Nine.
798340	801660	Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
801660	803220	That's like the lowest charisma
803220	804580	you can have to start.
805780	806620	Good.
806620	808620	Because you said that
808620	810780	your character leans into like.
810780	812180	Yeah, I'm kind of mean.
812180	814140	People see me as kind of
814140	815660	an obsessive relentless bitch,
815660	816620	but I would never have been able
816620	817900	to cure mad cow disease
817900	819700	if I wasn't a relentless bitch.
819700	821020	What's your haircut?
821020	823460	Short, blonde.
823460	824300	Bangs.
824300	825580	Bangs.
825620	826700	I don't know where I got that.
826700	827620	Also, I'm hot.
827620	828940	Don't forget.
828940	831220	And what are you typically wearing?
831220	833660	Normally black trench coat.
834660	837020	Probably some pearl earrings.
837020	839140	Whatever your hot people wear
839140	840260	is what I'm normally wearing.
840260	841100	My God.
841100	842460	I'm sensing a lot of Robin
842460	844500	Robin Wright from House of Cards.
844500	846100	Like that sort of vibe.
846100	847620	Yes.
847620	848500	Yeah.
848500	849980	But hotter.
849980	850820	But hotter.
850820	851660	Oh wow.
851660	853820	But hotter and Nobel Prize winner.
853820	854660	I love it.
854660	855500	Exactly.
856260	857380	Humble.
857380	858220	And humble.
861060	861900	All right.
861900	862740	Give me a rundown.
862740	863980	What was your experience like
863980	865940	the first time you saw something unnatural?
865940	867460	Let me tell you about it.
867460	870420	So I was flying my DA40 home.
870420	871460	I have a DA40.
871460	872300	A small plane.
872300	873140	Of course.
873140	873980	The DA40.
873980	874820	Yeah, I know.
874820	875660	I looked it up.
875660	876500	Yeah, so I own one
876500	878700	and I know a lot about it
878700	880740	and I know how to fly it.
880740	882860	So I was flying it home
882860	884940	to my secret cabin in the woods
884940	887500	that none of my children or ex-wives know about
887500	889100	because I like my privacy.
889100	889940	Smart.
889940	893100	So one night I was flying my Diamond DA40 home
893100	897940	and I saw a gigantic explosion come from the woods
897940	899020	but I didn't hear it.
899020	901140	It was completely silent.
901140	904860	It was blue and wet looking.
904860	905700	Ew.
908700	909700	Thank you for that.
909700	911660	Silent and wet and blue.
911660	912900	Silent and wet.
912900	915180	So I landed my plane nearby,
915180	919700	ran down the road to where I thought I was close to it,
919700	922860	hiding because I was afraid of who might be back there.
922860	926460	And then five minutes later I saw six black escalates
926460	927940	drive past on the road.
927940	929220	I was hiding in a bush.
929220	931380	Also my plane was covered by a...
931380	933660	No need to get too deep into the weeds.
933660	934620	My plane was hidden.
934620	936420	Into the weeds that are covering your plane.
936420	938540	And they couldn't see it.
938540	940500	Anyway, then I ran to the side of the explosion
940500	941620	and there was nothing.
941620	942540	I couldn't see anything.
943020	943860	Nothing was different.
943860	946100	Not a leaf turned.
946100	947340	Not a branch broken.
947340	948860	Not a stone unturned.
948860	950900	Not a stone turned.
950900	954340	Ever since then, whenever I'm flying my Diamond DA40 home,
954340	955420	that I know how to fly.
955420	956260	Brag.
957260	959340	A brag about a fictional character.
959340	961700	So I've just been seeing a lot of these silent explosions
961700	965020	but I can't seem to get close enough to see what's going on.
965020	966420	How many X's do you have?
967620	968700	Hard to say.
968700	969580	Science is easy.
969580	970540	Counting is hard.
970540	971740	Three, at least three.
971780	974300	Well, some marriages were like, you know,
975700	976860	Vegas marriages.
976860	977700	Do those count?
977700	978860	Like that's kind of a half marriage.
978860	980100	Legally, they do, yeah.
980100	983580	So your most recent one is...
983580	984420	Oh, Jillian.
984420	985780	Yes, Jillian.
985780	990300	Jillian didn't sign a prenup before we got married.
990300	991580	That's my bad.
991580	992420	Smart lady.
992420	993540	You would think I would have learned my lesson.
993540	996380	So she's receiving quite a bit of alimony from me right now,
996380	997660	unfortunately.
997660	1000140	But I'm rich, so it's fine.
1000180	1003260	Rich and hot, rich and hot, humble and fucking smart.
1003260	1004860	Genius.
1004860	1006340	Ally, when you play a role playing game,
1006340	1009020	you're supposed to create a character
1009020	1011100	that is different than yourself
1011100	1013860	to try to embody someone else.
1013860	1016260	Yeah, because I actually am a pilot in real life.
1016260	1017100	Really?
1017100	1017940	And I have a diamond DA40.
1017940	1019340	I thought you were gonna say pile of garbage.
1019340	1021180	I don't know why.
1021180	1022980	I'm a pile of garbage.
1022980	1024380	Yes, Eleanor, I am a pilot.
1024380	1026100	No, stop lying to Eleanor.
1027260	1028940	I'm so disappointed now.
1030740	1033020	I was like, oh, I could hire her as my pilot
1033020	1035940	when I become rich, famous, noble, priceless.
1035940	1037300	Okay, no, I'll learn.
1037300	1038140	I'll learn.
1038140	1039220	Yes, please.
1039220	1040300	Tell me about Belvedere.
1040300	1044020	Oh, so Jillian and I share custody of a...
1045980	1047140	Dog.
1047140	1049900	Hold on, no, I have to actually look up at the dog.
1049900	1051900	Saint Bernard.
1051900	1054700	My ex-wife Jillian and I share custody of a Saint Bernard.
1054700	1056220	His name is Belvedere.
1056220	1057340	I love him very much.
1057340	1059140	I have him on the weekends.
1059140	1061340	We take a lot of hikes, but Jillian has him
1061340	1062180	during the week.
1062180	1063460	It's Monday night.
1063460	1067140	You're getting ready to go drop off Belvedere at Jillian's.
1067140	1069900	This is the last moment that you get to spend
1069900	1072300	with your beloved Saint Bernard
1072300	1075780	before he goes and spends the week with Jillian
1075780	1079500	and her money that you pay her.
1079500	1080340	My money.
1083420	1087460	All of a sudden you hear cars, more than one,
1087500	1088860	they're pulling up outside.
1089900	1092740	You look out the window, you see the string
1092740	1097220	of those black SUVs, and they are lining your driveway,
1097220	1100820	but only one guy is walking up to the door and he knocks.
1102700	1105740	He keeps knocking.
1106620	1108620	Boom, boom, boom, boom.
1110620	1111460	Yes!
1112700	1113540	I mean, you couldn't help yourself.
1113540	1114380	I just helped yourself.
1114380	1116220	He couldn't help yourself.
1116220	1117420	Maybe I could.
1118340	1119180	Sound person.
1122620	1124260	Are you a fully artist?
1124260	1125420	I don't know what that means.
1125420	1127900	We have to get through all of these.
1129700	1132340	This whole episode is just Allie's introduction.
1134220	1138300	Allie, banging now on your door.
1138300	1139220	I don't answer.
1139220	1140060	Banging.
1141140	1142700	Louder and louder.
1142700	1143940	Is Belvedere upset?
1147420	1150660	Okay, I answered the door very reluctantly,
1150660	1153540	and I don't have one of those locks on the top of the door,
1153540	1155500	the chain locks, and I don't undo that.
1155500	1157380	Dr. Rusty Hooch?
1157380	1159180	Yes, can I see some identification, please?
1159180	1160460	What are you doing at my house?
1160460	1161460	Yeah, no problem.
1161460	1165380	He holds up his hand as if he's holding a badge
1165380	1166220	of some sort.
1166220	1168420	There's literally nothing in his hand.
1168420	1171540	And he says, you don't really need to know who I am.
1171540	1174420	We've been following you, and we understand
1174420	1176860	that you've been noticing some situations
1177180	1179420	that have been happening out in the woods.
1179420	1181940	I think due to some of your expertise,
1181940	1183180	we're gonna need your help.
1183180	1184420	I don't know what you're talking about.
1184420	1185580	I don't go in the woods.
1185580	1186700	I live in the city.
1186700	1188860	Dr. Hooch.
1188860	1192340	And he calls out your plane's number,
1192340	1194260	like your ID number.
1194260	1195180	Look around you.
1196260	1197860	What am I supposed to be seeing right now?
1197860	1200020	Well, I suppose it's your choice.
1200900	1203700	Do you see all those SPVs down there?
1203700	1204540	Yes.
1204540	1206500	You can come with us.
1206500	1207980	Maybe you'll learn something.
1209660	1210980	All right, well, I have to take Belvedere
1210980	1212460	to Jillian's house, my ex-wife,
1212460	1213900	because she has them during the week.
1213900	1216620	So I'll come with you, but I gotta take my dog first.
1216620	1218740	Any chance that I can get you to leave your dog here
1218740	1219580	until we're done?
1219580	1220460	It won't take too long.
1220460	1221460	It's a legal issue.
1221460	1223420	I'll really get in a lot of trouble from Jillian
1223420	1226460	if I don't have him there by 10 p.m. on Monday night.
1226460	1228380	We're gonna have you back by 10.
1228380	1229340	Oh, all right, all right.
1229340	1231380	As long as we can get Belvedere to Jillian, fine.
1231380	1232700	I'll go with you.
1232700	1234340	Okay, so you guys head out.
1234380	1236180	You get into an SUV.
1236180	1239220	It's actually empty, this one, except for a driver,
1239220	1243380	and this unidentified man gets into the car with you,
1243380	1246100	and he begins asking you about how many times
1246100	1249900	you've seen these silent blue explosions.
1250820	1252900	You guys pull up to a small camp in the woods
1252900	1256780	that's being run out of the back of a big truck.
1256780	1259620	So there's just this one covered truck
1259620	1262900	with a bunch of lab equipment inside of it,
1262900	1265540	computers going, scientists running around
1265540	1266780	talking to each other.
1266780	1269020	There's a bunch of military-looking guys
1269020	1273660	who are not wearing camo or any sort of military gear.
1273660	1277060	One of them approaches you with a, it's like a jar.
1277060	1278020	It's not a mason jar.
1278020	1279740	It's far more scientific.
1279740	1282460	It seems to be sealed on both sides.
1282460	1287460	It looks like a high-tech version of the bank teller thing
1287620	1289420	that you put in the tube, right?
1289420	1294220	And it is filled with this like bioluminescent blue liquid.
1294220	1297900	We're hoping that you can reverse engineer this.
1297900	1299540	I'm gonna need to know some more information
1299540	1301180	before I do anything for y'all.
1301180	1302420	Do you know who I am?
1302420	1305500	I just won a Nobel Prize for inventing mad cow disease.
1305500	1307340	I'm gonna need some context.
1307340	1308180	It's not gonna hooch.
1308180	1309940	We know exactly who you are.
1309940	1312900	Let's show her some context.
1312900	1317580	And a couple of the military guys go over to one of the SUVs
1317580	1321180	and pull out a guy who is bound.
1321180	1324340	He's wearing just like the raddest old clothes
1324340	1325660	you've ever seen.
1325660	1328020	Looks like he hasn't showered in months.
1328020	1329820	Filthy, filthy dude.
1329820	1331820	He's just kinda like dazed.
1331820	1333140	Looks like he's been drugged.
1333140	1335420	They kinda pull him out into the middle
1335420	1338100	of this clearing in the woods.
1338100	1339900	All right, come with me, come with me.
1339900	1341300	He walks you over to this guy
1341300	1343780	who's just kinda like put down on his knees,
1343780	1347180	hands tied behind his back, feet are bound.
1347700	1351300	And he opens up this container and it, oh, sorry, Taylor,
1351300	1353060	do you wanna do the opening of the container?
1353060	1354380	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1354380	1355220	Psst.
1359820	1360780	Got it in one.
1360780	1361620	Nailed it.
1364780	1369780	He puts a finger in this like bioluminescent goop
1370060	1373340	and it kind of sticks to him like paint.
1373340	1377980	And then he draws a symbol on this bound man's forehead
1377980	1382220	and it kind of looks like waves that have teeth,
1382220	1383940	this weird symbol.
1383940	1386420	And then he closes the container.
1386420	1387660	Taylor?
1387660	1388780	Psst.
1388780	1390340	Pfft.
1390340	1391180	God.
1393460	1394300	It's art.
1395180	1396860	And he starts counting down.
1398220	1401900	39, 37.
1401940	1404020	And he says, we're gonna wanna get away.
1404020	1408620	42, 38, 35.
1408620	1411660	And you guys are walking and you see that other people
1411660	1414260	are walking extremely quickly.
1414260	1416180	And he is not, he's chilling.
1416180	1418140	He kinda turns back.
1418140	1420820	Are you ready to see the craziest thing you've ever seen?
1420820	1422980	I highly doubt this is gonna be the craziest thing
1422980	1423820	I've ever seen.
1423820	1428420	I've seen my dog take a giant shit in my Diamond DA40.
1429300	1430580	In it.
1430580	1434500	A bioluminescent explosion begins to pour out
1434500	1438940	of the bound dude's face and fill the ground around you.
1438940	1441780	And it begins to create a massive dome
1441780	1443300	that is engulfing this guy
1443300	1446140	and then slowly expands and takes over.
1446140	1448500	And as it's taking over, the guy looks at you next to you
1448500	1450580	and he's like, it would be all right.
1451900	1453620	This blue hits your face.
1453620	1457940	Your hair blows back and suddenly you see inside
1457940	1462340	and you are standing in seemingly the middle of the ocean.
1462340	1465380	You see all of this wildlife around you.
1465380	1468740	Fish, schools of fish swimming together.
1468740	1471300	Sharks, part of a whale at the dome
1471300	1472780	on the far side away from you.
1472780	1475340	And there's coral everywhere and it's dark
1475340	1477900	and it's blue and it's glowing.
1477900	1482900	And then suddenly it just collapses in on itself.
1483860	1488860	The only change is that this bound dude is gone.
1490740	1492100	What the fuck?
1495620	1496780	Shit.
1496780	1499460	Well, so first I checked my pocket mirror
1499460	1502380	to check my hair since it got messed up.
1502380	1504020	So I fixed my hair first.
1506460	1508100	As you're staring at yourself,
1508100	1512660	you see that your lips and your eyes,
1512660	1515860	your nostrils, your eyebrows,
1515860	1520380	everything on your face is fucking trembling.
1520380	1524380	You've never seen yourself look this shook.
1526740	1528700	I'm going to sue the shit out of you motherfuckers.
1528700	1529860	What did you just do to me?
1529860	1532100	You get a phone call from Jillian.
1532100	1534660	I walk up into the woods to take this call.
1534660	1537860	And that is Dr. Rusty Hooch.
1537860	1539220	Oh my God.
1539220	1540260	Holy shit.
1540260	1542100	Holy shit.
1542100	1542940	Radical, radical, radical.
1542940	1545540	It's now a good time to say that I'm afraid of sharks.
1547060	1548540	In real life or the character?
1548540	1549380	In real life.
1549380	1550220	Oh, for real?
1550220	1552500	In the character, yeah.
1552500	1554740	Okay, Ellie.
1554740	1555580	Oh my God.
1555580	1556780	You're up.
1556780	1558420	Give me a rundown.
1558420	1560580	Dr. Olivia Miller.
1560580	1563700	I based this off of the Swedish crime dramas
1563700	1566660	because every protagonist in Swedish crime dramas
1566660	1568620	is the exact same dude.
1568620	1571260	But in this case, I just made it a female.
1571260	1575620	Early fifties, incredibly tired woman.
1575620	1578900	Like everything about her is so freaking over it.
1578900	1580980	Like mentally tired, physically tired.
1580980	1583820	She has two daughters.
1583820	1585020	One of them won't speak to her
1585020	1587460	because she's a 15 year old little bitch.
1587460	1591500	And the other one is off to college,
1591500	1593020	but it's like teen daughters.
1593020	1595820	We all know, we all know what they're like.
1595820	1600820	She was recently left by her husband for a younger model.
1601580	1605020	And she's just so freaking tired.
1605020	1606380	You know, she's a workaholic.
1606380	1607220	She's a surgeon.
1607220	1608700	She's a very brilliant surgeon.
1608700	1611820	She's been doing that for a long time
1611820	1614580	and people call her for the tough cases.
1614580	1618980	But since everything else in her life sort of fell apart,
1618980	1622220	she's been really burying herself in work.
1622220	1624340	Takes on extra hours.
1624340	1627300	She's on call almost all the time.
1627300	1630660	And she's gained a couple of extra pounds
1630660	1632180	because she's not taking care of herself.
1632180	1634260	She picked up smoking because it was the only thing
1634260	1636420	that sort of calmed her nerves.
1636420	1638980	Even though she knows it's wrong, she's a doctor.
1638980	1641500	Lots of fast food, very little exercise.
1641500	1646220	And the idea I had in my head for her was Bill Murray
1646220	1649060	because of this constant through the signs, sad face,
1649060	1650940	but like a female version.
1651940	1653300	It's amazing.
1653300	1656260	I'm picturing Kate Winslet in mayor of East town.
1656260	1657580	I don't know if you saw that.
1657580	1660860	Yeah, that's very exactly that type of like,
1660860	1663340	because that's basically every crime drama
1663340	1666780	of like this resigned brilliant detective
1666780	1670020	just being so freaking like tired of everything.
1670020	1673220	But then like, well, I've seen worse or have I, you know.
1673220	1674900	Are there any happy detectives?
1674900	1675740	I don't think so.
1675740	1678180	I don't think you can be happy and be a detective,
1678180	1680460	but we shall see maybe in this game.
1680500	1682300	Maybe she'll find joy.
1682300	1686020	Yes, I think in this game, we'll find joy.
1686020	1686860	Yeah, psych.
1686860	1688580	That's true.
1688580	1689540	God, that show is great.
1689540	1694140	Eleanor, you've created like the opposite character from Ally.
1696260	1700100	The two doctors, Dr. Rusty Hooch and Dr. Olivia Miller,
1700100	1704340	both in name and juxtaposition could not be further
1704340	1705180	from each other.
1705180	1709380	Fun thing though, my charisma is 13, so I'm charming,
1709420	1710540	which I didn't realize.
1712540	1714780	But she's also started sleeping with her neighbor
1714780	1717460	because that's like the one, also another takeaway.
1717460	1720700	And so her neighbor kind of wants something more to happen,
1720700	1722180	but she's just like, no, no,
1722180	1726060	this is a very transactional thing going on.
1726060	1729380	But it's one of her bonds because they sort of drink whiskey
1729380	1732620	and play chess together or something boring.
1733780	1736940	I was about to say that sounds fun.
1736940	1738820	Yeah, I wrote for her tagline,
1739260	1742820	she's technically a lovely woman in need of a hug
1742820	1744380	and hopefully other things.
1746060	1748660	What was it, the occult or the unnatural or whatever?
1748660	1750100	The unnatural.
1750100	1751740	Yeah, when you asked that question,
1751740	1753460	I was just like, wait, what?
1753460	1755940	Because I thought for some reason thought this was like,
1755940	1757980	I've been trying to not read up on Delta Green
1757980	1761540	because I love going into something spoiler free.
1761540	1764740	And then I'm like, so there is an element of unnatural
1764740	1766660	because people have told me it's terrifying,
1766660	1770620	but I wasn't sure if it was like murder mystery terrifying
1770620	1773660	or if it's like, you know, unnatural, but now I know.
1773660	1774660	And so-
1774660	1776460	Little column A, little column B.
1776460	1779540	I envisioned her to say she's a very good surgeon.
1779540	1783460	She was called in for this weird case,
1783460	1788060	an autopsy of a corpse and what she found out
1788060	1789500	as she was doing it,
1789500	1794060	she had to extract this thing out of the body,
1794060	1798380	this black gooey blob of fat, basically.
1798380	1800620	And as she was picking it up really carefully,
1800620	1803540	it started like moving in a way
1803540	1805180	that suggested it's still alive.
1806260	1809300	And then she had to move it into a separate jar
1809300	1812620	and some people in black suits just took it away.
1812620	1815100	No more questions needed, so to speak.
1815100	1817700	Awesome, so awesome.
1817700	1820380	Dr. Olivia Miller, it's a school night.
1820380	1824580	And strangely, your 15-year-old
1824580	1828580	has requested a movie night with her mom.
1828580	1830660	This is very out of the ordinary.
1831620	1832460	How do you react?
1832460	1834220	What movie do you suggest?
1834220	1837100	Oh, I've heard that the latest
1837100	1838900	Downton Abbey movie just came out.
1839740	1840900	Would you like to watch that?
1840900	1845100	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, let's do that.
1845100	1848140	Or we can watch a Star War.
1850380	1855380	Okay, no, the Downton Abbey sounds nice, actually.
1856620	1860180	Just something calming would be good.
1861100	1862060	I'm sorry.
1862060	1863980	Are you okay, honey?
1863980	1865060	Is everything all right?
1865060	1865900	It's fine.
1865900	1870900	It's just, can we talk for a second?
1871660	1872500	Of course.
1873820	1875020	Let me just...
1875020	1877060	Your front door starts rattling
1877060	1879060	and someone is just boom, boom, boom, boom.
1879060	1881540	Jesus, honey, please, just sit down.
1881540	1882500	I'll get you a...
1883780	1886540	Dr. Miller, Dr. Miller!
1886540	1888820	Fucking Christ, what is it?
1888820	1890260	And she walks over to the door.
1890260	1892100	If you peek your head through the window
1892100	1893660	or see through the peephole,
1893660	1896780	you see that the team of those men
1896780	1901060	who took away the jar with that fatty tissue
1901060	1903700	that seemed to be alive in it last time,
1903700	1906380	they are here at your home
1906380	1911380	and they have in custody a woman
1911700	1915580	who is shaking violently and screaming,
1915580	1917580	please, just fucking kill me!
1917580	1919900	Just fucking kill me!
1919900	1924380	All right, she quickly opens the door because-
1924380	1925220	They barge in.
1925220	1927380	They just boom, barge in, take over.
1927380	1930460	The men slam this woman on your kitchen table
1930460	1932940	and this woman is just like, please, please, kill me!
1932940	1934380	Doctor, doctor, we need you to...
1934420	1936900	Sorry, she's not dead yet, but we have to remove it.
1936900	1937820	You have to remove it.
1937820	1939340	Do you have any equipment here?
1939340	1940180	Of course.
1940180	1942740	And immediately she goes into professional mode
1942740	1945220	and takes out her medical equipment
1945220	1947940	and starts ordering everyone around like,
1947940	1951020	you, get me a towel, you there, start heating up,
1951020	1954140	like start disinfecting my tools and that she-
1954140	1956380	Yeah, somebody's got the stove going,
1956380	1958940	you got towels coming in, we got everything you need.
1958940	1961300	They've knocked off your bar cart.
1961300	1963860	They've like shoved everything off the top of the bar cart
1964220	1966700	and put it next to the table to put all the supplies on it.
1966700	1970500	And she looks at her daughter though, like, Laura, please,
1970500	1971340	I need you to-
1971340	1972780	What is happening?
1972780	1974460	Honey, you need to go to your room right now.
1974460	1976060	We need to go to your room and you stay there
1976060	1977020	and I'll find you soon.
1977020	1978860	Okay, and you're right back to business
1978860	1981580	and you're looking over the situation.
1981580	1983900	You see on this woman's neck,
1983900	1985540	there's just this kind of like,
1988340	1993340	pulsating sack of fat and fluid.
1994620	1995460	Meow.
1996740	2001380	She tries to do like an incision or like tries to-
2001380	2003820	Try and roll surgery for me.
2003820	2006260	Ooh, my first roll.
2006260	2010140	You said, okay.
2011060	2013900	Oh, I don't know, that's probably a fail.
2013900	2018900	It's 83 and I think I did put, oh no.
2019140	2019980	Yeah, that's a fail.
2019980	2022220	I only have 15 surgery, fuck.
2022220	2026060	As you cut it open, this fatty tissue begins to pour out
2026060	2028900	like you've seen it kind of jiggle in your hand earlier.
2028900	2030140	It's moving on its own.
2030140	2031300	It busts out.
2031300	2033000	You've accidentally cut it.
2033000	2034100	Your hand has slipped.
2034100	2036380	You didn't just cut through the skin.
2036380	2038920	You actually cut into the tissue itself.
2038920	2042700	The thing begins to unfold and twist itself inside out
2042700	2047700	as it turns to dust and this dust flies up into the nose
2048080	2050700	of one of these black-suited agents
2050740	2053460	and immediately one of the other agents goes,
2053460	2057220	oh, fucking Jason, pulls his gun and fires it
2057220	2058860	into the back of this guy's head.
2058860	2061660	As he hits the ground in your kitchen,
2061660	2064940	he fires three more times shattering the tile
2064940	2066820	underneath this guy's head.
2066820	2068880	You just had the kitchen redone.
2070000	2072660	You look over and at the end of the hallway,
2072660	2077660	you see your 15-year-old daughter is just staring in shock
2078660	2080480	from behind her door.
2080700	2085700	That's Dr. Olivia Miller.
2086020	2087540	Jesus Christ.
2087540	2091900	Hey, Ellie, Eleanor, welcome to Delta Green.
2091900	2095580	Yeah, oh my God.
2095580	2096420	Oh my God.
2096420	2097820	Well, cool.
2097820	2098660	Cool, cool, cool.
2102300	2104900	Next up, it's Lindsay.
2104900	2105740	Alphabetically.
2105740	2106560	Lindsay.
2106560	2107400	Hello.
2107400	2110040	Tell me about, what is this character's name?
2111180	2114380	Doreen Maureen, if you will.
2114380	2115980	Really just Doreen and then anything
2115980	2117700	that rhymes with Doreen.
2117700	2118600	Oh, anything.
2120140	2121380	If you go on for too long,
2121380	2123500	are we gonna call you Doreen Boring?
2123500	2124700	Yes, yes.
2124700	2126980	Boom, if you know a lot about the setting,
2126980	2128740	we'll call you Doreen Loring.
2128740	2129580	Oh my God.
2129580	2134120	When you go swimming, we call you Doreen Chlorine.
2137460	2138780	Genius name.
2138780	2140180	Doreen's pretty simple.
2141620	2146620	She's, just imagine like simple, super down to earth.
2146620	2150100	She's a fed agent, she's 45
2150100	2152780	and she doesn't really have a whole lot of friends.
2152780	2154740	She has a very, very small group of friends
2154740	2157900	and then it's just like no family anywhere close.
2157900	2162900	It's just me and my whippet, which is my-
2163460	2165260	Your drug of choice.
2165260	2166100	Gotcha, boom.
2167020	2168300	Y'all ever done nitrous?
2168300	2173100	It's both that and it is a type of dog.
2173100	2176100	It's a, imagine a teeny tiny gray hound.
2176100	2178900	A little scared, a little shaky, really thin.
2178900	2180300	That's my dog.
2180300	2183340	She's pretty lonely, but likes it that way.
2183340	2184940	So she's pretty run down.
2184940	2186700	She's got like box dyed hair.
2186700	2189820	It's grown out quite a bit since last time she's dying.
2189820	2192660	So she's got some dark gray roots coming in.
2192660	2194220	She's got some sunken eyes
2194220	2197380	and she just wears like super baggy clothes and-
2197420	2199580	Baggy clothes that I believe you wrote.
2201980	2203220	Baggy clothes like she's ready
2203220	2204980	to shoplift a bag of marshmallows.
2207820	2210580	That's how I'm referring to all baggy clothes from now on.
2210580	2213980	Like she's ready to shoplift a bag of marshmallows.
2213980	2214820	She's ready.
2217020	2221340	Yeah, so she's more fun on the page than in person.
2221340	2222700	Her favorite-
2222700	2225260	She's more fun on the page than in person.
2225260	2228100	A perfect character for a role-playing game.
2231100	2233460	Yeah, she's always just like got pockets full
2233460	2235980	of like the wrapping of hard candy.
2235980	2239660	I got a pocket full of hard candy, oh my God.
2239660	2240500	I'm so tired.
2240500	2242220	When you leaned into the mic, Allie,
2242220	2244420	I expected you to join me.
2244420	2245700	No, I'm exhausted.
2247260	2248900	So disappointed.
2248900	2249860	God damn it.
2249860	2251620	And then, yeah, it's either that
2251620	2254340	or just some loose Mentos in there all the time.
2254380	2255700	She just got trash in her car.
2255700	2257500	I got a pocket full of loose Mentos.
2259580	2261180	I'm not even gonna look at you.
2262900	2265260	I tried to join, but then I just, I just couldn't.
2265260	2266100	I'm sorry.
2266940	2270300	She spends a lot of her extra time just like scrolling
2270300	2273540	on Pinterest on her iPad and like petting her with it.
2273540	2274940	Jesus Christ.
2274940	2277260	Honestly, that's all you needed to say
2277260	2280380	to get a full idea of who this woman is.
2280380	2281380	I know this woman.
2281380	2282220	I know this woman.
2282220	2283540	She just scrolls Pinterest on her iPad.
2284420	2287420	I know who this is based off of someone I know.
2287420	2288260	Your mom?
2288260	2289100	Is it your mom?
2289100	2289940	It's based off of my mom.
2289940	2292420	I was gonna say, it sounds like I was doing a burn,
2292420	2294500	but I think it's probably, she's just literally my mom.
2294500	2295340	Is it your fucking mom?
2295340	2297180	He's just your fucking mom.
2298540	2301940	She religiously listens to this podcast, you know.
2304540	2305820	I think she would be appalled.
2305820	2306660	She would.
2306660	2307580	She absolutely would.
2307580	2309060	Mom, if you're listening to this,
2309060	2311380	only portions of this are based off of your mom.
2311380	2312580	Not for moms.
2313340	2314860	Except for Eleanor.
2314860	2316100	She can listen.
2316100	2317540	That mom can listen.
2317540	2318380	Eleanor, you're allowed to listen.
2318380	2319540	Otherwise, not for moms.
2321220	2324260	I think we have a lot of mom listeners, actually.
2324260	2326940	I'm so sorry I discriminated against the mom community.
2326940	2327780	I didn't mean it.
2327780	2330980	Can you, I mean, if you're at home all day
2330980	2334540	caring for your child, what better to listen to than-
2334540	2336020	Horror comedy.
2336020	2336900	Oh, for sure.
2336900	2339780	On behalf of all moms, I am incredibly offended,
2339780	2341340	but also a little aroused.
2343580	2345340	I think that's a green light.
2350340	2352180	All right, I think we know who this woman is
2352180	2354060	just based off that comment alone,
2354060	2359060	so let's dive into her experience with the unnatural.
2359820	2361460	All right, her experience,
2361460	2364220	it's caused a lot of trauma for Doreen.
2364220	2366700	I was called in on a murder case.
2366700	2368340	I had been working on this case for a while,
2368340	2370180	and I, oh, and do I need to read it in my case?
2370180	2372300	Hey, I don't know if you're gonna do a fresh person, maybe.
2372860	2373700	One night.
2373700	2374540	There we go.
2374540	2376260	I get this call one night,
2376260	2379140	and it's from an unknown number.
2379140	2380780	So I answer the phone,
2380780	2382380	and somebody's telling me to meet them
2382380	2385020	at a location I'm unaware of.
2385020	2387000	I didn't know this place existed.
2387000	2388500	I decide it's a good idea
2388500	2390100	since this case has been going for a while
2390100	2392740	and I'm really tired of it, ready to end this case.
2392740	2394780	So I show up at this house.
2394780	2395860	I open the front door
2395860	2398100	because the door's just kind of leaning open a little bit.
2398100	2399620	When I walk in,
2399620	2402820	everything is just covered in black rubber,
2402820	2404460	the walls, the ceilings.
2404460	2407380	You can see that there are things in this house,
2407380	2409940	but they're all just covered in this black rubber.
2411540	2413100	Sorry, I got...
2413100	2413940	Sorry.
2413940	2414760	You spooked yourself?
2414760	2415600	I scared myself.
2415600	2416440	Oh, my God.
2416440	2417260	No, I scared.
2417260	2418100	Are you really scared of rubber?
2418100	2419620	It was Ramona.
2419620	2420460	It was Ramona.
2420460	2421660	Okay, I'm sorry.
2421660	2422820	I could smell the rubber.
2422820	2424180	I can smell it.
2425020	2430020	It reminded me of the time I forgot to use a rubber.
2433580	2436100	Why do all my jokes keep going back to condoms?
2436100	2438500	Condoms and condoms.
2438500	2440220	I gave penis on the brain.
2441740	2442780	Penis on the brain.
2442780	2444620	Penis, penis on the brain.
2444620	2446660	No one wanted to keep going on that.
2448660	2449500	I danced.
2451100	2452500	All right.
2452540	2453820	Everything inside of this house
2453820	2455180	is just lined in this rubber,
2455180	2457900	and it's thick, and it's weird, and it's soft,
2457900	2460080	and it's making me really uneasy.
2460080	2461200	So a dick.
2464300	2465500	As I'm walking through this house,
2465500	2467860	I start to hear a little bit of laughter,
2468700	2473700	and it's really creepy, really uneasy.
2474520	2475700	It's somewhere in the house.
2475700	2476620	I don't know where it is,
2476620	2478180	but it's somewhere in this house.
2478180	2480340	I gotta find who's laughing at me.
2483500	2484860	The laughter gets stronger.
2486060	2488180	So I pull out my gun,
2488180	2489980	and I start walking around gun first,
2489980	2493380	and I'm looking for where this noise is coming from,
2493380	2496500	and all of a sudden I see something not covered
2496500	2499620	in this black rubber, and it's this big old mirror,
2499620	2501660	and it looks really old, antique,
2501660	2503880	and it's all rusty on the edges.
2503880	2506460	And as I'm looking into this mirror,
2506460	2509560	I see these two little kids,
2509560	2511740	and they're staring right back at me,
2511820	2513100	and they're just covered in blood
2513100	2515540	like someone's just been beaten up.
2515540	2516380	I'm sorry.
2518580	2521460	Like someone's just been beaten up.
2521460	2523280	You immediately recoiled.
2527500	2528460	Covered in blood.
2528460	2529660	Covered in blood.
2529660	2531220	Just covered from head to toe.
2531220	2533820	I turn to see what they're doing.
2533820	2535060	They're standing behind me a little bit.
2535060	2537060	I turn, and they're not there.
2537060	2538980	So I turn back, I look at the mirror,
2538980	2540420	and they start melting.
2540420	2542060	They're melting into this metallic,
2542060	2544440	silver, metal-looking lava.
2545340	2546600	Now they're really in the room with me,
2546600	2547940	but they're just two puddles of lava,
2547940	2551220	and they start coming right at me, rolling towards me.
2551220	2554980	And as I get closer, I start losing my bearings,
2554980	2557500	and so I start running out of the building,
2557500	2559040	only to find when I get outside
2559040	2563380	that there are a bunch of agents in black cars and suits
2563380	2564900	pointing their gun at me.
2564900	2565860	I didn't know what to do.
2565860	2568820	I got called here by someone who I don't know,
2568820	2572260	so I just start running away in a zigzag pattern,
2572260	2573860	and I'd never seen them since.
2575660	2578060	That was the end of my story, though, so.
2578060	2578900	Dope story.
2578900	2580300	Terrifying.
2580300	2581140	Thanks.
2581140	2582500	The next time we see Doreen Marine,
2583780	2585100	that'd be hard,
2585100	2587940	she is on the stand in a courtroom.
2587940	2591700	It's a bright, sunny day, the sun rays are coming in
2591700	2594180	through the windows, across one side,
2594180	2596620	onto half of the people watching.
2596620	2599340	The lawyer in a smart suit is asking questions
2599340	2602660	about what happened in that house.
2602660	2606240	You can see one of those people in the black suits
2606240	2608680	that were outside, the woman who was up front.
2609580	2613020	She's sitting in the back row, and she's just staring.
2614580	2616260	The lawyer continues.
2616260	2620100	So, how long were you inside the house?
2620100	2620940	Oh, I don't know.
2620940	2623820	It couldn't have been longer than maybe 10 minutes.
2623820	2626020	And did you?
2626260	2629380	She laughs and rolls her eyes at the jury.
2629380	2633740	See anything like what the defendant described?
2633740	2634580	Objection!
2634580	2635420	Sustained.
2635420	2638780	Did you see the spooky, melty children in the mirror row?
2638780	2639620	Objection!
2639620	2640460	Sustained.
2640460	2642420	What did you see that night?
2644100	2648020	I saw them melty, spooky children in the reflection.
2648020	2649940	There's only one mirror.
2649940	2651820	I saw them children.
2651820	2652900	They were coming at me.
2652900	2657020	The lawyer is just rolling her eyes, looking at the jury.
2657020	2659180	You literally see some of the jury members
2659180	2661180	are putting their hands over their mouths
2661180	2665080	to stifle laughter, and the judge is rubbing his temples.
2665980	2667860	Cut to the bathroom.
2667860	2670300	Doreen Marine is splashing water on her face.
2670300	2672700	Spsh, pow, spsh, spsh, pow.
2672700	2673700	Ha ha ha ha!
2675700	2676860	I think I'm getting better at this.
2676860	2677860	Ha ha ha ha!
2680020	2680940	When suddenly,
2683460	2686340	you start to hear laughter from behind you.
2686340	2688420	Roll sanity for me real quick.
2688420	2689260	Ooh.
2693740	2695980	This is a really good teaching moment.
2695980	2697220	What'd you roll, Lindsay?
2698580	2699420	88.
2699420	2701580	Can you say that a little bit louder for me?
2701580	2702420	88.
2703660	2707580	So, in Delta Green, when the dice match,
2707580	2710980	like 88 or 44 or 22 or 11.
2710980	2712020	What about 55?
2712060	2714460	That's another one.
2714460	2717580	When the dice match, it is critical.
2717580	2720500	So if it's under your score, that's a critical success.
2720500	2722500	But when it's over your score in Delta Green,
2722500	2725980	it's called a fumble or a critical failure.
2725980	2730340	Critical failure on a sanity check is not good,
2730340	2731860	especially in an introduction
2731860	2735700	where we haven't really started playing the game yet almost.
2735700	2739740	So I'm gonna describe this scene from the perspective
2739740	2744740	of the federal agent who is sitting in the back row
2744820	2747460	who just walked into this bathroom
2747460	2752420	to see Doreen Marine kick in the door of the stall
2752420	2756540	that was behind her with just nothing in her eyes.
2756540	2760740	She's just gone, blinded by anger and fear.
2760740	2765740	She is just slamming two kids' heads into the toilet.
2766740	2771180	Ah, ah, ah, ah, shit, oh, shit, fuck, fuck.
2771180	2774540	And you see a vape fall out of one of their hands,
2774540	2776780	which is why they were in this stall together
2776780	2778580	in the first place, just vaping,
2778580	2780540	just getting away from the parents for a little bit,
2780540	2782100	vaping in the bathroom.
2782100	2785460	This woman pulls you off of these two teens.
2785460	2787900	What are you doing, what are you doing, what are you doing?
2787900	2789820	Look at me, Doreen, Doreen, Doreen.
2789820	2794340	No one believes you, Doreen, Doreen, I believe you.
2794340	2797340	We have to get out of here, get out of here, get out of here.
2797340	2801420	And in this fragile state, Doreen's ready to go
2801420	2804160	with just about anyone who believes her right now.
2805420	2806620	And two of you get into a car
2806620	2808600	and you drive to this warehouse.
2809620	2810820	I don't wanna freak you out,
2810820	2813940	but what I'm about to show you,
2813940	2817720	just know that we're doing a good thing.
2818900	2821860	And she opens up the door of the warehouse
2821860	2826460	and you just see it is filled with mirrors
2826460	2828980	and the smell of rubber is in the air.
2831940	2833940	That's Doreen Maureen.
2833940	2835380	Good damn.
2835380	2839780	God, oh my God, oh my God.
2839780	2841660	So cool, so fucking cool.
2841660	2845860	You guys all wrote, rad introductions for your characters.
2845860	2847500	It makes me so happy.
2847500	2850940	Now we're on to, I think it says here your name is?
2850980	2852440	The Chuckster.
2854700	2858100	My born name is Charles,
2859320	2862020	but most people call me Chuck.
2862020	2863620	And if you're a close friend,
2863620	2865740	you call me the Chuckster.
2869700	2870620	Should I get into it?
2870620	2871460	Oh yeah, please.
2871460	2874900	All right, I am about 34 years old.
2874900	2877100	I just moved out of my parents' house
2877100	2878900	about six months ago.
2878900	2880660	Yeah, thank you.
2881220	2882340	I'm basically a gamer.
2882340	2885060	I game and I sleep and I eat mac and cheese
2885060	2887940	in rotation is what I do.
2887940	2891980	And so I don't have any physical friends per se,
2891980	2894740	but I'm really tight with my online community of gamers,
2894740	2896100	of fellow gamers.
2896100	2898740	So we don't really know a whole lot about each other
2898740	2902700	other than our gaming tags and what each other eat
2902700	2904420	and drink, et cetera.
2904420	2908060	I am also a partier, solo partier.
2908060	2909620	I'm crushing them beers.
2909660	2912060	I'm a solo partier.
2912060	2915860	Crushing them beers day and night as I play my games.
2915860	2916820	Is that a partier?
2918700	2920700	In Missouri it is.
2920700	2922500	Yeah, I mean, I'm talking to my friends.
2922500	2924140	They're also crushing beers.
2926660	2927560	I think so.
2928780	2931260	What else do you want to know about me?
2931260	2932100	What do you look like?
2932100	2935380	I am ginger, my ginger.
2935380	2937100	Oh, a stud.
2937100	2938740	Yes, of course I am.
2940140	2942940	I would say I'm like fat strong.
2942940	2943780	Yeah.
2943780	2947260	Yeah, I think it's the best way to describe how I look.
2947260	2951900	About five, six average height and yeah, like fat strong.
2951900	2955780	So I am very strong, but I got a layer of pudge over it
2955780	2957700	and I don't like work out or anything.
2957700	2958780	I guess I have strong thumbs.
2958780	2960060	Tasty.
2960060	2960900	From my gaming.
2963900	2965380	Tasty indeed.
2965380	2968420	So you are, you were ex-military?
2968420	2970020	Oh yeah, I'm ex-military.
2970020	2973580	I don't share this with many people
2973580	2976860	other than a couple of my tight online community friends,
2976860	2980620	but I was not dishonorably charged,
2980620	2983140	but I was like the level below.
2983140	2986900	Cause I was solo partying a little too hard one night
2986900	2991020	and maybe did some unsavory activities
2991020	2994580	involving piss and my Sergeant's bed.
2995100	2997780	My Sergeant's bed.
2997780	2999620	Yeah, that is not allowed.
3000500	3001420	It's not.
3001420	3004140	Unless the Sergeant's into that sort of thing.
3004140	3006460	I tell people, I tell people
3006460	3009620	that I was on a pretty righteous mission,
3009620	3011060	you know, fighting them baddies
3011060	3013580	and saving hundreds of children.
3013580	3015580	I rolled my ankle pretty bad.
3020060	3023500	So I got the purple heart and the red heart
3023500	3024780	and a green heart.
3024780	3029220	And now I'm a veteran of, you know,
3029220	3032460	the good old USA, getting them checks.
3032460	3034780	Stolen valor, the character.
3034780	3035620	I love it.
3035620	3036460	Great.
3036460	3039420	All right, so your parents,
3039420	3041220	you just moved out of their house.
3041220	3042540	They adore you.
3042540	3045140	They think that I was honorably discharged
3045140	3048380	for an injury on the battleground,
3048380	3051940	but I actually, I actually never,
3051940	3054260	I actually never saw battle.
3054260	3055380	Didn't make it there.
3055380	3057300	I was in my, what's it called?
3057300	3059620	What you start with when you're practicing for war?
3059620	3060460	It's the practicing.
3060460	3061780	The practice battleground.
3061780	3062900	The practice ground.
3062900	3064300	I was in the practice round.
3066460	3067420	What is that called?
3067420	3069420	You know, you know.
3069420	3072420	Tweet, tweet at pretending to be people.
3072420	3073260	Not our tag.
3075060	3077580	P-T-P-P-P-P-T-T.
3077580	3080180	Pretending pod to tell her,
3080180	3081540	are you talking about basic training?
3082140	3082980	Yeah, that's right.
3082980	3084180	All right, didn't even make it out of basic.
3084180	3085020	Sounds good.
3085020	3085860	Didn't make it out of basic.
3085860	3086700	Wow.
3086700	3088100	Yeah, and then I kind of laid low
3088100	3092660	because I was ashamed and I didn't want my parents to know.
3092660	3097660	And yeah, then I came back and yeah, stolen valor for sure.
3098020	3100580	But I was, I mean, I tried to be in the military.
3100580	3102380	So it's not, it's not that stole.
3102380	3104060	It's like partial stolen valor.
3104060	3107420	Question, how hard is it to get into the American military?
3107420	3108260	Is it hard or is it like-
3108260	3109980	You just have to have a heartbeat.
3109980	3111980	So it's Chucky a little pathetic
3111980	3114220	for not being able to make it out of basic?
3114220	3115060	Yes.
3115060	3115900	Yes.
3115900	3116740	Oh no, Chucky.
3116740	3118340	I mean, to be fair, we're speaking about things
3118340	3120700	we know shit, jack shit about, like-
3120700	3121540	That's fair.
3121540	3123180	I don't know much about the military.
3123180	3124020	I don't think Zach does.
3124020	3128300	The military industrial complex is ruining the world.
3128300	3129140	Oh God.
3130900	3133900	They don't appreciate the chucks of the,
3133900	3134740	you know, of the nation.
3134740	3135940	All right, how did you,
3135940	3139260	how did you come to learn about the unnatural?
3139260	3140100	Yes. Okay.
3140100	3143500	So I was gaming with my bros, my brosips one night
3143500	3146220	and I, no, I can't, I'm not allowed to say that.
3146220	3147060	Oh, sorry.
3147060	3149020	No, I'm just shaking my head for fun.
3150940	3152940	Because brosips is a really stupid word.
3152940	3153780	That's why.
3157140	3160820	I was gaming with my brosips and we chat on the side,
3160820	3162420	you know, and then I've got my whole headset
3162420	3164700	where I'm like screaming into my mic,
3164700	3167620	but then I get this separate little chat window pop up
3167620	3170380	and it's like inverse colors, black with white type
3170380	3171820	and I've never seen it before.
3171820	3174140	And it's one of my buddies, one of my good buddies.
3174140	3179140	His screen name is dingdonghashtag451,
3179500	3181660	who I know to be Brett.
3181660	3182560	I mean, we're pretty tight.
3182560	3184860	Like we've been gaming for like two years together
3184860	3186360	and he sends me this message
3186360	3189100	and this random like private chat that says,
3189100	3191220	hey bro, I want to show you something,
3191220	3192420	but can you be discreet?
3192420	3196740	And I'm like, of course I can broseph, what's up?
3196740	3199700	So he sends me this video and I watch it
3199700	3202260	and it's from the perspective of a guy
3202260	3205860	and then there's two military type guys in front of him
3205860	3208260	and they're walking into a forest.
3208260	3210180	It's nighttime, it's dark.
3210180	3213420	And we hear this deep groaning sound, like.
3214860	3215700	Excuse me.
3215700	3216520	Oh, sorry.
3216520	3218300	At least let me do my own sound effects.
3218300	3221060	I don't know who you think you are, sir.
3221060	3222180	The crooner.
3222180	3223540	Okay, so it's more like.
3223540	3224380	Ooh.
3225340	3226180	Ooh.
3228980	3231420	Yeah, that's the scariest thing I've ever heard.
3231420	3232260	Ooh.
3233460	3235380	Something like that.
3235380	3237860	And it gets so loud at a point
3237860	3240780	that I have to turn the volume down as I'm watching it.
3240780	3245780	They get closer and closer to this clearing that I can see.
3245800	3250360	And inside the clearing, there is this bottomless pit
3250360	3253220	with a glowing orange light coming out of it.
3253740	3255980	And the groaning is so loud at this point
3255980	3258140	that you can see the men holding their ears.
3258140	3259520	It's clearly unbearable.
3259520	3261700	And I've turned my volume down almost to
3261700	3263220	almost a complete mute.
3263220	3268100	And then all of a sudden I see this huge black tongue
3268100	3270900	surface itself out of the bottomless pit,
3270900	3275300	split into two and wrap itself around the two men
3275300	3276820	that were holding their ears.
3276820	3279180	And at this point they've like gone down to their knees
3279180	3280820	cause it's so difficult to be around.
3280860	3284580	So tongue split in two, wraps around each of them,
3284580	3287340	throws them up in the air, catches them,
3287340	3289420	wraps around again, and then the tongue
3289420	3291320	goes down into the hole.
3291320	3293080	At this point, the man holding the camera,
3293080	3296040	he's like dropped it and he's running away.
3296040	3299220	But you can still kind of see half that the ground
3299220	3302320	starts to just mold itself over
3302320	3304540	and the trees grow back up again.
3304540	3305780	And it's as if it wasn't there at all.
3305780	3306700	Oh my God.
3306700	3307660	Jesus.
3307660	3312420	So I see this video and I got to keep cool for my boys,
3312420	3314020	you know, always keeping cool for my boys.
3314020	3317740	So to Brett, I'm like, dude, so tight,
3317740	3320420	like whatever this is, I'm in.
3320420	3324060	But I'm like completely tense.
3324060	3326620	And I don't know much about this personally,
3326620	3328580	but I believe that maybe my ball sack
3328580	3330180	has like gone into my body.
3330180	3331180	Is that a thing that happens?
3331180	3333160	Yeah, that's definitely a thing that would happen.
3333160	3336580	Maybe not the sack itself going into your body,
3336580	3339500	but the testicles would definitely coil up.
3339500	3341380	Yeah, which would shrink the sack.
3341380	3344820	Okay, so shrunken sack for me.
3346820	3349540	It's the shrunken sack for me.
3349540	3351420	Also, I didn't say what my screen name is.
3351420	3353180	We got the episode title.
3355180	3356560	I didn't say what my screen name is,
3356560	3359180	but it's a Ballbuster 420, hell yeah.
3360700	3362860	And it's the complete screen name.
3362860	3365680	Okay, eventually you get a message from Brett again,
3365680	3368920	ding dong, hashtag 451, which by the way,
3368920	3372640	Taylor was like, did you guys notice?
3372640	3376640	The D in ding and the G in dong for capital
3378880	3383800	for a very, yeah, very subtle reference to Delta Green.
3383800	3384640	Wow.
3387160	3389680	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
3389680	3391680	You brought, most of you probably,
3391680	3392520	yeah, wouldn't have gotten that, but.
3392520	3394400	Ellie, are you okay?
3394400	3395240	I'm like, what?
3395240	3397840	You guys are brilliant masterminds.
3397840	3400520	I did not see that, thank you.
3402600	3404480	Brett's gonna come pick you up
3404480	3407120	and you're gonna head out.
3407120	3410600	He's gonna take you to meet some of his friends, yeah?
3410600	3411440	Yeah.
3411440	3412260	Yeah, you're joining up.
3412260	3415180	All right, so he takes you to,
3415180	3419680	okay, so it's like the most recent holy tongue site, right?
3419680	3421200	So we're calling that thing the holy tongue.
3421200	3423480	Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it.
3423520	3424360	Holy tongue.
3424360	3425800	It doesn't have holes in it, it's split into,
3425800	3426640	oh, it goes in the hole, I get it.
3426640	3428120	Nice, all right, you get it.
3428120	3431580	So we've tracked it down to this corn field, right?
3431580	3433680	Okay, so we're gonna head on out
3433680	3436160	and as you guys get there, there's this corn field,
3436160	3439960	there's a couple tents set up, dudes on laptops,
3439960	3442560	a couple military bros hanging out.
3442560	3445280	All right, so we're going in with a third guy,
3445280	3447040	come on over here, come on over here.
3447040	3450280	And this dude walks up and he's like, yo,
3450320	3452880	Bill, we're nice to, oh shit, not Bill,
3452880	3455200	Bill, not Bill, gamertags?
3455200	3457760	Yeah, sorry, it's a rumple foreskin, what up?
3457760	3458600	How's it going?
3458600	3461400	And he puts out a fist for you to bump.
3461400	3466400	I go for the fist, but then I do the octopus,
3466440	3467280	is that what it is?
3467280	3468320	Jesus fucking Christ.
3468320	3470880	Squid, is it a squid?
3470880	3472400	So I squid him.
3472400	3473240	Oh!
3475560	3477560	You inked me, bro.
3477600	3480960	And then I grab his arm and then I go in for a bro hug.
3480960	3483800	Oh yeah, you guys slap the shit out of each other's backs.
3485240	3486800	Dude, I knew you'd be tight.
3486800	3488640	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, tight as hell, bro.
3488640	3489480	All right, sick.
3489480	3491900	So plan is, what we're gonna do,
3491900	3493660	this thing is probably gonna come up,
3493660	3496520	hey nerd, when's this thing popping up?
3496520	3499560	And this dude on the computer is like,
3499560	3503200	huge sigh, pushes up his glasses and is like,
3504760	3505960	14 minutes.
3507640	3509080	So we're gonna wear these
3509080	3511680	and he puts on these noise-canceling headphones
3511680	3514160	that are super high-tech over your ears
3514160	3515560	and then he keeps talking,
3515560	3517260	but you just see his mouth moving.
3518520	3521120	And then he's like, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
3521120	3523800	And then he takes off your headphones.
3523800	3524640	And he's like, all right,
3524640	3526400	so we're gonna wait for this thing, right?
3526400	3527240	And then-
3527240	3528800	So whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
3528800	3530840	we're gonna meet the tongue?
3530840	3532240	Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, it's gonna be sick.
3532240	3534800	I just wanna make it like maybe not the best idea.
3534800	3537280	Whoa, bro, are you not down?
3537840	3539720	No, no, no, no, I'm super down.
3539720	3541600	Don't worry about my downness.
3541600	3544120	I've never been so down, down in the ground,
3544120	3545480	underneath the body.
3545480	3546920	Yeah, exactly, that's where we're going.
3546920	3548440	We're gonna go down into it, all right?
3548440	3550100	So first we're gonna stun it.
3550100	3550940	Cool, cool, cool.
3550940	3552200	Right, so those nerds over there,
3552200	3554760	and he points back at this like whole tent
3554760	3557800	where they've got this crazy, like metal, shiny,
3557800	3559360	EMP looking thing.
3559360	3560680	What's an EMP?
3560680	3562800	Electromagnetic pulse.
3562800	3565880	So that would like send a shockwave
3565920	3567680	that would knock out electronics.
3567680	3570600	Yo, but this one is gonna knock out this fucking tongue.
3570600	3573560	Apparently they already tried it like 10 times
3573560	3574880	or twice or whatever.
3574880	3578080	And so like, we're definitely gonna be able to stun it.
3578080	3581120	It'll be chill for like 15 minutes.
3581120	3581960	All right, all right.
3581960	3585560	So we are going to, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
3585560	3588240	I mean, splunk, I guess is the word.
3588240	3590920	It's not a cave, but you know, it's a hole, baby.
3590920	3592880	Ha ha, they fist bump.
3592880	3593920	You've got cameras,
3593960	3596800	you've got these strange like energy reading devices.
3596800	3598520	He's like, yeah, I don't know what they are,
3598520	3600160	but apparently it's gonna give them
3600160	3602160	like the information they need.
3602160	3604840	Obviously we're gonna have a bunch of guns and knives
3604840	3606080	just in case shit goes down.
3606080	3607280	I brought my knuckle busters.
3607280	3608640	I brought my throwing stars.
3608640	3610560	I'm ready to get down.
3610560	3612040	You have throwing stars?
3612040	3613080	Hell yeah, I got throwing stars.
3613080	3614560	Can I see your throwing stars?
3614560	3616760	I mean, when the time presents itself.
3616760	3619560	Oh, play close to the chest, play close to the chest.
3619560	3620680	I dig that, all right, cool.
3620680	3622160	So let's fucking go.
3622160	3626080	Cut to the Chuckster, if I may.
3626080	3627560	I think we're tight enough now, yeah.
3627560	3630320	You're stabbing your knife into solid ground
3630320	3633800	for the first time in what feels like an eternity
3633800	3637040	as you finish scrambling as fast as you can
3637040	3640520	out of the roused holy tongue.
3640520	3642120	This thing is alive now.
3642120	3644720	It's back and you crawl toward the team
3644720	3646240	on the ground away from it.
3646240	3650440	This team that's firing now at the whole situation
3650440	3652920	from behind cover, just a bunch of military dudes
3652920	3656080	firing over your head as you're crawling to safety
3656080	3659720	and you hear Brett ding-dong, hashtag 451.
3659720	3660920	He's screaming.
3660920	3664240	You look back, you see one of these tongues, boom,
3664240	3666760	grabs him by the ankle and it starts slowly
3666760	3668040	dragging him back in.
3668040	3669440	What do you do?
3669440	3670760	Well, first of all, as it's happening,
3670760	3673400	I'm yelling, not tight.
3673400	3674240	Tight.
3679280	3683880	Ding-dong, I'll save you.
3683880	3686560	I'll come back for you.
3686560	3688600	And then I just continue to scramble away.
3690480	3691880	All right, hell yeah.
3691880	3693720	No sign of Rumple foreskin.
3693720	3695800	Rumple foreskin is gone.
3695800	3698720	There is no Rumple foreskin to be seen.
3698720	3700720	I'm just trying to say that a few more times
3700720	3702320	before we never hear it again.
3702360	3703760	Okay, so.
3703760	3705120	Wait, where's Rumple foreskin?
3705120	3705960	Nowhere to be seen.
3705960	3707280	Damn.
3707280	3711680	Ding-dong is being pulled back slowly into this thing
3711680	3715560	and the ground begins to kind of reform itself
3715560	3718360	and right at the last second, right before,
3718360	3720840	you think that ding-dong's entire body
3720840	3722920	is gonna be yoinked down into the hole,
3722920	3725120	but it doesn't quite all make it.
3725120	3727640	And as the ground finishes forming,
3727640	3731840	the head of Brett is just sitting on the ground
3732320	3736120	and you think maybe he himself is just stuck there
3736120	3741120	until slowly the head falls over on its side
3741800	3746200	and blood just starts squirting out from the bottom of it.
3746200	3747040	Jeez.
3750360	3753360	That is Charles Chuck, the Chuckster.
3753360	3755600	Thank you, thank you for playing.
3755600	3757800	Fucking, oh my God.
3757800	3761040	Sorry, I'm reacting and sitting here.
3761080	3762560	How do you feel?
3762560	3764280	I'm super intrigued by all these stories.
3764280	3767720	They're really cool, but also they start off
3767720	3772720	like penis joke, Brett, foreskin, military complex
3774240	3777240	and then like, you're dead, you're gone.
3777240	3780160	And there doesn't seem to be a way to protect yourself
3780160	3782920	which makes it even more terrifying.
3782920	3784480	It just lands on you.
3784480	3787080	I think I'm gonna go back for that tongue.
3787160	3788240	Go for it.
3788240	3789080	Yeah.
3817080	3824080	Breathe it in.
3840080	3845080	Clasp your fist, or fall apart.
3845080	3850080	Water leaks through your fingers.
3850080	3856080	You're standing in a swirling flood.
3856080	3868080	And only darkness lingers.
3875080	3887080	Falling fast into a deep abyss.
3887080	3892080	Till it sets you out again.
3892080	3897080	Find your feet on your broken bones.
3897080	3908080	You're out for the edge again.
3927080	3943080	You're out for the edge again.
3957080	3976080	You're out for the edge again.
3987080	4002080	You're out for the edge again.
4002080	4027080	You're out for the edge again.
4027080	4052080	Yeah.
4052080	4080080	Yeah.
4080080	4108080	Yeah.
4108080	4121080	Yeah.
