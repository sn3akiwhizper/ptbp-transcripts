418.22 426.90 speaker2  I know that that is new to Eleanor here. Eleanor, are you excited?
425.26 445.82 speaker3  I've been wanting to play this game ever since I heard about it the first time, which was in, I don't know, doesn't matter, but I have been wanting to play it for a really, really long time. And I'm so excited that you guys invited me to play because it seems like you guys know what you're doing
444.06 449.10 speaker2  Oh, that's funny.
447.22 451.42 speaker3  One of us at this table does. It's good.
449.94 469.70 speaker2  It's good to have your confidence. It's me. It's me. It's a role-playing game. Okay, moving on. So...
468.86 475.50 speaker3  Oh, no.
471.78 478.94 speaker2  How are you so good on all those other podcasts?
477.98 486.46 speaker3  I don't even know.
484.06 490.86 speaker2  So this is the first time I'm playing Delta Green without a beer in my hand in a long time.
490.02 503.98 speaker3  Congratulations. It's also till 10 in the morning. Yup, still would have done it. It's Saturday. Saturday's for the boys. Saturday's for the boys.
502.58 513.06 speaker2  So Delta Green is a role-playing game about losing your mind or dying in the process of trying to stop
512.14 526.38 speaker3  Oh, really? I thought it was a romantic comedy. Someone told me it was like a period piece set in the 19th century Britain. 19th century Arkansas.
525.02 539.82 speaker2  We are playing... This game will be set in Mississippi and Arkansas tonight. We're gonna kick it off in Mississippi and then drive on up to Arkansas, which Eleanor, you had to do some research
538.58 550.90 speaker3  What do you mean Mississippi? I thought it was... Oh God, I thought it was... Wait, Mississippi the river or Mississippi the...
548.94 561.42 speaker2  The characters are gonna meet in Shreveport, which is in Mississippi, but then you're gonna drive into Arkansas. You don't need to know anything about Mississippi other than what should she know about Mississippi?
560.42 568.30 speaker3  How to spell it. M-I-S-S-I-S-S-I-P-P-I. I've been swimming in the Mississippi.
566.10 571.86 speaker2  Wait, you swam in the Mississippi?
570.58 586.70 speaker3  Actually, that's a Swedish saying. Take a piss in the Mississippi. Actually, that's what my mom says all the time. Like when something is irrelevant, it's like fart in space, but we also say it's a piss in Mississippi.
584.38 591.26 speaker2  Yeah, P-I-S-S-I-S-S-I-P-P-I.
589.54 597.26 speaker3  Piss is hippie. Oh my God. Google it.
595.94 625.10 speaker2  Google it before you tweet it. Google it. So normally Delta Green is a game with a lot of really fantastic scenarios that are written for it and published by Arc Dream Publishing, which is a publishing company that publishes games and scenarios for Delta Green. However, instead of running one of their extremely well-written and edited scenarios, I'm gonna run you through something I wrote
624.26 651.10 speaker3  Hell yeah. All right, well. I don't think Zach's killing children in this. Based on his face. Don't worry about it. Kill as many children you want and puppies.
648.70 673.38 speaker2  That's what I was waiting to hear. All right, so let's meet these characters, shall we? Let's go in alphabetical order of first name of real life human. Who is your character? What's she look like? What's her deal? What's she been up to? Give us the rundown.
672.54 679.74 speaker3  Thank you. I'm gonna pull up my summary of my character. Thank you.
678.02 700.42 speaker2  to answer some questions that I'd sent and then to write a little bit of backstory about how they ran into the unnatural. And all four of you did an absolutely stellar job. Should we do season two together as a group instead of the normal?
698.66 705.10 speaker3  Okay, my name is.
701.86 708.90 speaker2  Oh no, not again.
707.62 733.26 speaker3  I remember that it's a joke. I just don't remember why. You started it. I am a scientist. I didn't choose my name. My parents did.
732.34 734.94 speaker2  They chose your last name? Yeah, totally.
734.10 736.62 speaker3  So you're Dr. Hooch?
735.78 738.30 speaker2  Rad.
737.46 769.70 speaker3  The Hooch. They call me Rusty. Mostly like potions and stuff. Ha ha ha ha ha. for curing mad cow disease. Did you do it with potions? I did it with potions. Ha ha ha ha ha ha. I'm hoping to cure tinnitus next. Okay, yes. because I think it's unnecessary.
767.78 771.22 speaker2  Unnecessary emotion sadness.
769.70 777.98 speaker3  Unnecessary negative emotion, which I will be curing with potions. I love this so much.
776.90 781.22 speaker2  47. 47 going on 53.
779.38 788.34 speaker3  Going on 53. A Nobel Prize winner at 47
786.74 794.34 speaker2  In the presence of greatness.
793.50 796.50 speaker3  I love you so much. Just let that be known.
795.18 801.66 speaker2  What's your charisma score?
798.34 804.58 speaker3  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
803.22 806.62 speaker2  you can have to start.
805.78 808.62 speaker3  Good.
806.62 814.14 speaker2  Because you said that your character leans into like.
812.18 846.10 speaker3  People see me as kind of an obsessive relentless bitch, but I would never have been able to cure mad cow disease if I wasn't a relentless bitch. Short, blonde. Bangs. Bangs. I don't know where I got that. Also, I'm hot. Don't forget. Probably some pearl earrings. Whatever your hot people wear is what I'm normally wearing. My God. I'm sensing a lot of Robin Robin Wright from House of Cards.
844.50 848.50 speaker2  Like that sort of vibe.
847.62 861.90 speaker3  Yeah. But hotter. But hotter. Oh wow. But hotter and Nobel Prize winner. I love it. Exactly. Humble. And humble.
861.06 870.42 speaker2  All right. Give me a rundown. What was your experience like the first time you saw something unnatural?
867.46 909.70 speaker3  So I was flying my DA40 home. I have a DA40. A small plane. Of course. I looked it up. Yeah, so I own one and I know a lot about it and I know how to fly it. So I was flying it home to my secret cabin in the woods that none of my children or ex-wives know about because I like my privacy. Smart. So one night I was flying my Diamond DA40 home and I saw a gigantic explosion come from the woods but I didn't hear it. It was completely silent. It was blue and wet looking. Ew.
908.70 919.70 speaker4  Thank you for that. Silent and wet.
915.18 936.42 speaker3  ran down the road to where I thought I was close to it, hiding because I was afraid of who might be back there. And then five minutes later I saw six black escalates drive past on the road. I was hiding in a bush. Also my plane was covered by a... No need to get too deep into the weeds. My plane was hidden.
934.62 940.50 speaker2  Into the weeds that are covering your plane.
938.54 970.54 speaker3  Anyway, then I ran to the side of the explosion and there was nothing. I couldn't see anything. Nothing was different. Not a leaf turned. Not a branch broken. Not a stone unturned. Not a stone turned. Ever since then, whenever I'm flying my Diamond DA40 home, that I know how to fly. So I've just been seeing a lot of these silent explosions but I can't seem to get close enough to see what's going on. How many X's do you have?
969.58 976.86 speaker2  Counting is hard. Three, at least three.
975.70 983.58 speaker4  Vegas marriages. Do those count? Like that's kind of a half marriage.
980.10 985.78 speaker2  So your most recent one is...
984.42 1009.02 speaker4  Yes, Jillian. You would think I would have learned my lesson. unfortunately. But I'm rich, so it's fine.
1006.34 1017.10 speaker2  you're supposed to create a character that is different than yourself to try to embody someone else.
1016.26 1033.02 speaker4  Really? And I have a diamond DA40.
1030.74 1044.02 speaker3  I was like, oh, I could hire her as my pilot when I become rich, famous, noble, priceless. Yes, please.
1040.30 1063.46 speaker4  Oh, so Jillian and I share custody of a... Dog. My ex-wife Jillian and I share custody of a Saint Bernard. His name is Belvedere. I love him very much. I have him on the weekends. We take a lot of hikes, but Jillian has him
1062.18 1108.62 speaker2  It's Monday night. You're getting ready to go drop off Belvedere at Jillian's. This is the last moment that you get to spend with your beloved Saint Bernard they're pulling up outside. You look out the window, you see the string of those black SUVs, and they are lining your driveway, but only one guy is walking up to the door and he knocks.
1106.62 1114.38 speaker3  Boom, boom, boom, boom. Yes! I mean, you couldn't help yourself.
1113.54 1117.42 speaker4  I just helped yourself.
1116.22 1139.22 speaker3  Maybe I could. Sound person. I don't know what that means.
1138.30 1165.38 speaker4  I don't answer. Okay, I answered the door very reluctantly, and I don't have one of those locks on the top of the door, the chain locks, and I don't undo that. Dr. Rusty Hooch? Yes, can I see some identification, please? What are you doing at my house?
1161.46 1185.58 speaker2  He holds up his hand as if he's holding a badge of some sort. There's literally nothing in his hand. And he says, you don't really need to know who I am. We've been following you, and we understand that you've been noticing some situations that have been happening out in the woods. I think due to some of your expertise, we're gonna need your help.
1184.42 1192.34 speaker4  I don't go in the woods. I live in the city.
1188.86 1212.46 speaker2  And he calls out your plane's number, like your ID number. Look around you. Well, I suppose it's your choice. You can come with us.
1210.98 1219.58 speaker4  to Jillian's house, my ex-wife, because she has them during the week.
1218.74 1223.42 speaker2  until we're done? It won't take too long.
1221.46 1236.18 speaker4  I'll really get in a lot of trouble from Jillian if I don't have him there by 10 p.m. on Monday night. I'll go with you.
1234.38 1301.18 speaker2  You get into an SUV. It's actually empty, this one, except for a driver, and this unidentified man gets into the car with you, and he begins asking you about how many times you've seen these silent blue explosions. You guys pull up to a small camp in the woods that's being run out of the back of a big truck. So there's just this one covered truck with a bunch of lab equipment inside of it, computers going, scientists running around talking to each other. There's a bunch of military-looking guys who are not wearing camo or any sort of military gear. One of them approaches you with a, it's like a jar. It's not a mason jar. It's far more scientific. It seems to be sealed on both sides. It looks like a high-tech version of the bank teller thing
1299.54 1308.18 speaker4  before I do anything for y'all. Do you know who I am? I just won a Nobel Prize for inventing mad cow disease. I'm gonna need some context.
1307.34 1341.30 speaker2  It's not gonna hooch. We know exactly who you are. and pull out a guy who is bound. He's wearing just like the raddest old clothes you've ever seen. Looks like he hasn't showered in months. Filthy, filthy dude. He's just kinda like dazed. Looks like he's been drugged.
1339.90 1351.30 speaker5  He walks you over to this guy who's just kinda like put down on his knees,
1347.70 1408.62 speaker2  And he opens up this container and it, oh, sorry, Taylor, He puts a finger in this like bioluminescent goop and it kind of sticks to him like paint. And then he draws a symbol on this bound man's forehead and it kind of looks like waves that have teeth, this weird symbol. And then he closes the container. Taylor? Psst. And he starts counting down. 39, 37.
1404.02 1414.26 speaker5  42, 38, 35.
1411.66 1423.82 speaker2  are walking extremely quickly. And he is not, he's chilling. He kinda turns back.
1422.98 1438.94 speaker4  I've ever seen. I've seen my dog take a giant shit in my Diamond DA40.
1434.50 1502.38 speaker2  of the bound dude's face and fill the ground around you. And it begins to create a massive dome that is engulfing this guy and then slowly expands and takes over. And as it's taking over, the guy looks at you next to you and he's like, it would be all right. This blue hits your face. Your hair blows back and suddenly you see inside and you are standing in seemingly the middle of the ocean. You see all of this wildlife around you. Fish, schools of fish swimming together. Sharks, part of a whale at the dome on the far side away from you. And there's coral everywhere and it's dark and it's blue and it's glowing. And then suddenly it just collapses in on itself.
1499.46 1512.66 speaker4  to check my hair since it got messed up. So I fixed my hair first.
1508.10 1529.86 speaker2  you see that your lips and your eyes, your nostrils, your eyebrows, everything on your face is fucking trembling. You've never seen yourself look this shook.
1528.70 1542.94 speaker4  What did you just do to me?
1542.10 1548.54 speaker2  Radical, radical, radical.
1547.06 1700.10 speaker3  In real life or the character? In real life. Oh, for real? I based this off of the Swedish crime dramas because every protagonist in Swedish crime dramas is the exact same dude. But in this case, I just made it a female. Early fifties, incredibly tired woman. Like everything about her is so freaking over it. Like mentally tired, physically tired. She has two daughters. One of them won't speak to her because she's a 15 year old little bitch. And the other one is off to college, but it's like teen daughters. We all know, we all know what they're like. She was recently left by her husband for a younger model. And she's just so freaking tired. You know, she's a workaholic. She's a surgeon. She's a very brilliant surgeon. She's been doing that for a long time and people call her for the tough cases. But since everything else in her life sort of fell apart, she's been really burying herself in work. Takes on extra hours. She's on call almost all the time. And she's gained a couple of extra pounds because she's not taking care of herself. She picked up smoking because it was the only thing that sort of calmed her nerves. Even though she knows it's wrong, she's a doctor. Lots of fast food, very little exercise. And the idea I had in my head for her was Bill Murray because of this constant through the signs, sad face, but like a female version. It's amazing. I don't know if you saw that. because that's basically every crime drama of like this resigned brilliant detective just being so freaking like tired of everything. But then like, well, I've seen worse or have I, you know. Are there any happy detectives? I don't think so. I don't think you can be happy and be a detective, but we shall see maybe in this game. Maybe she'll find joy. God, that show is great.
1696.26 1709.38 speaker2  The two doctors, Dr. Rusty Hooch and Dr. Olivia Miller, from each other.
1705.18 1820.38 speaker3  Fun thing though, my charisma is 13, so I'm charming, which I didn't realize. But she's also started sleeping with her neighbor because that's like the one, also another takeaway. And so her neighbor kind of wants something more to happen, but she's just like, no, no, this is a very transactional thing going on. But it's one of her bonds because they sort of drink whiskey and play chess together or something boring. she's technically a lovely woman in need of a hug and hopefully other things. I was just like, wait, what? Because I thought for some reason thought this was like, I've been trying to not read up on Delta Green because I love going into something spoiler free. And then I'm like, so there is an element of unnatural because people have told me it's terrifying, or if it's like, you know, unnatural, but now I know. And so- I envisioned her to say she's a very good surgeon. She was called in for this weird case, an autopsy of a corpse and what she found out as she was doing it, she had to extract this thing out of the body, this black gooey blob of fat, basically. And as she was picking it up really carefully, it started like moving in a way that suggested it's still alive. And then she had to move it into a separate jar and some people in black suits just took it away. No more questions needed, so to speak.
1817.70 1838.90 speaker2  Dr. Olivia Miller, it's a school night. And strangely, your 15-year-old has requested a movie night with her mom. This is very out of the ordinary. How do you react?
1837.10 1872.50 speaker3  Downton Abbey movie just came out. Would you like to watch that? Is everything all right?
1871.66 1875.02 speaker5  Of course.
1873.82 1879.06 speaker3  Let me just...
1877.06 1882.50 speaker2  and someone is just boom, boom, boom, boom.
1881.54 1893.66 speaker3  I'll get you a... And she walks over to the door.
1892.10 1924.38 speaker2  or see through the peephole, you see that the team of those men who took away the jar with that fatty tissue that seemed to be alive in it last time, they are here at your home who is shaking violently and screaming,
1919.90 1927.38 speaker6  All right, she quickly opens the door because-
1925.22 1934.38 speaker2  They just boom, barge in, take over.
1932.94 1937.82 speaker0  Doctor, doctor, we need you to...
1936.90 1942.74 speaker2  You have to remove it. Do you have any equipment here?
1940.18 1956.38 speaker3  And immediately she goes into professional mode and takes out her medical equipment and starts ordering everyone around like, you, get me a towel, you there, start heating up, like start disinfecting my tools and that she-
1954.14 1971.34 speaker2  Yeah, somebody's got the stove going, you got towels coming in, we got everything you need. They've knocked off your bar cart. They've like shoved everything off the top of the bar cart and put it next to the table to put all the supplies on it.
1970.50 1981.58 speaker6  I need you to- What is happening? Honey, you need to go to your room right now. We need to go to your room and you stay there and I'll find you soon.
1978.86 2013.90 speaker2  and you're looking over the situation. You see on this woman's neck, there's just this kind of like,
2011.06 2028.90 speaker6  Oh, I don't know, that's probably a fail. It's 83 and I think I did put, oh no. Yeah, that's a fail. I only have 15 surgery, fuck.
2026.06 2097.82 speaker2  like you've seen it kind of jiggle in your hand earlier. It's moving on its own. It busts out. You've accidentally cut it. Your hand has slipped. You didn't just cut through the skin. You actually cut into the tissue itself. The thing begins to unfold and twist itself inside out as it turns to dust and this dust flies up into the nose of one of these black-suited agents and immediately one of the other agents goes, oh, fucking Jason, pulls his gun and fires it into the back of this guy's head. As he hits the ground in your kitchen, he fires three more times shattering the tile underneath this guy's head. You just had the kitchen redone. you see your 15-year-old daughter is just staring in shock from behind her door. Jesus Christ.
2096.42 2126.98 speaker6  Well, cool. Cool, cool, cool.
2124.70 2134.12 speaker2  Boom, if you know a lot about the setting, we'll call you Doreen Loring.
2129.58 2154.74 speaker3  When you go swimming, we call you Doreen Chlorine. Doreen's pretty simple.
2152.78 2168.30 speaker4  She has a very, very small group of friends and then it's just like no family anywhere close.
2167.02 2180.30 speaker2  Y'all ever done nitrous?
2178.90 2184.94 speaker3  That's my dog.
2183.34 2210.58 speaker4  So she's pretty run down. She's got like box dyed hair. It's grown out quite a bit since last time she's dying. So she's got some dark gray roots coming in. She's got some sunken eyes and she just wears like super baggy clothes and- to shoplift a bag of marshmallows.
2207.82 2214.82 speaker2  That's how I'm referring to all baggy clothes from now on. Like she's ready to shoplift a bag of marshmallows.
2213.98 2228.10 speaker4  She's ready. Yeah, so she's more fun on the page than in person. Her favorite-
2225.26 2233.46 speaker2  A perfect character for a role-playing game.
2231.10 2240.50 speaker4  Yeah, she's always just like got pockets full of like the wrapping of hard candy.
2239.66 2249.86 speaker2  I'm so tired. When you leaned into the mic, Allie, I expected you to join me. No, I'm exhausted.
2248.90 2274.94 speaker4  God damn it. or just some loose Mentos in there all the time. She just got trash in her car. I'm sorry. She spends a lot of her extra time just like scrolling on Pinterest on her iPad and like petting her with it.
2273.54 2281.38 speaker2  Jesus Christ. Honestly, that's all you needed to say to get a full idea of who this woman is.
2280.38 2282.22 speaker4  I know this woman.
2281.38 2288.26 speaker2  I know this woman. She just scrolls Pinterest on her iPad.
2287.42 2305.82 speaker4  Your mom? Is it your mom? It's based off of my mom. Is it your fucking mom?
2304.54 2306.66 speaker6  I think she would be appalled.
2305.82 2314.86 speaker4  She would. She absolutely would. Mom, if you're listening to this, only portions of this are based off of your mom.
2313.34 2316.10 speaker3  Except for Eleanor.
2314.86 2330.98 speaker4  She can listen. That mom can listen. Eleanor, you're allowed to listen. Otherwise, not for moms. I'm so sorry I discriminated against the mom community. I didn't mean it.
2327.78 2341.34 speaker2  Can you, I mean, if you're at home all day caring for your child, what better to listen to than-
2339.78 2345.34 speaker3  but also a little aroused.
2343.58 2354.06 speaker6  I think that's a green light.
2352.18 2364.22 speaker2  just based off that comment alone, so let's dive into her experience with the unnatural.
2361.46 2373.70 speaker4  it's caused a lot of trauma for Doreen. I was called in on a murder case. I had been working on this case for a while, and I, oh, and do I need to read it in my case?
2372.86 2379.14 speaker2  One night.
2376.26 2413.10 speaker4  and it's from an unknown number. So I answer the phone, and somebody's telling me to meet them at a location I'm unaware of. I didn't know this place existed. I decide it's a good idea since this case has been going for a while and I'm really tired of it, ready to end this case. So I show up at this house. I open the front door because the door's just kind of leaning open a little bit. When I walk in, everything is just covered in black rubber, the walls, the ceilings. You can see that there are things in this house, but they're all just covered in this black rubber.
2411.54 2414.76 speaker3  Sorry, I got...
2413.94 2438.50 speaker4  You spooked yourself? I scared myself. Oh, my God. It was Ramona. Okay, I'm sorry.
2436.10 2442.78 speaker6  Condoms and condoms.
2441.74 2449.50 speaker4  Penis on the brain.
2448.66 2452.50 speaker6  I danced.
2451.10 2516.38 speaker4  All right. Everything inside of this house is just lined in this rubber, and it's thick, and it's weird, and it's soft, and it's making me really uneasy. I start to hear a little bit of laughter, and it's really creepy, really uneasy. It's somewhere in the house. I don't know where it is, but it's somewhere in this house. I gotta find who's laughing at me. So I pull out my gun, and I start walking around gun first, and I'm looking for where this noise is coming from, and all of a sudden I see something not covered in this black rubber, and it's this big old mirror, and it looks really old, antique, and it's all rusty on the edges. And as I'm looking into this mirror, I see these two little kids, and they're staring right back at me, and they're just covered in blood like someone's just been beaten up.
2515.54 2531.22 speaker6  I'm sorry. Covered in blood.
2529.66 2582.50 speaker4  Just covered from head to toe. I turn to see what they're doing. They're standing behind me a little bit. I turn, and they're not there. So I turn back, I look at the mirror, and they start melting. They're melting into this metallic, silver, metal-looking lava. Now they're really in the room with me, but they're just two puddles of lava, and they start coming right at me, rolling towards me. And as I get closer, I start losing my bearings, and so I start running out of the building, only to find when I get outside that there are a bunch of agents in black cars and suits pointing their gun at me. I didn't know what to do. I got called here by someone who I don't know, so I just start running away in a zigzag pattern, and I'd never seen them since. Dope story. Terrifying.
2581.14 2620.94 speaker2  The next time we see Doreen Marine, she is on the stand in a courtroom. It's a bright, sunny day, the sun rays are coming in through the windows, across one side, onto half of the people watching. The lawyer in a smart suit is asking questions about what happened in that house. You can see one of those people in the black suits that were outside, the woman who was up front. She's sitting in the back row, and she's just staring.
2620.10 2635.42 speaker5  Oh, I don't know.
2634.58 2649.94 speaker2  Sustained. Did you see the spooky, melty children in the mirror row? Sustained. What did you see that night?
2648.02 2659.18 speaker4  There's only one mirror. I saw them children. They were coming at me.
2657.02 2689.26 speaker2  You literally see some of the jury members are putting their hands over their mouths to stifle laughter, and the judge is rubbing his temples. Cut to the bathroom. Doreen Marine is splashing water on her face. Spsh, pow, spsh, spsh, pow. When suddenly, Roll sanity for me real quick.
2688.42 2695.98 speaker6  Ooh.
2693.74 2702.42 speaker2  This is a really good teaching moment.
2701.58 2720.50 speaker5  88.
2717.58 2810.82 speaker2  So if it's under your score, that's a critical success. But when it's over your score in Delta Green, it's called a fumble or a critical failure. Critical failure on a sanity check is not good, especially in an introduction So I'm gonna describe this scene from the perspective of the federal agent who is sitting in the back row who just walked into this bathroom to see Doreen Marine kick in the door of the stall that was behind her with just nothing in her eyes. She's just gone, blinded by anger and fear. She is just slamming two kids' heads into the toilet. which is why they were in this stall together in the first place, just vaping, just getting away from the parents for a little bit, vaping in the bathroom. This woman pulls you off of these two teens. And in this fragile state, Doreen's ready to go with just about anyone who believes her right now. And two of you get into a car and you drive to this warehouse.
2809.62 2821.86 speaker5  I don't wanna freak you out, but what I'm about to show you,
2818.90 2862.02 speaker2  And she opens up the door of the warehouse and you just see it is filled with mirrors and the smell of rubber is in the air. It makes me so happy.
2859.32 2924.14 speaker6  but most people call me Chuck. And if you're a close friend, you call me the Chuckster. Should I get into it? Oh yeah, please. All right, I am about 34 years old. I just moved out of my parents' house about six months ago. I'm basically a gamer. in rotation is what I do. And so I don't have any physical friends per se, but I'm really tight with my online community of gamers, of fellow gamers. So we don't really know a whole lot about each other other than our gaming tags and what each other eat and drink, et cetera. I am also a partier, solo partier. I'm crushing them beers. Is that a partier?
2922.50 2931.26 speaker4  They're also crushing beers. I think so.
2928.78 2968.42 speaker6  What else do you want to know about me? Oh, a stud. I would say I'm like fat strong. Yeah. Yeah, I think it's the best way to describe how I look. About five, six average height and yeah, like fat strong. So I am very strong, but I got a layer of pudge over it and I don't like work out or anything. I guess I have strong thumbs. Tasty. From my gaming.
2965.38 2973.58 speaker2  So you are, you were ex-military?
2970.02 3001.42 speaker6  I don't share this with many people other than a couple of my tight online community friends, but I was not dishonorably charged, but I was like the level below. Cause I was solo partying a little too hard one night and maybe did some unsavory activities
3000.50 3011.06 speaker2  It's not.
3009.62 3035.62 speaker6  you know, fighting them baddies and saving hundreds of children. I rolled my ankle pretty bad. So I got the purple heart and the red heart and a green heart. And now I'm a veteran of, you know, the good old USA, getting them checks.
3034.78 3048.38 speaker2  I love it.
3045.14 3062.90 speaker6  for an injury on the battleground, but I actually, I actually never, I actually never saw battle. Didn't make it there. I was in my, what's it called? What you start with when you're practicing for war? It's the practicing. The practice battleground.
3061.78 3072.42 speaker3  The practice ground.
3069.42 3080.18 speaker6  Tweet, tweet at pretending to be people.
3077.58 3084.18 speaker5  Pretending pod to tell her, are you talking about basic training? Yeah, that's right.
3082.98 3085.86 speaker2  All right, didn't even make it out of basic.
3085.02 3108.26 speaker6  Didn't make it out of basic. Wow. Yeah, and then I kind of laid low And yeah, then I came back and yeah, stolen valor for sure. But I was, I mean, I tried to be in the military.
3107.42 3120.70 speaker3  Is it hard or is it like- for not being able to make it out of basic? Yes. Yes. Oh no, Chucky.
3118.34 3140.10 speaker6  we know shit, jack shit about, like- That's fair. I don't know much about the military. I don't think Zach does. you know, of the nation.
3139.26 3146.22 speaker3  Yes. Okay.
3143.50 3147.06 speaker6  and I, no, I can't, I'm not allowed to say that.
3146.22 3153.78 speaker2  Oh, sorry. No, I'm just shaking my head for fun.
3152.94 3160.82 speaker3  That's why.
3157.14 3232.26 speaker6  I was gaming with my brosips and we chat on the side, you know, and then I've got my whole headset where I'm like screaming into my mic, but then I get this separate little chat window pop up and it's like inverse colors, black with white type and I've never seen it before. And it's one of my buddies, one of my good buddies. His screen name is dingdonghashtag451, who I know to be Brett. Like we've been gaming for like two years together and he sends me this message and this random like private chat that says, hey bro, I want to show you something, but can you be discreet? So he sends me this video and I watch it and it's from the perspective of a guy and then there's two military type guys in front of him and they're walking into a forest. It's nighttime, it's dark. And we hear this deep groaning sound, like. At least let me do my own sound effects. Okay, so it's more like. Ooh. Ooh.
3231.42 3237.86 speaker5  Ooh.
3235.38 3339.50 speaker6  And it gets so loud at a point that I have to turn the volume down as I'm watching it. They get closer and closer to this clearing that I can see. And inside the clearing, there is this bottomless pit with a glowing orange light coming out of it. And the groaning is so loud at this point that you can see the men holding their ears. It's clearly unbearable. And I've turned my volume down almost to almost a complete mute. And then all of a sudden I see this huge black tongue surface itself out of the bottomless pit, split into two and wrap itself around the two men that were holding their ears. And at this point they've like gone down to their knees cause it's so difficult to be around. So tongue split in two, wraps around each of them, throws them up in the air, catches them, wraps around again, and then the tongue goes down into the hole. At this point, the man holding the camera, he's like dropped it and he's running away. But you can still kind of see half that the ground starts to just mold itself over and the trees grow back up again. And it's as if it wasn't there at all. So I see this video and I got to keep cool for my boys, you know, always keeping cool for my boys. So to Brett, I'm like, dude, so tight, like whatever this is, I'm in. But I'm like completely tense. And I don't know much about this personally, but I believe that maybe my ball sack has like gone into my body.
3336.58 3353.18 speaker2  but the testicles would definitely coil up.
3351.42 3365.68 speaker6  We got the episode title. I didn't say what my screen name is, but it's a Ballbuster 420, hell yeah.
3362.86 3391.68 speaker2  Okay, eventually you get a message from Brett again, ding dong, hashtag 451, which by the way,
3389.68 3392.52 speaker6  You brought, most of you probably,
3391.68 3394.40 speaker4  yeah, wouldn't have gotten that, but.
3392.52 3397.84 speaker6  Ellie, are you okay?
3395.24 3407.12 speaker3  You guys are brilliant masterminds. I did not see that, thank you.
3404.48 3423.48 speaker5  and you're gonna head out. okay, so it's like the most recent holy tongue site, right?
3421.20 3461.40 speaker2  Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it. Holy tongue. So we've tracked it down to this corn field, right? Okay, so we're gonna head on out and as you guys get there, there's this corn field, there's a couple tents set up, dudes on laptops, a couple military bros hanging out. All right, so we're going in with a third guy, come on over here, come on over here. Bill, we're nice to, oh shit, not Bill, Bill, not Bill, gamertags? Yeah, sorry, it's a rumple foreskin, what up? How's it going?
3458.60 3477.56 speaker6  And he puts out a fist for you to bump. I go for the fist, but then I do the octopus, is that what it is? Squid, is it a squid? So I squid him.
3475.56 3489.48 speaker5  You inked me, bro.
3488.64 3541.60 speaker2  All right, sick. And this dude on the computer is like, huge sigh, pushes up his glasses and is like, 14 minutes. that are super high-tech over your ears and then he keeps talking, but you just see his mouth moving. And then he's like, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. so we're gonna wait for this thing, right? And then-
3539.72 3548.44 speaker6  Don't worry about my downness. I've never been so down, down in the ground, underneath the body.
3546.92 3554.76 speaker5  We're gonna go down into it, all right? Cool, cool, cool.
3552.20 3570.60 speaker2  and he points back at this like whole tent where they've got this crazy, like metal, shiny, EMP looking thing. What's an EMP? Electromagnetic pulse. So that would like send a shockwave that would knock out electronics.
3567.68 3574.88 speaker5  Yo, but this one is gonna knock out this fucking tongue.
3573.56 3607.28 speaker2  or twice or whatever. It'll be chill for like 15 minutes. All right, all right. So we are going to, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Ha ha, they fist bump. He's like, yeah, I don't know what they are, but apparently it's gonna give them like the information they need. Obviously we're gonna have a bunch of guns and knives just in case shit goes down.
3606.08 3620.68 speaker6  I brought my knuckle busters. I brought my throwing stars. I'm ready to get down. Hell yeah, I got throwing stars.
3619.56 3633.80 speaker5  I dig that, all right, cool. So let's fucking go.
3630.32 3670.76 speaker2  for the first time in what feels like an eternity as you finish scrambling as fast as you can out of the roused holy tongue. This thing is alive now. It's back and you crawl toward the team on the ground away from it. This team that's firing now at the whole situation from behind cover, just a bunch of military dudes firing over your head as you're crawling to safety and you hear Brett ding-dong, hashtag 451. He's screaming. grabs him by the ankle and it starts slowly dragging him back in.
3669.44 3693.72 speaker6  Well, first of all, as it's happening, I'm yelling, not tight. Tight.
3691.88 3705.96 speaker2  No sign of Rumple foreskin. Rumple foreskin is gone. There is no Rumple foreskin to be seen. I'm just trying to say that a few more times before we never hear it again.
3705.12 3711.68 speaker4  Nowhere to be seen.
3707.28 3753.36 speaker2  Ding-dong is being pulled back slowly into this thing and the ground begins to kind of reform itself and right at the last second, right before, you think that ding-dong's entire body is gonna be yoinked down into the hole, but it doesn't quite all make it. And as the ground finishes forming, the head of Brett is just sitting on the ground and you think maybe he himself is just stuck there until slowly the head falls over on its side
3750.36 3761.04 speaker5  That is Charles Chuck, the Chuckster.
3757.80 3788.24 speaker3  Sorry, I'm reacting and sitting here. How do you feel? I'm super intrigued by all these stories. They're really cool, but also they start off like penis joke, Brett, foreskin, military complex and then like, you're dead, you're gone. which makes it even more terrifying. It just lands on you.
3787.16 3897.08 speaker6  Go for it. Yeah.
3892.08 3943.08 speaker5  Find your feet on your broken bones. You're out for the edge again. You're out for the edge again. Yeah.
