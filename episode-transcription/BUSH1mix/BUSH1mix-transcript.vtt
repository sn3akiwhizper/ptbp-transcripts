00:00.000 --> 00:02.240
Well, where the shit am I now?

00:02.240 --> 00:04.940
And when the hell are I?

00:04.940 --> 00:10.600
Let me check my map I got from that interdimensional gas station.

00:10.600 --> 00:13.320
Southwest Arkansas.

00:13.320 --> 00:16.980
There ain't possibly a place named like that.

00:16.980 --> 00:22.420
I guess I better put on a good show no matter where or when I am.

00:22.420 --> 00:23.380
Fuck.

00:23.380 --> 00:27.780
I'm coming at you live from wherever I said earlier.

00:27.780 --> 00:31.500
From 694.2 PTBP.

00:31.500 --> 00:35.820
The only radio station that broadcasts from Arkansas.

00:35.820 --> 00:37.420
Probably.

00:37.420 --> 00:40.260
This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Nathan.

00:40.260 --> 00:44.940
AKA at APOC underscore Golem on Twitter.

00:44.940 --> 00:47.700
From Aberdeen, South Dakota.

00:47.700 --> 00:51.600
Who tweeted about the show and tagged at Pretending Pod.

00:51.600 --> 00:55.140
Which is a praiseworthy thing to do with your fingers.

00:55.140 --> 00:56.700
Nathan writes.

00:56.820 --> 00:58.460
Dearest Edward.

00:58.460 --> 01:00.260
I will see you soon.

01:00.260 --> 01:02.580
I tried to stay strong.

01:02.580 --> 01:03.780
I promised.

01:03.780 --> 01:05.180
And I failed.

01:05.180 --> 01:09.780
I thought I could trap it inside me but now I'm the one trapped.

01:09.780 --> 01:11.580
It is in me now.

01:11.580 --> 01:14.700
It forces me to move against my will.

01:14.700 --> 01:19.420
I scream inside my own head while it makes me do things.

01:19.420 --> 01:21.460
Bad things, Ed.

01:21.460 --> 01:22.860
I'm so sorry.

01:22.860 --> 01:24.620
It comes for you now.

01:24.660 --> 01:29.020
I feel my feet wrench and spasm in a mockery of walking.

01:29.020 --> 01:32.980
As it forces my body to lurch in your direction.

01:32.980 --> 01:34.580
It is patient.

01:34.580 --> 01:35.980
Dearest Edward.

01:35.980 --> 01:37.600
I'm so sorry.

01:37.600 --> 01:39.240
I will see you soon.

01:40.500 --> 01:42.740
Well, you heard the guy, Edward.

01:42.740 --> 01:44.780
He's coming to see you soon.

01:44.780 --> 01:49.100
Sounds like it's gonna be a fun time for you and your BFF.

01:49.100 --> 01:50.400
If you wanna write up something

01:50.400 --> 01:53.140
for your arken-saucy wolf to howl,

01:53.140 --> 01:55.300
tag at PretendingPod on Twitter

01:55.300 --> 01:58.700
or write a five-star review on Apple Podcasts

01:58.700 --> 02:01.740
or I guess also two more things.

02:01.740 --> 02:05.740
Tag at PretendingPod on Instagram, fuck Mark Zuckerberg

02:05.740 --> 02:08.100
or tag pretending to be people on Facebook,

02:08.100 --> 02:11.300
fuck Mark Zuckerberg.

02:11.300 --> 02:13.280
We love it when people are excited

02:13.280 --> 02:15.540
to tell their friends about our show here

02:15.540 --> 02:18.520
but seriously, fuck Mark Zuckerberg.

02:18.520 --> 02:22.420
Maybe Wolfie can give that pasty half alien

02:22.420 --> 02:25.900
the physical delights the human part of him craves.

02:25.900 --> 02:30.300
He ain't never ever met a wolf like me.

02:30.300 --> 02:33.420
And if that excellent pun gave you the blues,

02:33.420 --> 02:37.140
let's see who won in this week's The News.

02:37.140 --> 02:40.620
And that winner from Twitter's mostly bitter litter

02:40.620 --> 02:44.740
is the Twitter outfitter at tdunder-beck

02:44.740 --> 02:49.740
aka Cosplay underscore by underscore Tyler.

02:50.220 --> 02:52.300
He guessed the special guest

02:53.140 --> 02:55.020
who will join Allie, Lindsay, and Taylor

02:55.020 --> 03:00.020
for all five parts of Operation Bigfoot Underground

03:00.180 --> 03:01.620
Search and Hunt.

03:01.620 --> 03:06.620
That's right, Operation Bigfoot Underground Search and Hunt

03:06.820 --> 03:09.660
will be played by the crew who you knew

03:09.660 --> 03:13.580
when they brought you their story in the Contingent Woods

03:13.580 --> 03:18.380
alongside Eleanor DiLorenzo, the delightful creator

03:18.380 --> 03:21.380
and GM of the Lost Mountain saga,

03:21.380 --> 03:24.780
a dedicated role player on the Glass Cannon Network's

03:24.780 --> 03:28.940
Androids and Aliens, the foul-mouthed Twitch streamer

03:28.940 --> 03:32.100
who once laughed so hard she could barely breathe

03:32.100 --> 03:36.020
after reading the name Mike Oxmaul.

03:36.020 --> 03:38.620
Well, better not dwell on that name.

03:38.620 --> 03:42.020
My mouth might get jealous of all that nasty trash

03:42.020 --> 03:44.060
going in the wrong hole.

03:44.060 --> 03:48.700
Let's fill them ears with something that clears the gears.

03:48.740 --> 03:51.580
It's Molly Healy with Circles.

03:51.580 --> 03:53.420
["Circles"]

04:01.420 --> 04:03.420
["Circles"]

04:18.700 --> 04:20.700
["Circles"]

04:32.820 --> 04:34.620
I'm glad you were honest with us.

04:34.620 --> 04:35.900
Yes.

04:35.900 --> 04:36.900
We're cutting this out.

04:36.900 --> 04:39.100
That's requesting my first cut.

04:39.100 --> 04:39.940
Oh no, the Thomas Roll.

04:39.940 --> 04:41.420
Oh no, it's staying in.

04:41.420 --> 04:43.940
Fuck, Allie, you said it.

04:43.940 --> 04:47.460
Oh no, it was just about to get cut.

04:47.460 --> 04:50.260
Welcome to Pretending to Be People.

04:50.260 --> 04:54.820
I am here with a whole table of special guests here.

04:54.820 --> 04:57.340
We're going to go around the table here.

04:57.340 --> 04:59.300
We're going to start with,

04:59.300 --> 05:02.140
she's played Gerald Fingersen.

05:02.140 --> 05:05.820
She played Sharon Shadow Berryman.

05:05.820 --> 05:08.780
She does the sound of phone calls.

05:08.780 --> 05:11.500
Ring, ring, ring, ring.

05:11.500 --> 05:13.380
It's my wife, Borat Voice.

05:13.380 --> 05:14.220
Taylor.

05:14.220 --> 05:16.020
Hello, I'm his wife.

05:16.060 --> 05:17.580
Did that work the opposite way?

05:19.380 --> 05:20.340
I don't think so.

05:20.340 --> 05:21.180
Anyway, hi.

05:21.180 --> 05:25.100
We have Liz Lonklin, the Doc Martin wearing punk,

05:25.100 --> 05:29.620
the designer of the infamous PTBP fanny pack

05:29.620 --> 05:33.340
that I fucking promise will exist one day.

05:33.340 --> 05:35.100
It's Lindsay.

05:35.100 --> 05:36.820
Hello, I'm Lindsay.

05:38.140 --> 05:38.980
Nailed it.

05:38.980 --> 05:41.980
Just top notch, boom town.

05:41.980 --> 05:44.940
She played Krista Krinklehoff.

05:44.980 --> 05:46.300
It's still hard to say.

05:47.980 --> 05:50.620
She played a bro bot named Brett.

05:50.620 --> 05:52.100
She's my new coworker.

05:52.100 --> 05:53.580
Thanks for getting me the job.

05:53.580 --> 05:54.980
It's Ali.

05:54.980 --> 05:56.220
Hello, I am Ali.

05:56.220 --> 05:57.980
I regret getting him the job.

05:57.980 --> 06:01.380
I'm loud and in the, well, I used to be in the office,

06:01.380 --> 06:03.500
but now no one's in the office.

06:03.500 --> 06:05.020
Woo.

06:05.020 --> 06:08.100
And finally, she's an actor.

06:08.100 --> 06:09.980
She's a standup comedian.

06:09.980 --> 06:11.660
She's a Twitch streamer.

06:11.660 --> 06:13.820
She's a player on Glass Cannon Network,

06:13.820 --> 06:16.500
Starfinder podcast, Androids and Aliens.

06:16.500 --> 06:19.460
She's the creator and GM of her own show,

06:19.460 --> 06:21.140
The Lost Mountain Saga,

06:21.140 --> 06:24.220
which is getting a season two coming soon.

06:24.220 --> 06:27.540
It's Eleanor DiLorenzo, Lindsay.

06:27.540 --> 06:30.380
Woo.

06:30.380 --> 06:32.060
Thanks for the applause, guys.

06:32.900 --> 06:33.740
Thanks.

06:35.340 --> 06:36.180
Oh, there it is.

06:36.180 --> 06:37.740
It was a little delay.

06:37.740 --> 06:40.580
I request that the rest of us also get a echo out.

06:40.580 --> 06:43.340
I'm so sorry.

06:43.340 --> 06:48.340
Honestly, it's doing Eleanor DiLorenzo, it's very good.

06:48.540 --> 06:52.460
No, but also Taylor Reeve, she's the worst of the game.

06:56.460 --> 06:58.220
So today we're playing Delta Green.

06:58.220 --> 07:02.420
I know that that is new to Eleanor here.

07:02.420 --> 07:03.420
Eleanor, are you excited?

07:03.420 --> 07:05.260
I am incredibly excited.

07:05.260 --> 07:06.900
I've been wanting to play this game

07:06.900 --> 07:08.380
ever since I heard about it the first time,

07:08.380 --> 07:11.340
which was in, I don't know, doesn't matter,

07:11.340 --> 07:12.940
but I have been wanting to play it

07:12.940 --> 07:15.300
for a really, really long time.

07:15.300 --> 07:19.340
And I'm so excited that you guys invited me to play

07:19.340 --> 07:22.100
because it seems like you guys know what you're doing

07:22.100 --> 07:24.060
or maybe that's just...

07:24.060 --> 07:25.820
Oh, that's funny.

07:27.220 --> 07:29.100
One of us at this table does.

07:29.100 --> 07:29.940
It's good.

07:29.940 --> 07:31.420
It's good to have your confidence.

07:31.420 --> 07:32.260
It's me.

07:32.740 --> 07:33.580
It's me.

07:35.900 --> 07:38.740
So a quick rundown of Delta Green.

07:38.740 --> 07:39.940
It's a role-playing game.

07:39.940 --> 07:41.060
Okay, moving on.

07:41.060 --> 07:41.900
So...

07:43.500 --> 07:45.020
That's all you need to know.

07:46.140 --> 07:48.860
Delta Green is a role-playing game about...

07:48.860 --> 07:49.700
Oh, no.

07:51.780 --> 07:55.500
How are you so good on all those other podcasts?

07:55.500 --> 07:57.980
Listen, I've been drunk for the past five years.

07:57.980 --> 07:58.940
I don't even know.

07:58.940 --> 08:03.940
I'm doing dry January.

08:04.060 --> 08:06.460
So this is the first time I'm playing Delta Green

08:06.460 --> 08:09.180
without a beer in my hand in a long time.

08:09.180 --> 08:10.020
Wow.

08:10.020 --> 08:10.860
Congratulations.

08:10.860 --> 08:12.820
It's also till 10 in the morning.

08:12.820 --> 08:14.260
Yup, still would have done it.

08:14.260 --> 08:15.900
Not a doubt in my mind.

08:15.900 --> 08:17.620
It's Saturday.

08:17.620 --> 08:18.820
Saturday's for the boys.

08:18.820 --> 08:20.820
Saturday's for the boys.

08:22.580 --> 08:23.980
So Delta Green is a role-playing game

08:23.980 --> 08:27.420
about losing your mind or dying

08:27.420 --> 08:29.980
in the process of trying to stop

08:29.980 --> 08:32.140
the inevitable end of the world.

08:32.140 --> 08:33.060
Oh, really?

08:33.060 --> 08:34.740
I thought it was a romantic comedy.

08:34.740 --> 08:36.740
Someone told me it was like a period piece

08:36.740 --> 08:39.220
set in the 19th century Britain.

08:39.220 --> 08:41.020
Yup, based on menstruation.

08:41.020 --> 08:42.660
19th century Arkansas.

08:45.020 --> 08:46.380
We are playing...

08:46.380 --> 08:49.940
This game will be set in Mississippi and Arkansas tonight.

08:49.940 --> 08:51.380
We're gonna kick it off in Mississippi

08:51.380 --> 08:53.740
and then drive on up to Arkansas,

08:53.740 --> 08:56.940
which Eleanor, you had to do some research

08:56.940 --> 08:58.580
on...

08:58.580 --> 08:59.820
What do you mean Mississippi?

08:59.820 --> 09:00.660
I thought it was...

09:00.660 --> 09:01.620
Oh God, I thought it was...

09:01.620 --> 09:05.700
Wait, Mississippi the river or Mississippi the...

09:05.700 --> 09:07.340
It's a city, right?

09:07.340 --> 09:08.940
We're just gonna meet...

09:08.940 --> 09:10.900
The characters are gonna meet in Shreveport,

09:10.900 --> 09:12.060
which is in Mississippi,

09:12.060 --> 09:13.780
but then you're gonna drive into Arkansas.

09:13.780 --> 09:16.140
You don't need to know anything about Mississippi

09:16.140 --> 09:20.420
other than what should she know about Mississippi?

09:20.420 --> 09:21.420
How to spell it.

09:21.420 --> 09:24.180
M-I-S-S-I-S-S-I-P-P-I.

09:24.180 --> 09:26.060
I've been swimming in the Mississippi.

09:26.100 --> 09:28.300
Wait, you swam in the Mississippi?

09:28.300 --> 09:30.580
Maybe, or I took a piss in it.

09:30.580 --> 09:31.860
Actually, that's a Swedish saying.

09:31.860 --> 09:33.460
Take a piss in the Mississippi.

09:34.540 --> 09:36.460
Actually, that's what my mom says all the time.

09:36.460 --> 09:38.860
Like when something is irrelevant,

09:38.860 --> 09:40.220
it's like fart in space,

09:40.220 --> 09:42.100
but we also say it's a piss in Mississippi.

09:42.100 --> 09:44.380
Oh, that's really good.

09:44.380 --> 09:46.700
Yeah, P-I-S-S-I-S-S-I-P-P-I.

09:46.700 --> 09:49.540
Piss is hippie.

09:49.540 --> 09:51.260
Piss is hippie.

09:51.260 --> 09:52.820
Has anyone ever thought of that?

09:52.820 --> 09:53.820
Are we the first?

09:53.820 --> 09:55.100
Oh my God.

09:55.100 --> 09:55.940
Google it.

09:55.940 --> 09:57.260
Google it before you tweet it.

09:57.260 --> 09:58.420
Google it.

09:58.420 --> 10:01.340
Okay, so just gonna give you a rundown.

10:01.340 --> 10:03.100
So normally Delta Green is a game

10:03.100 --> 10:05.940
with a lot of really fantastic scenarios

10:05.940 --> 10:07.020
that are written for it

10:07.020 --> 10:09.500
and published by Arc Dream Publishing,

10:09.500 --> 10:12.300
which is a publishing company that publishes games

10:12.300 --> 10:14.500
and scenarios for Delta Green.

10:14.500 --> 10:16.180
However, instead of running

10:16.180 --> 10:20.340
one of their extremely well-written and edited scenarios,

10:20.340 --> 10:22.140
I'm gonna run you through something I wrote

10:22.140 --> 10:24.260
that's just in a Google doc here.

10:24.260 --> 10:25.100
Hell yeah.

10:34.100 --> 10:36.140
All right, well.

10:36.140 --> 10:38.740
I don't think Zach's killing children in this.

10:38.740 --> 10:39.940
Based on his face.

10:39.940 --> 10:42.580
Gonna run a different scenario.

10:42.580 --> 10:43.500
Don't worry about it.

10:43.500 --> 10:46.500
Kill as many children you want and puppies.

10:46.500 --> 10:47.340
Monster.

10:48.700 --> 10:51.100
That's what I was waiting to hear.

10:52.100 --> 10:56.940
All right, so let's meet these characters, shall we?

10:56.940 --> 10:58.220
Let's dive in here.

10:58.220 --> 11:02.220
Let's go in alphabetical order of first name

11:02.220 --> 11:04.380
of real life human.

11:04.380 --> 11:05.700
Allie.

11:05.700 --> 11:06.540
Hello.

11:06.540 --> 11:07.380
Who is your character?

11:07.380 --> 11:08.260
What's she look like?

11:08.260 --> 11:09.420
What's her deal?

11:09.420 --> 11:10.380
What's she been up to?

11:10.380 --> 11:11.620
Give us the rundown.

11:11.620 --> 11:12.540
I would love to.

11:12.540 --> 11:13.380
Thank you.

11:13.380 --> 11:15.060
I'm gonna pull up my summary of my character.

11:15.060 --> 11:16.060
Thank you.

11:16.060 --> 11:18.020
You guys all, I asked this group

11:18.020 --> 11:19.740
to answer some questions that I'd sent

11:19.900 --> 11:22.220
and then to write a little bit of backstory

11:22.220 --> 11:24.580
about how they ran into the unnatural.

11:24.580 --> 11:29.580
And all four of you did an absolutely stellar job.

11:29.700 --> 11:31.980
Should we do season two together as a group

11:31.980 --> 11:33.460
instead of the normal?

11:33.460 --> 11:36.380
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

11:36.380 --> 11:37.220
Bye.

11:38.660 --> 11:40.420
Okay, my name is.

11:40.420 --> 11:41.860
Joke.

11:41.860 --> 11:45.100
Oh no, not again.

11:46.420 --> 11:47.620
Do you remember that?

11:47.620 --> 11:48.900
I remember that it's a joke.

11:48.940 --> 11:50.140
I just don't remember why.

11:50.140 --> 11:51.460
You started it.

11:51.460 --> 11:53.780
This happens to me all the time.

11:53.780 --> 11:56.860
I'm just making so many jokes all the time.

11:56.860 --> 11:57.940
All right, here we go.

11:57.940 --> 12:00.460
My name is Rusty Hooch.

12:01.620 --> 12:03.180
I am a scientist.

12:03.180 --> 12:06.580
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

12:06.580 --> 12:07.980
I am a scientist.

12:09.780 --> 12:11.220
I didn't choose my name.

12:11.220 --> 12:12.340
My parents did.

12:12.340 --> 12:13.260
They chose your last name?

12:13.260 --> 12:14.100
Yeah, totally.

12:14.100 --> 12:14.940
So you're Dr. Hooch?

12:14.940 --> 12:15.780
I'm Dr. Hooch.

12:15.780 --> 12:16.620
Rad.

12:16.620 --> 12:17.460
Yeah.

12:17.460 --> 12:18.300
The Hooch.

12:18.540 --> 12:19.980
They call me Rusty.

12:19.980 --> 12:21.900
What kind of science do you do?

12:21.900 --> 12:24.700
Mostly like potions and stuff.

12:24.700 --> 12:26.900
Ha ha ha ha ha.

12:26.900 --> 12:29.180
Well, I did just win a Nobel Prize

12:29.180 --> 12:30.660
for curing mad cow disease.

12:30.660 --> 12:31.620
Congratulations.

12:31.620 --> 12:32.820
Did you do it with potions?

12:32.820 --> 12:35.300
I did it with potions.

12:35.300 --> 12:39.180
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

12:39.180 --> 12:41.460
I'm hoping to cure tinnitus next.

12:41.460 --> 12:42.300
Okay, yes.

12:42.300 --> 12:45.700
And also the emotion sadness

12:45.700 --> 12:47.740
because I think it's unnecessary.

12:47.780 --> 12:49.700
Unnecessary emotion sadness.

12:49.700 --> 12:51.220
Unnecessary negative emotion,

12:51.220 --> 12:54.260
which I will be curing with potions.

12:54.260 --> 12:55.180
I love this so much.

12:55.180 --> 12:56.900
How old is she?

12:56.900 --> 12:57.980
47.

12:57.980 --> 12:59.380
47 going on 53.

12:59.380 --> 13:01.220
Going on 53.

13:01.220 --> 13:05.060
A Nobel Prize winner at 47

13:05.060 --> 13:06.740
we're amongst a genius.

13:06.740 --> 13:08.340
In the presence of greatness.

13:08.340 --> 13:11.820
I'm also very hot.

13:11.820 --> 13:12.660
Yeah.

13:12.660 --> 13:13.500
Okay.

13:13.500 --> 13:14.340
I love you so much.

13:14.340 --> 13:15.180
Just let that be known.

13:15.180 --> 13:16.500
What's your charisma score?

13:17.500 --> 13:18.340
Nine.

13:18.340 --> 13:21.660
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

13:21.660 --> 13:23.220
That's like the lowest charisma

13:23.220 --> 13:24.580
you can have to start.

13:25.780 --> 13:26.620
Good.

13:26.620 --> 13:28.620
Because you said that

13:28.620 --> 13:30.780
your character leans into like.

13:30.780 --> 13:32.180
Yeah, I'm kind of mean.

13:32.180 --> 13:34.140
People see me as kind of

13:34.140 --> 13:35.660
an obsessive relentless bitch,

13:35.660 --> 13:36.620
but I would never have been able

13:36.620 --> 13:37.900
to cure mad cow disease

13:37.900 --> 13:39.700
if I wasn't a relentless bitch.

13:39.700 --> 13:41.020
What's your haircut?

13:41.020 --> 13:43.460
Short, blonde.

13:43.460 --> 13:44.300
Bangs.

13:44.300 --> 13:45.580
Bangs.

13:45.620 --> 13:46.700
I don't know where I got that.

13:46.700 --> 13:47.620
Also, I'm hot.

13:47.620 --> 13:48.940
Don't forget.

13:48.940 --> 13:51.220
And what are you typically wearing?

13:51.220 --> 13:53.660
Normally black trench coat.

13:54.660 --> 13:57.020
Probably some pearl earrings.

13:57.020 --> 13:59.140
Whatever your hot people wear

13:59.140 --> 14:00.260
is what I'm normally wearing.

14:00.260 --> 14:01.100
My God.

14:01.100 --> 14:02.460
I'm sensing a lot of Robin

14:02.460 --> 14:04.500
Robin Wright from House of Cards.

14:04.500 --> 14:06.100
Like that sort of vibe.

14:06.100 --> 14:07.620
Yes.

14:07.620 --> 14:08.500
Yeah.

14:08.500 --> 14:09.980
But hotter.

14:09.980 --> 14:10.820
But hotter.

14:10.820 --> 14:11.660
Oh wow.

14:11.660 --> 14:13.820
But hotter and Nobel Prize winner.

14:13.820 --> 14:14.660
I love it.

14:14.660 --> 14:15.500
Exactly.

14:16.260 --> 14:17.380
Humble.

14:17.380 --> 14:18.220
And humble.

14:21.060 --> 14:21.900
All right.

14:21.900 --> 14:22.740
Give me a rundown.

14:22.740 --> 14:23.980
What was your experience like

14:23.980 --> 14:25.940
the first time you saw something unnatural?

14:25.940 --> 14:27.460
Let me tell you about it.

14:27.460 --> 14:30.420
So I was flying my DA40 home.

14:30.420 --> 14:31.460
I have a DA40.

14:31.460 --> 14:32.300
A small plane.

14:32.300 --> 14:33.140
Of course.

14:33.140 --> 14:33.980
The DA40.

14:33.980 --> 14:34.820
Yeah, I know.

14:34.820 --> 14:35.660
I looked it up.

14:35.660 --> 14:36.500
Yeah, so I own one

14:36.500 --> 14:38.700
and I know a lot about it

14:38.700 --> 14:40.740
and I know how to fly it.

14:40.740 --> 14:42.860
So I was flying it home

14:42.860 --> 14:44.940
to my secret cabin in the woods

14:44.940 --> 14:47.500
that none of my children or ex-wives know about

14:47.500 --> 14:49.100
because I like my privacy.

14:49.100 --> 14:49.940
Smart.

14:49.940 --> 14:53.100
So one night I was flying my Diamond DA40 home

14:53.100 --> 14:57.940
and I saw a gigantic explosion come from the woods

14:57.940 --> 14:59.020
but I didn't hear it.

14:59.020 --> 15:01.140
It was completely silent.

15:01.140 --> 15:04.860
It was blue and wet looking.

15:04.860 --> 15:05.700
Ew.

15:08.700 --> 15:09.700
Thank you for that.

15:09.700 --> 15:11.660
Silent and wet and blue.

15:11.660 --> 15:12.900
Silent and wet.

15:12.900 --> 15:15.180
So I landed my plane nearby,

15:15.180 --> 15:19.700
ran down the road to where I thought I was close to it,

15:19.700 --> 15:22.860
hiding because I was afraid of who might be back there.

15:22.860 --> 15:26.460
And then five minutes later I saw six black escalates

15:26.460 --> 15:27.940
drive past on the road.

15:27.940 --> 15:29.220
I was hiding in a bush.

15:29.220 --> 15:31.380
Also my plane was covered by a...

15:31.380 --> 15:33.660
No need to get too deep into the weeds.

15:33.660 --> 15:34.620
My plane was hidden.

15:34.620 --> 15:36.420
Into the weeds that are covering your plane.

15:36.420 --> 15:38.540
And they couldn't see it.

15:38.540 --> 15:40.500
Anyway, then I ran to the side of the explosion

15:40.500 --> 15:41.620
and there was nothing.

15:41.620 --> 15:42.540
I couldn't see anything.

15:43.020 --> 15:43.860
Nothing was different.

15:43.860 --> 15:46.100
Not a leaf turned.

15:46.100 --> 15:47.340
Not a branch broken.

15:47.340 --> 15:48.860
Not a stone unturned.

15:48.860 --> 15:50.900
Not a stone turned.

15:50.900 --> 15:54.340
Ever since then, whenever I'm flying my Diamond DA40 home,

15:54.340 --> 15:55.420
that I know how to fly.

15:55.420 --> 15:56.260
Brag.

15:57.260 --> 15:59.340
A brag about a fictional character.

15:59.340 --> 16:01.700
So I've just been seeing a lot of these silent explosions

16:01.700 --> 16:05.020
but I can't seem to get close enough to see what's going on.

16:05.020 --> 16:06.420
How many X's do you have?

16:07.620 --> 16:08.700
Hard to say.

16:08.700 --> 16:09.580
Science is easy.

16:09.580 --> 16:10.540
Counting is hard.

16:10.540 --> 16:11.740
Three, at least three.

16:11.780 --> 16:14.300
Well, some marriages were like, you know,

16:15.700 --> 16:16.860
Vegas marriages.

16:16.860 --> 16:17.700
Do those count?

16:17.700 --> 16:18.860
Like that's kind of a half marriage.

16:18.860 --> 16:20.100
Legally, they do, yeah.

16:20.100 --> 16:23.580
So your most recent one is...

16:23.580 --> 16:24.420
Oh, Jillian.

16:24.420 --> 16:25.780
Yes, Jillian.

16:25.780 --> 16:30.300
Jillian didn't sign a prenup before we got married.

16:30.300 --> 16:31.580
That's my bad.

16:31.580 --> 16:32.420
Smart lady.

16:32.420 --> 16:33.540
You would think I would have learned my lesson.

16:33.540 --> 16:36.380
So she's receiving quite a bit of alimony from me right now,

16:36.380 --> 16:37.660
unfortunately.

16:37.660 --> 16:40.140
But I'm rich, so it's fine.

16:40.180 --> 16:43.260
Rich and hot, rich and hot, humble and fucking smart.

16:43.260 --> 16:44.860
Genius.

16:44.860 --> 16:46.340
Ally, when you play a role playing game,

16:46.340 --> 16:49.020
you're supposed to create a character

16:49.020 --> 16:51.100
that is different than yourself

16:51.100 --> 16:53.860
to try to embody someone else.

16:53.860 --> 16:56.260
Yeah, because I actually am a pilot in real life.

16:56.260 --> 16:57.100
Really?

16:57.100 --> 16:57.940
And I have a diamond DA40.

16:57.940 --> 16:59.340
I thought you were gonna say pile of garbage.

16:59.340 --> 17:01.180
I don't know why.

17:01.180 --> 17:02.980
I'm a pile of garbage.

17:02.980 --> 17:04.380
Yes, Eleanor, I am a pilot.

17:04.380 --> 17:06.100
No, stop lying to Eleanor.

17:07.260 --> 17:08.940
I'm so disappointed now.

17:10.740 --> 17:13.020
I was like, oh, I could hire her as my pilot

17:13.020 --> 17:15.940
when I become rich, famous, noble, priceless.

17:15.940 --> 17:17.300
Okay, no, I'll learn.

17:17.300 --> 17:18.140
I'll learn.

17:18.140 --> 17:19.220
Yes, please.

17:19.220 --> 17:20.300
Tell me about Belvedere.

17:20.300 --> 17:24.020
Oh, so Jillian and I share custody of a...

17:25.980 --> 17:27.140
Dog.

17:27.140 --> 17:29.900
Hold on, no, I have to actually look up at the dog.

17:29.900 --> 17:31.900
Saint Bernard.

17:31.900 --> 17:34.700
My ex-wife Jillian and I share custody of a Saint Bernard.

17:34.700 --> 17:36.220
His name is Belvedere.

17:36.220 --> 17:37.340
I love him very much.

17:37.340 --> 17:39.140
I have him on the weekends.

17:39.140 --> 17:41.340
We take a lot of hikes, but Jillian has him

17:41.340 --> 17:42.180
during the week.

17:42.180 --> 17:43.460
It's Monday night.

17:43.460 --> 17:47.140
You're getting ready to go drop off Belvedere at Jillian's.

17:47.140 --> 17:49.900
This is the last moment that you get to spend

17:49.900 --> 17:52.300
with your beloved Saint Bernard

17:52.300 --> 17:55.780
before he goes and spends the week with Jillian

17:55.780 --> 17:59.500
and her money that you pay her.

17:59.500 --> 18:00.340
My money.

18:03.420 --> 18:07.460
All of a sudden you hear cars, more than one,

18:07.500 --> 18:08.860
they're pulling up outside.

18:09.900 --> 18:12.740
You look out the window, you see the string

18:12.740 --> 18:17.220
of those black SUVs, and they are lining your driveway,

18:17.220 --> 18:20.820
but only one guy is walking up to the door and he knocks.

18:22.700 --> 18:25.740
He keeps knocking.

18:26.620 --> 18:28.620
Boom, boom, boom, boom.

18:30.620 --> 18:31.460
Yes!

18:32.700 --> 18:33.540
I mean, you couldn't help yourself.

18:33.540 --> 18:34.380
I just helped yourself.

18:34.380 --> 18:36.220
He couldn't help yourself.

18:36.220 --> 18:37.420
Maybe I could.

18:38.340 --> 18:39.180
Sound person.

18:42.620 --> 18:44.260
Are you a fully artist?

18:44.260 --> 18:45.420
I don't know what that means.

18:45.420 --> 18:47.900
We have to get through all of these.

18:49.700 --> 18:52.340
This whole episode is just Allie's introduction.

18:54.220 --> 18:58.300
Allie, banging now on your door.

18:58.300 --> 18:59.220
I don't answer.

18:59.220 --> 19:00.060
Banging.

19:01.140 --> 19:02.700
Louder and louder.

19:02.700 --> 19:03.940
Is Belvedere upset?

19:07.420 --> 19:10.660
Okay, I answered the door very reluctantly,

19:10.660 --> 19:13.540
and I don't have one of those locks on the top of the door,

19:13.540 --> 19:15.500
the chain locks, and I don't undo that.

19:15.500 --> 19:17.380
Dr. Rusty Hooch?

19:17.380 --> 19:19.180
Yes, can I see some identification, please?

19:19.180 --> 19:20.460
What are you doing at my house?

19:20.460 --> 19:21.460
Yeah, no problem.

19:21.460 --> 19:25.380
He holds up his hand as if he's holding a badge

19:25.380 --> 19:26.220
of some sort.

19:26.220 --> 19:28.420
There's literally nothing in his hand.

19:28.420 --> 19:31.540
And he says, you don't really need to know who I am.

19:31.540 --> 19:34.420
We've been following you, and we understand

19:34.420 --> 19:36.860
that you've been noticing some situations

19:37.180 --> 19:39.420
that have been happening out in the woods.

19:39.420 --> 19:41.940
I think due to some of your expertise,

19:41.940 --> 19:43.180
we're gonna need your help.

19:43.180 --> 19:44.420
I don't know what you're talking about.

19:44.420 --> 19:45.580
I don't go in the woods.

19:45.580 --> 19:46.700
I live in the city.

19:46.700 --> 19:48.860
Dr. Hooch.

19:48.860 --> 19:52.340
And he calls out your plane's number,

19:52.340 --> 19:54.260
like your ID number.

19:54.260 --> 19:55.180
Look around you.

19:56.260 --> 19:57.860
What am I supposed to be seeing right now?

19:57.860 --> 20:00.020
Well, I suppose it's your choice.

20:00.900 --> 20:03.700
Do you see all those SPVs down there?

20:03.700 --> 20:04.540
Yes.

20:04.540 --> 20:06.500
You can come with us.

20:06.500 --> 20:07.980
Maybe you'll learn something.

20:09.660 --> 20:10.980
All right, well, I have to take Belvedere

20:10.980 --> 20:12.460
to Jillian's house, my ex-wife,

20:12.460 --> 20:13.900
because she has them during the week.

20:13.900 --> 20:16.620
So I'll come with you, but I gotta take my dog first.

20:16.620 --> 20:18.740
Any chance that I can get you to leave your dog here

20:18.740 --> 20:19.580
until we're done?

20:19.580 --> 20:20.460
It won't take too long.

20:20.460 --> 20:21.460
It's a legal issue.

20:21.460 --> 20:23.420
I'll really get in a lot of trouble from Jillian

20:23.420 --> 20:26.460
if I don't have him there by 10 p.m. on Monday night.

20:26.460 --> 20:28.380
We're gonna have you back by 10.

20:28.380 --> 20:29.340
Oh, all right, all right.

20:29.340 --> 20:31.380
As long as we can get Belvedere to Jillian, fine.

20:31.380 --> 20:32.700
I'll go with you.

20:32.700 --> 20:34.340
Okay, so you guys head out.

20:34.380 --> 20:36.180
You get into an SUV.

20:36.180 --> 20:39.220
It's actually empty, this one, except for a driver,

20:39.220 --> 20:43.380
and this unidentified man gets into the car with you,

20:43.380 --> 20:46.100
and he begins asking you about how many times

20:46.100 --> 20:49.900
you've seen these silent blue explosions.

20:50.820 --> 20:52.900
You guys pull up to a small camp in the woods

20:52.900 --> 20:56.780
that's being run out of the back of a big truck.

20:56.780 --> 20:59.620
So there's just this one covered truck

20:59.620 --> 21:02.900
with a bunch of lab equipment inside of it,

21:02.900 --> 21:05.540
computers going, scientists running around

21:05.540 --> 21:06.780
talking to each other.

21:06.780 --> 21:09.020
There's a bunch of military-looking guys

21:09.020 --> 21:13.660
who are not wearing camo or any sort of military gear.

21:13.660 --> 21:17.060
One of them approaches you with a, it's like a jar.

21:17.060 --> 21:18.020
It's not a mason jar.

21:18.020 --> 21:19.740
It's far more scientific.

21:19.740 --> 21:22.460
It seems to be sealed on both sides.

21:22.460 --> 21:27.460
It looks like a high-tech version of the bank teller thing

21:27.620 --> 21:29.420
that you put in the tube, right?

21:29.420 --> 21:34.220
And it is filled with this like bioluminescent blue liquid.

21:34.220 --> 21:37.900
We're hoping that you can reverse engineer this.

21:37.900 --> 21:39.540
I'm gonna need to know some more information

21:39.540 --> 21:41.180
before I do anything for y'all.

21:41.180 --> 21:42.420
Do you know who I am?

21:42.420 --> 21:45.500
I just won a Nobel Prize for inventing mad cow disease.

21:45.500 --> 21:47.340
I'm gonna need some context.

21:47.340 --> 21:48.180
It's not gonna hooch.

21:48.180 --> 21:49.940
We know exactly who you are.

21:49.940 --> 21:52.900
Let's show her some context.

21:52.900 --> 21:57.580
And a couple of the military guys go over to one of the SUVs

21:57.580 --> 22:01.180
and pull out a guy who is bound.

22:01.180 --> 22:04.340
He's wearing just like the raddest old clothes

22:04.340 --> 22:05.660
you've ever seen.

22:05.660 --> 22:08.020
Looks like he hasn't showered in months.

22:08.020 --> 22:09.820
Filthy, filthy dude.

22:09.820 --> 22:11.820
He's just kinda like dazed.

22:11.820 --> 22:13.140
Looks like he's been drugged.

22:13.140 --> 22:15.420
They kinda pull him out into the middle

22:15.420 --> 22:18.100
of this clearing in the woods.

22:18.100 --> 22:19.900
All right, come with me, come with me.

22:19.900 --> 22:21.300
He walks you over to this guy

22:21.300 --> 22:23.780
who's just kinda like put down on his knees,

22:23.780 --> 22:27.180
hands tied behind his back, feet are bound.

22:27.700 --> 22:31.300
And he opens up this container and it, oh, sorry, Taylor,

22:31.300 --> 22:33.060
do you wanna do the opening of the container?

22:33.060 --> 22:34.380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:34.380 --> 22:35.220
Psst.

22:39.820 --> 22:40.780
Got it in one.

22:40.780 --> 22:41.620
Nailed it.

22:44.780 --> 22:49.780
He puts a finger in this like bioluminescent goop

22:50.060 --> 22:53.340
and it kind of sticks to him like paint.

22:53.340 --> 22:57.980
And then he draws a symbol on this bound man's forehead

22:57.980 --> 23:02.220
and it kind of looks like waves that have teeth,

23:02.220 --> 23:03.940
this weird symbol.

23:03.940 --> 23:06.420
And then he closes the container.

23:06.420 --> 23:07.660
Taylor?

23:07.660 --> 23:08.780
Psst.

23:08.780 --> 23:10.340
Pfft.

23:10.340 --> 23:11.180
God.

23:13.460 --> 23:14.300
It's art.

23:15.180 --> 23:16.860
And he starts counting down.

23:18.220 --> 23:21.900
39, 37.

23:21.940 --> 23:24.020
And he says, we're gonna wanna get away.

23:24.020 --> 23:28.620
42, 38, 35.

23:28.620 --> 23:31.660
And you guys are walking and you see that other people

23:31.660 --> 23:34.260
are walking extremely quickly.

23:34.260 --> 23:36.180
And he is not, he's chilling.

23:36.180 --> 23:38.140
He kinda turns back.

23:38.140 --> 23:40.820
Are you ready to see the craziest thing you've ever seen?

23:40.820 --> 23:42.980
I highly doubt this is gonna be the craziest thing

23:42.980 --> 23:43.820
I've ever seen.

23:43.820 --> 23:48.420
I've seen my dog take a giant shit in my Diamond DA40.

23:49.300 --> 23:50.580
In it.

23:50.580 --> 23:54.500
A bioluminescent explosion begins to pour out

23:54.500 --> 23:58.940
of the bound dude's face and fill the ground around you.

23:58.940 --> 24:01.780
And it begins to create a massive dome

24:01.780 --> 24:03.300
that is engulfing this guy

24:03.300 --> 24:06.140
and then slowly expands and takes over.

24:06.140 --> 24:08.500
And as it's taking over, the guy looks at you next to you

24:08.500 --> 24:10.580
and he's like, it would be all right.

24:11.900 --> 24:13.620
This blue hits your face.

24:13.620 --> 24:17.940
Your hair blows back and suddenly you see inside

24:17.940 --> 24:22.340
and you are standing in seemingly the middle of the ocean.

24:22.340 --> 24:25.380
You see all of this wildlife around you.

24:25.380 --> 24:28.740
Fish, schools of fish swimming together.

24:28.740 --> 24:31.300
Sharks, part of a whale at the dome

24:31.300 --> 24:32.780
on the far side away from you.

24:32.780 --> 24:35.340
And there's coral everywhere and it's dark

24:35.340 --> 24:37.900
and it's blue and it's glowing.

24:37.900 --> 24:42.900
And then suddenly it just collapses in on itself.

24:43.860 --> 24:48.860
The only change is that this bound dude is gone.

24:50.740 --> 24:52.100
What the fuck?

24:55.620 --> 24:56.780
Shit.

24:56.780 --> 24:59.460
Well, so first I checked my pocket mirror

24:59.460 --> 25:02.380
to check my hair since it got messed up.

25:02.380 --> 25:04.020
So I fixed my hair first.

25:06.460 --> 25:08.100
As you're staring at yourself,

25:08.100 --> 25:12.660
you see that your lips and your eyes,

25:12.660 --> 25:15.860
your nostrils, your eyebrows,

25:15.860 --> 25:20.380
everything on your face is fucking trembling.

25:20.380 --> 25:24.380
You've never seen yourself look this shook.

25:26.740 --> 25:28.700
I'm going to sue the shit out of you motherfuckers.

25:28.700 --> 25:29.860
What did you just do to me?

25:29.860 --> 25:32.100
You get a phone call from Jillian.

25:32.100 --> 25:34.660
I walk up into the woods to take this call.

25:34.660 --> 25:37.860
And that is Dr. Rusty Hooch.

25:37.860 --> 25:39.220
Oh my God.

25:39.220 --> 25:40.260
Holy shit.

25:40.260 --> 25:42.100
Holy shit.

25:42.100 --> 25:42.940
Radical, radical, radical.

25:42.940 --> 25:45.540
It's now a good time to say that I'm afraid of sharks.

25:47.060 --> 25:48.540
In real life or the character?

25:48.540 --> 25:49.380
In real life.

25:49.380 --> 25:50.220
Oh, for real?

25:50.220 --> 25:52.500
In the character, yeah.

25:52.500 --> 25:54.740
Okay, Ellie.

25:54.740 --> 25:55.580
Oh my God.

25:55.580 --> 25:56.780
You're up.

25:56.780 --> 25:58.420
Give me a rundown.

25:58.420 --> 26:00.580
Dr. Olivia Miller.

26:00.580 --> 26:03.700
I based this off of the Swedish crime dramas

26:03.700 --> 26:06.660
because every protagonist in Swedish crime dramas

26:06.660 --> 26:08.620
is the exact same dude.

26:08.620 --> 26:11.260
But in this case, I just made it a female.

26:11.260 --> 26:15.620
Early fifties, incredibly tired woman.

26:15.620 --> 26:18.900
Like everything about her is so freaking over it.

26:18.900 --> 26:20.980
Like mentally tired, physically tired.

26:20.980 --> 26:23.820
She has two daughters.

26:23.820 --> 26:25.020
One of them won't speak to her

26:25.020 --> 26:27.460
because she's a 15 year old little bitch.

26:27.460 --> 26:31.500
And the other one is off to college,

26:31.500 --> 26:33.020
but it's like teen daughters.

26:33.020 --> 26:35.820
We all know, we all know what they're like.

26:35.820 --> 26:40.820
She was recently left by her husband for a younger model.

26:41.580 --> 26:45.020
And she's just so freaking tired.

26:45.020 --> 26:46.380
You know, she's a workaholic.

26:46.380 --> 26:47.220
She's a surgeon.

26:47.220 --> 26:48.700
She's a very brilliant surgeon.

26:48.700 --> 26:51.820
She's been doing that for a long time

26:51.820 --> 26:54.580
and people call her for the tough cases.

26:54.580 --> 26:58.980
But since everything else in her life sort of fell apart,

26:58.980 --> 27:02.220
she's been really burying herself in work.

27:02.220 --> 27:04.340
Takes on extra hours.

27:04.340 --> 27:07.300
She's on call almost all the time.

27:07.300 --> 27:10.660
And she's gained a couple of extra pounds

27:10.660 --> 27:12.180
because she's not taking care of herself.

27:12.180 --> 27:14.260
She picked up smoking because it was the only thing

27:14.260 --> 27:16.420
that sort of calmed her nerves.

27:16.420 --> 27:18.980
Even though she knows it's wrong, she's a doctor.

27:18.980 --> 27:21.500
Lots of fast food, very little exercise.

27:21.500 --> 27:26.220
And the idea I had in my head for her was Bill Murray

27:26.220 --> 27:29.060
because of this constant through the signs, sad face,

27:29.060 --> 27:30.940
but like a female version.

27:31.940 --> 27:33.300
It's amazing.

27:33.300 --> 27:36.260
I'm picturing Kate Winslet in mayor of East town.

27:36.260 --> 27:37.580
I don't know if you saw that.

27:37.580 --> 27:40.860
Yeah, that's very exactly that type of like,

27:40.860 --> 27:43.340
because that's basically every crime drama

27:43.340 --> 27:46.780
of like this resigned brilliant detective

27:46.780 --> 27:50.020
just being so freaking like tired of everything.

27:50.020 --> 27:53.220
But then like, well, I've seen worse or have I, you know.

27:53.220 --> 27:54.900
Are there any happy detectives?

27:54.900 --> 27:55.740
I don't think so.

27:55.740 --> 27:58.180
I don't think you can be happy and be a detective,

27:58.180 --> 28:00.460
but we shall see maybe in this game.

28:00.500 --> 28:02.300
Maybe she'll find joy.

28:02.300 --> 28:06.020
Yes, I think in this game, we'll find joy.

28:06.020 --> 28:06.860
Yeah, psych.

28:06.860 --> 28:08.580
That's true.

28:08.580 --> 28:09.540
God, that show is great.

28:09.540 --> 28:14.140
Eleanor, you've created like the opposite character from Ally.

28:16.260 --> 28:20.100
The two doctors, Dr. Rusty Hooch and Dr. Olivia Miller,

28:20.100 --> 28:24.340
both in name and juxtaposition could not be further

28:24.340 --> 28:25.180
from each other.

28:25.180 --> 28:29.380
Fun thing though, my charisma is 13, so I'm charming,

28:29.420 --> 28:30.540
which I didn't realize.

28:32.540 --> 28:34.780
But she's also started sleeping with her neighbor

28:34.780 --> 28:37.460
because that's like the one, also another takeaway.

28:37.460 --> 28:40.700
And so her neighbor kind of wants something more to happen,

28:40.700 --> 28:42.180
but she's just like, no, no,

28:42.180 --> 28:46.060
this is a very transactional thing going on.

28:46.060 --> 28:49.380
But it's one of her bonds because they sort of drink whiskey

28:49.380 --> 28:52.620
and play chess together or something boring.

28:53.780 --> 28:56.940
I was about to say that sounds fun.

28:56.940 --> 28:58.820
Yeah, I wrote for her tagline,

28:59.260 --> 29:02.820
she's technically a lovely woman in need of a hug

29:02.820 --> 29:04.380
and hopefully other things.

29:06.060 --> 29:08.660
What was it, the occult or the unnatural or whatever?

29:08.660 --> 29:10.100
The unnatural.

29:10.100 --> 29:11.740
Yeah, when you asked that question,

29:11.740 --> 29:13.460
I was just like, wait, what?

29:13.460 --> 29:15.940
Because I thought for some reason thought this was like,

29:15.940 --> 29:17.980
I've been trying to not read up on Delta Green

29:17.980 --> 29:21.540
because I love going into something spoiler free.

29:21.540 --> 29:24.740
And then I'm like, so there is an element of unnatural

29:24.740 --> 29:26.660
because people have told me it's terrifying,

29:26.660 --> 29:30.620
but I wasn't sure if it was like murder mystery terrifying

29:30.620 --> 29:33.660
or if it's like, you know, unnatural, but now I know.

29:33.660 --> 29:34.660
And so-

29:34.660 --> 29:36.460
Little column A, little column B.

29:36.460 --> 29:39.540
I envisioned her to say she's a very good surgeon.

29:39.540 --> 29:43.460
She was called in for this weird case,

29:43.460 --> 29:48.060
an autopsy of a corpse and what she found out

29:48.060 --> 29:49.500
as she was doing it,

29:49.500 --> 29:54.060
she had to extract this thing out of the body,

29:54.060 --> 29:58.380
this black gooey blob of fat, basically.

29:58.380 --> 30:00.620
And as she was picking it up really carefully,

30:00.620 --> 30:03.540
it started like moving in a way

30:03.540 --> 30:05.180
that suggested it's still alive.

30:06.260 --> 30:09.300
And then she had to move it into a separate jar

30:09.300 --> 30:12.620
and some people in black suits just took it away.

30:12.620 --> 30:15.100
No more questions needed, so to speak.

30:15.100 --> 30:17.700
Awesome, so awesome.

30:17.700 --> 30:20.380
Dr. Olivia Miller, it's a school night.

30:20.380 --> 30:24.580
And strangely, your 15-year-old

30:24.580 --> 30:28.580
has requested a movie night with her mom.

30:28.580 --> 30:30.660
This is very out of the ordinary.

30:31.620 --> 30:32.460
How do you react?

30:32.460 --> 30:34.220
What movie do you suggest?

30:34.220 --> 30:37.100
Oh, I've heard that the latest

30:37.100 --> 30:38.900
Downton Abbey movie just came out.

30:39.740 --> 30:40.900
Would you like to watch that?

30:40.900 --> 30:45.100
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, let's do that.

30:45.100 --> 30:48.140
Or we can watch a Star War.

30:50.380 --> 30:55.380
Okay, no, the Downton Abbey sounds nice, actually.

30:56.620 --> 31:00.180
Just something calming would be good.

31:01.100 --> 31:02.060
I'm sorry.

31:02.060 --> 31:03.980
Are you okay, honey?

31:03.980 --> 31:05.060
Is everything all right?

31:05.060 --> 31:05.900
It's fine.

31:05.900 --> 31:10.900
It's just, can we talk for a second?

31:11.660 --> 31:12.500
Of course.

31:13.820 --> 31:15.020
Let me just...

31:15.020 --> 31:17.060
Your front door starts rattling

31:17.060 --> 31:19.060
and someone is just boom, boom, boom, boom.

31:19.060 --> 31:21.540
Jesus, honey, please, just sit down.

31:21.540 --> 31:22.500
I'll get you a...

31:23.780 --> 31:26.540
Dr. Miller, Dr. Miller!

31:26.540 --> 31:28.820
Fucking Christ, what is it?

31:28.820 --> 31:30.260
And she walks over to the door.

31:30.260 --> 31:32.100
If you peek your head through the window

31:32.100 --> 31:33.660
or see through the peephole,

31:33.660 --> 31:36.780
you see that the team of those men

31:36.780 --> 31:41.060
who took away the jar with that fatty tissue

31:41.060 --> 31:43.700
that seemed to be alive in it last time,

31:43.700 --> 31:46.380
they are here at your home

31:46.380 --> 31:51.380
and they have in custody a woman

31:51.700 --> 31:55.580
who is shaking violently and screaming,

31:55.580 --> 31:57.580
please, just fucking kill me!

31:57.580 --> 31:59.900
Just fucking kill me!

31:59.900 --> 32:04.380
All right, she quickly opens the door because-

32:04.380 --> 32:05.220
They barge in.

32:05.220 --> 32:07.380
They just boom, barge in, take over.

32:07.380 --> 32:10.460
The men slam this woman on your kitchen table

32:10.460 --> 32:12.940
and this woman is just like, please, please, kill me!

32:12.940 --> 32:14.380
Doctor, doctor, we need you to...

32:14.420 --> 32:16.900
Sorry, she's not dead yet, but we have to remove it.

32:16.900 --> 32:17.820
You have to remove it.

32:17.820 --> 32:19.340
Do you have any equipment here?

32:19.340 --> 32:20.180
Of course.

32:20.180 --> 32:22.740
And immediately she goes into professional mode

32:22.740 --> 32:25.220
and takes out her medical equipment

32:25.220 --> 32:27.940
and starts ordering everyone around like,

32:27.940 --> 32:31.020
you, get me a towel, you there, start heating up,

32:31.020 --> 32:34.140
like start disinfecting my tools and that she-

32:34.140 --> 32:36.380
Yeah, somebody's got the stove going,

32:36.380 --> 32:38.940
you got towels coming in, we got everything you need.

32:38.940 --> 32:41.300
They've knocked off your bar cart.

32:41.300 --> 32:43.860
They've like shoved everything off the top of the bar cart

32:44.220 --> 32:46.700
and put it next to the table to put all the supplies on it.

32:46.700 --> 32:50.500
And she looks at her daughter though, like, Laura, please,

32:50.500 --> 32:51.340
I need you to-

32:51.340 --> 32:52.780
What is happening?

32:52.780 --> 32:54.460
Honey, you need to go to your room right now.

32:54.460 --> 32:56.060
We need to go to your room and you stay there

32:56.060 --> 32:57.020
and I'll find you soon.

32:57.020 --> 32:58.860
Okay, and you're right back to business

32:58.860 --> 33:01.580
and you're looking over the situation.

33:01.580 --> 33:03.900
You see on this woman's neck,

33:03.900 --> 33:05.540
there's just this kind of like,

33:08.340 --> 33:13.340
pulsating sack of fat and fluid.

33:14.620 --> 33:15.460
Meow.

33:16.740 --> 33:21.380
She tries to do like an incision or like tries to-

33:21.380 --> 33:23.820
Try and roll surgery for me.

33:23.820 --> 33:26.260
Ooh, my first roll.

33:26.260 --> 33:30.140
You said, okay.

33:31.060 --> 33:33.900
Oh, I don't know, that's probably a fail.

33:33.900 --> 33:38.900
It's 83 and I think I did put, oh no.

33:39.140 --> 33:39.980
Yeah, that's a fail.

33:39.980 --> 33:42.220
I only have 15 surgery, fuck.

33:42.220 --> 33:46.060
As you cut it open, this fatty tissue begins to pour out

33:46.060 --> 33:48.900
like you've seen it kind of jiggle in your hand earlier.

33:48.900 --> 33:50.140
It's moving on its own.

33:50.140 --> 33:51.300
It busts out.

33:51.300 --> 33:53.000
You've accidentally cut it.

33:53.000 --> 33:54.100
Your hand has slipped.

33:54.100 --> 33:56.380
You didn't just cut through the skin.

33:56.380 --> 33:58.920
You actually cut into the tissue itself.

33:58.920 --> 34:02.700
The thing begins to unfold and twist itself inside out

34:02.700 --> 34:07.700
as it turns to dust and this dust flies up into the nose

34:08.080 --> 34:10.700
of one of these black-suited agents

34:10.740 --> 34:13.460
and immediately one of the other agents goes,

34:13.460 --> 34:17.220
oh, fucking Jason, pulls his gun and fires it

34:17.220 --> 34:18.860
into the back of this guy's head.

34:18.860 --> 34:21.660
As he hits the ground in your kitchen,

34:21.660 --> 34:24.940
he fires three more times shattering the tile

34:24.940 --> 34:26.820
underneath this guy's head.

34:26.820 --> 34:28.880
You just had the kitchen redone.

34:30.000 --> 34:32.660
You look over and at the end of the hallway,

34:32.660 --> 34:37.660
you see your 15-year-old daughter is just staring in shock

34:38.660 --> 34:40.480
from behind her door.

34:40.700 --> 34:45.700
That's Dr. Olivia Miller.

34:46.020 --> 34:47.540
Jesus Christ.

34:47.540 --> 34:51.900
Hey, Ellie, Eleanor, welcome to Delta Green.

34:51.900 --> 34:55.580
Yeah, oh my God.

34:55.580 --> 34:56.420
Oh my God.

34:56.420 --> 34:57.820
Well, cool.

34:57.820 --> 34:58.660
Cool, cool, cool.

35:02.300 --> 35:04.900
Next up, it's Lindsay.

35:04.900 --> 35:05.740
Alphabetically.

35:05.740 --> 35:06.560
Lindsay.

35:06.560 --> 35:07.400
Hello.

35:07.400 --> 35:10.040
Tell me about, what is this character's name?

35:11.180 --> 35:14.380
Doreen Maureen, if you will.

35:14.380 --> 35:15.980
Really just Doreen and then anything

35:15.980 --> 35:17.700
that rhymes with Doreen.

35:17.700 --> 35:18.600
Oh, anything.

35:20.140 --> 35:21.380
If you go on for too long,

35:21.380 --> 35:23.500
are we gonna call you Doreen Boring?

35:23.500 --> 35:24.700
Yes, yes.

35:24.700 --> 35:26.980
Boom, if you know a lot about the setting,

35:26.980 --> 35:28.740
we'll call you Doreen Loring.

35:28.740 --> 35:29.580
Oh my God.

35:29.580 --> 35:34.120
When you go swimming, we call you Doreen Chlorine.

35:37.460 --> 35:38.780
Genius name.

35:38.780 --> 35:40.180
Doreen's pretty simple.

35:41.620 --> 35:46.620
She's, just imagine like simple, super down to earth.

35:46.620 --> 35:50.100
She's a fed agent, she's 45

35:50.100 --> 35:52.780
and she doesn't really have a whole lot of friends.

35:52.780 --> 35:54.740
She has a very, very small group of friends

35:54.740 --> 35:57.900
and then it's just like no family anywhere close.

35:57.900 --> 36:02.900
It's just me and my whippet, which is my-

36:03.460 --> 36:05.260
Your drug of choice.

36:05.260 --> 36:06.100
Gotcha, boom.

36:07.020 --> 36:08.300
Y'all ever done nitrous?

36:08.300 --> 36:13.100
It's both that and it is a type of dog.

36:13.100 --> 36:16.100
It's a, imagine a teeny tiny gray hound.

36:16.100 --> 36:18.900
A little scared, a little shaky, really thin.

36:18.900 --> 36:20.300
That's my dog.

36:20.300 --> 36:23.340
She's pretty lonely, but likes it that way.

36:23.340 --> 36:24.940
So she's pretty run down.

36:24.940 --> 36:26.700
She's got like box dyed hair.

36:26.700 --> 36:29.820
It's grown out quite a bit since last time she's dying.

36:29.820 --> 36:32.660
So she's got some dark gray roots coming in.

36:32.660 --> 36:34.220
She's got some sunken eyes

36:34.220 --> 36:37.380
and she just wears like super baggy clothes and-

36:37.420 --> 36:39.580
Baggy clothes that I believe you wrote.

36:41.980 --> 36:43.220
Baggy clothes like she's ready

36:43.220 --> 36:44.980
to shoplift a bag of marshmallows.

36:47.820 --> 36:50.580
That's how I'm referring to all baggy clothes from now on.

36:50.580 --> 36:53.980
Like she's ready to shoplift a bag of marshmallows.

36:53.980 --> 36:54.820
She's ready.

36:57.020 --> 37:01.340
Yeah, so she's more fun on the page than in person.

37:01.340 --> 37:02.700
Her favorite-

37:02.700 --> 37:05.260
She's more fun on the page than in person.

37:05.260 --> 37:08.100
A perfect character for a role-playing game.

37:11.100 --> 37:13.460
Yeah, she's always just like got pockets full

37:13.460 --> 37:15.980
of like the wrapping of hard candy.

37:15.980 --> 37:19.660
I got a pocket full of hard candy, oh my God.

37:19.660 --> 37:20.500
I'm so tired.

37:20.500 --> 37:22.220
When you leaned into the mic, Allie,

37:22.220 --> 37:24.420
I expected you to join me.

37:24.420 --> 37:25.700
No, I'm exhausted.

37:27.260 --> 37:28.900
So disappointed.

37:28.900 --> 37:29.860
God damn it.

37:29.860 --> 37:31.620
And then, yeah, it's either that

37:31.620 --> 37:34.340
or just some loose Mentos in there all the time.

37:34.380 --> 37:35.700
She just got trash in her car.

37:35.700 --> 37:37.500
I got a pocket full of loose Mentos.

37:39.580 --> 37:41.180
I'm not even gonna look at you.

37:42.900 --> 37:45.260
I tried to join, but then I just, I just couldn't.

37:45.260 --> 37:46.100
I'm sorry.

37:46.940 --> 37:50.300
She spends a lot of her extra time just like scrolling

37:50.300 --> 37:53.540
on Pinterest on her iPad and like petting her with it.

37:53.540 --> 37:54.940
Jesus Christ.

37:54.940 --> 37:57.260
Honestly, that's all you needed to say

37:57.260 --> 38:00.380
to get a full idea of who this woman is.

38:00.380 --> 38:01.380
I know this woman.

38:01.380 --> 38:02.220
I know this woman.

38:02.220 --> 38:03.540
She just scrolls Pinterest on her iPad.

38:04.420 --> 38:07.420
I know who this is based off of someone I know.

38:07.420 --> 38:08.260
Your mom?

38:08.260 --> 38:09.100
Is it your mom?

38:09.100 --> 38:09.940
It's based off of my mom.

38:09.940 --> 38:12.420
I was gonna say, it sounds like I was doing a burn,

38:12.420 --> 38:14.500
but I think it's probably, she's just literally my mom.

38:14.500 --> 38:15.340
Is it your fucking mom?

38:15.340 --> 38:17.180
He's just your fucking mom.

38:18.540 --> 38:21.940
She religiously listens to this podcast, you know.

38:24.540 --> 38:25.820
I think she would be appalled.

38:25.820 --> 38:26.660
She would.

38:26.660 --> 38:27.580
She absolutely would.

38:27.580 --> 38:29.060
Mom, if you're listening to this,

38:29.060 --> 38:31.380
only portions of this are based off of your mom.

38:31.380 --> 38:32.580
Not for moms.

38:33.340 --> 38:34.860
Except for Eleanor.

38:34.860 --> 38:36.100
She can listen.

38:36.100 --> 38:37.540
That mom can listen.

38:37.540 --> 38:38.380
Eleanor, you're allowed to listen.

38:38.380 --> 38:39.540
Otherwise, not for moms.

38:41.220 --> 38:44.260
I think we have a lot of mom listeners, actually.

38:44.260 --> 38:46.940
I'm so sorry I discriminated against the mom community.

38:46.940 --> 38:47.780
I didn't mean it.

38:47.780 --> 38:50.980
Can you, I mean, if you're at home all day

38:50.980 --> 38:54.540
caring for your child, what better to listen to than-

38:54.540 --> 38:56.020
Horror comedy.

38:56.020 --> 38:56.900
Oh, for sure.

38:56.900 --> 38:59.780
On behalf of all moms, I am incredibly offended,

38:59.780 --> 39:01.340
but also a little aroused.

39:03.580 --> 39:05.340
I think that's a green light.

39:10.340 --> 39:12.180
All right, I think we know who this woman is

39:12.180 --> 39:14.060
just based off that comment alone,

39:14.060 --> 39:19.060
so let's dive into her experience with the unnatural.

39:19.820 --> 39:21.460
All right, her experience,

39:21.460 --> 39:24.220
it's caused a lot of trauma for Doreen.

39:24.220 --> 39:26.700
I was called in on a murder case.

39:26.700 --> 39:28.340
I had been working on this case for a while,

39:28.340 --> 39:30.180
and I, oh, and do I need to read it in my case?

39:30.180 --> 39:32.300
Hey, I don't know if you're gonna do a fresh person, maybe.

39:32.860 --> 39:33.700
One night.

39:33.700 --> 39:34.540
There we go.

39:34.540 --> 39:36.260
I get this call one night,

39:36.260 --> 39:39.140
and it's from an unknown number.

39:39.140 --> 39:40.780
So I answer the phone,

39:40.780 --> 39:42.380
and somebody's telling me to meet them

39:42.380 --> 39:45.020
at a location I'm unaware of.

39:45.020 --> 39:47.000
I didn't know this place existed.

39:47.000 --> 39:48.500
I decide it's a good idea

39:48.500 --> 39:50.100
since this case has been going for a while

39:50.100 --> 39:52.740
and I'm really tired of it, ready to end this case.

39:52.740 --> 39:54.780
So I show up at this house.

39:54.780 --> 39:55.860
I open the front door

39:55.860 --> 39:58.100
because the door's just kind of leaning open a little bit.

39:58.100 --> 39:59.620
When I walk in,

39:59.620 --> 40:02.820
everything is just covered in black rubber,

40:02.820 --> 40:04.460
the walls, the ceilings.

40:04.460 --> 40:07.380
You can see that there are things in this house,

40:07.380 --> 40:09.940
but they're all just covered in this black rubber.

40:11.540 --> 40:13.100
Sorry, I got...

40:13.100 --> 40:13.940
Sorry.

40:13.940 --> 40:14.760
You spooked yourself?

40:14.760 --> 40:15.600
I scared myself.

40:15.600 --> 40:16.440
Oh, my God.

40:16.440 --> 40:17.260
No, I scared.

40:17.260 --> 40:18.100
Are you really scared of rubber?

40:18.100 --> 40:19.620
It was Ramona.

40:19.620 --> 40:20.460
It was Ramona.

40:20.460 --> 40:21.660
Okay, I'm sorry.

40:21.660 --> 40:22.820
I could smell the rubber.

40:22.820 --> 40:24.180
I can smell it.

40:25.020 --> 40:30.020
It reminded me of the time I forgot to use a rubber.

40:33.580 --> 40:36.100
Why do all my jokes keep going back to condoms?

40:36.100 --> 40:38.500
Condoms and condoms.

40:38.500 --> 40:40.220
I gave penis on the brain.

40:41.740 --> 40:42.780
Penis on the brain.

40:42.780 --> 40:44.620
Penis, penis on the brain.

40:44.620 --> 40:46.660
No one wanted to keep going on that.

40:48.660 --> 40:49.500
I danced.

40:51.100 --> 40:52.500
All right.

40:52.540 --> 40:53.820
Everything inside of this house

40:53.820 --> 40:55.180
is just lined in this rubber,

40:55.180 --> 40:57.900
and it's thick, and it's weird, and it's soft,

40:57.900 --> 41:00.080
and it's making me really uneasy.

41:00.080 --> 41:01.200
So a dick.

41:04.300 --> 41:05.500
As I'm walking through this house,

41:05.500 --> 41:07.860
I start to hear a little bit of laughter,

41:08.700 --> 41:13.700
and it's really creepy, really uneasy.

41:14.520 --> 41:15.700
It's somewhere in the house.

41:15.700 --> 41:16.620
I don't know where it is,

41:16.620 --> 41:18.180
but it's somewhere in this house.

41:18.180 --> 41:20.340
I gotta find who's laughing at me.

41:23.500 --> 41:24.860
The laughter gets stronger.

41:26.060 --> 41:28.180
So I pull out my gun,

41:28.180 --> 41:29.980
and I start walking around gun first,

41:29.980 --> 41:33.380
and I'm looking for where this noise is coming from,

41:33.380 --> 41:36.500
and all of a sudden I see something not covered

41:36.500 --> 41:39.620
in this black rubber, and it's this big old mirror,

41:39.620 --> 41:41.660
and it looks really old, antique,

41:41.660 --> 41:43.880
and it's all rusty on the edges.

41:43.880 --> 41:46.460
And as I'm looking into this mirror,

41:46.460 --> 41:49.560
I see these two little kids,

41:49.560 --> 41:51.740
and they're staring right back at me,

41:51.820 --> 41:53.100
and they're just covered in blood

41:53.100 --> 41:55.540
like someone's just been beaten up.

41:55.540 --> 41:56.380
I'm sorry.

41:58.580 --> 42:01.460
Like someone's just been beaten up.

42:01.460 --> 42:03.280
You immediately recoiled.

42:07.500 --> 42:08.460
Covered in blood.

42:08.460 --> 42:09.660
Covered in blood.

42:09.660 --> 42:11.220
Just covered from head to toe.

42:11.220 --> 42:13.820
I turn to see what they're doing.

42:13.820 --> 42:15.060
They're standing behind me a little bit.

42:15.060 --> 42:17.060
I turn, and they're not there.

42:17.060 --> 42:18.980
So I turn back, I look at the mirror,

42:18.980 --> 42:20.420
and they start melting.

42:20.420 --> 42:22.060
They're melting into this metallic,

42:22.060 --> 42:24.440
silver, metal-looking lava.

42:25.340 --> 42:26.600
Now they're really in the room with me,

42:26.600 --> 42:27.940
but they're just two puddles of lava,

42:27.940 --> 42:31.220
and they start coming right at me, rolling towards me.

42:31.220 --> 42:34.980
And as I get closer, I start losing my bearings,

42:34.980 --> 42:37.500
and so I start running out of the building,

42:37.500 --> 42:39.040
only to find when I get outside

42:39.040 --> 42:43.380
that there are a bunch of agents in black cars and suits

42:43.380 --> 42:44.900
pointing their gun at me.

42:44.900 --> 42:45.860
I didn't know what to do.

42:45.860 --> 42:48.820
I got called here by someone who I don't know,

42:48.820 --> 42:52.260
so I just start running away in a zigzag pattern,

42:52.260 --> 42:53.860
and I'd never seen them since.

42:55.660 --> 42:58.060
That was the end of my story, though, so.

42:58.060 --> 42:58.900
Dope story.

42:58.900 --> 43:00.300
Terrifying.

43:00.300 --> 43:01.140
Thanks.

43:01.140 --> 43:02.500
The next time we see Doreen Marine,

43:03.780 --> 43:05.100
that'd be hard,

43:05.100 --> 43:07.940
she is on the stand in a courtroom.

43:07.940 --> 43:11.700
It's a bright, sunny day, the sun rays are coming in

43:11.700 --> 43:14.180
through the windows, across one side,

43:14.180 --> 43:16.620
onto half of the people watching.

43:16.620 --> 43:19.340
The lawyer in a smart suit is asking questions

43:19.340 --> 43:22.660
about what happened in that house.

43:22.660 --> 43:26.240
You can see one of those people in the black suits

43:26.240 --> 43:28.680
that were outside, the woman who was up front.

43:29.580 --> 43:33.020
She's sitting in the back row, and she's just staring.

43:34.580 --> 43:36.260
The lawyer continues.

43:36.260 --> 43:40.100
So, how long were you inside the house?

43:40.100 --> 43:40.940
Oh, I don't know.

43:40.940 --> 43:43.820
It couldn't have been longer than maybe 10 minutes.

43:43.820 --> 43:46.020
And did you?

43:46.260 --> 43:49.380
She laughs and rolls her eyes at the jury.

43:49.380 --> 43:53.740
See anything like what the defendant described?

43:53.740 --> 43:54.580
Objection!

43:54.580 --> 43:55.420
Sustained.

43:55.420 --> 43:58.780
Did you see the spooky, melty children in the mirror row?

43:58.780 --> 43:59.620
Objection!

43:59.620 --> 44:00.460
Sustained.

44:00.460 --> 44:02.420
What did you see that night?

44:04.100 --> 44:08.020
I saw them melty, spooky children in the reflection.

44:08.020 --> 44:09.940
There's only one mirror.

44:09.940 --> 44:11.820
I saw them children.

44:11.820 --> 44:12.900
They were coming at me.

44:12.900 --> 44:17.020
The lawyer is just rolling her eyes, looking at the jury.

44:17.020 --> 44:19.180
You literally see some of the jury members

44:19.180 --> 44:21.180
are putting their hands over their mouths

44:21.180 --> 44:25.080
to stifle laughter, and the judge is rubbing his temples.

44:25.980 --> 44:27.860
Cut to the bathroom.

44:27.860 --> 44:30.300
Doreen Marine is splashing water on her face.

44:30.300 --> 44:32.700
Spsh, pow, spsh, spsh, pow.

44:32.700 --> 44:33.700
Ha ha ha ha!

44:35.700 --> 44:36.860
I think I'm getting better at this.

44:36.860 --> 44:37.860
Ha ha ha ha!

44:40.020 --> 44:40.940
When suddenly,

44:43.460 --> 44:46.340
you start to hear laughter from behind you.

44:46.340 --> 44:48.420
Roll sanity for me real quick.

44:48.420 --> 44:49.260
Ooh.

44:53.740 --> 44:55.980
This is a really good teaching moment.

44:55.980 --> 44:57.220
What'd you roll, Lindsay?

44:58.580 --> 44:59.420
88.

44:59.420 --> 45:01.580
Can you say that a little bit louder for me?

45:01.580 --> 45:02.420
88.

45:03.660 --> 45:07.580
So, in Delta Green, when the dice match,

45:07.580 --> 45:10.980
like 88 or 44 or 22 or 11.

45:10.980 --> 45:12.020
What about 55?

45:12.060 --> 45:14.460
That's another one.

45:14.460 --> 45:17.580
When the dice match, it is critical.

45:17.580 --> 45:20.500
So if it's under your score, that's a critical success.

45:20.500 --> 45:22.500
But when it's over your score in Delta Green,

45:22.500 --> 45:25.980
it's called a fumble or a critical failure.

45:25.980 --> 45:30.340
Critical failure on a sanity check is not good,

45:30.340 --> 45:31.860
especially in an introduction

45:31.860 --> 45:35.700
where we haven't really started playing the game yet almost.

45:35.700 --> 45:39.740
So I'm gonna describe this scene from the perspective

45:39.740 --> 45:44.740
of the federal agent who is sitting in the back row

45:44.820 --> 45:47.460
who just walked into this bathroom

45:47.460 --> 45:52.420
to see Doreen Marine kick in the door of the stall

45:52.420 --> 45:56.540
that was behind her with just nothing in her eyes.

45:56.540 --> 46:00.740
She's just gone, blinded by anger and fear.

46:00.740 --> 46:05.740
She is just slamming two kids' heads into the toilet.

46:06.740 --> 46:11.180
Ah, ah, ah, ah, shit, oh, shit, fuck, fuck.

46:11.180 --> 46:14.540
And you see a vape fall out of one of their hands,

46:14.540 --> 46:16.780
which is why they were in this stall together

46:16.780 --> 46:18.580
in the first place, just vaping,

46:18.580 --> 46:20.540
just getting away from the parents for a little bit,

46:20.540 --> 46:22.100
vaping in the bathroom.

46:22.100 --> 46:25.460
This woman pulls you off of these two teens.

46:25.460 --> 46:27.900
What are you doing, what are you doing, what are you doing?

46:27.900 --> 46:29.820
Look at me, Doreen, Doreen, Doreen.

46:29.820 --> 46:34.340
No one believes you, Doreen, Doreen, I believe you.

46:34.340 --> 46:37.340
We have to get out of here, get out of here, get out of here.

46:37.340 --> 46:41.420
And in this fragile state, Doreen's ready to go

46:41.420 --> 46:44.160
with just about anyone who believes her right now.

46:45.420 --> 46:46.620
And two of you get into a car

46:46.620 --> 46:48.600
and you drive to this warehouse.

46:49.620 --> 46:50.820
I don't wanna freak you out,

46:50.820 --> 46:53.940
but what I'm about to show you,

46:53.940 --> 46:57.720
just know that we're doing a good thing.

46:58.900 --> 47:01.860
And she opens up the door of the warehouse

47:01.860 --> 47:06.460
and you just see it is filled with mirrors

47:06.460 --> 47:08.980
and the smell of rubber is in the air.

47:11.940 --> 47:13.940
That's Doreen Maureen.

47:13.940 --> 47:15.380
Good damn.

47:15.380 --> 47:19.780
God, oh my God, oh my God.

47:19.780 --> 47:21.660
So cool, so fucking cool.

47:21.660 --> 47:25.860
You guys all wrote, rad introductions for your characters.

47:25.860 --> 47:27.500
It makes me so happy.

47:27.500 --> 47:30.940
Now we're on to, I think it says here your name is?

47:30.980 --> 47:32.440
The Chuckster.

47:34.700 --> 47:38.100
My born name is Charles,

47:39.320 --> 47:42.020
but most people call me Chuck.

47:42.020 --> 47:43.620
And if you're a close friend,

47:43.620 --> 47:45.740
you call me the Chuckster.

47:49.700 --> 47:50.620
Should I get into it?

47:50.620 --> 47:51.460
Oh yeah, please.

47:51.460 --> 47:54.900
All right, I am about 34 years old.

47:54.900 --> 47:57.100
I just moved out of my parents' house

47:57.100 --> 47:58.900
about six months ago.

47:58.900 --> 48:00.660
Yeah, thank you.

48:01.220 --> 48:02.340
I'm basically a gamer.

48:02.340 --> 48:05.060
I game and I sleep and I eat mac and cheese

48:05.060 --> 48:07.940
in rotation is what I do.

48:07.940 --> 48:11.980
And so I don't have any physical friends per se,

48:11.980 --> 48:14.740
but I'm really tight with my online community of gamers,

48:14.740 --> 48:16.100
of fellow gamers.

48:16.100 --> 48:18.740
So we don't really know a whole lot about each other

48:18.740 --> 48:22.700
other than our gaming tags and what each other eat

48:22.700 --> 48:24.420
and drink, et cetera.

48:24.420 --> 48:28.060
I am also a partier, solo partier.

48:28.060 --> 48:29.620
I'm crushing them beers.

48:29.660 --> 48:32.060
I'm a solo partier.

48:32.060 --> 48:35.860
Crushing them beers day and night as I play my games.

48:35.860 --> 48:36.820
Is that a partier?

48:38.700 --> 48:40.700
In Missouri it is.

48:40.700 --> 48:42.500
Yeah, I mean, I'm talking to my friends.

48:42.500 --> 48:44.140
They're also crushing beers.

48:46.660 --> 48:47.560
I think so.

48:48.780 --> 48:51.260
What else do you want to know about me?

48:51.260 --> 48:52.100
What do you look like?

48:52.100 --> 48:55.380
I am ginger, my ginger.

48:55.380 --> 48:57.100
Oh, a stud.

48:57.100 --> 48:58.740
Yes, of course I am.

49:00.140 --> 49:02.940
I would say I'm like fat strong.

49:02.940 --> 49:03.780
Yeah.

49:03.780 --> 49:07.260
Yeah, I think it's the best way to describe how I look.

49:07.260 --> 49:11.900
About five, six average height and yeah, like fat strong.

49:11.900 --> 49:15.780
So I am very strong, but I got a layer of pudge over it

49:15.780 --> 49:17.700
and I don't like work out or anything.

49:17.700 --> 49:18.780
I guess I have strong thumbs.

49:18.780 --> 49:20.060
Tasty.

49:20.060 --> 49:20.900
From my gaming.

49:23.900 --> 49:25.380
Tasty indeed.

49:25.380 --> 49:28.420
So you are, you were ex-military?

49:28.420 --> 49:30.020
Oh yeah, I'm ex-military.

49:30.020 --> 49:33.580
I don't share this with many people

49:33.580 --> 49:36.860
other than a couple of my tight online community friends,

49:36.860 --> 49:40.620
but I was not dishonorably charged,

49:40.620 --> 49:43.140
but I was like the level below.

49:43.140 --> 49:46.900
Cause I was solo partying a little too hard one night

49:46.900 --> 49:51.020
and maybe did some unsavory activities

49:51.020 --> 49:54.580
involving piss and my Sergeant's bed.

49:55.100 --> 49:57.780
My Sergeant's bed.

49:57.780 --> 49:59.620
Yeah, that is not allowed.

50:00.500 --> 50:01.420
It's not.

50:01.420 --> 50:04.140
Unless the Sergeant's into that sort of thing.

50:04.140 --> 50:06.460
I tell people, I tell people

50:06.460 --> 50:09.620
that I was on a pretty righteous mission,

50:09.620 --> 50:11.060
you know, fighting them baddies

50:11.060 --> 50:13.580
and saving hundreds of children.

50:13.580 --> 50:15.580
I rolled my ankle pretty bad.

50:20.060 --> 50:23.500
So I got the purple heart and the red heart

50:23.500 --> 50:24.780
and a green heart.

50:24.780 --> 50:29.220
And now I'm a veteran of, you know,

50:29.220 --> 50:32.460
the good old USA, getting them checks.

50:32.460 --> 50:34.780
Stolen valor, the character.

50:34.780 --> 50:35.620
I love it.

50:35.620 --> 50:36.460
Great.

50:36.460 --> 50:39.420
All right, so your parents,

50:39.420 --> 50:41.220
you just moved out of their house.

50:41.220 --> 50:42.540
They adore you.

50:42.540 --> 50:45.140
They think that I was honorably discharged

50:45.140 --> 50:48.380
for an injury on the battleground,

50:48.380 --> 50:51.940
but I actually, I actually never,

50:51.940 --> 50:54.260
I actually never saw battle.

50:54.260 --> 50:55.380
Didn't make it there.

50:55.380 --> 50:57.300
I was in my, what's it called?

50:57.300 --> 50:59.620
What you start with when you're practicing for war?

50:59.620 --> 51:00.460
It's the practicing.

51:00.460 --> 51:01.780
The practice battleground.

51:01.780 --> 51:02.900
The practice ground.

51:02.900 --> 51:04.300
I was in the practice round.

51:06.460 --> 51:07.420
What is that called?

51:07.420 --> 51:09.420
You know, you know.

51:09.420 --> 51:12.420
Tweet, tweet at pretending to be people.

51:12.420 --> 51:13.260
Not our tag.

51:15.060 --> 51:17.580
P-T-P-P-P-P-T-T.

51:17.580 --> 51:20.180
Pretending pod to tell her,

51:20.180 --> 51:21.540
are you talking about basic training?

51:22.140 --> 51:22.980
Yeah, that's right.

51:22.980 --> 51:24.180
All right, didn't even make it out of basic.

51:24.180 --> 51:25.020
Sounds good.

51:25.020 --> 51:25.860
Didn't make it out of basic.

51:25.860 --> 51:26.700
Wow.

51:26.700 --> 51:28.100
Yeah, and then I kind of laid low

51:28.100 --> 51:32.660
because I was ashamed and I didn't want my parents to know.

51:32.660 --> 51:37.660
And yeah, then I came back and yeah, stolen valor for sure.

51:38.020 --> 51:40.580
But I was, I mean, I tried to be in the military.

51:40.580 --> 51:42.380
So it's not, it's not that stole.

51:42.380 --> 51:44.060
It's like partial stolen valor.

51:44.060 --> 51:47.420
Question, how hard is it to get into the American military?

51:47.420 --> 51:48.260
Is it hard or is it like-

51:48.260 --> 51:49.980
You just have to have a heartbeat.

51:49.980 --> 51:51.980
So it's Chucky a little pathetic

51:51.980 --> 51:54.220
for not being able to make it out of basic?

51:54.220 --> 51:55.060
Yes.

51:55.060 --> 51:55.900
Yes.

51:55.900 --> 51:56.740
Oh no, Chucky.

51:56.740 --> 51:58.340
I mean, to be fair, we're speaking about things

51:58.340 --> 52:00.700
we know shit, jack shit about, like-

52:00.700 --> 52:01.540
That's fair.

52:01.540 --> 52:03.180
I don't know much about the military.

52:03.180 --> 52:04.020
I don't think Zach does.

52:04.020 --> 52:08.300
The military industrial complex is ruining the world.

52:08.300 --> 52:09.140
Oh God.

52:10.900 --> 52:13.900
They don't appreciate the chucks of the,

52:13.900 --> 52:14.740
you know, of the nation.

52:14.740 --> 52:15.940
All right, how did you,

52:15.940 --> 52:19.260
how did you come to learn about the unnatural?

52:19.260 --> 52:20.100
Yes. Okay.

52:20.100 --> 52:23.500
So I was gaming with my bros, my brosips one night

52:23.500 --> 52:26.220
and I, no, I can't, I'm not allowed to say that.

52:26.220 --> 52:27.060
Oh, sorry.

52:27.060 --> 52:29.020
No, I'm just shaking my head for fun.

52:30.940 --> 52:32.940
Because brosips is a really stupid word.

52:32.940 --> 52:33.780
That's why.

52:37.140 --> 52:40.820
I was gaming with my brosips and we chat on the side,

52:40.820 --> 52:42.420
you know, and then I've got my whole headset

52:42.420 --> 52:44.700
where I'm like screaming into my mic,

52:44.700 --> 52:47.620
but then I get this separate little chat window pop up

52:47.620 --> 52:50.380
and it's like inverse colors, black with white type

52:50.380 --> 52:51.820
and I've never seen it before.

52:51.820 --> 52:54.140
And it's one of my buddies, one of my good buddies.

52:54.140 --> 52:59.140
His screen name is dingdonghashtag451,

52:59.500 --> 53:01.660
who I know to be Brett.

53:01.660 --> 53:02.560
I mean, we're pretty tight.

53:02.560 --> 53:04.860
Like we've been gaming for like two years together

53:04.860 --> 53:06.360
and he sends me this message

53:06.360 --> 53:09.100
and this random like private chat that says,

53:09.100 --> 53:11.220
hey bro, I want to show you something,

53:11.220 --> 53:12.420
but can you be discreet?

53:12.420 --> 53:16.740
And I'm like, of course I can broseph, what's up?

53:16.740 --> 53:19.700
So he sends me this video and I watch it

53:19.700 --> 53:22.260
and it's from the perspective of a guy

53:22.260 --> 53:25.860
and then there's two military type guys in front of him

53:25.860 --> 53:28.260
and they're walking into a forest.

53:28.260 --> 53:30.180
It's nighttime, it's dark.

53:30.180 --> 53:33.420
And we hear this deep groaning sound, like.

53:34.860 --> 53:35.700
Excuse me.

53:35.700 --> 53:36.520
Oh, sorry.

53:36.520 --> 53:38.300
At least let me do my own sound effects.

53:38.300 --> 53:41.060
I don't know who you think you are, sir.

53:41.060 --> 53:42.180
The crooner.

53:42.180 --> 53:43.540
Okay, so it's more like.

53:43.540 --> 53:44.380
Ooh.

53:45.340 --> 53:46.180
Ooh.

53:48.980 --> 53:51.420
Yeah, that's the scariest thing I've ever heard.

53:51.420 --> 53:52.260
Ooh.

53:53.460 --> 53:55.380
Something like that.

53:55.380 --> 53:57.860
And it gets so loud at a point

53:57.860 --> 54:00.780
that I have to turn the volume down as I'm watching it.

54:00.780 --> 54:05.780
They get closer and closer to this clearing that I can see.

54:05.800 --> 54:10.360
And inside the clearing, there is this bottomless pit

54:10.360 --> 54:13.220
with a glowing orange light coming out of it.

54:13.740 --> 54:15.980
And the groaning is so loud at this point

54:15.980 --> 54:18.140
that you can see the men holding their ears.

54:18.140 --> 54:19.520
It's clearly unbearable.

54:19.520 --> 54:21.700
And I've turned my volume down almost to

54:21.700 --> 54:23.220
almost a complete mute.

54:23.220 --> 54:28.100
And then all of a sudden I see this huge black tongue

54:28.100 --> 54:30.900
surface itself out of the bottomless pit,

54:30.900 --> 54:35.300
split into two and wrap itself around the two men

54:35.300 --> 54:36.820
that were holding their ears.

54:36.820 --> 54:39.180
And at this point they've like gone down to their knees

54:39.180 --> 54:40.820
cause it's so difficult to be around.

54:40.860 --> 54:44.580
So tongue split in two, wraps around each of them,

54:44.580 --> 54:47.340
throws them up in the air, catches them,

54:47.340 --> 54:49.420
wraps around again, and then the tongue

54:49.420 --> 54:51.320
goes down into the hole.

54:51.320 --> 54:53.080
At this point, the man holding the camera,

54:53.080 --> 54:56.040
he's like dropped it and he's running away.

54:56.040 --> 54:59.220
But you can still kind of see half that the ground

54:59.220 --> 55:02.320
starts to just mold itself over

55:02.320 --> 55:04.540
and the trees grow back up again.

55:04.540 --> 55:05.780
And it's as if it wasn't there at all.

55:05.780 --> 55:06.700
Oh my God.

55:06.700 --> 55:07.660
Jesus.

55:07.660 --> 55:12.420
So I see this video and I got to keep cool for my boys,

55:12.420 --> 55:14.020
you know, always keeping cool for my boys.

55:14.020 --> 55:17.740
So to Brett, I'm like, dude, so tight,

55:17.740 --> 55:20.420
like whatever this is, I'm in.

55:20.420 --> 55:24.060
But I'm like completely tense.

55:24.060 --> 55:26.620
And I don't know much about this personally,

55:26.620 --> 55:28.580
but I believe that maybe my ball sack

55:28.580 --> 55:30.180
has like gone into my body.

55:30.180 --> 55:31.180
Is that a thing that happens?

55:31.180 --> 55:33.160
Yeah, that's definitely a thing that would happen.

55:33.160 --> 55:36.580
Maybe not the sack itself going into your body,

55:36.580 --> 55:39.500
but the testicles would definitely coil up.

55:39.500 --> 55:41.380
Yeah, which would shrink the sack.

55:41.380 --> 55:44.820
Okay, so shrunken sack for me.

55:46.820 --> 55:49.540
It's the shrunken sack for me.

55:49.540 --> 55:51.420
Also, I didn't say what my screen name is.

55:51.420 --> 55:53.180
We got the episode title.

55:55.180 --> 55:56.560
I didn't say what my screen name is,

55:56.560 --> 55:59.180
but it's a Ballbuster 420, hell yeah.

56:00.700 --> 56:02.860
And it's the complete screen name.

56:02.860 --> 56:05.680
Okay, eventually you get a message from Brett again,

56:05.680 --> 56:08.920
ding dong, hashtag 451, which by the way,

56:08.920 --> 56:12.640
Taylor was like, did you guys notice?

56:12.640 --> 56:16.640
The D in ding and the G in dong for capital

56:18.880 --> 56:23.800
for a very, yeah, very subtle reference to Delta Green.

56:23.800 --> 56:24.640
Wow.

56:27.160 --> 56:29.680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

56:29.680 --> 56:31.680
You brought, most of you probably,

56:31.680 --> 56:32.520
yeah, wouldn't have gotten that, but.

56:32.520 --> 56:34.400
Ellie, are you okay?

56:34.400 --> 56:35.240
I'm like, what?

56:35.240 --> 56:37.840
You guys are brilliant masterminds.

56:37.840 --> 56:40.520
I did not see that, thank you.

56:42.600 --> 56:44.480
Brett's gonna come pick you up

56:44.480 --> 56:47.120
and you're gonna head out.

56:47.120 --> 56:50.600
He's gonna take you to meet some of his friends, yeah?

56:50.600 --> 56:51.440
Yeah.

56:51.440 --> 56:52.260
Yeah, you're joining up.

56:52.260 --> 56:55.180
All right, so he takes you to,

56:55.180 --> 56:59.680
okay, so it's like the most recent holy tongue site, right?

56:59.680 --> 57:01.200
So we're calling that thing the holy tongue.

57:01.200 --> 57:03.480
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it.

57:03.520 --> 57:04.360
Holy tongue.

57:04.360 --> 57:05.800
It doesn't have holes in it, it's split into,

57:05.800 --> 57:06.640
oh, it goes in the hole, I get it.

57:06.640 --> 57:08.120
Nice, all right, you get it.

57:08.120 --> 57:11.580
So we've tracked it down to this corn field, right?

57:11.580 --> 57:13.680
Okay, so we're gonna head on out

57:13.680 --> 57:16.160
and as you guys get there, there's this corn field,

57:16.160 --> 57:19.960
there's a couple tents set up, dudes on laptops,

57:19.960 --> 57:22.560
a couple military bros hanging out.

57:22.560 --> 57:25.280
All right, so we're going in with a third guy,

57:25.280 --> 57:27.040
come on over here, come on over here.

57:27.040 --> 57:30.280
And this dude walks up and he's like, yo,

57:30.320 --> 57:32.880
Bill, we're nice to, oh shit, not Bill,

57:32.880 --> 57:35.200
Bill, not Bill, gamertags?

57:35.200 --> 57:37.760
Yeah, sorry, it's a rumple foreskin, what up?

57:37.760 --> 57:38.600
How's it going?

57:38.600 --> 57:41.400
And he puts out a fist for you to bump.

57:41.400 --> 57:46.400
I go for the fist, but then I do the octopus,

57:46.440 --> 57:47.280
is that what it is?

57:47.280 --> 57:48.320
Jesus fucking Christ.

57:48.320 --> 57:50.880
Squid, is it a squid?

57:50.880 --> 57:52.400
So I squid him.

57:52.400 --> 57:53.240
Oh!

57:55.560 --> 57:57.560
You inked me, bro.

57:57.600 --> 58:00.960
And then I grab his arm and then I go in for a bro hug.

58:00.960 --> 58:03.800
Oh yeah, you guys slap the shit out of each other's backs.

58:05.240 --> 58:06.800
Dude, I knew you'd be tight.

58:06.800 --> 58:08.640
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, tight as hell, bro.

58:08.640 --> 58:09.480
All right, sick.

58:09.480 --> 58:11.900
So plan is, what we're gonna do,

58:11.900 --> 58:13.660
this thing is probably gonna come up,

58:13.660 --> 58:16.520
hey nerd, when's this thing popping up?

58:16.520 --> 58:19.560
And this dude on the computer is like,

58:19.560 --> 58:23.200
huge sigh, pushes up his glasses and is like,

58:24.760 --> 58:25.960
14 minutes.

58:27.640 --> 58:29.080
So we're gonna wear these

58:29.080 --> 58:31.680
and he puts on these noise-canceling headphones

58:31.680 --> 58:34.160
that are super high-tech over your ears

58:34.160 --> 58:35.560
and then he keeps talking,

58:35.560 --> 58:37.260
but you just see his mouth moving.

58:38.520 --> 58:41.120
And then he's like, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

58:41.120 --> 58:43.800
And then he takes off your headphones.

58:43.800 --> 58:44.640
And he's like, all right,

58:44.640 --> 58:46.400
so we're gonna wait for this thing, right?

58:46.400 --> 58:47.240
And then-

58:47.240 --> 58:48.800
So whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

58:48.800 --> 58:50.840
we're gonna meet the tongue?

58:50.840 --> 58:52.240
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, it's gonna be sick.

58:52.240 --> 58:54.800
I just wanna make it like maybe not the best idea.

58:54.800 --> 58:57.280
Whoa, bro, are you not down?

58:57.840 --> 58:59.720
No, no, no, no, I'm super down.

58:59.720 --> 59:01.600
Don't worry about my downness.

59:01.600 --> 59:04.120
I've never been so down, down in the ground,

59:04.120 --> 59:05.480
underneath the body.

59:05.480 --> 59:06.920
Yeah, exactly, that's where we're going.

59:06.920 --> 59:08.440
We're gonna go down into it, all right?

59:08.440 --> 59:10.100
So first we're gonna stun it.

59:10.100 --> 59:10.940
Cool, cool, cool.

59:10.940 --> 59:12.200
Right, so those nerds over there,

59:12.200 --> 59:14.760
and he points back at this like whole tent

59:14.760 --> 59:17.800
where they've got this crazy, like metal, shiny,

59:17.800 --> 59:19.360
EMP looking thing.

59:19.360 --> 59:20.680
What's an EMP?

59:20.680 --> 59:22.800
Electromagnetic pulse.

59:22.800 --> 59:25.880
So that would like send a shockwave

59:25.920 --> 59:27.680
that would knock out electronics.

59:27.680 --> 59:30.600
Yo, but this one is gonna knock out this fucking tongue.

59:30.600 --> 59:33.560
Apparently they already tried it like 10 times

59:33.560 --> 59:34.880
or twice or whatever.

59:34.880 --> 59:38.080
And so like, we're definitely gonna be able to stun it.

59:38.080 --> 59:41.120
It'll be chill for like 15 minutes.

59:41.120 --> 59:41.960
All right, all right.

59:41.960 --> 59:45.560
So we are going to, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

59:45.560 --> 59:48.240
I mean, splunk, I guess is the word.

59:48.240 --> 59:50.920
It's not a cave, but you know, it's a hole, baby.

59:50.920 --> 59:52.880
Ha ha, they fist bump.

59:52.880 --> 59:53.920
You've got cameras,

59:53.960 --> 59:56.800
you've got these strange like energy reading devices.

59:56.800 --> 59:58.520
He's like, yeah, I don't know what they are,

59:58.520 --> 01:00:00.160
but apparently it's gonna give them

01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:02.160
like the information they need.

01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:04.840
Obviously we're gonna have a bunch of guns and knives

01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:06.080
just in case shit goes down.

01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:07.280
I brought my knuckle busters.

01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:08.640
I brought my throwing stars.

01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:10.560
I'm ready to get down.

01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:12.040
You have throwing stars?

01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:13.080
Hell yeah, I got throwing stars.

01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:14.560
Can I see your throwing stars?

01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:16.760
I mean, when the time presents itself.

01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:19.560
Oh, play close to the chest, play close to the chest.

01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:20.680
I dig that, all right, cool.

01:00:20.680 --> 01:00:22.160
So let's fucking go.

01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:26.080
Cut to the Chuckster, if I may.

01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:27.560
I think we're tight enough now, yeah.

01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:30.320
You're stabbing your knife into solid ground

01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:33.800
for the first time in what feels like an eternity

01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:37.040
as you finish scrambling as fast as you can

01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:40.520
out of the roused holy tongue.

01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:42.120
This thing is alive now.

01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:44.720
It's back and you crawl toward the team

01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:46.240
on the ground away from it.

01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:50.440
This team that's firing now at the whole situation

01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:52.920
from behind cover, just a bunch of military dudes

01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:56.080
firing over your head as you're crawling to safety

01:00:56.080 --> 01:00:59.720
and you hear Brett ding-dong, hashtag 451.

01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:00.920
He's screaming.

01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:04.240
You look back, you see one of these tongues, boom,

01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:06.760
grabs him by the ankle and it starts slowly

01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:08.040
dragging him back in.

01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:09.440
What do you do?

01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:10.760
Well, first of all, as it's happening,

01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:13.400
I'm yelling, not tight.

01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:14.240
Tight.

01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:23.880
Ding-dong, I'll save you.

01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:26.560
I'll come back for you.

01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:28.600
And then I just continue to scramble away.

01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:31.880
All right, hell yeah.

01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:33.720
No sign of Rumple foreskin.

01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:35.800
Rumple foreskin is gone.

01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:38.720
There is no Rumple foreskin to be seen.

01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:40.720
I'm just trying to say that a few more times

01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:42.320
before we never hear it again.

01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:43.760
Okay, so.

01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:45.120
Wait, where's Rumple foreskin?

01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:45.960
Nowhere to be seen.

01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:47.280
Damn.

01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:51.680
Ding-dong is being pulled back slowly into this thing

01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:55.560
and the ground begins to kind of reform itself

01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:58.360
and right at the last second, right before,

01:01:58.360 --> 01:02:00.840
you think that ding-dong's entire body

01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:02.920
is gonna be yoinked down into the hole,

01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:05.120
but it doesn't quite all make it.

01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:07.640
And as the ground finishes forming,

01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:11.840
the head of Brett is just sitting on the ground

01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:16.120
and you think maybe he himself is just stuck there

01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:21.120
until slowly the head falls over on its side

01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:26.200
and blood just starts squirting out from the bottom of it.

01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:27.040
Jeez.

01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:33.360
That is Charles Chuck, the Chuckster.

01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:35.600
Thank you, thank you for playing.

01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:37.800
Fucking, oh my God.

01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:41.040
Sorry, I'm reacting and sitting here.

01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:42.560
How do you feel?

01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:44.280
I'm super intrigued by all these stories.

01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:47.720
They're really cool, but also they start off

01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:52.720
like penis joke, Brett, foreskin, military complex

01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:57.240
and then like, you're dead, you're gone.

01:02:57.240 --> 01:03:00.160
And there doesn't seem to be a way to protect yourself

01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:02.920
which makes it even more terrifying.

01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:04.480
It just lands on you.

01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:07.080
I think I'm gonna go back for that tongue.

01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:08.240
Go for it.

01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:09.080
Yeah.

01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:44.080
Breathe it in.

01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:05.080
Clasp your fist, or fall apart.

01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:10.080
Water leaks through your fingers.

01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:16.080
You're standing in a swirling flood.

01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:28.080
And only darkness lingers.

01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:47.080
Falling fast into a deep abyss.

01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:52.080
Till it sets you out again.

01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:57.080
Find your feet on your broken bones.

01:04:57.080 --> 01:05:08.080
You're out for the edge again.

01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:43.080
You're out for the edge again.
