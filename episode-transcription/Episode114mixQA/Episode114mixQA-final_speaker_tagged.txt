It's somehow both dark and bright and there is everything and nothing all at once. There's also a possum wearing a cowboy hat. His name is Jeremy. is from Newman's Necromorium Funeral Home.

That guy keeps screaming that he just wants to go home and there's been a terrible mistake. Classic Lewis, now that you sold on the idea, let us handle you dead. We'll even wear gloves. Well damn, thanks Newman. I would advise you to not listen to the screams of Classic Lewis. Every Lewis I've ever known has been a lie and a cheat. This one is probably no exception. And every Lewis is also a rat bastard. But especially a Lewis named Classic Lewis. Remember, if you want to write up something for your wolf to howl, tag at Pretending Pod on Twitter or Instagram.

316.92 364.58 speaker2  The season is done. The season is over and it's time to answer questions about the season. I like to think that most of the questions as far as what actually happened have been answered. Although, I understand and that's okay. Dude, today a coworker of mine asked me for my phone number so that they could send me a playlist. And what are the seven, not 10 numbers that you told me? No, I won't be saying that.
361.18 369.66 speaker3  what's the band that sings Radioactive? Oh, is that Imagine Dragons?
368.82 379.10 speaker2  Oh, no.
377.66 385.98 speaker3  I kept wanting to tell it, but I was like, wait until we're recording.
383.38 397.98 speaker2  We've been hanging out for a while I did get,
396.62 400.82 speaker3  I got Joe with a-
399.46 403.52 speaker2  with such a genuine one.
401.66 409.90 speaker3  It was really good and I was like, oh, you should have saved it for the pod. I didn't even see that coming. I straight up don't,
408.54 412.48 speaker2  I don't know if I was in here, if I wasn't listening. You were not.
411.58 421.46 speaker3  But it was a, dude, I just like, it was like both of us looking at our phones. I was like, dude, did you see that thing about the article about Cho Ken today?
420.38 431.82 speaker2  And I went, Cho Ken? Oh my God. Jesus. I was so genuinely, I have not heard about this. Please tell me.
430.98 435.26 speaker3  You're like, who's Cho Ken?
434.42 439.94 speaker2  God. Anyway,
439.02 442.54 speaker3  that was good.
441.72 475.30 speaker2  I think that's enough. We have enough questions for that to be our jumping off point. So let's dive into these. I'm gonna go ahead and start I'm Zach and I have a question. We asked for questions, comments or compliments on Twitter and Reddit and So I'm gonna start this thing off by complimenting myself. Zach, I don't say this a lot, but
474.46 476.12 speaker3  Good job, man.
475.30 494.40 speaker2  That's huge, dude. Yeah. All right. That was genuine. And I didn't expect to negate my horrible self-talk to myself, but here we are. And so I do have a compliment right off the bat
493.58 497.74 speaker3  Joe,
495.82 530.42 speaker2  Oh, literally individually. Do you also have one for the group? I literally didn't plan this at all. I am not looking at anything. I didn't have these planned, Joe, having you as a player makes my job as a GM more fun. to things that happen and how stoked you get and how into the story you are at all times makes me, but I'm being genuine.
528.90 532.50 speaker3  No, you can say it. That's so nice, dude.
531.34 538.90 speaker2  At first, I thought it was just
536.54 543.50 speaker3  But no, it makes it more fun as a player at the table. Yeah, it totally does.
541.18 604.82 speaker2  So moving on from the compliments. No, moving on to Luke. Luke, you are without a doubt the most fun and spontaneous person I've ever like hung out with even. You are extremely enjoyable to be around due to your ability to take any situation and find the levity in it. I appreciate that so much. And I specifically within the realm of role-playing, anytime that I feel you grab the reins out of my hands, I'm nothing but overjoyed. And back to the questions. I can't do the same joke again. And Tom.
603.58 614.74 speaker3  Thank you.
611.50 660.58 speaker2  on the precipice of like in and out of game in a way that, in my opinion, speaks to the soul of like how we role-play. Your ability to constantly have one hand in hot water Also, I respect you and any opinion that you bring to the table, regardless of how opposite of what I've just said is. Basically, you. Thank you.
658.14 663.90 speaker3  Also, the earliest stuff about me being the voice
660.58 670.54 speaker2  of a role-playing generation, I wonder if you said yes. Legitimately though, I have a hard time taking
669.26 677.74 speaker3  I'm very controlling.
675.54 703.98 speaker2  and I think you're a great dude. Thanks, bro. I love you guys so much and you have changed my life for the better. Same. Back at you, man. I love so much about you.
701.30 713.54 speaker3  not playing this, even though it's only been. Yeah, I've blacked out all memories of life. Even though it's been more. Yeah, we've been doing it for like 10 years. No, I love you too.
712.70 716.86 speaker2  We love you too. All right, we've got a question from.
716.04 726.90 speaker3  Oh, wait, no, no. You said you had a question for us. To finish.
723.10 748.78 speaker2  All right, so the question that I have is actually a question that I will ask at the top of the next episode, the next Q&A episode. I have a personal question for you guys. Justin will be here for next week's Q&A.
747.18 755.86 speaker3  Check back in at 8.30.
753.54 764.58 speaker2  We've got a question from. It was all a snow globe. They say, I hope it's okay to ask a few. It is.
761.94 768.42 speaker3  That was a classic reference to that one show.
764.58 777.62 speaker2  I was gonna say, do you millennials get that reference? Yeah, it's the thing where Chris O'Dowd Okay.
776.18 778.52 speaker3  It's Saint something, right?
777.62 781.66 speaker2  Oh, okay.
779.42 783.34 speaker3  It's a spoiler no matter what.
781.66 787.22 speaker2  Once I'm a very drunk mom. Be careful.
784.54 792.70 speaker3  Oh yeah, just in case anybody's trying to watch Men in Black. That hospital show or whatever.
790.58 794.10 speaker2  They were in a marble and the marble had fake snow in it.
792.70 795.10 speaker3  Was it Saint Elsewhere?
794.10 796.26 speaker2  Saint Elsewhere, yeah.
795.10 802.58 speaker3  Okay, so real quick.
801.18 809.94 speaker2  It could be so much quicker.
807.30 823.38 speaker3  asked me how old I was and I was like 29 at the time and I said 29 and she goes, oh, you're just like my son. You're a millennium. You're a millennium. I'm a millennium. That's really good.
822.54 883.06 speaker2  Yeah. Okay, that's perfect. They asked, it was all snow globe, asks, who was the person in the woods in episode six? Charles Donovan. Okay. I should have asked who you thought it was but that would just belabor the whole part. Moving on. I would say, oh. Next question. Who is the ambiguously British man in the circle of white powder? I believe they are talking about the person that Lindsay's character talks to in the contention woods arc. That was an agent of Pisces. Delta Green has a British wing of its existence and they are called Pisces. And I believe that man had a tattoo somewhere and I believe, I did not look this up, to the fact that he was in Pisces. It might've even been a fish.
882.22 890.54 speaker3  So, okay. So if any of us had run into him, we would have known right away.
889.70 893.22 speaker2  Fish, Pisces.
890.54 903.26 speaker3  So that's deep lore for somebody who knows Delta Green lore. That wasn't for us. Zach, yeah. Speaking of like your own deep lore,
901.86 909.42 speaker2  I totally thought you were like,
908.14 912.86 speaker3  but they were there the whole time.
909.42 934.64 speaker2  You guys literally never ran into anyone from Pisces. My cool fish men brigade. Bar Corp owned by Pisces. No. So next question. What does Joe smell like? What flavor vape do you have? Yeah. I got some strawberry milk tonight. Oh, that is an answer. All right.
932.50 937.24 speaker3  That's pretty much what he smells like just in general.
934.64 969.80 speaker2  I've known him since middle school. Joe, middle school. You've got the option. Chocolate, vanilla. Is it called vanilla milk? Regular. 2%. Strawberry. Oh, all right. And moving on, what was the asylum all about? Specifically the Satan plot line that apparently got dropped. Yeah, because I did mention at one point that the Satan, somebody asked about it mid-game. I think I said, you guys didn't look into that very much,
968.60 975.32 speaker3  so we didn't worry about it.
972.00 994.20 speaker2  the agents, the dead president's cell, Kennedy, McKinley, and Harrison back to wherever they came from, or at least try to hitch more of a ride on what they had. But as we were role-playing, it just felt right to kind of leave you out in the cold. I could use that sentence for all role-playing.
991.76 996.68 speaker3  Yeah, that's your go-to instinct as a GM.
994.20 1004.28 speaker2  And I'm trying to get better at it, all right? We're all growing.
1002.20 1012.32 speaker3  That's one thing that I'm gonna work on. No, it's fun and it leads to, I don't know.
1011.00 1013.32 speaker2  Yeah, exactly.
1012.32 1018.02 speaker3  We go to the mill.
1016.12 1098.18 speaker2  So what was the asylum all about? So basically there's a woman there named, code name Satan, not actually birth name Satan. And she was in charge of running these different teams of essentially what Delta Green Lore would call cowboys. So your A through Z cells. But I decided instead of the modern day using A through Z cells, they would have gotten rid of it by then and come up with some fun alternatives. So I thought dead presidents was a fun combo of things. So I went with that. But that is also where K cell was run out of, because they originally started with the alphabet cells the unnatural threat to the world, not with government oversight. And so that is what the asylum is specifically all about. The woman who runs it, she's a black and white character. She's got a lot going on. Everyone's got like a middling agenda. In Delta Green, from what I can tell, there aren't a lot of like specifically good but everyone's kind of like trying to do their best with the hand they've been dealt.
1097.30 1102.54 speaker3  I don't know.
1100.76 1109.40 speaker2  If somebody else asks a question about it later, which I bet they do, I might add to that.
1107.32 1121.66 speaker3  it just really stresses me out when we're playing it,
1120.82 1141.86 speaker2  Yeah. No, thank you. Yeah. Hey, why don't you just ask the NPCs if they believe in Jesus? So they finish it out. Snow Globe finishes it out by saying, thank you all for everything. This is by far my favorite podcast,
1140.62 1142.82 speaker3  Thanks, us too.
1141.86 1164.34 speaker2  It's a nice thing to say. It is ours as well. Ain't on a no, no, no. Is that how you say it? Ain't on a no, no, no. Which is No Way Hang On. That's one of our beautiful mods over on the subreddit and the discord. We've got a question. What's y'all's favorite karaoke jam?
1161.90 1166.30 speaker3  Soak Up The Sun by Shirl Crow.
1164.34 1170.14 speaker2  That's good. Soak Up The Sun is real good.
1168.86 1174.46 speaker3  cause I know the words already. Yep.
1172.50 1176.50 speaker2  And what are Beatles songs?
1174.46 1182.70 speaker3  It's this band that I've been into lately. They're kind of coming up.
1181.88 1188.70 speaker2  Really. Wait, when we did karaoke at my house, did you not sing? Oh, I probably did.
1186.06 1195.70 speaker3  But like drunk, living room karaoke. I've never been in a bar full of people,
1194.78 1216.32 speaker2  Yeah. Thomas, you were actually there though for my birthday a couple of years ago. After the ball game. for my birthday. That was a surprise, which was fucking rad. We went and hung out and watched a day game in St. Louis that I didn't know was happening.
1214.38 1221.06 speaker3  Yeah, I got you those tickets, not your wife and my partner. You know what?
1220.06 1228.40 speaker2  It actually makes more sense
1227.56 1230.90 speaker3  I don't know. Yeah, I don't know, man. Who knows?
1230.06 1239.26 speaker2  But I would bet. I was just willing to give you full credit here on the recording.
1236.82 1242.06 speaker3  involved heard that, they would probably be like, what?
1240.86 1242.90 speaker2  They're not listening to this?
1242.06 1252.18 speaker3  That's fair.
1250.50 1255.18 speaker2  on Instagram and Twitter. You can find it there. And that is me singing-
1253.86 1262.70 speaker3  Oh baby, baby.
1260.38 1284.74 speaker2  My go-to is Hit Me Baby One More Time by Britney Spears, specifically because it is just out of my range.
1283.78 1289.06 speaker3  Oh yeah, classic. Like karaoke.
1287.02 1292.06 speaker2  Well, that's Neil.
1289.06 1300.98 speaker3  Looked like yellow teeth, red face. like meaning like late forties, a polo.
1298.82 1316.56 speaker2  And they love the polos. Compliment from ainonanonono. Nice cock, bro.
1315.74 1319.84 speaker3  Thanks.
1317.40 1353.32 speaker2  All right, and a question from ainonanonono. I remember Zach delivering some well-deserved praise to Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency, which shares some fun elements with season one of PTBP. What other foundational media or artists have influenced y'all in this season as handler and players? Anyone have an inspiration to you as a player or just to give you like a head space of what this game we're playing was? I just do whatever I want. Yeah, there, yeah, yeah. The most truthful answer.
1350.84 1383.36 speaker3  Yeah, Wild West Arc was all Deadwood in my brain. Yeah. Deadwood was what I would reference in my brain. Mine was Red Dead Redemption. Yeah, like that pop culture is inundated with so just lots of cop stereotypes and then the actual place we live for.
1379.44 1390.68 speaker2  and getting a feel for what life is like in a smaller town. I actually drove through Mountain Grove. I mean, literally just passed it. You literally drove through.
1388.84 1393.28 speaker3  I literally drove through. You're the one who drove through Mountain Grove.
1392.44 1395.76 speaker2  I drove through.
1394.92 1402.18 speaker3  Mountain Grove. Blues Brothers style like that mall.
1399.24 1410.60 speaker2  That's the small town that I stole the map from for contention. Oh, nice. Oh, really?
1409.76 1430.76 speaker3  The layout of the roads and things. Yeah, I did. I dated someone and grew up there and when I was like 19 and we drove out there a few times to hang out with her parents. And it was, it's very small. It's really small, yeah. You've been to contention then. Yeah, you've been to contention.
1429.92 1445.80 speaker2  and like-
1444.44 1455.26 speaker3  I've seen some movies. It's good.
1454.04 1463.92 speaker2  Holistic Detective Agency. I took a lot from that. Compliment, thanks for making me laugh so hard. I cried a few times. Wow. I'm glad we did it to you
1462.44 1464.76 speaker3  because we did it to ourselves a lot.
1463.92 1468.80 speaker2  Oh yeah.
1465.60 1478.92 speaker3  We had more fun making it than you did listening to it. Oh, 100%.
1473.92 1506.04 speaker2  L-Elephant, L-Elephant, L-Elephant, L-Elephant. L-Elephant, L-Elephant, L-Elephant. I think it's just L-Elephant. Thanks. Thank you. for people paying a lot of attention. There was, quote, no backbone being, oh, by the way, we're doing spoilers.
1505.04 1517.32 speaker3  Yeah, big time. Who's Dog? We'll have Dog.
1516.48 1573.76 speaker2  Last name basis, yeah. We know each other pretty well. Joe's on a last name basis with Dog. Over the years, we've gotten to know each other pretty well. No backbone being a more relevant song than first thought. Yes, classic. The Wizard of Oznod with what everyone lost on Marvin Glass's compound. I think at one point you named some corpses after the last podcast on the left crew. Actually, those were the costumes that Billy Harrison was tied up in the back of Charles Donovan's trunk and also in Charles Donovan's trunk was Charles Donovan's extra disguises in which he used the last podcast on the left crew as covers. What's an anagram? Am I thinking of the right?
1572.34 1574.68 speaker3  Whether it's all mixed up.
1573.76 1585.08 speaker2  It's all mixed up, yes. Okay, so Tildy B. Mitchell is an anagram. Oh, fuck, what's it for though?
1581.56 1592.20 speaker3  I refuse to look for anagrams in every name you give us.
1590.60 1608.80 speaker2  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's not gonna give it to you because it's like half baked. It's like lit B. It's lit. How do you spell Tildy? and then Mitchell, M-I-T-C-H-E-L-L. But lit is part of it? It's lit.
1607.84 1619.20 speaker3  Fucking good, dude. Good anagram, bro.
1617.16 1626.10 speaker2  Yeah, like Bill and Ted because they time travel.
1625.28 1684.92 speaker3  that you just named her. Holy fuck, that's cool. I thought that came later. I thought those revelations came later. I guess that. She was destined. That's just a fun detail outside of the canon. Yeah, that doesn't mean anything. It's an Easter egg. What's another Easter egg? or whatever it was. Consume, yeah.
1682.56 1687.28 speaker2  that you guys would be like, why is it that?
1684.92 1699.70 speaker3  Every time you do that, I'm just like, I'm not gonna make Zach feel bad about his English.
1696.56 1708.44 speaker2  and reveal my hidden secrets, but also it might hurt my feelings.
1705.20 1712.70 speaker3  that must be one of your weird things, right?
1708.44 1733.18 speaker2  And you're just like, no, no, no, no, Thomas. Anyway, so that's one. Consume is definitely one that I really liked. Oh, this one's dumb. This one's so dumb, but Oz Mayhem Wolf, his brother was Elby, E-L-B-Y, which is not a name.
1732.18 1739.18 speaker3  But like pounds or?
1738.34 1747.30 speaker2  I like that. That was real stupid. He mentioned him, yeah.
1746.46 1748.90 speaker3  Oh, okay.
1747.30 1770.14 speaker2  He mentioned him once. Yeah, Vigna is a genus, I think, of bean. It's a science bean.
1767.14 1778.04 speaker3  Copperhead Road by Steve Earle. We kind of made his dad something else, but I guess Kevin is literally the character in Copperhead Road.
1777.20 1784.08 speaker2  Exactly. Clark was born with a tail. And never got it removed.
1783.24 1786.68 speaker3  The whole time. The whole time.
1784.92 1789.92 speaker2  If you just looked at his back,
1788.08 1794.96 speaker3  If you'd done an alertness check, you actually had detailed emotional responses for the tail.
1793.78 1806.00 speaker2  I had rolls I could have made. For those of you who are gonna go back and listen through the campaign, you'll find a slight whooshing sound.
1804.16 1831.04 speaker3  I do remember one last Easter egg. Zach was like, okay, your character is God. This is all a dream that he's created for the other characters. So just remember that at the end. I was like, okay, yeah, for sure. I wrote it down. The only thing in my notes.
1829.56 1838.88 speaker2  where I had listed like.
1835.36 1847.00 speaker3  Was trying to consume all the little nuggets as it went by. There was a bunch of stuff in there, man.
1845.04 1859.40 speaker2  on certain time restraints for a while. Yeah, that was a weird time when you guys were like at the end of your time in contention when all the moving parts were happening. And I was trying to keep track of it.
1857.68 1862.36 speaker3  All right, let's move on.
1861.14 1899.58 speaker2  It is, we'll keep going. A little while ago, I had an idea about a connection to Martin Cupertino being an influential person wanting to create cube during the calm comfy campground arc and the contention boys chasing down the origins of what they called ball. I get that Martin was a Steve Jobs stand in, but was the cube versus ball connection intentional or am I grasping at straws? I'm gonna turn this one over to Thomas for the answer.
1895.78 1929.14 speaker3  was just a parody of the original iMac. And then like the crazy promises about cube were just like Zombocom style like nonsense and over promising like tech world. Like this will solve every problem anybody's ever had. We got to think about our pace.
1924.82 1934.14 speaker2  Cause I think we have 50 total in three. Yeah, we're on page one of nine. The reason it was called, we are 30 minutes in.
1933.14 1948.18 speaker3  The reason it was called cube is cause the iMac is like a cube shape kind of. This isn't one we can answer.
1947.34 1955.50 speaker2  We could try. I'll read it and we'll try.
1952.22 1964.22 speaker3  How did Marvin get removed from the myriad hive mind? That's a question I've had myself. Yeah, so here's my best guess.
1961.62 1967.66 speaker2  Marvin, he just didn't want to be in it anymore.
1966.26 1998.94 speaker3  He just wanted it more. Like kind of the odd, but he like he wanted out and he did. but I wondered if he was some link in an evolution between Tildy and what we know as myriad, whether he was in the middle or he was an evolved beyond myriad. I think he was just like a funny guy. He's just a wild and crazy dude. Next question. Yeah, were Marvin's sons his biological sons? Yes. Was the glass syndicate just a puppet for some greater organization? Yes, next question. Yeah, yes and yes.
1997.10 2002.78 speaker2  What was Stan and Nancy's agenda
2001.94 2026.78 speaker3  Zach never knew. He didn't actually have. He wanted, they were actually, the city asylum was trying to research the brown note. Right, yeah. from myriad hive mind? How did Marvin remove himself?
2025.70 2039.82 speaker2  Smart question, Joe. of these creatures and that's all I ever really thought about it.
2037.30 2044.14 speaker3  Well, that would also be a great campaign, a mini campaign.
2040.66 2064.06 speaker2  Yeah, it really, I honestly had a certain thought as we were recording from 100 on. I was like, I could do at least three or four more spin-offs. Like we could do this theoretically forever. Yeah, oh yeah, Jesus Christ Ministries could have easily had its own one shot, which I was planning for a while and then abandoned at a certain point.
2062.46 2070.22 speaker3  Well, that was Fergie's thing, right? Yeah. Fergie's whole crime organization.
2066.86 2073.94 speaker2  With all those little kids that were all like androids.
2070.22 2080.50 speaker3  Yeah, oh, we could play Android orphans.
2077.04 2084.66 speaker2  So that's all I really ever had for Marvin. Oh, were his sons biological? No, they were not.
2083.82 2088.14 speaker3  Were they created?
2084.66 2129.88 speaker2  No, he was dealing in trafficking and so he took two of the strongest ones They have been, they had been like brainwashed to basically just like the Glass family was their family. They were Glass boys like through and through, but one of them had their mind melted before the season started and the other one got sent to the dark place. So they were not role played through very thoroughly just because of their circumstances.
2125.78 2134.16 speaker3  Another question here, biological sons. Was the Glass syndicate just a puppet for some greater organization?
2132.64 2142.40 speaker2  The Glass syndicate was not a puppet. The Glass syndicate was held strong by Marvin Glass
2140.40 2144.64 speaker3  That's interesting, so that's, we disagree on that. Okay, that's fair.
2143.60 2228.32 speaker2  What was your guys' answer? We said yes. We said yes, next question. Next question, what was Man Stan Steen's agenda and by extension that of the city asylum? Okay, so these are two very different questions specifically because the city asylum was holding Stan Man Steen as a prisoner at the time. He was let out only to go to his daughter's funeral as a courtesy and he used that time to get the fuck out of existence which was his goal due to his ability to see. He was living the same kind of life where you guys were where his idea of the world kept changing. Every single time something unnatural happened, I changed the town of contention slightly and the main clue of that change was the name of your fourth police officer in contention and small other changes happened but the only one that we really stumbled across in game was Randy Angst. that could pop up if the right questions were asked which I should have, again, just learning how to be a better GM pushed that theme forward.
2227.04 2229.60 speaker3  He very much was.
2228.76 2344.92 speaker2  I thought they felt weird. Yep, and so he fucked off and when he fucked off, he landed himself in a heap of trouble and then eventually got a hold of a phone and needed some help from the future pulp hero overseer. Yeah, at the end there. So that would be a fun thing to look into. I would love that story. Okay, so yeah, he only showed up twice who is dealing with the same thing There were some other people like that as well. Mildred Mitchell being one of them. If you guys had talked about your fourth officer around her, she would have gotten the name wrong like you guys had. Were K cell and the FBI agents working for the same group? Yes, but in different time periods. Given that in the ending, the FBI agents were answering to the lady that got dubbed Satan, it seems as though there was another pernicious element at play and that K cell was likely opposed to them. To clarify, my working theory is that the FBI agents working for Satan are an M-A-R-Y-esque threat with some evil agenda in mind. Yes, I mean, they are as much a threat as the group of cowboys are a threat in traditional Delta Green lore, which, you know, Delta Green agents are a threat, man. That's just kind of how it happens. Their goal is to- Mr. Steal Your Girl. Yeah, exactly. And so that is the reason why the father of Maggie Cook, I almost said Tim Cook, well, it was Jim Cook, which is why I called him that, is Jim Cook, he worked for Satan and that's why he had a reference to Satan in his house. But by the end of his time,
2340.96 2349.52 speaker3  he was working against her machinations.
2344.92 2366.74 speaker2  So moving on, what was up with all the numbers plague deal? What was up with the numbers plague deal? What was the overseer's original motivation for setting it off? Also, it seemed like the overseer considered that run a quote, success, despite everyone dying on that go round.
2364.18 2370.64 speaker3  Did we know that Joe set that off, Luke? I have, I don't think so.
2369.00 2375.30 speaker2  It seemed like it'd be fun.
2374.46 2389.68 speaker3  That was cool. I had not become the overseer yet.
2387.16 2457.40 speaker2  with good intentions from the other side. I had it so that the overseer would make lots of mistakes throughout his time because in Delta Green, the characters traditionally 60% of the time succeed on stuff. And so I kept that in mind as I worked through the overseer's plan. And his plan for CSU and for Bar Corp was, he did not plan for CSU to become a crazy suicide haven. His plan was to give this woman, this activist, on CSU's campus, the ability to change the mind of Bruce Robin, the leader of Bar Corp, of the biggest corporation in the city. And so he failed in that. And accidentally set off a whole thing where basically the spell went cattywampus and the cleanup needed to happen.
2456.56 2465.60 speaker3  It was almost working though because didn't we run into people saying that he's had a change of heart and has been doing things better lately? Exactly. That's cool.
2462.32 2486.96 speaker2  It was so close to working, but something was off, which is just kind of a constant in Delta Green is that, yeah, you can use the unnatural and sometimes the unnatural can do good things, but overwhelmingly, if you try to use the unnatural for good, it's not gonna work out. And so that was my thought for that whole arc.
2486.12 2507.92 speaker3  a success. That giant is for sure the thing that was on his mind the whole time. Defeating that was his most solid of a goal, at least when I got ahold of him. Yeah. Exactly.
2503.52 2581.34 speaker2  A wild gazebo asks, I think that story arc, oh, they were adding on to what was said by Soren Ash. They said, I think that story arc needs the most explaining. I love how just wild everything got, but they didn't really investigate and find out any of the plot points there. Yeah, they were a little preoccupied with all the shit that I was throwing at them constantly. Wouldn't change that because it's a great in a way to see it all go missed. And ShamWow Chameleon, I can tell you, got real, real high. She did, she got ahold of a passing helicopter, got even higher and then in my mind, into the rotors. I think she probably just convinced That's what I like to think. Got a thing from Jake Medrano, 911 says, always love your stuff. Hey, that's a big always. Thanks. What about this?
2578.84 2601.04 speaker3  Blip, blip, blip, blip, blip, blip, blip, blip, blip. You love that?
2598.90 2639.88 speaker2  Yeah, they say Sean McCoy, who is the creator of Mothership, which is a RPG game, recently did an AMA where he mentioned he loved your podcast and hope you eventually did a adventure campaign of Mothership. I've been looking for a good actual play and would love to see you guys cover that. Hope this finds you well. I'm found well. I'm found well. Same. through the answer of. Because it is asking about Mothership and Sean McCoy. And we are-
2638.84 2646.36 speaker3  I don't know fucking shit about it. He just asked me to look him up and see if it was problematic.
2645.52 2657.08 speaker2  All right. And as far as he can tell, no. And that is a good thing. So we are, with that being said,
2655.56 2664.02 speaker3  We would love to play Mothership. It's, as far as I understand, a space RPG, which we've all been talking about
2661.52 2682.20 speaker4  if you wanna play a space thing sometime. Yeah, we would love to play it. Yeah, hey, Sean.
2680.96 2684.44 speaker2  uh-oh, I will-
2683.04 2692.32 speaker3  Let us read it. For Thomas, Luke, Joe, and Justin, can you tell us what happened in season one? Zach, how would you describe it?
2690.32 2704.84 speaker2  Oh, this is a, all right. So we're gonna cut to- We're gonna skip this one.
2702.60 2738.00 speaker3  My dude, it would not take me longer and an hour to describe what happened in the season of this podcast. Justin doesn't need to be here.
2737.16 2749.64 speaker2  and slams you in the ground? I didn't expect anything ever. Did you? Did you think that it killed you?
2747.80 2753.56 speaker3  because we kept getting pictures from a place that had no goo. Yeah, no, it seemed like there was another goo place.
2752.48 2760.80 speaker4  Yeah. Yeah. But not at all formed like it was. No.
2759.40 2766.20 speaker3  It seemed way cooler to be honest. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2765.24 2857.44 speaker2  Bansu also says, at the start of season one and how those changed as things evolved? One of the big changes that I decided to make happen each time something unnatural occurred in the world angrier at her father, and more dedicated to taking over the world every single time something fucked up happened. And so the Maggie Cook that you guys knew would be different than the Maggie Cook that you talked to through her setting up her own fake death, where someone said like, oh, she didn't stand up. Like someone else was trying to, Gary Daley was trying to throw like a slight hint there, which you guys picked up on and were like, okay, so it might not have been her. If you guys had actually run dental through Randy Anx with her teeth files on file, you would have found out that the corpse was not the same, did not have the same dental records as Chief Maggie Cook. after your time at the Sydney Mausoleum, you all kind of talked about how aggressive she was and how angry she was, which is different than we had talked about
2855.96 2868.06 speaker3  yeah, the real Maggie Cook died and this is a fake Maggie Cook.
2864.10 2886.74 speaker2  you guys were the ones who were kind of split off along with Stan Manstein, Mildred Mitchell, certain people who continued on this specific timeline, trajectory of contention, as other people continued on the same path of contention that they were on.
2885.90 2891.02 speaker3  Yeah.
2888.90 2897.56 speaker2  Zach, were the time loops always planned? No, did that come about due to the condition the characters were in by that point?
2896.62 2904.02 speaker3  And the microdosing. And the microdosing.
2900.64 2954.92 speaker2  if there was enough interest of writing up a setting guide. So I wanna say I'd be interested in that and TD underscore Woogie says seconded. Hey guys, that is a goal that we are considering putting up on the Patreon if we're gonna put up a poll soon for patrons to kind of let us know what they're wanting of things that we should focus on is writing up a campaign setting for contention, which I think would be really fun from what you initially thought the ending would come to? How off the rails did it get?
2952.80 2957.44 speaker3  Yeah, that's exactly what I planned.
2954.92 2980.24 speaker2  No, we kind of talked a little bit. We could talk about it with Justin when he's on next episode about how I told you guys I was trying to kill Don D. Pettymore
2979.00 3005.88 speaker3  and I feel pretty shitty about it, but I don't actually because it got us, Justin, through to the end, so. But I fudged an unnatural success
3003.88 3045.90 speaker2  but we have to get through more. Okay, oh, so the answer is that it was very different than I expected. I wrote what was gonna happen in the next session after we played the previous session. I had literally nothing planned and I planned as we played through the end of the entire campaign. and always have, I plan it based on what happened the last session every time because you can't just prep a bunch of stuff and expect it to work because it never does.
3045.08 3049.18 speaker3  Nice.
3047.26 3063.00 speaker2  What was the biggest takeaway you got from making this podcast and what did you learn to prepare for season two? Shit's easy, make it up as you go.
3059.04 3067.72 speaker3  Yeah, the answer you just said from the previous question.
3066.30 3095.64 speaker2  gonna take your guys' advice. I really liked the idea of, Thomas mentioned, recapping what you learned from an NPC after your interactions with them. We love recaps around here. I do that with combat, I realized, where I kind of recap each round what happened in combat and then thankfully later we had characters do it in game. But yeah, I really liked the idea of recapping what you guys get from NPCs.
3092.88 3111.48 speaker3  Characters who would have never been there if I hadn't heroically lied while Zach tried to murder us on those catwalks. Murder Justin on those catwalks. Right guys?
3110.52 3115.16 speaker2  Shit's easy. Shit's easy, just make it up as you go.
3113.32 3120.32 speaker3  Make it up as you go. It was fun for me.
3117.34 3141.24 speaker2  Editing is really hard and takes a long time. Yeah. And is really important. that when I finally saw your faces, I had a completely different image from what you sounded like, except for Luke. I thought, quote, yeah, that's about right.
3138.24 3148.28 speaker3  I mean, we sound like normal people, but we're all devastatingly attractive except for Luke.
3146.56 3149.58 speaker4  No, they just could tell from my voice.
3148.28 3152.76 speaker3  They're like that guy. They say great stuff, guys.
3150.92 3169.88 speaker2  What confidence that man has. Tall idiot Milky Way at ShadowWorldVivo. Oh, we're on Twitter. It must have hashtag PTBPQ. Love the podcast. I've listened through all of it twice.
3167.76 3174.24 speaker3  That's hundreds of hours. Double hundreds.
3172.06 3184.84 speaker2  What did the myriads mean at the end when they were saying, quote, for your own safety, please remain here? Did they think shutting down Overseer and Ball was a safe choice?
3183.60 3195.58 speaker4  I was curious about this one too, because on the re-listen, you really hit home with that a bunch of times.
3193.28 3224.54 speaker2  is that it's really fucking dangerous for you guys to try to go back into the world that Myriad was about to shut down, was kind of the vibe that I was trying to give you. Basically, find another option, which you did in the weirdest way that I was not expecting. But yeah, I was saying like, if you go back to contention, I am going to make you blip out of existence because Myriad will erase your entire plane,
3223.44 3231.44 speaker3  I guess I assumed at the time that also meant the place we were in, right? The same.
3229.28 3235.24 speaker4  I thought for your own safety, please remain here. We'll wipe you all out. I was like, you're lying.
3234.28 3244.12 speaker3  I thought it was a threat. Okay.
3243.28 3245.88 speaker4  Yep. Gotcha.
3244.12 3308.28 speaker2  You definitely could have lived in existence there. A great fun one. So yeah, they were basically just saying, for your own safety, because jumping to a new plane is really hard. And we kind of talked about that after we recorded a couple of times where it was like, what would have happened if you guys would have tried to jump planes? And I had a table that you would have rolled on Yeah. My favorite that I was really pulling for was going to be a very luscious, verdant, green jungle that then you all would have slowly died of radiation poisoning and maybe at the jaws of dinosaurs. So yeah, there were different places. Well, that's not my favorite. That you could have ended up if you had to try to leave. Gazebo, a wild gazebo says, I for one look forward to our new lives under Keith's rule. I'm sure he'll be a kind and a holy empathetic leader. All hail Keith's, hallowed be thy name. Hallowed be thy name.
3307.04 3318.70 speaker3  Looks like the Keiths myriad have taken over some Twitter accounts and are spreading some disinfo. Bless you, my son.
3315.80 3331.80 speaker2  Lynn is spooky at Jet Sedette says, shout out to the handsome boy, Luke. Hashtag HZKMP, hashtag PTBPQ, smiley face. Keep it up.
3330.44 3338.24 speaker3  Who is that really, Keith? I don't know who that is.
3335.92 3422.00 speaker2  at MariexLupin says, so when y'all releasing the hot dog cut of No Backbone. Amazing job on season one. I can't wait for the next season to kick off. that's coming down the pipeline. with the permission of Kudzu on Patreon. I'll actually, that's a great question. I'll hit up Seth, who's the lead singer of Kudzu, and see if he's cool with me releasing the hot dog cut, So I'll send it to him and then we'll, thankfully the season's over, so he can't pull out now. Kyanite fuck cars at 1312 Kyanite asks, do y'all have a secret to not getting burnt out on the same story, adventure, system, et cetera, other than reasonable and restful breaks? Those are for babies and I am no baby. We took a couple of big breaks. We started recording this season in contention a full year before we started releasing, we've said a few times. So I mean, there were many breaks in there, on the story? No, because it just changed.
3420.76 3452.60 speaker3  It was a consistent thread, but so many other things where it's like. We had the luxury of those mini arcs also to break it all up. Actually, yeah, by the time we got to the numbers and everything without a lot of even hints about what was actually going on. in the world in general. Though I don't know if you guys had more than I did at that point with your characters. I didn't know anything.
3450.52 3478.40 speaker4  There was also a moment where the entire story could have changed because Leon wanted to take me elsewhere and I had some kind of role that I succeeded and or failed on. If I had gone to the other place, I guess we're in spoiler territory. He wanted to take me straight to Comcomfy Campground and meet up with Maggie.
3473.40 3498.96 speaker2  with a heavy metal box that would have summoned the Gigantum Barpithecus into the world of contention and her plan was alongside the overseer, you, was to hold the world hostage and literally take control of a one world government.
3496.68 3503.08 speaker4  You guys could have had a very different overseer.
3500.68 3509.36 speaker3  Yeah, I mean, obviously I love the story that we crafted but that's way better.
3506.88 3518.52 speaker2  So secret to not getting burnt out, I guess, is just to keep the story fresh and moving in different directions constantly.
3517.16 3527.44 speaker4  when I came back from one of the loops, I was trying to convince them to go to Comcomfy Campground. We had another chance to have done that.
3523.12 3557.16 speaker2  I was also planning on that happening, yeah, for a while. it seemed that there was an uneasy truce between the Circle of Knowledge, Coq, Myriad and the majority of factions in the series with the possible exception of the Glass Syndicate. Was this unity an allied powers-esque counter to MARY's agenda?
3556.32 3563.80 speaker3  Yeah.
3560.52 3570.96 speaker2  I like to think that Myriad and the Circle of Knowledge, Bar Corp, they were all kind of working together.
3568.52 3574.72 speaker4  that they're all moving in different ways toward the same goal.
3571.80 3636.64 speaker2  Yeah, and Love was talking to you guys about that outside of Beans Pond and that is true. MARY was not a part of that agenda. Everyone was pretty confused about the balls and how they work and no one had a grasp on it was my thought process. There are a couple other balls that are out there in this world that were never found and I never wrote anything for them because I didn't. Make it up right now. Didn't think I needed to. of successes, Kacelle knocked out a certain number of them, John was one of them and yeah, the math doesn't quite add up there's one or two I think that are left out. Nice. And so they're still doing this stuff. Also, keep in mind if you're stoned and you're listening to this and it's late at night and it's dark and you're in your house by yourself, don't look out the window because there's someone looking at you.
3633.36 3655.70 speaker3  Yeah, and your ball.
3651.62 3657.62 speaker2  Xylopia or, well, no, it's gotta be that, right?
3656.66 3662.18 speaker4  Oh yeah, probably.
3661.34 3664.68 speaker2  Nothing. Nothing. Nothing, but we are talking about it.
3663.84 3668.10 speaker4  Who the fuck told you that? I'll tell you about season two.
3666.52 3674.38 speaker3  How do you know about that? That wasn't supposed to leave this room. Codename season two.
3672.74 3681.46 speaker4  that you've done a lot of work on it already.
3679.18 3720.30 speaker2  contention in the main story and everything, like with the NPCs that would be moving parts were all written out well before we started recording. And I was like, oh shit, I gotta get on this. So I've had the idea rumbling around in my head for season two since, I would say, when we were recording episode 12. Nice. And I've kind of fine-tuned it. Taylor has worked as my story supervisor to basically me talking out loud and her being like, that doesn't make sense. Let's fix that. So that's what we can tell you.
3718.74 3723.94 speaker3  What were you watching a lot of at that point in time?
3722.46 3739.10 speaker2  What was I watching? Gilligan's Island. Mr. Strange, wait, what was it? Jonathan Norrell? Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell. Yeah.
3738.28 3749.74 speaker3  It's pretty good. Yeah, I think it's really fun.
3746.90 3794.66 speaker2  but I really like that story. Dirk Gilligan had a lot to do with season one. John dies at the end, had a lot to do with season one. Anytime I'm watching media or listening to media, of Scum and Villainy or some other spacey flavor of tabletop role-playing? C Mothership. Yeah, for sure. I've heard Scum and Villainy is dope. Yeah, I think it is not name brand, but it is essentially, do you want to role play Star Wars? This is a way to do it. Cool.
3793.50 3813.22 speaker3  the whole time we were playing it? What? Scum and Villainy.
3808.78 3817.62 speaker2  PTBP is my only Patreon subscription at the moment. Hey, thank you.
3814.18 3834.10 speaker3  We encourage you to divest as much if you're welcome and invest it all in PTBP. It's going up and up and up and up, baby. Diamond hands on PTBP.
3831.94 3844.10 speaker2  1KL, oh no.
3843.26 3849.30 speaker3  Come town joke.
3847.06 3870.58 speaker2  What was the schism in the circle of knowledge? Really all about. Her relationship with her father depreciated in value every single time something unnatural happened and that is what led her to come up with the idea to dethrone him and take over the circle of knowledge.
3867.92 3876.78 speaker4  before we blipped into existence as characters. That is correct. Because we found a bunch of notes about that schism happening previous to us.
3875.82 3883.06 speaker3  Gotcha, cool. Yeah.
3880.10 3897.78 speaker2  what was the deal with Joe's parents? Why did they get the book? What was the deal with their hinting him about letters slash Wheel of Fortune? I may just have spaced something.
3896.44 3904.26 speaker3  but what's the deal with Joe's parents? Like Joe's parents, it's a whole ass episode.
3900.62 3936.82 speaker4  Yeah, we would need some time. or answer why they got the book. I can tell you what I think of as the day in the library was Clark Old, the overseer, protecting young Clark and knowing that that was a timeline that needed to continue. And that's why he chained the doors closed
3933.70 3966.34 speaker2  I just threw the vague back to Luke and mid answer, Joe just like snagged it out of the air one handed and then handed it to Luke and continued answering until we couldn't hold it in anymore. And the deal with Joe's parents is just simply, they had the book, don't fucking worry about it.
3964.18 3982.18 speaker4  that Clark and the overseer storyline ended is that he was gonna go back and put the pieces in place that then set them in motion to end up where they ended up. So the book had to end up with Joe's parents. Is that a TV trope? With Clark's parents.
3980.18 4074.84 speaker2  And yes, you're 100% right about the day that Clark was in the library as a child. That is exactly what the overseer was there to do. But the overseer was always being chased by myriad. Thanks. Thank you. It's been a fun ride. Thank you. Thanks. Thank you. My question is, what, if any, meaning did the actual vocal portion of the spells throughout the show have? Like, were they a specific language? Did they mean something aside from the spell? And the answer is slightly. Yeah, I used a Google translate to take words that I thought were meaningful to the spell. And then I Google translated them into fucking Swedish and then Arabic and then French and then Spanish and then Indonesian and then Dutch. And just like somewhere along the line, pulled out a syllable or two that I liked that also worked toward that spell. So if it was like time backwards, then I would do it with those two words and then put those combination of syllables together. And that's how I came up with the spell. So that's how we used hyper geometry in season one. And I've been working on my magic engine for season two. And I'm pretty stoked about it. So.
4072.88 4084.96 speaker3  And I did the same with to do hakanu.
4084.12 4092.10 speaker2  Very cool. And I love season one and congratulations on finishing it on such a high note. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
4091.28 4094.22 speaker3  Thank you.
4092.94 4129.58 speaker2  My question is a bit more pertaining to the behind the scenes stuff, but I wanted to know how you guys approach the various topics or directions that the characters will go through. I know a lot of the twists were surprises and I was wondering if you guys had to talk beforehand regarding what topics to avoid or if certain subjects were too sensitive for some people, or if a player didn't like a certain direction that the handler took their character down because it seemed like everyone took all the surprises in stride and strove to continue the story with them. And that really stood out to me. Excuse my shitty English, which.
4128.74 4131.98 speaker4  Your English was great.
4129.58 4147.66 speaker2  Your English was phenomenal. Alc underscore the underscore missed also added your English is fine. Thanks for popping in there to reassure this poster. Thanks.
4146.42 4163.32 speaker3  like, do we want to, like, we discuss some content beforehand, and thoughtful discussions about what we do
4161.74 4166.44 speaker4  We definitely have one-on-ones with Zach too that are like, hey, here's what I'm thinking.
4165.62 4170.90 speaker3  He'll do that. Like I want to kind of do this with your character maybe or whatever.
4169.68 4227.02 speaker2  Which even pre-recording, I specifically remember one day at work, I was, I texted all three of you when I was working the shitty job and I took my lunch break so seriously. reading every post on the R slash Call of Cthulhu and R slash Delta Green subreddits. I went to top all time. And I read for like 10 pages on both of those, just consuming as much content as I could to try to try to get more info on how to be good at this. But I texted you guys something about your characters and Joe texted me back immediately. And then we literally started like role-playing like a solo thing with his character over text message on my lunch break to prepare for like the next session that was happening.
4226.18 4247.04 speaker4  So sick. There's also a part of the question that says, if a player didn't like a certain direction that the handler was taking their character down, I never felt that way, but I also always felt comfortable if I needed to, to tell you that. I think you were receptive to anything we said.
4245.58 4257.96 speaker3  And I think there have been a couple of moments where we're like, I don't, I can't think of anything in particular, but it does feel like maybe we've done that.
4256.22 4280.88 speaker2  there might've even been a couple of times where just mid campaign, you might come up to me and be like, hey. I'm Irish now. I'm Irish now. Meaning to talk more about it in character, if you could kind of prompt it in the role-playing. Like Joe said, that's my hope obviously, is that you guys feel comfortable coming to me with any concerns that you have.
4278.80 4288.60 speaker4  There's nothing so sacred that I would feel like I couldn't say, hey, I don't know if this is what I want.
4286.70 4306.52 speaker3  Zach lustily texted Joe.
4303.88 4307.56 speaker2  we've been friends for a long time and like-
4306.52 4310.00 speaker3  We all know kind of.
4307.56 4314.50 speaker2  Yeah, we know our boundaries, I think.
4312.62 4322.66 speaker3  if we didn't have like the same general values.
4320.14 4326.54 speaker2  And I wouldn't, if you were gonna joke about stuff that I wasn't comfortable with. Yeah, for sure.
4325.30 4349.30 speaker3  All people as people. Exactly, which is- It's a really, really basic concept. It's like so simple. Jacob pepping.
4346.66 4368.74 speaker2  Pepping, Jacob pepping just says, love the show, only actual play to really grab me and drag me down into the ooze and never let me go. Thank you. Thank you. Erotic. Yeah, that's great. If everyone had to pick a moment from the show, what would it be? Coolest, funniest, most memorable, or just most nuts?
4367.52 4390.02 speaker4  Most recently. Yeah, man. The Keith turn. It was incredible.
4387.18 4404.60 speaker2  Really important, the way that that all went down and the fight with John and Clark, like the roles just happened the way that told a fun story. Yeah.
4402.24 4409.56 speaker3  I was like, dude, this is sick. That was one of the most intense things, I think,
4408.54 4410.58 speaker4  Are you talking about in the house?
4409.56 4414.52 speaker3  Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Where I was like, oh, we're gonna die. Like this is-
4413.04 4423.36 speaker4  Yeah, yeah, right, totally.
4420.72 4436.60 speaker2  when I described the top half of that robot of role-playing for Zach, like. Yep.
4435.12 4450.84 speaker3  I saw the look in their eyes and I've been chasing that feeling ever since. And you gave us just an old man shitting himself the whole time, too?
4447.40 4454.36 speaker2  You guys were so aggressive about the guns with him.
4452.60 4462.64 speaker3  That seems like so long ago. It was so long ago we did that, but that was dope.
4460.12 4498.90 speaker2  from the season one of pretending to be people that when you think about the show, like reaches out to you as a particular moment? Well, for me, for you as a role player, I can think of two specifically. One, Martin Cupertino, trying to convince the group that he was in the right about where to go when you guys were in the woods and looking for the door. And you had a much lower skill in survival than the alternative, which was the archeologist played by Joe.
4498.06 4501.40 speaker3  Whose name was? I don't remember his name.
4500.56 4505.34 speaker2  I don't either. And it was not Angela.
4503.66 4522.24 speaker3  Angie, Angie, Angie. Which that cracked me up when I was like, hey, can I name your wife, Angela? And then I was like, ha ha ha.
4520.28 4524.72 speaker4  off the podcast, didn't it? To me.
4523.08 4534.84 speaker2  Oh, I think it might've. I think it might've. I think I wasn't recording when you put two and two together.
4533.76 4539.64 speaker4  Idiot.
4536.96 4594.50 speaker2  And then the other one for Thomas is, when you decided that, when you passed a sanity check in the Old West Arc That was another. And then additionally, I'll throw up one more just because we're on the topic and I'm thinking of it. When you threw Drew Andrews against the wall, when it was just me and you, and you threatened his life. Oh, yeah.
4591.08 4601.94 speaker3  if you tried to screw me out of our cocaine deal.
4598.22 4627.32 speaker2  but he did throw out the idea top of like, okay, so this much money split four ways. And Thomas was like, no. like I thought I was going to be able to rope all of you into being the worst fucking cops. Oh, which you did on your own for the most part.
4624.56 4632.02 speaker3  but then when we found Fergie Beans, it might've just instantly gone to gunfire.
4630.86 4646.98 speaker2  That would have been really cool. That was the reveal that I was hoping for is the four of you out there for a drug deal and then Keith's fucking brother shows up with a van full of android kids.
4643.02 4651.70 speaker3  At the same time, imagine the Keith that we know is essentially the villain of this whole story.
4649.22 4655.26 speaker2  Definitely the villain of this whole story.
4651.70 4693.14 speaker3  Getting like a million dollars and some change to fund those dreams earlier than, you know, then he might've otherwise realized them. I don't think it's a, it wouldn't be prudent. It wouldn't be prudent. To quote a relevant and popular sketch from a relevant and popular show. Yes, that was super fucking fun. The orchestration of his brother's murder.
4690.56 4703.26 speaker2  got to take where you got got first and then were able to take them down
4701.14 4725.06 speaker3  That actually is like, I was like, oh my fucking God, I'm such a goddamn idiot. I'm the dumbest man alive.
4720.78 4732.56 speaker2  and you know that like the story is on your side. Right, in Delta Green, you're not like supposed to win. No, anything you do.
4730.70 4763.46 speaker3  This is why DMs like it so much your sick little rocks off. Post kill clarity. I gotta bring him back, I gotta bring him back. Load up the mausoleum.
4762.34 4782.82 speaker2  through this first Q&A. We're gonna do one more to finish out the rest of these questions that everybody asked. to answer the remaining questions that you all have and thank you. Thanks for listening. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
4780.98 4798.94 speaker3  If you've listened this far, whoa. Whoa. with the exciting conclusion of the question Zach was gonna ask us.
4797.64 4806.46 speaker2  I'm gonna eat a woman, a woman. Sorry, sorry." I know you really can't.
4804.24 4806.46 speaker3  pace game sort of tennis cinematography. Fly to fly to stream.
