00:00.000 --> 00:08.540
Greetings to all of the fine people who consider themselves PTBP enjoyers, and to those who

00:08.540 --> 00:12.240
do not yet enjoy, well, you will.

00:12.240 --> 00:16.900
I am your master of ceremony, Wolf the Dog.

00:16.900 --> 00:24.400
I have a master's degree in radio DJing and a bachelor's of fine arts in Greece applications.

00:24.400 --> 00:29.540
This is the station you all know as 694.2 PTBP.

00:29.540 --> 00:37.260
I'm here to make sure your ear ditches are properly lubricated and ready to receive informations.

00:37.260 --> 00:43.380
Instead of howling with Wolf, everybody's favorite segment, me, Wolf, would like to

00:43.380 --> 00:51.860
take a moment and howl at all of you who have entered the 694.2 PTBP season 2 fan art contest

00:51.860 --> 00:53.260
slash drawing.

00:53.260 --> 00:57.260
Howl!

00:57.380 --> 01:03.100
And here's another howl for those who took the extra step to post their entries on Instagram,

01:03.100 --> 01:08.620
Twitter, and Facebook with the hashtag PTBPcontest2.

01:08.620 --> 01:14.060
Howl!

01:14.060 --> 01:20.180
Remember, there will be a winner of the contest, and sure, they will be chosen by Joe and Justin

01:20.180 --> 01:25.620
and Luke and Thomas and Zach, and they will receive any three items of their choosing

01:25.820 --> 01:32.180
from the PTBP merch store, and their name will forever be remembered as the winner of

01:32.180 --> 01:39.780
this contest, and we will all bow down before their eternal and likely squamous artistry.

01:39.780 --> 01:44.660
But two more of you yahoos are going to be randomly picked to receive whatever piece

01:44.660 --> 01:52.100
of merch your heart desires, and you can enter any medium into this contest slash drawing.

01:52.100 --> 01:57.900
One of our esteemed and delightful moderators, Marie, has suggested that folks who can't

01:57.900 --> 02:04.100
trawl try out another form of media like Fanfic or a video of yourself doing the walk while

02:04.100 --> 02:05.900
squatting dance.

02:05.900 --> 02:09.180
Hmm, this strikes me as excellent advice.

02:09.180 --> 02:11.780
Fuck, could even win.

02:11.780 --> 02:16.420
Remember to submit them entries on the pinned thread over on the Pretending to be People

02:16.420 --> 02:17.420
subreddit.

02:17.660 --> 02:23.580
And then for additional entries, post that shit on Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook.

02:23.580 --> 02:27.200
If Wolf repeats himself, then you know it's true.

02:27.200 --> 02:29.860
So take this next bit to heart.

02:29.860 --> 02:33.300
The links are in the damn show notes.

02:33.300 --> 02:41.020
I spend all day and night typing up them little show notes for y'all, and I wonder to myself,

02:41.020 --> 02:43.620
is anyone even reading this stuff?

02:43.620 --> 02:48.340
I lay awake pondering, brainstorming, typing even.

02:48.340 --> 02:52.020
Do y'all know how many keyboards I go through?

02:52.020 --> 02:55.860
They're all so sopping wet after just a few words.

02:55.860 --> 03:02.220
So please, I beg of you, just this once, for dear old Wolfie, go take a look at them show

03:02.220 --> 03:03.220
notes.

03:03.220 --> 03:09.580
Now, let's dig in or down or whatever with our shiny new shovel and damn, this thing

03:09.580 --> 03:10.660
is sharp.

03:10.660 --> 03:15.900
Could probably slice right through Rapunzel's hair or fell a massive beanstalk.

03:15.900 --> 03:21.060
But this isn't Sondheim, we're just going into the news.

03:21.060 --> 03:28.100
Last time, Cal Colorado was in and out of a reverie while exploring the Zeitgeist Inn.

03:28.100 --> 03:34.940
His engagement to Virginia Wolf, the dog, the bounty hunter, Biden, AKA Virginia McIntyre

03:34.940 --> 03:36.360
out.

03:36.400 --> 03:43.520
His old archeologist contact, Dr. Brock Hargrave, left his shovel hidden in the tree line after

03:43.520 --> 03:49.520
potentially digging holes that absolutely spell out the numbers 836 and Braille, but

03:49.520 --> 03:53.800
you know, big and in the ground and now refilled.

03:53.800 --> 03:58.440
In, he's excited for his new life with his new wife.

03:58.440 --> 04:05.260
Out, he's putting his nose in a Ziploc bag with a waxy substance smeared about, trying

04:05.260 --> 04:07.140
to smell God.

04:07.140 --> 04:11.260
Who's to say which is a happier time for Cal Colorado?

04:11.260 --> 04:18.340
I guess I could, but instead, he has a brand new tune to keep those pesky memories at bay.

04:18.340 --> 04:23.940
It's Alter Girl with My Life is Great and It's All My Fall.

04:35.260 --> 04:59.780
Because my life is great and it's all my fall.

04:59.780 --> 05:04.380
The prison guard was banging on our cell.

05:04.380 --> 05:06.580
What's up?

05:06.580 --> 05:12.180
Drinking these and burping makes me think of when I was playing Ephraim, Judge Ephraim

05:12.180 --> 05:13.180
Courtland.

05:13.180 --> 05:14.180
Oh yeah.

05:14.180 --> 05:18.500
And I would like drink in any given hour of recording that, I would drink like seven of

05:18.500 --> 05:23.420
those and I would like, I would drink like half of one and then shake my body around

05:23.420 --> 05:27.300
so that I had a burp ready to go as soon as it was needed.

05:27.300 --> 05:29.700
I had no idea you were so committed to that character.

05:29.700 --> 05:33.180
What we do for the art baby, wow.

05:33.180 --> 05:38.100
I'm really glad that we were recording remote when that was happening.

05:38.100 --> 05:39.100
I don't know.

05:39.100 --> 05:40.740
I think.

05:40.740 --> 05:42.460
I'm not sure I would have been able to go.

05:42.460 --> 05:43.460
Oh my God.

05:43.460 --> 05:48.500
Oh no, the judge is back.

05:48.500 --> 05:51.300
They smell pleasant though, like strawberry.

05:51.300 --> 05:52.300
The burps.

05:52.300 --> 05:54.140
All of them, no matter what you've been drinking?

05:54.140 --> 05:55.140
Mm-hmm.

05:55.140 --> 05:59.980
Even if I'm not, even if it's not a burp from chugging sparkling water.

05:59.980 --> 06:06.420
Oh, that last one was so, such hashtag wet energy.

06:06.420 --> 06:08.780
Yeah, hashtag wet energy.

06:08.780 --> 06:10.820
That's a big theme this season, Zach.

06:10.820 --> 06:13.220
It is a big theme this season.

06:13.220 --> 06:14.220
God, that's wet.

06:14.220 --> 06:16.420
I don't like it, the words.

06:16.420 --> 06:17.420
Why?

06:17.420 --> 06:18.740
Wet energy?

06:18.740 --> 06:19.740
Yeah.

06:19.740 --> 06:24.460
People are lying when they say they have a problem with moist, but.

06:24.460 --> 06:29.740
Oh, I think because of, I think it's because of the fucking wet beef sign of the town we

06:29.740 --> 06:30.740
made up, Springfield.

06:30.740 --> 06:38.760
There's this guy who makes these Chicago style wet beef sandwiches, but he advertises it.

06:38.760 --> 06:41.140
Are you talking about the commercial that plays on Cardinal games?

06:41.140 --> 06:42.700
Because that's the one that gets me.

06:42.700 --> 06:44.180
What I have not heard of.

06:44.180 --> 06:46.020
A girl goes, why are you all wet?

06:46.020 --> 06:50.060
And the other girl goes, because I ate a wet Italian beef from.

06:50.060 --> 06:51.060
Don't say that.

06:51.060 --> 06:52.060
It's so gross.

06:52.060 --> 06:53.780
Don't give the wet beef guy business.

06:53.780 --> 06:57.140
I love that place.

06:57.140 --> 06:58.140
Everything there is good.

06:58.220 --> 07:01.100
I assume the wet beef is good too, but I'll never order it.

07:01.100 --> 07:02.420
No, I always get the muffuletta.

07:02.420 --> 07:05.900
I always get the, his last name special.

07:05.900 --> 07:15.100
Actually, I think it's a, it's not, it's like, oh, I didn't know it was both names.

07:15.100 --> 07:18.020
Lot of beeps there.

07:18.020 --> 07:23.180
Oh, I didn't know it was beep.

07:23.180 --> 07:27.980
It's beep, beeps, beep, beep, beep.

07:27.980 --> 07:30.620
Big fan of sandwiches though, overall.

07:30.620 --> 07:40.460
And like when I've got a wet saucer, maybe I can dip my Sammy into make it all nice.

07:40.460 --> 07:41.460
Yeah, dude.

07:41.460 --> 07:42.460
Yeah.

07:42.460 --> 07:43.460
I don't speak French.

07:43.460 --> 07:44.460
Sorry.

07:44.460 --> 07:45.460
I sneeze.

07:45.460 --> 07:46.460
I like it a lot.

07:46.460 --> 07:50.260
Is his sign still like a, the fill in the blanks thing?

07:50.260 --> 07:51.260
What does it say?

07:51.260 --> 07:55.900
At one point it was like, I like my coffee black, my something, something and my beef

07:55.900 --> 07:56.900
wet.

07:56.900 --> 08:02.460
That's what we're talking about at the start is awful, awful signs.

08:02.460 --> 08:03.460
Yeah.

08:03.460 --> 08:04.460
What is this?

08:04.460 --> 08:05.460
Have you driven by it recently?

08:05.460 --> 08:06.980
That was a common one.

08:06.980 --> 08:08.340
That's pretty often up there.

08:08.340 --> 08:16.340
One was just like fill in the blank and it's like W T B F.

08:16.340 --> 08:17.340
Wet beef.

08:17.340 --> 08:18.340
You nailed it.

08:18.340 --> 08:19.340
Oh no, he doesn't.

08:19.340 --> 08:20.340
Okay.

08:20.340 --> 08:21.340
He doesn't say wet beef.

08:21.340 --> 08:26.500
He says wet Italian specifically, which is why it's gross because you picked your

08:27.100 --> 08:36.820
I don't even know what he looks like, but I assume it's grosser if he's wet, wet in

08:36.820 --> 08:37.820
Italian.

08:37.820 --> 08:42.820
Anyway, shout out to Springfield, Missouri.

08:42.820 --> 08:48.900
What's beef beef.

08:48.900 --> 08:51.420
Monzo and both together.

08:51.420 --> 08:52.420
Yep.

08:53.420 --> 08:54.420
Give me something different.

08:54.420 --> 08:55.420
Monzo innuomido.

08:55.420 --> 08:56.420
Monzo innuomido.

08:56.420 --> 08:58.740
I think that means beef in water.

08:58.740 --> 09:00.540
I think that's sloppy steaks.

09:00.540 --> 09:01.540
Okay.

09:01.540 --> 09:03.540
Enough about that.

09:03.540 --> 09:06.260
You're getting my beef wet if you know what I mean.

09:06.260 --> 09:07.740
I do know what you mean.

09:07.740 --> 09:09.380
You're making my bread hard.

09:09.380 --> 09:10.380
Soggy.

09:10.380 --> 09:16.100
Oh, I got real high on Luke's vape pen so I was just looking at Thomas.

09:16.100 --> 09:21.660
Thomas was looking at maybe the darker reflection of himself in the TV.

09:21.660 --> 09:31.020
No, I was just looking at that koozie, but that's a much bleaker possibility and I could

09:31.020 --> 09:33.260
see how it looked like that.

09:33.260 --> 09:41.700
No, honestly, I was trying to not think about wet Italians and I was trying to think about

09:41.700 --> 09:45.940
the fucking game we're supposed to be playing and what our next move would be.

09:45.940 --> 09:48.700
How God damn dare you.

09:48.700 --> 09:55.740
Julius looks at the Ziploc bag and thinks, that looks a little like some wet beef.

09:55.740 --> 09:59.260
Maybe one of you should eat it.

09:59.260 --> 10:03.900
The meta gaming at this stage in the story is a...

10:03.900 --> 10:08.300
Well, that's why I don't take notes.

10:08.300 --> 10:11.820
Every time we record, it's a whole brand new experience.

10:11.820 --> 10:18.820
Yeah, to catch us up, based on where we were, y'all were smelling the bag, y'all were smelling

10:18.820 --> 10:19.820
God.

10:19.820 --> 10:21.620
I believe Julius Summers was the first one...

10:21.620 --> 10:24.180
I think we were specifically not smelling.

10:24.180 --> 10:29.340
Julius Summers was the first one who caught a whiff.

10:29.340 --> 10:30.540
I didn't smell it though.

10:30.540 --> 10:33.660
I touched it and caught the smell, I think.

10:33.660 --> 10:34.940
As you picked it up.

10:34.940 --> 10:35.940
Okay.

10:36.500 --> 10:39.860
Was it from the bag or from touching it?

10:39.860 --> 10:42.580
Smells a curious scent, huh?

10:42.580 --> 10:43.580
Hm.

10:43.580 --> 10:45.780
Makes you think.

10:45.780 --> 10:50.620
That would have made more sense.

10:50.620 --> 10:56.660
We've got a situation then where the bag is handed over to Stevie and they smell it as

10:56.660 --> 11:06.300
well and their eyes get massive and they're like, oh yeah, that's the smell.

11:06.300 --> 11:13.420
And then Beck Wilder grabbed the bag as well, but then Cal Colorado steps in and says, Beck,

11:13.420 --> 11:15.420
wait, wait, no.

11:15.420 --> 11:19.740
You've got to film me smelling it first and...

11:19.740 --> 11:20.740
Get the shot here.

11:20.740 --> 11:21.740
Give me the baggie.

11:21.740 --> 11:22.740
Give me the baggie.

11:22.740 --> 11:23.740
Beck hands it over.

11:23.740 --> 11:24.740
Okay, okay.

11:24.740 --> 11:25.740
Sort of reluctantly.

11:25.820 --> 11:28.220
I'm just looking forward to a God whiff.

11:28.220 --> 11:30.020
I just got a God whiff of something.

11:30.020 --> 11:32.180
It's what your wife's cooking.

11:32.180 --> 11:35.300
You're smelling what your wife's cooking.

11:35.300 --> 11:37.740
You believe God is a whiff.

11:37.740 --> 11:40.100
Is that Chuck Mangione too?

11:40.100 --> 11:41.100
Yeah.

11:41.100 --> 11:43.780
Wow, that is actually really strong.

11:43.780 --> 11:45.660
That is, okay, so great.

11:45.660 --> 11:49.500
This is perfect for a forgetting main character.

11:49.500 --> 11:50.500
Yeah.

11:50.500 --> 11:51.500
It is Brussels sprouts.

11:51.500 --> 11:52.500
Yes, it is.

11:52.500 --> 11:56.580
I don't know if it's your chance to take a whiff, but we've got to make television first.

11:56.580 --> 12:03.300
We're here outside of the zeitgeist where we found a bag of what some say is a substance

12:03.300 --> 12:08.660
very close to the essence of God himself and they say they smelled God in this bag and

12:08.660 --> 12:10.580
we're going to take a whiff.

12:10.580 --> 12:13.100
Watch me now as I smell the bag.

12:13.100 --> 12:14.100
Slow zoom.

12:14.100 --> 12:16.100
Okay, I'm opening the bag.

12:16.100 --> 12:19.100
I'm putting my nose in the bag.

12:19.700 --> 12:23.700
And what happens?

12:23.700 --> 12:29.420
Okay, so this Ziploc bag has been turned inside out and the substance is on the outside of

12:29.420 --> 12:30.420
the bag.

12:30.420 --> 12:31.420
Which is in another bag.

12:31.420 --> 12:32.420
Right, which we covered.

12:32.420 --> 12:33.420
Which is now in another bag.

12:33.420 --> 12:34.420
Last episode.

12:34.420 --> 12:36.980
Yeah, I wanted to get the full visual.

12:36.980 --> 12:37.980
He knows what he's doing.

12:37.980 --> 12:38.980
Yeah, yeah.

12:38.980 --> 12:39.980
Yeah, I meant that other bag.

12:39.980 --> 12:40.980
No, no, yeah.

12:40.980 --> 12:41.980
I meant the second bag.

12:41.980 --> 12:42.980
The second bag.

12:42.980 --> 12:43.980
The exterior bag.

12:43.980 --> 12:44.980
Yeah.

12:44.980 --> 12:45.980
Is open and sniffed.

12:45.980 --> 12:49.700
We're feeling a Ziploc bag with a piece of God on the outside.

12:49.700 --> 12:53.700
We know, we know, we know.

12:53.700 --> 12:55.700
Have you, have you smelled God?

12:55.700 --> 12:59.980
It'd be hilarious if you like ripped a fart right then.

12:59.980 --> 13:06.860
No, I don't think Cal has.

13:06.860 --> 13:09.540
I don't think Cal has smelled God yet.

13:09.540 --> 13:15.260
Um, okay, real quick, uh, Joe and what's your name?

13:15.260 --> 13:16.260
Luke.

13:16.260 --> 13:19.380
If you guys could leave the room for a second.

13:19.380 --> 13:20.380
New guy.

13:20.380 --> 13:21.380
New guy!

13:21.380 --> 13:37.980
What does Cal know of this entity?

13:37.980 --> 13:40.820
I don't think he knows much at all about it.

13:40.820 --> 13:45.220
He probably doesn't think it's God for sure.

13:45.220 --> 13:51.980
Have you passed out each time God has been around or have you seen, have you gotten a

13:51.980 --> 13:53.460
visual on God?

13:53.460 --> 13:54.460
I don't think so.

13:54.460 --> 13:56.460
Smells like earwax.

13:56.460 --> 14:01.740
Yeah, Cal gags at that.

14:01.740 --> 14:08.560
He removes his nose from the bag and he squints at the camera and he says, well, if that's

14:08.560 --> 14:27.800
God folks, act just very earnestly, took his headphones off and stuck a finger in his ear.

14:27.800 --> 14:30.280
And I thought he was about to stand up and go like outside and pee or something.

14:30.280 --> 14:33.320
And then he just stuck his earwax finger in my nose.

14:33.320 --> 14:35.920
Well, you didn't, you didn't stick it in my nose.

14:35.920 --> 14:38.760
That would have been nuts if I penetrated nostrils.

14:38.760 --> 14:43.360
You proffered it like close enough and you didn't, you know, you didn't make me sniff

14:43.360 --> 14:47.680
it without consent, but it was there for me to sniff.

14:47.680 --> 14:49.480
I'm a decent friend.

14:49.480 --> 14:50.480
Yeah.

14:50.480 --> 14:58.660
So Cal says, well, some people may say this smells like divinity, but to me it just smells

14:58.660 --> 15:09.860
like the inside of some morons ear.

15:09.860 --> 15:14.660
Take your whiff back if you must.

15:14.660 --> 15:15.660
Morons earwax.

15:15.660 --> 15:17.460
I don't even know what that would smell like.

15:17.460 --> 15:21.280
Is that like an idiom?

15:21.280 --> 15:23.420
Go ahead and give it a smell.

15:23.420 --> 15:24.800
All right.

15:24.800 --> 15:29.600
And he's using his camera under his arm, like a selfie upward, so it's a real chinny

15:29.600 --> 15:35.800
shot and he holds it up to his nose and takes a whiff.

15:35.800 --> 15:38.120
Luke and Thomas, if you could leave the room for me.

15:38.120 --> 15:41.280
Why did we come here in the first place?

15:41.280 --> 15:45.960
So you can see how sweaty I am in person.

15:45.960 --> 15:51.100
Joe, what do you know of this entity?

15:51.100 --> 15:53.200
I saw it.

15:53.200 --> 15:57.760
It looked like a super soaker midair going from one entity into, I think it was Chuck

15:57.760 --> 16:00.800
Binwell I saw it hit and send him through a glass window.

16:00.800 --> 16:03.520
I don't remember if I've seen it since.

16:03.520 --> 16:04.880
I don't think I have.

16:04.880 --> 16:06.120
No, I think you were out.

16:06.120 --> 16:10.040
I think you passed out the next time that it was visible to someone.

16:10.040 --> 16:11.040
Yeah.

16:11.040 --> 16:14.680
So yeah, I've just got, I've got senses of what it looks like.

16:14.680 --> 16:19.800
You've been told what it smells like.

16:19.800 --> 16:21.360
Salt water, oceany.

16:21.360 --> 16:22.360
Oh, weird.

16:22.520 --> 16:25.080
It's like you're getting some of that.

16:25.080 --> 16:26.640
Oh yeah.

16:26.640 --> 16:34.200
You can definitely see where they're coming from as that scent overwhelming overpowers

16:34.200 --> 16:36.160
your nostrils.

16:36.160 --> 16:48.240
You are given visions and visuals of lightning continuously striking an unnaturally focused

16:48.240 --> 16:59.760
tornado and unholy stomach dropping phenomenon connecting the sky above and the ground below.

16:59.760 --> 17:07.440
This vibrating, humming electric and wet mass makes up this towering force of nature.

17:07.440 --> 17:15.840
This terrifying, unfamiliar deep below this tunnel travels.

17:15.840 --> 17:24.760
All of a sudden you see the middle of a desert and you see the sand just blast away in a

17:24.760 --> 17:29.920
circular pattern like ripples all through the sand.

17:29.920 --> 17:37.000
This entity is gone and there is just an endless hole and your vision goes down the hole further

17:37.000 --> 17:44.240
and further and further into dark, endless nothingness.

17:44.240 --> 17:50.120
And then you smell this odd sort of sailing and you're looking at everyone back here at

17:50.120 --> 17:51.120
the zeitgeist.

17:51.120 --> 17:52.120
Roll grip.

17:52.120 --> 17:53.120
Holy shit.

17:53.120 --> 17:54.120
That was cool.

17:54.120 --> 17:55.120
I pass.

17:55.120 --> 18:02.680
You only lose one grip here.

18:02.680 --> 18:05.800
You're able to kind of hold on.

18:05.800 --> 18:12.280
You wonder to yourself almost if you've sort of tuned in to one of these events occurring,

18:12.280 --> 18:14.840
but you're not certain of that.

18:14.840 --> 18:17.720
You just have this horrible feeling.

18:17.720 --> 18:23.640
I think that he holds on to some of his grip because it was oddly beautiful.

18:23.640 --> 18:30.520
It was a storm with lightning crashing a spectacle and then that tunnel downward into nothingness

18:30.520 --> 18:33.480
was almost peaceful by the end of it.

18:33.480 --> 18:37.120
It was a shock and then relief and release.

18:37.120 --> 18:41.640
He was still frightened by it, I think ultimately, but there was something about it that was

18:41.640 --> 18:42.640
almost nice.

18:42.640 --> 18:43.640
I love that.

18:43.640 --> 18:44.640
That was cool.

18:44.640 --> 18:53.000
Beck Wilder grabs the bag.

18:53.000 --> 19:00.320
You see him take a whiff and he's staring for a moment and then he throws the bag to

19:00.320 --> 19:01.320
the ground.

19:01.320 --> 19:08.800
He drops the camera and goes to pick up the camera and you see in his eyes he's wild eyed

19:08.800 --> 19:13.040
and he looks frightened, but also like when a little kid gets frightened, there's also

19:13.040 --> 19:16.120
like a little bit of a smile there.

19:16.120 --> 19:27.760
He's what that smell like smell dude.

19:27.760 --> 19:31.080
I saw holy shit here.

19:31.080 --> 19:33.280
What'd you see the store?

19:33.280 --> 19:35.360
You guys didn't see the store.

19:35.360 --> 19:36.560
Holy shit.

19:36.560 --> 19:39.560
Like oh holy shit.

19:39.560 --> 19:41.120
Lightning tornado stuff.

19:41.120 --> 19:42.120
Yeah.

19:42.120 --> 19:43.120
Yeah.

19:43.120 --> 19:44.120
That's it.

19:44.120 --> 19:45.120
I think I saw.

19:45.120 --> 19:46.120
I think I saw a hole dude.

19:46.120 --> 19:52.160
I think I saw the formation of a fucking hole where shit.

19:52.160 --> 19:55.280
This can be like that map guesser game on the internet.

19:55.280 --> 19:56.280
It was Sandy.

19:56.280 --> 20:00.320
They drove on the left side of the road and the trees.

20:00.320 --> 20:03.480
The sun was in the Northern hemisphere.

20:03.480 --> 20:08.580
It's the desert or the beach or a volleyball court.

20:08.580 --> 20:12.180
It was magnificent and terrible.

20:12.180 --> 20:14.600
How long did this take a flash guys?

20:14.600 --> 20:20.480
I think, you know, it makes me smell God and it made you see the storm and stuff.

20:20.480 --> 20:25.200
I think I think we got to get this stuff to to Greg.

20:25.200 --> 20:27.000
Why do you think that?

20:27.000 --> 20:34.240
Because God is in Greg and I smell God and he saw, you know, what God is making Greg

20:34.240 --> 20:40.220
do when, when we interacted with this stuff, maybe God will like this or maybe it he'll

20:40.220 --> 20:41.220
hate it.

20:41.220 --> 20:44.880
But either way, it's something, it could be some sort of like direct link.

20:44.880 --> 20:45.880
Yeah.

20:45.880 --> 20:49.220
I suppose we could use it to track God down.

20:49.220 --> 20:53.720
Like a that's so Raven, like look into the future a little bit to see where he is.

20:54.360 --> 20:58.680
Just like a, you know, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, what are we, what are you, what

20:58.680 --> 21:01.000
are we talking about when we talk about God?

21:01.000 --> 21:05.320
I mean, whatever was in the turtle and whatever's in Greg.

21:05.320 --> 21:06.320
Yeah.

21:06.320 --> 21:11.360
That like wet energy, the wet, the wet energy for sure.

21:11.360 --> 21:19.920
Cal is really trying to like square wet energy with a Methodism.

21:19.920 --> 21:28.160
He's like, okay, like a, like a Buddhist thing, like, okay.

21:28.160 --> 21:29.160
This is something, right?

21:29.160 --> 21:31.520
This is something powerful.

21:31.520 --> 21:38.080
We saw powerful things at the Godels, little lair, little big secret city, but you know,

21:38.080 --> 21:39.080
this could be God.

21:39.080 --> 21:43.120
This could be the work of very bad men.

21:43.120 --> 21:44.120
And that's what we do.

21:44.120 --> 21:45.120
We stop bad men.

21:45.120 --> 21:46.120
Right?

21:46.120 --> 21:47.120
Yeah.

21:48.080 --> 21:50.480
And give him this stuff.

21:50.480 --> 21:53.840
Maybe see how he reacts to it.

21:53.840 --> 21:58.240
Um, yeah, maybe we've got to find him first.

21:58.240 --> 21:59.240
Yeah.

21:59.240 --> 22:02.720
Well, and I think we can make, I don't, you know, I don't want to put this on you back,

22:02.720 --> 22:07.560
but we might be able to get a good idea of where he is or where he's been.

22:07.560 --> 22:13.000
If, if you can kind of, if it makes you see, I mean, you guys want me to take another hit?

22:13.000 --> 22:17.040
What do you saw this right when you, just when you smelled the, yeah.

22:17.080 --> 22:18.080
What did I look like?

22:18.080 --> 22:19.760
Was I standing there for like 20 minutes?

22:19.760 --> 22:21.520
Oh, that's been weird looking.

22:21.520 --> 22:26.680
You sniffed and then you, and then you started the camera and ran away after like 20 minutes.

22:26.680 --> 22:27.680
No, immediately.

22:27.680 --> 22:28.680
Immediately.

22:28.680 --> 22:29.680
What?

22:29.680 --> 22:31.840
Wait, did you, you didn't make me roll for it.

22:31.840 --> 22:32.840
Did you?

22:32.840 --> 22:33.840
What?

22:33.840 --> 22:38.080
Roll for what?

22:38.080 --> 22:40.160
When I smelled the bag, you didn't make me roll.

22:40.160 --> 22:42.480
No, there's different sort of mechanics.

22:42.480 --> 22:43.480
Okay.

22:43.480 --> 22:44.480
Gotcha.

22:44.480 --> 22:45.480
For this whole thing.

22:45.480 --> 22:46.480
I smell what you're stepping in.

22:46.480 --> 22:47.480
Yeah.

22:47.480 --> 22:53.040
It's based on sense.

22:53.040 --> 22:57.600
I mean, it obviously doesn't take long to smell it again and see what you see.

22:57.600 --> 22:58.600
Wait.

22:58.600 --> 23:01.000
As long as we don't have to leave the room.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
Let me hold the camera.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
Okay.

23:03.000 --> 23:08.960
You, you hold it here and then you push this button to turn off the play to the record,

23:08.960 --> 23:09.960
but don't ever touch that.

23:09.960 --> 23:10.960
Like why would you?

23:10.960 --> 23:11.960
You know what I mean?

23:11.960 --> 23:14.440
And then this here you can use to zoom if you need to.

23:14.440 --> 23:20.000
I know how to use a camera back and he instantly pushes that button.

23:20.000 --> 23:25.280
Cal, I can see the lights off.

23:25.280 --> 23:26.280
What?

23:26.280 --> 23:27.560
Hit it one more time.

23:27.560 --> 23:28.560
Click.

23:28.560 --> 23:31.560
You got it buddy.

23:31.560 --> 23:36.360
Julius is going to kind of like get around back in case he like falls down or something

23:36.360 --> 23:37.360
to catch him.

23:37.360 --> 23:38.360
Yeah.

23:38.360 --> 23:39.360
I'll get the other side.

23:39.360 --> 23:40.360
All right.

23:40.360 --> 23:41.360
Hi.

23:41.880 --> 23:45.680
Wilder and I'm about to smell the God thing again.

23:45.680 --> 23:48.480
Ready?

23:48.480 --> 23:49.480
Here we go.

23:49.480 --> 23:52.480
And he does.

23:52.480 --> 24:01.480
This is the fucking watch thing.

24:01.480 --> 24:16.080
If Beck can, since he's doing this with purpose this time and it kind of hopes to know what

24:16.080 --> 24:20.240
to expect, he's going to try and do what we talked about and maybe instead of focusing

24:20.240 --> 24:24.360
on the storm, look for landmarks on the horizon and stuff like that.

24:24.360 --> 24:25.360
Very cool.

24:25.360 --> 24:28.880
If, if that's what happens, I don't, if he sees the storm again, maybe I see something

24:28.880 --> 24:29.880
else.

24:29.880 --> 24:30.880
Go ahead.

24:31.280 --> 24:34.280
Tell us what we see.

24:34.280 --> 24:38.480
Well, you tell me first, what do you, uh, what do you smell?

24:38.480 --> 24:41.440
What do you, uh, what are you feeling like?

24:41.440 --> 24:48.360
It's that brackish brine again to start and then I don't, I mean, then, then he starts

24:48.360 --> 24:54.360
smelling like what it smells like when it first starts to rain pet pet decor, petrichor.

24:54.360 --> 24:56.640
That's what that's called.

24:56.640 --> 24:59.240
Thanks Dr. Who.

24:59.280 --> 25:01.920
And then he starts to see the storm.

25:01.920 --> 25:11.000
Fleeing, flinging itself up into view over the side of the building where you stood in

25:11.000 --> 25:13.120
Grover's Gorge.

25:13.120 --> 25:21.960
The thing flings itself into the body of Chuck Bidwell, thrusting him, I mean, just exploding

25:21.960 --> 25:24.520
the sky backwards.

25:24.520 --> 25:34.320
And then you see that exact same wet energy that blew past you traveling vast distances,

25:34.320 --> 25:45.320
hauling ass in one singular direction over different landmasses, over different landmarks,

25:45.320 --> 25:49.680
over different climate systems and weather patterns.

25:49.680 --> 25:56.200
This thing travels over oceans onto new land.

25:56.200 --> 26:06.520
Let's roll search or yeah, I think search is probably good.

26:06.520 --> 26:09.200
It's a 47 on a 40.

26:09.200 --> 26:10.200
Fail.

26:10.200 --> 26:11.200
Damn dude.

26:11.200 --> 26:18.720
Um, man, yeah, and you're pretty sure you saw like one big thing, but you can't quite

26:18.760 --> 26:24.800
make out what it was and you're like, oh, it was something, it was something big.

26:24.800 --> 26:28.000
You could have figured it out.

26:28.000 --> 26:29.000
You're pretty sure.

26:29.000 --> 26:37.600
I was just a little more worldly.

26:37.600 --> 26:43.600
Beck throws the bag down and this time he looks a little more confused, but also like

26:43.600 --> 26:47.760
his heart rate is up again and kind of wide eyed.

26:47.800 --> 26:48.800
Uh, okay.

26:48.800 --> 26:49.800
News update.

26:49.800 --> 26:50.800
Dudes.

26:50.800 --> 26:53.120
Uh, it's not like present all the time.

26:53.120 --> 26:55.760
Like here's, I saw the fucking beginning, dude.

26:55.760 --> 27:01.960
I saw Grover's Gorge and I saw the first time I saw the fucking wet energy God, dude.

27:01.960 --> 27:03.640
It was flying into Chuck Bidwell.

27:03.640 --> 27:14.680
Like I saw the first time and then he took off and he was fucking going to fail T four

27:14.680 --> 27:20.960
plus one, one, two grip.

27:20.960 --> 27:26.400
You're able to hold it down, but this is going to be a struggle for Beck to get out all the

27:26.400 --> 27:27.400
time.

27:27.400 --> 27:50.160
And it was, it was like, it was like, it was like, I was like, so, okay, um, where is it

27:50.160 --> 27:51.160
now?

27:51.160 --> 27:56.920
I mean, like that's the bad news is like fucking anywhere, dude.

27:56.920 --> 27:58.800
It was just going.

27:58.800 --> 28:01.360
I'm not talking like across town, dude.

28:01.360 --> 28:04.120
I'm talking around the fucking globe.

28:04.120 --> 28:05.840
Is it making the holes?

28:05.840 --> 28:09.960
I mean this time it wasn't, but I think it was like on its way to, I think the first

28:09.960 --> 28:18.960
thing I saw it was a hole make and the second thing was a way to the hole where two speeds,

28:18.960 --> 28:21.200
which way did this hole?

28:21.200 --> 28:23.000
It went west east.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.000
Fuck.

28:24.000 --> 28:25.560
I never learned my directions, right?

28:25.560 --> 28:26.700
What can you tell us?

28:26.700 --> 28:29.120
It was continents, dude.

28:29.120 --> 28:35.000
Continents intercontinental ballistic man soul.

28:35.000 --> 28:36.000
There's something there.

28:36.000 --> 28:37.000
Yeah.

28:37.000 --> 28:43.760
Like an episode title, Julius, uh, doesn't want to lose the bag.

28:43.760 --> 28:47.680
So he grabs it and is going to try to put it back in the other bag.

28:47.680 --> 28:48.680
Hold on.

28:48.680 --> 28:49.680
Let me show you this thing.

28:49.680 --> 28:57.640
Give me, give me another with that back.

28:57.640 --> 28:58.640
Take this camera.

28:58.640 --> 28:59.640
Thanks.

28:59.640 --> 29:02.760
Julius grabs the bag off the ground, which is, I don't know if we've covered this, but

29:02.760 --> 29:07.040
it's the bag with the goo turned inside out inside of a Ziploc bag.

29:07.040 --> 29:10.880
I don't know if we've covered this just so we're all clear.

29:10.880 --> 29:16.680
He offers it to Cal Cal kind of like yanks it and he's a, he's a little like peeved and

29:16.680 --> 29:25.920
he takes a big, big whiff, uh, as big as he can of the bag.

29:25.920 --> 29:39.520
It just, it just smells like some asshole idiot, dill pickles, earwax.

29:39.520 --> 29:42.080
It smells like my fucking brother's earwax.

29:42.080 --> 29:43.080
Sorry.

29:43.080 --> 29:45.280
Sorry for my language.

29:45.280 --> 29:50.680
And like nothing else, nothing else.

29:50.680 --> 29:55.000
Let me try.

29:55.000 --> 30:06.360
He's going to give it a on purpose with this time, Joe and Thomas, point the camera at

30:06.360 --> 30:09.600
me.

30:09.600 --> 30:10.600
Joe walks back in.

30:10.600 --> 30:17.560
Becca's pointing the camera at him.

30:17.560 --> 30:25.480
You feel wet and through your eyes you see Julius Summers looking at you as you're walking

30:25.480 --> 30:33.720
with purpose towards the edge of the cliff in Godel's gate to Grover's gorge and you

30:33.720 --> 30:38.800
are on a mission and you make it to the edge.

30:38.800 --> 30:48.740
You feel your body falling, you feel free, you're not Julius Summers, you're something

30:48.740 --> 30:49.740
else entirely.

30:49.740 --> 31:03.120
You hit the ground, a rush of wet energy bursts forth and you are on board.

31:03.160 --> 31:14.200
Once again, as it just exactly as Beck described, like absolutely just fucking going.

31:14.200 --> 31:19.480
As you blast through the stained glass and enter this upside down church, you see the

31:19.480 --> 31:28.840
ceiling, which is now the floor of this enormous cavernous, almost hollowed out inside of this

31:28.840 --> 31:32.760
enormous cavernous church.

31:32.760 --> 31:39.520
There is a moat at least 10 meters wide running left to right through tunnels that have been

31:39.520 --> 31:41.800
bore out on either side.

31:41.800 --> 31:50.120
There's just a river of red liquid blood by the looks of it based on the countless bodies

31:50.120 --> 31:57.380
that are piled up on the far side of this moat and over the top of this moat is some

31:57.380 --> 32:07.140
train tracking and there is a small little train car sitting waiting patiently and then

32:07.140 --> 32:10.220
you open up your eyes and you're at the zeitgeist.

32:10.220 --> 32:11.220
Fuck yeah.

32:11.220 --> 32:12.220
Roll grip.

32:12.220 --> 32:15.980
It's probably not going to be a pass.

32:15.980 --> 32:16.980
Fourteen out of twenty.

32:16.980 --> 32:21.500
Oh shit, you're only going to lose one, you're going to be able to hold it together but just

32:21.500 --> 32:26.540
barely as this is absolutely stupid.

32:26.540 --> 32:27.900
Is that a good description?

32:27.900 --> 32:28.900
Yeah.

32:28.900 --> 32:30.780
Because this is fucking stupid.

32:30.780 --> 32:33.380
This shit's stupid.

32:33.380 --> 32:34.380
Okay then.

32:34.380 --> 32:39.340
How do you hold onto grip in the face of something so stupid?

32:39.340 --> 32:46.300
Because Julius takes this vision as a clue and he knows what he's going to suggest when

32:46.300 --> 32:51.500
the boys get back or by that I mean when he comes to.

32:51.500 --> 32:52.500
Whee!

32:52.500 --> 32:53.500
Whoa!

32:53.500 --> 32:54.500
Oh!

32:54.500 --> 32:55.500
Oh!

32:55.500 --> 33:04.980
Julius like is in his own world a little bit and then he comes to and looks at you guys.

33:04.980 --> 33:06.180
I know where to go.

33:06.180 --> 33:07.620
Holy shit!

33:07.620 --> 33:12.300
There's a like a blood subway in the church in Godel's gorge.

33:12.300 --> 33:13.940
A what?

33:13.940 --> 33:21.260
I rode on the wet wings of God into the church.

33:21.260 --> 33:22.260
Nice.

33:22.260 --> 33:24.060
Or maybe I was God.

33:24.060 --> 33:32.180
I felt like if you packed a whole day at Six Flags into one second.

33:32.180 --> 33:33.180
And then.

33:33.180 --> 33:34.180
In a good way or a bad way?

33:34.180 --> 33:36.740
In a great way until I saw.

33:36.740 --> 33:38.380
Like bad in a good way?

33:38.380 --> 33:42.060
There's like bad in a good way.

33:42.060 --> 33:49.720
There's a river of blood with a train on top of it surrounded by dead bodies in that upside

33:49.720 --> 33:57.680
down church in Grover's gorge and that's I think I mean that's where God went when

33:57.680 --> 34:00.640
I was with him.

34:00.640 --> 34:03.960
Alternatively I was thinking about jumping in one of those holes.

34:03.960 --> 34:05.560
Holy shit guys.

34:05.560 --> 34:07.200
Holy fucking shit.

34:07.200 --> 34:08.460
Alternatively.

34:08.460 --> 34:11.480
This isn't God this is this is the devil.

34:11.480 --> 34:13.680
Even more reason to find him and stop him.

34:13.680 --> 34:16.920
I'm definitely open to the idea of this thing being a devil dude.

34:16.920 --> 34:21.360
What if we just bulldozed the gorge right on in over on this stupid fucking church.

34:21.360 --> 34:22.360
Take that Satan.

34:22.360 --> 34:23.360
Right?

34:23.360 --> 34:24.360
Yeah.

34:24.360 --> 34:25.360
Haha.

34:25.360 --> 34:28.200
Like take a how?

34:28.200 --> 34:29.940
How would you do that?

34:29.940 --> 34:31.880
We fill it in we fill it all in.

34:31.880 --> 34:33.120
The whole thing.

34:33.120 --> 34:34.960
It was a lot that is true.

34:34.960 --> 34:38.160
And then they're not going to stop us with this whole project.

34:38.160 --> 34:44.280
Well that's why we reveal their sinister machinations to the world through the news.

34:44.280 --> 34:45.760
So everybody's on our side.

34:45.760 --> 34:47.760
But we got to get the facts first.

34:47.760 --> 34:56.840
We can't just report we smelled some goo and it's all gone.

34:56.840 --> 34:57.840
Why not?

34:57.840 --> 35:01.960
No damn it Beck he's right.

35:01.960 --> 35:04.800
We got to find the facts the source.

35:04.800 --> 35:10.080
I mean we got to we either got to go to one of the holes and like drop a camera in it

35:10.080 --> 35:12.380
or we got to get on the blood train.

35:12.380 --> 35:14.460
That weird nightcrawler guy.

35:14.460 --> 35:16.180
Didn't he have drones and stuff?

35:16.180 --> 35:17.180
Oh shit.

35:17.180 --> 35:18.180
Daddy?

35:18.180 --> 35:19.180
Yeah.

35:19.180 --> 35:21.800
He would love to plug one of those holes.

35:21.800 --> 35:30.340
Let's call daddy and get him to plug a hole.

35:30.340 --> 35:32.220
What was daddy's real name?

35:32.220 --> 35:33.220
Thomas do you?

35:33.220 --> 35:34.220
Kurt.

35:34.220 --> 35:35.220
Kurt.

35:35.220 --> 35:36.220
What are you learning?

35:36.220 --> 35:37.940
I was just refreshing myself on Kurt.

35:37.940 --> 35:40.200
He's 30s looks older curly hair.

35:40.200 --> 35:43.340
And he had footage of the storm and stuff right?

35:43.340 --> 35:44.340
Yeah.

35:45.220 --> 35:46.220
Bright.

35:46.220 --> 35:48.740
Oh he had brought footage of the phenomenon.

35:48.740 --> 35:53.540
I hate to say it but that fucking creep's been on top of this from the start.

35:53.540 --> 36:00.980
I did your burp while I was trying to keep mine quiet.

36:00.980 --> 36:02.740
Have one of you guys got daddy's number?

36:02.740 --> 36:04.500
I definitely got daddy's number.

36:04.500 --> 36:08.080
Call him and see who knows he might have even flown a drone down there already.

36:08.080 --> 36:10.460
Can we please call him Kurt?

36:10.460 --> 36:14.980
Daddy has an inquisitive mind you know.

36:14.980 --> 36:16.820
From what I could tell when I met him.

36:16.820 --> 36:21.820
See why do you just let him make you call him daddy?

36:21.820 --> 36:26.300
Well when people tell me their name I call them that and it's kind of hard to start calling

36:26.300 --> 36:28.220
somebody something and then change it.

36:28.220 --> 36:38.020
That's something started so progressive and then ended so.

36:38.020 --> 36:39.700
I dial daddy.

36:39.700 --> 36:40.700
Perfect.

36:40.700 --> 36:42.900
Do you have to go find out what daddy sounds like?

36:42.900 --> 36:43.900
Yup.

36:43.900 --> 36:46.660
Is it just a creep like this?

36:46.660 --> 36:56.260
I think it's yeah it's definitely another pushed strained voice.

36:56.260 --> 36:57.420
Beck whips out his phone.

36:57.420 --> 37:00.860
What is he in your contacts as?

37:00.860 --> 37:03.460
He's daddy parentheses Kurt.

37:03.460 --> 37:04.460
Unfortunate.

37:04.460 --> 37:08.340
K daddy.

37:08.340 --> 37:13.780
And Beck Wilder clicks call and throws it on speakerphone that way we don't have to

37:13.780 --> 37:17.300
make Lagan Thomas leave the room again.

37:17.300 --> 37:18.300
I sniff the bag.

37:18.300 --> 37:19.300
I click off speakerphone.

37:19.300 --> 37:20.300
Are we good?

37:20.300 --> 37:23.300
He sniffed the bag right?

37:23.300 --> 37:24.300
No.

37:24.300 --> 37:29.220
Oh okay I sniffed the bag.

37:29.220 --> 37:34.540
Don't don't let him sniff the bag.

37:34.540 --> 37:38.500
I was rubbing my ear.

37:38.500 --> 37:43.420
I'm never I'm never making eye contact so you can always get me with that.

37:43.420 --> 37:47.700
Taylor's been ringing for a while now.

37:47.700 --> 37:48.700
And then I.

37:48.700 --> 37:49.700
Wilder.

37:49.700 --> 37:56.420
Kurt uh hey this is Cal Colorado Beck Wilder and Julius Summers.

37:56.420 --> 38:00.200
We need to use some of your drones we'll pay you of course.

38:00.200 --> 38:01.200
Think you could do that?

38:01.200 --> 38:02.200
Oh yeah.

38:02.200 --> 38:07.680
Cool thanks buddy click.

felt good okay what are our other options uh there's there's several bedrooms uh take your

44:07.260 --> 44:13.160
pick several several couches and the various lounging areas and living spaces um julius is

44:13.160 --> 44:18.180
gonna wander around the house until he finds a bedroom and then immediately probably go to sleep

44:18.180 --> 44:23.780
yeah i don't know for there if you have more to do here but when beck is bedding down he's taking

44:23.780 --> 44:27.820
the bag that has that footage that got stolen previously and using it as a pillow he's not

44:27.820 --> 44:34.160
letting it away from him yeah in the slightest way amazing cal is up on the uh the top floor

44:34.160 --> 44:42.700
in his uh study pacing in front of his window with a uh a glass of scotch and um holding a bible

44:42.700 --> 44:48.920
in one hand and occasionally like flipping through it and then picking up uh zen and the art of

44:48.920 --> 44:54.780
motorcycle maintenance flipping through that and trying to reconcile what he's seen the past few

44:54.780 --> 45:03.700
days with uh his previous cosmology and theology julius strips down to his boxers and he like steps

45:03.740 --> 45:12.040
up on the bed and then steps back down and does that about 200 times and then and then lays down

45:12.040 --> 45:21.760
in bed can beck fall asleep uh re-watching footage yeah absolutely he just wants to kind of look back

45:21.760 --> 45:26.320
at what he's been filming and if you'll give me a search role for anything interesting that he

45:26.320 --> 45:39.100
didn't notice before oh i walked right in here uh yeah shoot a 10 40 those are cool dice thanks

45:39.100 --> 45:45.220
they're cheery blossoms i sprung this on you if you want to think about it i just thought that

45:45.220 --> 45:50.100
would be a thing that beck does oh 100 looking at corners of the frame that he wasn't actually

45:50.100 --> 45:54.700
focused on previously i could take my answer off air or like it comes to you in a dream and you

45:54.700 --> 46:03.560
remember in the morning yes i want to add that while julius is getting his leg workout in he's

46:03.560 --> 46:09.360
trying to compartmentalize killing his uncle so he doesn't ever think about it again smart

46:09.360 --> 46:19.480
what kind of compartment are you putting that in uh he's a scary one with all the scary stuff he's

46:19.480 --> 46:29.820
done throughout his life he's crushing it in 200 thighs his massive mental thighs i vice luke and

46:29.820 --> 46:41.620
thomas if you guys could leave the room joe as beck wilder goes through this footage again and

46:41.620 --> 46:47.620
again looking through everything you you catch something that you didn't notice the first time

46:47.620 --> 46:57.320
around on the train heading across godel's gate away from grover's gorge and there's a jaguar

46:57.320 --> 47:07.960
prowling on top of this train and then it made a jump and you're replaying this spot over and over

47:07.960 --> 47:20.460
because in the very very back of the audio you hear this voice that you don't recognize saying

47:20.460 --> 47:32.140
oh shit holy shit oh shit oh shit oh shit roll grip

47:38.140 --> 47:46.700
that's a crit pass oh my god okay well this adds up this adds up this makes sense you saw

47:47.740 --> 47:59.020
a kangaroo wearing a school uniform you saw a humanoid body with the face of a pug the fact

47:59.020 --> 48:06.860
that there's a jaguar with human speech that is well within your grasp and understanding of the

48:06.880 --> 48:14.480
world with the life that you've been living recently yeah the the final shot of beck is you

48:14.480 --> 48:19.080
he's got his headphones on and he's been using a little dial on the camera he's watching through

48:19.080 --> 48:24.720
the viewfinder and he's gotten to that point and he's turned it back and turned it forward oh shit

48:24.720 --> 48:31.600
turn it back and turn it forward oh shit turn it back turn it forward oh shit and then beck starts

48:31.620 --> 48:39.300
to say it along with it oh shit oh shit oh shit

48:52.100 --> 48:57.260
30 seconds of silence to get room to edit out all the bad noise so shouldn't we just be making

48:57.280 --> 49:09.000
a bunch of bad noise there's someone in your house edit that out computer they aren't very

49:09.000 --> 49:16.080
smart in that regard yet don't let them hear you say that don't let them hear you say that

49:27.260 --> 49:46.280
my life is great

49:57.260 --> 49:59.320
you
