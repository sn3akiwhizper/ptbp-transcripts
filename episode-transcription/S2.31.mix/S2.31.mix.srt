00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,540
Greetings to all of the fine people who consider themselves PTBP enjoyers, and to those who

2
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:12,240
do not yet enjoy, well, you will.

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,900
I am your master of ceremony, Wolf the Dog.

4
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:24,400
I have a master's degree in radio DJing and a bachelor's of fine arts in Greece applications.

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:29,540
This is the station you all know as 694.2 PTBP.

6
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:37,260
I'm here to make sure your ear ditches are properly lubricated and ready to receive informations.

7
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:43,380
Instead of howling with Wolf, everybody's favorite segment, me, Wolf, would like to

8
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:51,860
take a moment and howl at all of you who have entered the 694.2 PTBP season 2 fan art contest

9
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,260
slash drawing.

10
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:57,260
Howl!

11
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:03,100
And here's another howl for those who took the extra step to post their entries on Instagram,

12
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:08,620
Twitter, and Facebook with the hashtag PTBPcontest2.

13
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:14,060
Howl!

14
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:20,180
Remember, there will be a winner of the contest, and sure, they will be chosen by Joe and Justin

15
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:25,620
and Luke and Thomas and Zach, and they will receive any three items of their choosing

16
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:32,180
from the PTBP merch store, and their name will forever be remembered as the winner of

17
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:39,780
this contest, and we will all bow down before their eternal and likely squamous artistry.

18
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:44,660
But two more of you yahoos are going to be randomly picked to receive whatever piece

19
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:52,100
of merch your heart desires, and you can enter any medium into this contest slash drawing.

20
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:57,900
One of our esteemed and delightful moderators, Marie, has suggested that folks who can't

21
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:04,100
trawl try out another form of media like Fanfic or a video of yourself doing the walk while

22
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,900
squatting dance.

23
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:09,180
Hmm, this strikes me as excellent advice.

24
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:11,780
Fuck, could even win.

25
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:16,420
Remember to submit them entries on the pinned thread over on the Pretending to be People

26
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,420
subreddit.

27
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:23,580
And then for additional entries, post that shit on Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook.

28
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:27,200
If Wolf repeats himself, then you know it's true.

29
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,860
So take this next bit to heart.

30
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:33,300
The links are in the damn show notes.

31
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:41,020
I spend all day and night typing up them little show notes for y'all, and I wonder to myself,

32
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,620
is anyone even reading this stuff?

33
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:48,340
I lay awake pondering, brainstorming, typing even.

34
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:52,020
Do y'all know how many keyboards I go through?

35
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:55,860
They're all so sopping wet after just a few words.

36
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:02,220
So please, I beg of you, just this once, for dear old Wolfie, go take a look at them show

37
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,220
notes.

38
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:09,580
Now, let's dig in or down or whatever with our shiny new shovel and damn, this thing

39
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,660
is sharp.

40
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:15,900
Could probably slice right through Rapunzel's hair or fell a massive beanstalk.

41
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:21,060
But this isn't Sondheim, we're just going into the news.

42
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:28,100
Last time, Cal Colorado was in and out of a reverie while exploring the Zeitgeist Inn.

43
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:34,940
His engagement to Virginia Wolf, the dog, the bounty hunter, Biden, AKA Virginia McIntyre

44
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,360
out.

45
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:43,520
His old archeologist contact, Dr. Brock Hargrave, left his shovel hidden in the tree line after

46
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:49,520
potentially digging holes that absolutely spell out the numbers 836 and Braille, but

47
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:53,800
you know, big and in the ground and now refilled.

48
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:58,440
In, he's excited for his new life with his new wife.

49
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:05,260
Out, he's putting his nose in a Ziploc bag with a waxy substance smeared about, trying

50
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,140
to smell God.

51
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:11,260
Who's to say which is a happier time for Cal Colorado?

52
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:18,340
I guess I could, but instead, he has a brand new tune to keep those pesky memories at bay.

53
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:23,940
It's Alter Girl with My Life is Great and It's All My Fall.

54
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:59,780
Because my life is great and it's all my fall.

55
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:04,380
The prison guard was banging on our cell.

56
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,580
What's up?

57
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:12,180
Drinking these and burping makes me think of when I was playing Ephraim, Judge Ephraim

58
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,180
Courtland.

59
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,180
Oh yeah.

60
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:18,500
And I would like drink in any given hour of recording that, I would drink like seven of

61
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:23,420
those and I would like, I would drink like half of one and then shake my body around

62
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:27,300
so that I had a burp ready to go as soon as it was needed.

63
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,700
I had no idea you were so committed to that character.

64
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:33,180
What we do for the art baby, wow.

65
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:38,100
I'm really glad that we were recording remote when that was happening.

66
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,100
I don't know.

67
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,740
I think.

68
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,460
I'm not sure I would have been able to go.

69
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,460
Oh my God.

70
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:48,500
Oh no, the judge is back.

71
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,300
They smell pleasant though, like strawberry.

72
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,300
The burps.

73
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,140
All of them, no matter what you've been drinking?

74
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,140
Mm-hmm.

75
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:59,980
Even if I'm not, even if it's not a burp from chugging sparkling water.

76
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:06,420
Oh, that last one was so, such hashtag wet energy.

77
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:08,780
Yeah, hashtag wet energy.

78
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,820
That's a big theme this season, Zach.

79
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:13,220
It is a big theme this season.

80
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,220
God, that's wet.

81
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,420
I don't like it, the words.

82
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,420
Why?

83
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,740
Wet energy?

84
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,740
Yeah.

85
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:24,460
People are lying when they say they have a problem with moist, but.

86
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:29,740
Oh, I think because of, I think it's because of the fucking wet beef sign of the town we

87
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:30,740
made up, Springfield.

88
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:38,760
There's this guy who makes these Chicago style wet beef sandwiches, but he advertises it.

89
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,140
Are you talking about the commercial that plays on Cardinal games?

90
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,700
Because that's the one that gets me.

91
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,180
What I have not heard of.

92
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,020
A girl goes, why are you all wet?

93
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:50,060
And the other girl goes, because I ate a wet Italian beef from.

94
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:51,060
Don't say that.

95
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,060
It's so gross.

96
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,780
Don't give the wet beef guy business.

97
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:57,140
I love that place.

98
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,140
Everything there is good.

99
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:01,100
I assume the wet beef is good too, but I'll never order it.

100
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,420
No, I always get the muffuletta.

101
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:05,900
I always get the, his last name special.

102
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:15,100
Actually, I think it's a, it's not, it's like, oh, I didn't know it was both names.

103
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:18,020
Lot of beeps there.

104
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:23,180
Oh, I didn't know it was beep.

105
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:27,980
It's beep, beeps, beep, beep, beep.

106
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,620
Big fan of sandwiches though, overall.

107
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:40,460
And like when I've got a wet saucer, maybe I can dip my Sammy into make it all nice.

108
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,460
Yeah, dude.

109
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,460
Yeah.

110
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,460
I don't speak French.

111
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,460
Sorry.

112
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,460
I sneeze.

113
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:46,460
I like it a lot.

114
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:50,260
Is his sign still like a, the fill in the blanks thing?

115
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,260
What does it say?

116
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:55,900
At one point it was like, I like my coffee black, my something, something and my beef

117
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:56,900
wet.

118
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:02,460
That's what we're talking about at the start is awful, awful signs.

119
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,460
Yeah.

120
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:04,460
What is this?

121
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,460
Have you driven by it recently?

122
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,980
That was a common one.

123
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,340
That's pretty often up there.

124
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:16,340
One was just like fill in the blank and it's like W T B F.

125
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,340
Wet beef.

126
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,340
You nailed it.

127
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,340
Oh no, he doesn't.

128
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,340
Okay.

129
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,340
He doesn't say wet beef.

130
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:26,500
He says wet Italian specifically, which is why it's gross because you picked your

131
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:36,820
I don't even know what he looks like, but I assume it's grosser if he's wet, wet in

132
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:37,820
Italian.

133
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:42,820
Anyway, shout out to Springfield, Missouri.

134
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:48,900
What's beef beef.

135
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,420
Monzo and both together.

136
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,420
Yep.

137
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,420
Give me something different.

138
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,420
Monzo innuomido.

139
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,420
Monzo innuomido.

140
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:58,740
I think that means beef in water.

141
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,540
I think that's sloppy steaks.

142
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,540
Okay.

143
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,540
Enough about that.

144
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:06,260
You're getting my beef wet if you know what I mean.

145
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:07,740
I do know what you mean.

146
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,380
You're making my bread hard.

147
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,380
Soggy.

148
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:16,100
Oh, I got real high on Luke's vape pen so I was just looking at Thomas.

149
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:21,660
Thomas was looking at maybe the darker reflection of himself in the TV.

150
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:31,020
No, I was just looking at that koozie, but that's a much bleaker possibility and I could

151
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,260
see how it looked like that.

152
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:41,700
No, honestly, I was trying to not think about wet Italians and I was trying to think about

153
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:45,940
the fucking game we're supposed to be playing and what our next move would be.

154
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:48,700
How God damn dare you.

155
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:55,740
Julius looks at the Ziploc bag and thinks, that looks a little like some wet beef.

156
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:59,260
Maybe one of you should eat it.

157
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:03,900
The meta gaming at this stage in the story is a...

158
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:08,300
Well, that's why I don't take notes.

159
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:11,820
Every time we record, it's a whole brand new experience.

160
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:18,820
Yeah, to catch us up, based on where we were, y'all were smelling the bag, y'all were smelling

161
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:19,820
God.

162
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,620
I believe Julius Summers was the first one...

163
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:24,180
I think we were specifically not smelling.

164
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:29,340
Julius Summers was the first one who caught a whiff.

165
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,540
I didn't smell it though.

166
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:33,660
I touched it and caught the smell, I think.

167
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:34,940
As you picked it up.

168
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:35,940
Okay.

169
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,860
Was it from the bag or from touching it?

170
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:42,580
Smells a curious scent, huh?

171
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,580
Hm.

172
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,780
Makes you think.

173
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:50,620
That would have made more sense.

174
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:56,660
We've got a situation then where the bag is handed over to Stevie and they smell it as

175
00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:06,300
well and their eyes get massive and they're like, oh yeah, that's the smell.

176
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:13,420
And then Beck Wilder grabbed the bag as well, but then Cal Colorado steps in and says, Beck,

177
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:15,420
wait, wait, no.

178
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:19,740
You've got to film me smelling it first and...

179
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:20,740
Get the shot here.

180
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:21,740
Give me the baggie.

181
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:22,740
Give me the baggie.

182
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:23,740
Beck hands it over.

183
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:24,740
Okay, okay.

184
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:25,740
Sort of reluctantly.

185
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:28,220
I'm just looking forward to a God whiff.

186
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,020
I just got a God whiff of something.

187
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,180
It's what your wife's cooking.

188
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:35,300
You're smelling what your wife's cooking.

189
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,740
You believe God is a whiff.

190
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,100
Is that Chuck Mangione too?

191
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,100
Yeah.

192
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,780
Wow, that is actually really strong.

193
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:45,660
That is, okay, so great.

194
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:49,500
This is perfect for a forgetting main character.

195
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,500
Yeah.

196
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,500
It is Brussels sprouts.

197
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,500
Yes, it is.

198
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:56,580
I don't know if it's your chance to take a whiff, but we've got to make television first.

199
00:11:56,580 --> 00:12:03,300
We're here outside of the zeitgeist where we found a bag of what some say is a substance

200
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:08,660
very close to the essence of God himself and they say they smelled God in this bag and

201
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,580
we're going to take a whiff.

202
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:13,100
Watch me now as I smell the bag.

203
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,100
Slow zoom.

204
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,100
Okay, I'm opening the bag.

205
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:19,100
I'm putting my nose in the bag.

206
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:23,700
And what happens?

207
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:29,420
Okay, so this Ziploc bag has been turned inside out and the substance is on the outside of

208
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,420
the bag.

209
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,420
Which is in another bag.

210
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,420
Right, which we covered.

211
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,420
Which is now in another bag.

212
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,420
Last episode.

213
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,980
Yeah, I wanted to get the full visual.

214
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:37,980
He knows what he's doing.

215
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:38,980
Yeah, yeah.

216
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:39,980
Yeah, I meant that other bag.

217
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:40,980
No, no, yeah.

218
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:41,980
I meant the second bag.

219
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:42,980
The second bag.

220
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:43,980
The exterior bag.

221
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:44,980
Yeah.

222
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:45,980
Is open and sniffed.

223
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:49,700
We're feeling a Ziploc bag with a piece of God on the outside.

224
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:53,700
We know, we know, we know.

225
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,700
Have you, have you smelled God?

226
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:59,980
It'd be hilarious if you like ripped a fart right then.

227
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:06,860
No, I don't think Cal has.

228
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:09,540
I don't think Cal has smelled God yet.

229
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:15,260
Um, okay, real quick, uh, Joe and what's your name?

230
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,260
Luke.

231
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:19,380
If you guys could leave the room for a second.

232
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,380
New guy.

233
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:21,380
New guy!

234
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:37,980
What does Cal know of this entity?

235
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,820
I don't think he knows much at all about it.

236
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:45,220
He probably doesn't think it's God for sure.

237
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:51,980
Have you passed out each time God has been around or have you seen, have you gotten a

238
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,460
visual on God?

239
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,460
I don't think so.

240
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,460
Smells like earwax.

241
00:13:56,460 --> 00:14:01,740
Yeah, Cal gags at that.

242
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:08,560
He removes his nose from the bag and he squints at the camera and he says, well, if that's

243
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:27,800
God folks, act just very earnestly, took his headphones off and stuck a finger in his ear.

244
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,280
And I thought he was about to stand up and go like outside and pee or something.

245
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:33,320
And then he just stuck his earwax finger in my nose.

246
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,920
Well, you didn't, you didn't stick it in my nose.

247
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,760
That would have been nuts if I penetrated nostrils.

248
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:43,360
You proffered it like close enough and you didn't, you know, you didn't make me sniff

249
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,680
it without consent, but it was there for me to sniff.

250
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,480
I'm a decent friend.

251
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,480
Yeah.

252
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:58,660
So Cal says, well, some people may say this smells like divinity, but to me it just smells

253
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:09,860
like the inside of some morons ear.

254
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:14,660
Take your whiff back if you must.

255
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:15,660
Morons earwax.

256
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,460
I don't even know what that would smell like.

257
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:21,280
Is that like an idiom?

258
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,420
Go ahead and give it a smell.

259
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,800
All right.

260
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,600
And he's using his camera under his arm, like a selfie upward, so it's a real chinny

261
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:35,800
shot and he holds it up to his nose and takes a whiff.

262
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,120
Luke and Thomas, if you could leave the room for me.

263
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:41,280
Why did we come here in the first place?

264
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:45,960
So you can see how sweaty I am in person.

265
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:51,100
Joe, what do you know of this entity?

266
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,200
I saw it.

267
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:57,760
It looked like a super soaker midair going from one entity into, I think it was Chuck

268
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,800
Binwell I saw it hit and send him through a glass window.

269
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,520
I don't remember if I've seen it since.

270
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,880
I don't think I have.

271
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,120
No, I think you were out.

272
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:10,040
I think you passed out the next time that it was visible to someone.

273
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,040
Yeah.

274
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,680
So yeah, I've just got, I've got senses of what it looks like.

275
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:19,800
You've been told what it smells like.

276
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,360
Salt water, oceany.

277
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,360
Oh, weird.

278
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:25,080
It's like you're getting some of that.

279
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,640
Oh yeah.

280
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:34,200
You can definitely see where they're coming from as that scent overwhelming overpowers

281
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,160
your nostrils.

282
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:48,240
You are given visions and visuals of lightning continuously striking an unnaturally focused

283
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:59,760
tornado and unholy stomach dropping phenomenon connecting the sky above and the ground below.

284
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:07,440
This vibrating, humming electric and wet mass makes up this towering force of nature.

285
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:15,840
This terrifying, unfamiliar deep below this tunnel travels.

286
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:24,760
All of a sudden you see the middle of a desert and you see the sand just blast away in a

287
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:29,920
circular pattern like ripples all through the sand.

288
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:37,000
This entity is gone and there is just an endless hole and your vision goes down the hole further

289
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:44,240
and further and further into dark, endless nothingness.

290
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:50,120
And then you smell this odd sort of sailing and you're looking at everyone back here at

291
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,120
the zeitgeist.

292
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,120
Roll grip.

293
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,120
Holy shit.

294
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,120
That was cool.

295
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,120
I pass.

296
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:02,680
You only lose one grip here.

297
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,800
You're able to kind of hold on.

298
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:12,280
You wonder to yourself almost if you've sort of tuned in to one of these events occurring,

299
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,840
but you're not certain of that.

300
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,720
You just have this horrible feeling.

301
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:23,640
I think that he holds on to some of his grip because it was oddly beautiful.

302
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:30,520
It was a storm with lightning crashing a spectacle and then that tunnel downward into nothingness

303
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:33,480
was almost peaceful by the end of it.

304
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:37,120
It was a shock and then relief and release.

305
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:41,640
He was still frightened by it, I think ultimately, but there was something about it that was

306
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,640
almost nice.

307
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,640
I love that.

308
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,640
That was cool.

309
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:53,000
Beck Wilder grabs the bag.

310
00:18:53,000 --> 00:19:00,320
You see him take a whiff and he's staring for a moment and then he throws the bag to

311
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,320
the ground.

312
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:08,800
He drops the camera and goes to pick up the camera and you see in his eyes he's wild eyed

313
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:13,040
and he looks frightened, but also like when a little kid gets frightened, there's also

314
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:16,120
like a little bit of a smile there.

315
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:27,760
He's what that smell like smell dude.

316
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,080
I saw holy shit here.

317
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,280
What'd you see the store?

318
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,360
You guys didn't see the store.

319
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,560
Holy shit.

320
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,560
Like oh holy shit.

321
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,120
Lightning tornado stuff.

322
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,120
Yeah.

323
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,120
Yeah.

324
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,120
That's it.

325
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,120
I think I saw.

326
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,120
I think I saw a hole dude.

327
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:52,160
I think I saw the formation of a fucking hole where shit.

328
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,280
This can be like that map guesser game on the internet.

329
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,280
It was Sandy.

330
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:00,320
They drove on the left side of the road and the trees.

331
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,480
The sun was in the Northern hemisphere.

332
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:08,580
It's the desert or the beach or a volleyball court.

333
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:12,180
It was magnificent and terrible.

334
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,600
How long did this take a flash guys?

335
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:20,480
I think, you know, it makes me smell God and it made you see the storm and stuff.

336
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:25,200
I think I think we got to get this stuff to to Greg.

337
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,000
Why do you think that?

338
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:34,240
Because God is in Greg and I smell God and he saw, you know, what God is making Greg

339
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:40,220
do when, when we interacted with this stuff, maybe God will like this or maybe it he'll

340
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,220
hate it.

341
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:44,880
But either way, it's something, it could be some sort of like direct link.

342
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,880
Yeah.

343
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:49,220
I suppose we could use it to track God down.

344
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:53,720
Like a that's so Raven, like look into the future a little bit to see where he is.

345
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:58,680
Just like a, you know, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, what are we, what are you, what

346
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,000
are we talking about when we talk about God?

347
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,320
I mean, whatever was in the turtle and whatever's in Greg.

348
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,320
Yeah.

349
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:11,360
That like wet energy, the wet, the wet energy for sure.

350
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:19,920
Cal is really trying to like square wet energy with a Methodism.

351
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:28,160
He's like, okay, like a, like a Buddhist thing, like, okay.

352
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,160
This is something, right?

353
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,520
This is something powerful.

354
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:38,080
We saw powerful things at the Godels, little lair, little big secret city, but you know,

355
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,080
this could be God.

356
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:43,120
This could be the work of very bad men.

357
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,120
And that's what we do.

358
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,120
We stop bad men.

359
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,120
Right?

360
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,120
Yeah.

361
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,480
And give him this stuff.

362
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,840
Maybe see how he reacts to it.

363
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:58,240
Um, yeah, maybe we've got to find him first.

364
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,240
Yeah.

365
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:02,720
Well, and I think we can make, I don't, you know, I don't want to put this on you back,

366
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:07,560
but we might be able to get a good idea of where he is or where he's been.

367
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:13,000
If, if you can kind of, if it makes you see, I mean, you guys want me to take another hit?

368
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,040
What do you saw this right when you, just when you smelled the, yeah.

369
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,080
What did I look like?

370
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,760
Was I standing there for like 20 minutes?

371
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,520
Oh, that's been weird looking.

372
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:26,680
You sniffed and then you, and then you started the camera and ran away after like 20 minutes.

373
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,680
No, immediately.

374
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,680
Immediately.

375
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,680
What?

376
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,840
Wait, did you, you didn't make me roll for it.

377
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,840
Did you?

378
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,840
What?

379
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:38,080
Roll for what?

380
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,160
When I smelled the bag, you didn't make me roll.

381
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,480
No, there's different sort of mechanics.

382
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,480
Okay.

383
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,480
Gotcha.

384
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,480
For this whole thing.

385
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,480
I smell what you're stepping in.

386
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,480
Yeah.

387
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:53,040
It's based on sense.

388
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:57,600
I mean, it obviously doesn't take long to smell it again and see what you see.

389
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,600
Wait.

390
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,000
As long as we don't have to leave the room.

391
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Let me hold the camera.

392
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Okay.

393
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,960
You, you hold it here and then you push this button to turn off the play to the record,

394
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,960
but don't ever touch that.

395
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,960
Like why would you?

396
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,960
You know what I mean?

397
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,440
And then this here you can use to zoom if you need to.

398
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:20,000
I know how to use a camera back and he instantly pushes that button.

399
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,280
Cal, I can see the lights off.

400
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,280
What?

401
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,560
Hit it one more time.

402
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,560
Click.

403
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:31,560
You got it buddy.

404
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:36,360
Julius is going to kind of like get around back in case he like falls down or something

405
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,360
to catch him.

406
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,360
Yeah.

407
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,360
I'll get the other side.

408
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,360
All right.

409
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,360
Hi.

410
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:45,680
Wilder and I'm about to smell the God thing again.

411
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,480
Ready?

412
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,480
Here we go.

413
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:52,480
And he does.

414
00:23:52,480 --> 00:24:01,480
This is the fucking watch thing.

415
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:16,080
If Beck can, since he's doing this with purpose this time and it kind of hopes to know what

416
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:20,240
to expect, he's going to try and do what we talked about and maybe instead of focusing

417
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,360
on the storm, look for landmarks on the horizon and stuff like that.

418
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,360
Very cool.

419
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,880
If, if that's what happens, I don't, if he sees the storm again, maybe I see something

420
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,880
else.

421
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,880
Go ahead.

422
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:34,280
Tell us what we see.

423
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:38,480
Well, you tell me first, what do you, uh, what do you smell?

424
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,440
What do you, uh, what are you feeling like?

425
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:48,360
It's that brackish brine again to start and then I don't, I mean, then, then he starts

426
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:54,360
smelling like what it smells like when it first starts to rain pet pet decor, petrichor.

427
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,640
That's what that's called.

428
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,240
Thanks Dr. Who.

429
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,920
And then he starts to see the storm.

430
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:11,000
Fleeing, flinging itself up into view over the side of the building where you stood in

431
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,120
Grover's Gorge.

432
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:21,960
The thing flings itself into the body of Chuck Bidwell, thrusting him, I mean, just exploding

433
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,520
the sky backwards.

434
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:34,320
And then you see that exact same wet energy that blew past you traveling vast distances,

435
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:45,320
hauling ass in one singular direction over different landmasses, over different landmarks,

436
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:49,680
over different climate systems and weather patterns.

437
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:56,200
This thing travels over oceans onto new land.

438
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:06,520
Let's roll search or yeah, I think search is probably good.

439
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:09,200
It's a 47 on a 40.

440
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,200
Fail.

441
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,200
Damn dude.

442
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:18,720
Um, man, yeah, and you're pretty sure you saw like one big thing, but you can't quite

443
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:24,800
make out what it was and you're like, oh, it was something, it was something big.

444
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:28,000
You could have figured it out.

445
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
You're pretty sure.

446
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:37,600
I was just a little more worldly.

447
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:43,600
Beck throws the bag down and this time he looks a little more confused, but also like

448
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,760
his heart rate is up again and kind of wide eyed.

449
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,800
Uh, okay.

450
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,800
News update.

451
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,800
Dudes.

452
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,120
Uh, it's not like present all the time.

453
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,760
Like here's, I saw the fucking beginning, dude.

454
00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:01,960
I saw Grover's Gorge and I saw the first time I saw the fucking wet energy God, dude.

455
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,640
It was flying into Chuck Bidwell.

456
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:14,680
Like I saw the first time and then he took off and he was fucking going to fail T four

457
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:20,960
plus one, one, two grip.

458
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:26,400
You're able to hold it down, but this is going to be a struggle for Beck to get out all the

459
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,400
time.

460
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:50,160
And it was, it was like, it was like, it was like, I was like, so, okay, um, where is it

461
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,160
now?

462
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:56,920
I mean, like that's the bad news is like fucking anywhere, dude.

463
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,800
It was just going.

464
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,360
I'm not talking like across town, dude.

465
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,120
I'm talking around the fucking globe.

466
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,840
Is it making the holes?

467
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,960
I mean this time it wasn't, but I think it was like on its way to, I think the first

468
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:18,960
thing I saw it was a hole make and the second thing was a way to the hole where two speeds,

469
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,200
which way did this hole?

470
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,000
It went west east.

471
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Fuck.

472
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,560
I never learned my directions, right?

473
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,700
What can you tell us?

474
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:29,120
It was continents, dude.

475
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:35,000
Continents intercontinental ballistic man soul.

476
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
There's something there.

477
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Yeah.

478
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:43,760
Like an episode title, Julius, uh, doesn't want to lose the bag.

479
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:47,680
So he grabs it and is going to try to put it back in the other bag.

480
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,680
Hold on.

481
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,680
Let me show you this thing.

482
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:57,640
Give me, give me another with that back.

483
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,640
Take this camera.

484
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,640
Thanks.

485
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,760
Julius grabs the bag off the ground, which is, I don't know if we've covered this, but

486
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:07,040
it's the bag with the goo turned inside out inside of a Ziploc bag.

487
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:10,880
I don't know if we've covered this just so we're all clear.

488
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:16,680
He offers it to Cal Cal kind of like yanks it and he's a, he's a little like peeved and

489
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:25,920
he takes a big, big whiff, uh, as big as he can of the bag.

490
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:39,520
It just, it just smells like some asshole idiot, dill pickles, earwax.

491
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,080
It smells like my fucking brother's earwax.

492
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,080
Sorry.

493
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,280
Sorry for my language.

494
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:50,680
And like nothing else, nothing else.

495
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:55,000
Let me try.

496
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:06,360
He's going to give it a on purpose with this time, Joe and Thomas, point the camera at

497
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:09,600
me.

498
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,600
Joe walks back in.

499
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:17,560
Becca's pointing the camera at him.

500
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:25,480
You feel wet and through your eyes you see Julius Summers looking at you as you're walking

501
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:33,720
with purpose towards the edge of the cliff in Godel's gate to Grover's gorge and you

502
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:38,800
are on a mission and you make it to the edge.

503
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:48,740
You feel your body falling, you feel free, you're not Julius Summers, you're something

504
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:49,740
else entirely.

505
00:30:49,740 --> 00:31:03,120
You hit the ground, a rush of wet energy bursts forth and you are on board.

506
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:14,200
Once again, as it just exactly as Beck described, like absolutely just fucking going.

507
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:19,480
As you blast through the stained glass and enter this upside down church, you see the

508
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:28,840
ceiling, which is now the floor of this enormous cavernous, almost hollowed out inside of this

509
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:32,760
enormous cavernous church.

510
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:39,520
There is a moat at least 10 meters wide running left to right through tunnels that have been

511
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,800
bore out on either side.

512
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:50,120
There's just a river of red liquid blood by the looks of it based on the countless bodies

513
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:57,380
that are piled up on the far side of this moat and over the top of this moat is some

514
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:07,140
train tracking and there is a small little train car sitting waiting patiently and then

515
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:10,220
you open up your eyes and you're at the zeitgeist.

516
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:11,220
Fuck yeah.

517
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,220
Roll grip.

518
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:15,980
It's probably not going to be a pass.

519
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:16,980
Fourteen out of twenty.

520
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:21,500
Oh shit, you're only going to lose one, you're going to be able to hold it together but just

521
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:26,540
barely as this is absolutely stupid.

522
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:27,900
Is that a good description?

523
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:28,900
Yeah.

524
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,780
Because this is fucking stupid.

525
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:33,380
This shit's stupid.

526
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:34,380
Okay then.

527
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:39,340
How do you hold onto grip in the face of something so stupid?

528
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:46,300
Because Julius takes this vision as a clue and he knows what he's going to suggest when

529
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:51,500
the boys get back or by that I mean when he comes to.

530
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,500
Whee!

531
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,500
Whoa!

532
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,500
Oh!

533
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,500
Oh!

534
00:32:55,500 --> 00:33:04,980
Julius like is in his own world a little bit and then he comes to and looks at you guys.

535
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:06,180
I know where to go.

536
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:07,620
Holy shit!

537
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:12,300
There's a like a blood subway in the church in Godel's gorge.

538
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:13,940
A what?

539
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:21,260
I rode on the wet wings of God into the church.

540
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:22,260
Nice.

541
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:24,060
Or maybe I was God.

542
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:32,180
I felt like if you packed a whole day at Six Flags into one second.

543
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:33,180
And then.

544
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:34,180
In a good way or a bad way?

545
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:36,740
In a great way until I saw.

546
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:38,380
Like bad in a good way?

547
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:42,060
There's like bad in a good way.

548
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:49,720
There's a river of blood with a train on top of it surrounded by dead bodies in that upside

549
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:57,680
down church in Grover's gorge and that's I think I mean that's where God went when

550
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:00,640
I was with him.

551
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,960
Alternatively I was thinking about jumping in one of those holes.

552
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,560
Holy shit guys.

553
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,200
Holy fucking shit.

554
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,460
Alternatively.

555
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:11,480
This isn't God this is this is the devil.

556
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,680
Even more reason to find him and stop him.

557
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:16,920
I'm definitely open to the idea of this thing being a devil dude.

558
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:21,360
What if we just bulldozed the gorge right on in over on this stupid fucking church.

559
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,360
Take that Satan.

560
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,360
Right?

561
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,360
Yeah.

562
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,360
Haha.

563
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:28,200
Like take a how?

564
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,940
How would you do that?

565
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,880
We fill it in we fill it all in.

566
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,120
The whole thing.

567
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,960
It was a lot that is true.

568
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,160
And then they're not going to stop us with this whole project.

569
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:44,280
Well that's why we reveal their sinister machinations to the world through the news.

570
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,760
So everybody's on our side.

571
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,760
But we got to get the facts first.

572
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:56,840
We can't just report we smelled some goo and it's all gone.

573
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,840
Why not?

574
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:01,960
No damn it Beck he's right.

575
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:04,800
We got to find the facts the source.

576
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:10,080
I mean we got to we either got to go to one of the holes and like drop a camera in it

577
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,380
or we got to get on the blood train.

578
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:14,460
That weird nightcrawler guy.

579
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:16,180
Didn't he have drones and stuff?

580
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:17,180
Oh shit.

581
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:18,180
Daddy?

582
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,180
Yeah.

583
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:21,800
He would love to plug one of those holes.

584
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:30,340
Let's call daddy and get him to plug a hole.

585
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:32,220
What was daddy's real name?

586
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:33,220
Thomas do you?

587
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:34,220
Kurt.

588
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:35,220
Kurt.

589
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,220
What are you learning?

590
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,940
I was just refreshing myself on Kurt.

591
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:40,200
He's 30s looks older curly hair.

592
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:43,340
And he had footage of the storm and stuff right?

593
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:44,340
Yeah.

594
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:46,220
Bright.

595
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:48,740
Oh he had brought footage of the phenomenon.

596
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:53,540
I hate to say it but that fucking creep's been on top of this from the start.

597
00:35:53,540 --> 00:36:00,980
I did your burp while I was trying to keep mine quiet.

598
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:02,740
Have one of you guys got daddy's number?

599
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:04,500
I definitely got daddy's number.

600
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:08,080
Call him and see who knows he might have even flown a drone down there already.

601
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,460
Can we please call him Kurt?

602
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:14,980
Daddy has an inquisitive mind you know.

603
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:16,820
From what I could tell when I met him.

604
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:21,820
See why do you just let him make you call him daddy?

605
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:26,300
Well when people tell me their name I call them that and it's kind of hard to start calling

606
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:28,220
somebody something and then change it.

607
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:38,020
That's something started so progressive and then ended so.

608
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:39,700
I dial daddy.

609
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:40,700
Perfect.

610
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,900
Do you have to go find out what daddy sounds like?

611
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:43,900
Yup.

612
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:46,660
Is it just a creep like this?

613
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:56,260
I think it's yeah it's definitely another pushed strained voice.

614
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,420
Beck whips out his phone.

615
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:00,860
What is he in your contacts as?

616
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:03,460
He's daddy parentheses Kurt.

617
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:04,460
Unfortunate.

618
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:08,340
K daddy.

619
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:13,780
And Beck Wilder clicks call and throws it on speakerphone that way we don't have to

620
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:17,300
make Lagan Thomas leave the room again.

621
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,300
I sniff the bag.

622
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,300
I click off speakerphone.

623
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:20,300
Are we good?

624
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:23,300
He sniffed the bag right?

625
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,300
No.

626
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:29,220
Oh okay I sniffed the bag.

627
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:34,540
Don't don't let him sniff the bag.

628
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:38,500
I was rubbing my ear.

629
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:43,420
I'm never I'm never making eye contact so you can always get me with that.

630
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:47,700
Taylor's been ringing for a while now.

631
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:48,700
And then I.

632
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:49,700
Wilder.

633
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:56,420
Kurt uh hey this is Cal Colorado Beck Wilder and Julius Summers.

634
00:37:56,420 --> 00:38:00,200
We need to use some of your drones we'll pay you of course.

635
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,200
Think you could do that?

636
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,200
Oh yeah.

637
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:07,680
Cool thanks buddy click.

638
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:11,080

felt good okay what are our other options uh there's there's several bedrooms uh take your

701
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:13,160
pick several several couches and the various lounging areas and living spaces um julius is

702
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:18,180
gonna wander around the house until he finds a bedroom and then immediately probably go to sleep

703
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:23,780
yeah i don't know for there if you have more to do here but when beck is bedding down he's taking

704
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:27,820
the bag that has that footage that got stolen previously and using it as a pillow he's not

705
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:34,160
letting it away from him yeah in the slightest way amazing cal is up on the uh the top floor

706
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:42,700
in his uh study pacing in front of his window with a uh a glass of scotch and um holding a bible

707
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:48,920
in one hand and occasionally like flipping through it and then picking up uh zen and the art of

708
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:54,780
motorcycle maintenance flipping through that and trying to reconcile what he's seen the past few

709
00:44:54,780 --> 00:45:03,700
days with uh his previous cosmology and theology julius strips down to his boxers and he like steps

710
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:12,040
up on the bed and then steps back down and does that about 200 times and then and then lays down

711
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:21,760
in bed can beck fall asleep uh re-watching footage yeah absolutely he just wants to kind of look back

712
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:26,320
at what he's been filming and if you'll give me a search role for anything interesting that he

713
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:39,100
didn't notice before oh i walked right in here uh yeah shoot a 10 40 those are cool dice thanks

714
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:45,220
they're cheery blossoms i sprung this on you if you want to think about it i just thought that

715
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:50,100
would be a thing that beck does oh 100 looking at corners of the frame that he wasn't actually

716
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:54,700
focused on previously i could take my answer off air or like it comes to you in a dream and you

717
00:45:54,700 --> 00:46:03,560
remember in the morning yes i want to add that while julius is getting his leg workout in he's

718
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:09,360
trying to compartmentalize killing his uncle so he doesn't ever think about it again smart

719
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:19,480
what kind of compartment are you putting that in uh he's a scary one with all the scary stuff he's

720
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:29,820
done throughout his life he's crushing it in 200 thighs his massive mental thighs i vice luke and

721
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:41,620
thomas if you guys could leave the room joe as beck wilder goes through this footage again and

722
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:47,620
again looking through everything you you catch something that you didn't notice the first time

723
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:57,320
around on the train heading across godel's gate away from grover's gorge and there's a jaguar

724
00:46:57,320 --> 00:47:07,960
prowling on top of this train and then it made a jump and you're replaying this spot over and over

725
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:20,460
because in the very very back of the audio you hear this voice that you don't recognize saying

726
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:32,140
oh shit holy shit oh shit oh shit oh shit roll grip

727
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:46,700
that's a crit pass oh my god okay well this adds up this adds up this makes sense you saw

728
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:59,020
a kangaroo wearing a school uniform you saw a humanoid body with the face of a pug the fact

729
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:06,860
that there's a jaguar with human speech that is well within your grasp and understanding of the

730
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:14,480
world with the life that you've been living recently yeah the the final shot of beck is you

731
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:19,080
he's got his headphones on and he's been using a little dial on the camera he's watching through

732
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:24,720
the viewfinder and he's gotten to that point and he's turned it back and turned it forward oh shit

733
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:31,600
turn it back and turn it forward oh shit turn it back turn it forward oh shit and then beck starts

734
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:39,300
to say it along with it oh shit oh shit oh shit

735
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:57,260
30 seconds of silence to get room to edit out all the bad noise so shouldn't we just be making

736
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:09,000
a bunch of bad noise there's someone in your house edit that out computer they aren't very

737
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:16,080
smart in that regard yet don't let them hear you say that don't let them hear you say that

738
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:46,280
my life is great

739
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:59,320
you
