0	8540	Greetings to all of the fine people who consider themselves PTBP enjoyers, and to those who
8540	12240	do not yet enjoy, well, you will.
12240	16900	I am your master of ceremony, Wolf the Dog.
16900	24400	I have a master's degree in radio DJing and a bachelor's of fine arts in Greece applications.
24400	29540	This is the station you all know as 694.2 PTBP.
29540	37260	I'm here to make sure your ear ditches are properly lubricated and ready to receive informations.
37260	43380	Instead of howling with Wolf, everybody's favorite segment, me, Wolf, would like to
43380	51860	take a moment and howl at all of you who have entered the 694.2 PTBP season 2 fan art contest
51860	53260	slash drawing.
53260	57260	Howl!
57380	63100	And here's another howl for those who took the extra step to post their entries on Instagram,
63100	68620	Twitter, and Facebook with the hashtag PTBPcontest2.
68620	74060	Howl!
74060	80180	Remember, there will be a winner of the contest, and sure, they will be chosen by Joe and Justin
80180	85620	and Luke and Thomas and Zach, and they will receive any three items of their choosing
85820	92180	from the PTBP merch store, and their name will forever be remembered as the winner of
92180	99780	this contest, and we will all bow down before their eternal and likely squamous artistry.
99780	104660	But two more of you yahoos are going to be randomly picked to receive whatever piece
104660	112100	of merch your heart desires, and you can enter any medium into this contest slash drawing.
112100	117900	One of our esteemed and delightful moderators, Marie, has suggested that folks who can't
117900	124100	trawl try out another form of media like Fanfic or a video of yourself doing the walk while
124100	125900	squatting dance.
125900	129180	Hmm, this strikes me as excellent advice.
129180	131780	Fuck, could even win.
131780	136420	Remember to submit them entries on the pinned thread over on the Pretending to be People
136420	137420	subreddit.
137660	143580	And then for additional entries, post that shit on Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook.
143580	147200	If Wolf repeats himself, then you know it's true.
147200	149860	So take this next bit to heart.
149860	153300	The links are in the damn show notes.
153300	161020	I spend all day and night typing up them little show notes for y'all, and I wonder to myself,
161020	163620	is anyone even reading this stuff?
163620	168340	I lay awake pondering, brainstorming, typing even.
168340	172020	Do y'all know how many keyboards I go through?
172020	175860	They're all so sopping wet after just a few words.
175860	182220	So please, I beg of you, just this once, for dear old Wolfie, go take a look at them show
182220	183220	notes.
183220	189580	Now, let's dig in or down or whatever with our shiny new shovel and damn, this thing
189580	190660	is sharp.
190660	195900	Could probably slice right through Rapunzel's hair or fell a massive beanstalk.
195900	201060	But this isn't Sondheim, we're just going into the news.
201060	208100	Last time, Cal Colorado was in and out of a reverie while exploring the Zeitgeist Inn.
208100	214940	His engagement to Virginia Wolf, the dog, the bounty hunter, Biden, AKA Virginia McIntyre
214940	216360	out.
216400	223520	His old archeologist contact, Dr. Brock Hargrave, left his shovel hidden in the tree line after
223520	229520	potentially digging holes that absolutely spell out the numbers 836 and Braille, but
229520	233800	you know, big and in the ground and now refilled.
233800	238440	In, he's excited for his new life with his new wife.
238440	245260	Out, he's putting his nose in a Ziploc bag with a waxy substance smeared about, trying
245260	247140	to smell God.
247140	251260	Who's to say which is a happier time for Cal Colorado?
251260	258340	I guess I could, but instead, he has a brand new tune to keep those pesky memories at bay.
258340	263940	It's Alter Girl with My Life is Great and It's All My Fall.
275260	299780	Because my life is great and it's all my fall.
299780	304380	The prison guard was banging on our cell.
304380	306580	What's up?
306580	312180	Drinking these and burping makes me think of when I was playing Ephraim, Judge Ephraim
312180	313180	Courtland.
313180	314180	Oh yeah.
314180	318500	And I would like drink in any given hour of recording that, I would drink like seven of
318500	323420	those and I would like, I would drink like half of one and then shake my body around
323420	327300	so that I had a burp ready to go as soon as it was needed.
327300	329700	I had no idea you were so committed to that character.
329700	333180	What we do for the art baby, wow.
333180	338100	I'm really glad that we were recording remote when that was happening.
338100	339100	I don't know.
339100	340740	I think.
340740	342460	I'm not sure I would have been able to go.
342460	343460	Oh my God.
343460	348500	Oh no, the judge is back.
348500	351300	They smell pleasant though, like strawberry.
351300	352300	The burps.
352300	354140	All of them, no matter what you've been drinking?
354140	355140	Mm-hmm.
355140	359980	Even if I'm not, even if it's not a burp from chugging sparkling water.
359980	366420	Oh, that last one was so, such hashtag wet energy.
366420	368780	Yeah, hashtag wet energy.
368780	370820	That's a big theme this season, Zach.
370820	373220	It is a big theme this season.
373220	374220	God, that's wet.
374220	376420	I don't like it, the words.
376420	377420	Why?
377420	378740	Wet energy?
378740	379740	Yeah.
379740	384460	People are lying when they say they have a problem with moist, but.
384460	389740	Oh, I think because of, I think it's because of the fucking wet beef sign of the town we
389740	390740	made up, Springfield.
390740	398760	There's this guy who makes these Chicago style wet beef sandwiches, but he advertises it.
398760	401140	Are you talking about the commercial that plays on Cardinal games?
401140	402700	Because that's the one that gets me.
402700	404180	What I have not heard of.
404180	406020	A girl goes, why are you all wet?
406020	410060	And the other girl goes, because I ate a wet Italian beef from.
410060	411060	Don't say that.
411060	412060	It's so gross.
412060	413780	Don't give the wet beef guy business.
413780	417140	I love that place.
417140	418140	Everything there is good.
418220	421100	I assume the wet beef is good too, but I'll never order it.
421100	422420	No, I always get the muffuletta.
422420	425900	I always get the, his last name special.
425900	435100	Actually, I think it's a, it's not, it's like, oh, I didn't know it was both names.
435100	438020	Lot of beeps there.
438020	443180	Oh, I didn't know it was beep.
443180	447980	It's beep, beeps, beep, beep, beep.
447980	450620	Big fan of sandwiches though, overall.
450620	460460	And like when I've got a wet saucer, maybe I can dip my Sammy into make it all nice.
460460	461460	Yeah, dude.
461460	462460	Yeah.
462460	463460	I don't speak French.
463460	464460	Sorry.
464460	465460	I sneeze.
465460	466460	I like it a lot.
466460	470260	Is his sign still like a, the fill in the blanks thing?
470260	471260	What does it say?
471260	475900	At one point it was like, I like my coffee black, my something, something and my beef
475900	476900	wet.
476900	482460	That's what we're talking about at the start is awful, awful signs.
482460	483460	Yeah.
483460	484460	What is this?
484460	485460	Have you driven by it recently?
485460	486980	That was a common one.
486980	488340	That's pretty often up there.
488340	496340	One was just like fill in the blank and it's like W T B F.
496340	497340	Wet beef.
497340	498340	You nailed it.
498340	499340	Oh no, he doesn't.
499340	500340	Okay.
500340	501340	He doesn't say wet beef.
501340	506500	He says wet Italian specifically, which is why it's gross because you picked your
507100	516820	I don't even know what he looks like, but I assume it's grosser if he's wet, wet in
516820	517820	Italian.
517820	522820	Anyway, shout out to Springfield, Missouri.
522820	528900	What's beef beef.
528900	531420	Monzo and both together.
531420	532420	Yep.
533420	534420	Give me something different.
534420	535420	Monzo innuomido.
535420	536420	Monzo innuomido.
536420	538740	I think that means beef in water.
538740	540540	I think that's sloppy steaks.
540540	541540	Okay.
541540	543540	Enough about that.
543540	546260	You're getting my beef wet if you know what I mean.
546260	547740	I do know what you mean.
547740	549380	You're making my bread hard.
549380	550380	Soggy.
550380	556100	Oh, I got real high on Luke's vape pen so I was just looking at Thomas.
556100	561660	Thomas was looking at maybe the darker reflection of himself in the TV.
561660	571020	No, I was just looking at that koozie, but that's a much bleaker possibility and I could
571020	573260	see how it looked like that.
573260	581700	No, honestly, I was trying to not think about wet Italians and I was trying to think about
581700	585940	the fucking game we're supposed to be playing and what our next move would be.
585940	588700	How God damn dare you.
588700	595740	Julius looks at the Ziploc bag and thinks, that looks a little like some wet beef.
595740	599260	Maybe one of you should eat it.
599260	603900	The meta gaming at this stage in the story is a...
603900	608300	Well, that's why I don't take notes.
608300	611820	Every time we record, it's a whole brand new experience.
611820	618820	Yeah, to catch us up, based on where we were, y'all were smelling the bag, y'all were smelling
618820	619820	God.
619820	621620	I believe Julius Summers was the first one...
621620	624180	I think we were specifically not smelling.
624180	629340	Julius Summers was the first one who caught a whiff.
629340	630540	I didn't smell it though.
630540	633660	I touched it and caught the smell, I think.
633660	634940	As you picked it up.
634940	635940	Okay.
636500	639860	Was it from the bag or from touching it?
639860	642580	Smells a curious scent, huh?
642580	643580	Hm.
643580	645780	Makes you think.
645780	650620	That would have made more sense.
650620	656660	We've got a situation then where the bag is handed over to Stevie and they smell it as
656660	666300	well and their eyes get massive and they're like, oh yeah, that's the smell.
666300	673420	And then Beck Wilder grabbed the bag as well, but then Cal Colorado steps in and says, Beck,
673420	675420	wait, wait, no.
675420	679740	You've got to film me smelling it first and...
679740	680740	Get the shot here.
680740	681740	Give me the baggie.
681740	682740	Give me the baggie.
682740	683740	Beck hands it over.
683740	684740	Okay, okay.
684740	685740	Sort of reluctantly.
685820	688220	I'm just looking forward to a God whiff.
688220	690020	I just got a God whiff of something.
690020	692180	It's what your wife's cooking.
692180	695300	You're smelling what your wife's cooking.
695300	697740	You believe God is a whiff.
697740	700100	Is that Chuck Mangione too?
700100	701100	Yeah.
701100	703780	Wow, that is actually really strong.
703780	705660	That is, okay, so great.
705660	709500	This is perfect for a forgetting main character.
709500	710500	Yeah.
710500	711500	It is Brussels sprouts.
711500	712500	Yes, it is.
712500	716580	I don't know if it's your chance to take a whiff, but we've got to make television first.
716580	723300	We're here outside of the zeitgeist where we found a bag of what some say is a substance
723300	728660	very close to the essence of God himself and they say they smelled God in this bag and
728660	730580	we're going to take a whiff.
730580	733100	Watch me now as I smell the bag.
733100	734100	Slow zoom.
734100	736100	Okay, I'm opening the bag.
736100	739100	I'm putting my nose in the bag.
739700	743700	And what happens?
743700	749420	Okay, so this Ziploc bag has been turned inside out and the substance is on the outside of
749420	750420	the bag.
750420	751420	Which is in another bag.
751420	752420	Right, which we covered.
752420	753420	Which is now in another bag.
753420	754420	Last episode.
754420	756980	Yeah, I wanted to get the full visual.
756980	757980	He knows what he's doing.
757980	758980	Yeah, yeah.
758980	759980	Yeah, I meant that other bag.
759980	760980	No, no, yeah.
760980	761980	I meant the second bag.
761980	762980	The second bag.
762980	763980	The exterior bag.
763980	764980	Yeah.
764980	765980	Is open and sniffed.
765980	769700	We're feeling a Ziploc bag with a piece of God on the outside.
769700	773700	We know, we know, we know.
773700	775700	Have you, have you smelled God?
775700	779980	It'd be hilarious if you like ripped a fart right then.
779980	786860	No, I don't think Cal has.
786860	789540	I don't think Cal has smelled God yet.
789540	795260	Um, okay, real quick, uh, Joe and what's your name?
795260	796260	Luke.
796260	799380	If you guys could leave the room for a second.
799380	800380	New guy.
800380	801380	New guy!
801380	817980	What does Cal know of this entity?
817980	820820	I don't think he knows much at all about it.
820820	825220	He probably doesn't think it's God for sure.
825220	831980	Have you passed out each time God has been around or have you seen, have you gotten a
831980	833460	visual on God?
833460	834460	I don't think so.
834460	836460	Smells like earwax.
836460	841740	Yeah, Cal gags at that.
841740	848560	He removes his nose from the bag and he squints at the camera and he says, well, if that's
848560	867800	God folks, act just very earnestly, took his headphones off and stuck a finger in his ear.
867800	870280	And I thought he was about to stand up and go like outside and pee or something.
870280	873320	And then he just stuck his earwax finger in my nose.
873320	875920	Well, you didn't, you didn't stick it in my nose.
875920	878760	That would have been nuts if I penetrated nostrils.
878760	883360	You proffered it like close enough and you didn't, you know, you didn't make me sniff
883360	887680	it without consent, but it was there for me to sniff.
887680	889480	I'm a decent friend.
889480	890480	Yeah.
890480	898660	So Cal says, well, some people may say this smells like divinity, but to me it just smells
898660	909860	like the inside of some morons ear.
909860	914660	Take your whiff back if you must.
914660	915660	Morons earwax.
915660	917460	I don't even know what that would smell like.
917460	921280	Is that like an idiom?
921280	923420	Go ahead and give it a smell.
923420	924800	All right.
924800	929600	And he's using his camera under his arm, like a selfie upward, so it's a real chinny
929600	935800	shot and he holds it up to his nose and takes a whiff.
935800	938120	Luke and Thomas, if you could leave the room for me.
938120	941280	Why did we come here in the first place?
941280	945960	So you can see how sweaty I am in person.
945960	951100	Joe, what do you know of this entity?
951100	953200	I saw it.
953200	957760	It looked like a super soaker midair going from one entity into, I think it was Chuck
957760	960800	Binwell I saw it hit and send him through a glass window.
960800	963520	I don't remember if I've seen it since.
963520	964880	I don't think I have.
964880	966120	No, I think you were out.
966120	970040	I think you passed out the next time that it was visible to someone.
970040	971040	Yeah.
971040	974680	So yeah, I've just got, I've got senses of what it looks like.
974680	979800	You've been told what it smells like.
979800	981360	Salt water, oceany.
981360	982360	Oh, weird.
982520	985080	It's like you're getting some of that.
985080	986640	Oh yeah.
986640	994200	You can definitely see where they're coming from as that scent overwhelming overpowers
994200	996160	your nostrils.
996160	1008240	You are given visions and visuals of lightning continuously striking an unnaturally focused
1008240	1019760	tornado and unholy stomach dropping phenomenon connecting the sky above and the ground below.
1019760	1027440	This vibrating, humming electric and wet mass makes up this towering force of nature.
1027440	1035840	This terrifying, unfamiliar deep below this tunnel travels.
1035840	1044760	All of a sudden you see the middle of a desert and you see the sand just blast away in a
1044760	1049920	circular pattern like ripples all through the sand.
1049920	1057000	This entity is gone and there is just an endless hole and your vision goes down the hole further
1057000	1064240	and further and further into dark, endless nothingness.
1064240	1070120	And then you smell this odd sort of sailing and you're looking at everyone back here at
1070120	1071120	the zeitgeist.
1071120	1072120	Roll grip.
1072120	1073120	Holy shit.
1073120	1074120	That was cool.
1074120	1075120	I pass.
1075120	1082680	You only lose one grip here.
1082680	1085800	You're able to kind of hold on.
1085800	1092280	You wonder to yourself almost if you've sort of tuned in to one of these events occurring,
1092280	1094840	but you're not certain of that.
1094840	1097720	You just have this horrible feeling.
1097720	1103640	I think that he holds on to some of his grip because it was oddly beautiful.
1103640	1110520	It was a storm with lightning crashing a spectacle and then that tunnel downward into nothingness
1110520	1113480	was almost peaceful by the end of it.
1113480	1117120	It was a shock and then relief and release.
1117120	1121640	He was still frightened by it, I think ultimately, but there was something about it that was
1121640	1122640	almost nice.
1122640	1123640	I love that.
1123640	1124640	That was cool.
1124640	1133000	Beck Wilder grabs the bag.
1133000	1140320	You see him take a whiff and he's staring for a moment and then he throws the bag to
1140320	1141320	the ground.
1141320	1148800	He drops the camera and goes to pick up the camera and you see in his eyes he's wild eyed
1148800	1153040	and he looks frightened, but also like when a little kid gets frightened, there's also
1153040	1156120	like a little bit of a smile there.
1156120	1167760	He's what that smell like smell dude.
1167760	1171080	I saw holy shit here.
1171080	1173280	What'd you see the store?
1173280	1175360	You guys didn't see the store.
1175360	1176560	Holy shit.
1176560	1179560	Like oh holy shit.
1179560	1181120	Lightning tornado stuff.
1181120	1182120	Yeah.
1182120	1183120	Yeah.
1183120	1184120	That's it.
1184120	1185120	I think I saw.
1185120	1186120	I think I saw a hole dude.
1186120	1192160	I think I saw the formation of a fucking hole where shit.
1192160	1195280	This can be like that map guesser game on the internet.
1195280	1196280	It was Sandy.
1196280	1200320	They drove on the left side of the road and the trees.
1200320	1203480	The sun was in the Northern hemisphere.
1203480	1208580	It's the desert or the beach or a volleyball court.
1208580	1212180	It was magnificent and terrible.
1212180	1214600	How long did this take a flash guys?
1214600	1220480	I think, you know, it makes me smell God and it made you see the storm and stuff.
1220480	1225200	I think I think we got to get this stuff to to Greg.
1225200	1227000	Why do you think that?
1227000	1234240	Because God is in Greg and I smell God and he saw, you know, what God is making Greg
1234240	1240220	do when, when we interacted with this stuff, maybe God will like this or maybe it he'll
1240220	1241220	hate it.
1241220	1244880	But either way, it's something, it could be some sort of like direct link.
1244880	1245880	Yeah.
1245880	1249220	I suppose we could use it to track God down.
1249220	1253720	Like a that's so Raven, like look into the future a little bit to see where he is.
1254360	1258680	Just like a, you know, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, what are we, what are you, what
1258680	1261000	are we talking about when we talk about God?
1261000	1265320	I mean, whatever was in the turtle and whatever's in Greg.
1265320	1266320	Yeah.
1266320	1271360	That like wet energy, the wet, the wet energy for sure.
1271360	1279920	Cal is really trying to like square wet energy with a Methodism.
1279920	1288160	He's like, okay, like a, like a Buddhist thing, like, okay.
1288160	1289160	This is something, right?
1289160	1291520	This is something powerful.
1291520	1298080	We saw powerful things at the Godels, little lair, little big secret city, but you know,
1298080	1299080	this could be God.
1299080	1303120	This could be the work of very bad men.
1303120	1304120	And that's what we do.
1304120	1305120	We stop bad men.
1305120	1306120	Right?
1306120	1307120	Yeah.
1308080	1310480	And give him this stuff.
1310480	1313840	Maybe see how he reacts to it.
1313840	1318240	Um, yeah, maybe we've got to find him first.
1318240	1319240	Yeah.
1319240	1322720	Well, and I think we can make, I don't, you know, I don't want to put this on you back,
1322720	1327560	but we might be able to get a good idea of where he is or where he's been.
1327560	1333000	If, if you can kind of, if it makes you see, I mean, you guys want me to take another hit?
1333000	1337040	What do you saw this right when you, just when you smelled the, yeah.
1337080	1338080	What did I look like?
1338080	1339760	Was I standing there for like 20 minutes?
1339760	1341520	Oh, that's been weird looking.
1341520	1346680	You sniffed and then you, and then you started the camera and ran away after like 20 minutes.
1346680	1347680	No, immediately.
1347680	1348680	Immediately.
1348680	1349680	What?
1349680	1351840	Wait, did you, you didn't make me roll for it.
1351840	1352840	Did you?
1352840	1353840	What?
1353840	1358080	Roll for what?
1358080	1360160	When I smelled the bag, you didn't make me roll.
1360160	1362480	No, there's different sort of mechanics.
1362480	1363480	Okay.
1363480	1364480	Gotcha.
1364480	1365480	For this whole thing.
1365480	1366480	I smell what you're stepping in.
1366480	1367480	Yeah.
1367480	1373040	It's based on sense.
1373040	1377600	I mean, it obviously doesn't take long to smell it again and see what you see.
1377600	1378600	Wait.
1378600	1381000	As long as we don't have to leave the room.
1381000	1382000	Let me hold the camera.
1382000	1383000	Okay.
1383000	1388960	You, you hold it here and then you push this button to turn off the play to the record,
1388960	1389960	but don't ever touch that.
1389960	1390960	Like why would you?
1390960	1391960	You know what I mean?
1391960	1394440	And then this here you can use to zoom if you need to.
1394440	1400000	I know how to use a camera back and he instantly pushes that button.
1400000	1405280	Cal, I can see the lights off.
1405280	1406280	What?
1406280	1407560	Hit it one more time.
1407560	1408560	Click.
1408560	1411560	You got it buddy.
1411560	1416360	Julius is going to kind of like get around back in case he like falls down or something
1416360	1417360	to catch him.
1417360	1418360	Yeah.
1418360	1419360	I'll get the other side.
1419360	1420360	All right.
1420360	1421360	Hi.
1421880	1425680	Wilder and I'm about to smell the God thing again.
1425680	1428480	Ready?
1428480	1429480	Here we go.
1429480	1432480	And he does.
1432480	1441480	This is the fucking watch thing.
1441480	1456080	If Beck can, since he's doing this with purpose this time and it kind of hopes to know what
1456080	1460240	to expect, he's going to try and do what we talked about and maybe instead of focusing
1460240	1464360	on the storm, look for landmarks on the horizon and stuff like that.
1464360	1465360	Very cool.
1465360	1468880	If, if that's what happens, I don't, if he sees the storm again, maybe I see something
1468880	1469880	else.
1469880	1470880	Go ahead.
1471280	1474280	Tell us what we see.
1474280	1478480	Well, you tell me first, what do you, uh, what do you smell?
1478480	1481440	What do you, uh, what are you feeling like?
1481440	1488360	It's that brackish brine again to start and then I don't, I mean, then, then he starts
1488360	1494360	smelling like what it smells like when it first starts to rain pet pet decor, petrichor.
1494360	1496640	That's what that's called.
1496640	1499240	Thanks Dr. Who.
1499280	1501920	And then he starts to see the storm.
1501920	1511000	Fleeing, flinging itself up into view over the side of the building where you stood in
1511000	1513120	Grover's Gorge.
1513120	1521960	The thing flings itself into the body of Chuck Bidwell, thrusting him, I mean, just exploding
1521960	1524520	the sky backwards.
1524520	1534320	And then you see that exact same wet energy that blew past you traveling vast distances,
1534320	1545320	hauling ass in one singular direction over different landmasses, over different landmarks,
1545320	1549680	over different climate systems and weather patterns.
1549680	1556200	This thing travels over oceans onto new land.
1556200	1566520	Let's roll search or yeah, I think search is probably good.
1566520	1569200	It's a 47 on a 40.
1569200	1570200	Fail.
1570200	1571200	Damn dude.
1571200	1578720	Um, man, yeah, and you're pretty sure you saw like one big thing, but you can't quite
1578760	1584800	make out what it was and you're like, oh, it was something, it was something big.
1584800	1588000	You could have figured it out.
1588000	1589000	You're pretty sure.
1589000	1597600	I was just a little more worldly.
1597600	1603600	Beck throws the bag down and this time he looks a little more confused, but also like
1603600	1607760	his heart rate is up again and kind of wide eyed.
1607800	1608800	Uh, okay.
1608800	1609800	News update.
1609800	1610800	Dudes.
1610800	1613120	Uh, it's not like present all the time.
1613120	1615760	Like here's, I saw the fucking beginning, dude.
1615760	1621960	I saw Grover's Gorge and I saw the first time I saw the fucking wet energy God, dude.
1621960	1623640	It was flying into Chuck Bidwell.
1623640	1634680	Like I saw the first time and then he took off and he was fucking going to fail T four
1634680	1640960	plus one, one, two grip.
1640960	1646400	You're able to hold it down, but this is going to be a struggle for Beck to get out all the
1646400	1647400	time.
1647400	1670160	And it was, it was like, it was like, it was like, I was like, so, okay, um, where is it
1670160	1671160	now?
1671160	1676920	I mean, like that's the bad news is like fucking anywhere, dude.
1676920	1678800	It was just going.
1678800	1681360	I'm not talking like across town, dude.
1681360	1684120	I'm talking around the fucking globe.
1684120	1685840	Is it making the holes?
1685840	1689960	I mean this time it wasn't, but I think it was like on its way to, I think the first
1689960	1698960	thing I saw it was a hole make and the second thing was a way to the hole where two speeds,
1698960	1701200	which way did this hole?
1701200	1703000	It went west east.
1703000	1704000	Fuck.
1704000	1705560	I never learned my directions, right?
1705560	1706700	What can you tell us?
1706700	1709120	It was continents, dude.
1709120	1715000	Continents intercontinental ballistic man soul.
1715000	1716000	There's something there.
1716000	1717000	Yeah.
1717000	1723760	Like an episode title, Julius, uh, doesn't want to lose the bag.
1723760	1727680	So he grabs it and is going to try to put it back in the other bag.
1727680	1728680	Hold on.
1728680	1729680	Let me show you this thing.
1729680	1737640	Give me, give me another with that back.
1737640	1738640	Take this camera.
1738640	1739640	Thanks.
1739640	1742760	Julius grabs the bag off the ground, which is, I don't know if we've covered this, but
1742760	1747040	it's the bag with the goo turned inside out inside of a Ziploc bag.
1747040	1750880	I don't know if we've covered this just so we're all clear.
1750880	1756680	He offers it to Cal Cal kind of like yanks it and he's a, he's a little like peeved and
1756680	1765920	he takes a big, big whiff, uh, as big as he can of the bag.
1765920	1779520	It just, it just smells like some asshole idiot, dill pickles, earwax.
1779520	1782080	It smells like my fucking brother's earwax.
1782080	1783080	Sorry.
1783080	1785280	Sorry for my language.
1785280	1790680	And like nothing else, nothing else.
1790680	1795000	Let me try.
1795000	1806360	He's going to give it a on purpose with this time, Joe and Thomas, point the camera at
1806360	1809600	me.
1809600	1810600	Joe walks back in.
1810600	1817560	Becca's pointing the camera at him.
1817560	1825480	You feel wet and through your eyes you see Julius Summers looking at you as you're walking
1825480	1833720	with purpose towards the edge of the cliff in Godel's gate to Grover's gorge and you
1833720	1838800	are on a mission and you make it to the edge.
1838800	1848740	You feel your body falling, you feel free, you're not Julius Summers, you're something
1848740	1849740	else entirely.
1849740	1863120	You hit the ground, a rush of wet energy bursts forth and you are on board.
1863160	1874200	Once again, as it just exactly as Beck described, like absolutely just fucking going.
1874200	1879480	As you blast through the stained glass and enter this upside down church, you see the
1879480	1888840	ceiling, which is now the floor of this enormous cavernous, almost hollowed out inside of this
1888840	1892760	enormous cavernous church.
1892760	1899520	There is a moat at least 10 meters wide running left to right through tunnels that have been
1899520	1901800	bore out on either side.
1901800	1910120	There's just a river of red liquid blood by the looks of it based on the countless bodies
1910120	1917380	that are piled up on the far side of this moat and over the top of this moat is some
1917380	1927140	train tracking and there is a small little train car sitting waiting patiently and then
1927140	1930220	you open up your eyes and you're at the zeitgeist.
1930220	1931220	Fuck yeah.
1931220	1932220	Roll grip.
1932220	1935980	It's probably not going to be a pass.
1935980	1936980	Fourteen out of twenty.
1936980	1941500	Oh shit, you're only going to lose one, you're going to be able to hold it together but just
1941500	1946540	barely as this is absolutely stupid.
1946540	1947900	Is that a good description?
1947900	1948900	Yeah.
1948900	1950780	Because this is fucking stupid.
1950780	1953380	This shit's stupid.
1953380	1954380	Okay then.
1954380	1959340	How do you hold onto grip in the face of something so stupid?
1959340	1966300	Because Julius takes this vision as a clue and he knows what he's going to suggest when
1966300	1971500	the boys get back or by that I mean when he comes to.
1971500	1972500	Whee!
1972500	1973500	Whoa!
1973500	1974500	Oh!
1974500	1975500	Oh!
1975500	1984980	Julius like is in his own world a little bit and then he comes to and looks at you guys.
1984980	1986180	I know where to go.
1986180	1987620	Holy shit!
1987620	1992300	There's a like a blood subway in the church in Godel's gorge.
1992300	1993940	A what?
1993940	2001260	I rode on the wet wings of God into the church.
2001260	2002260	Nice.
2002260	2004060	Or maybe I was God.
2004060	2012180	I felt like if you packed a whole day at Six Flags into one second.
2012180	2013180	And then.
2013180	2014180	In a good way or a bad way?
2014180	2016740	In a great way until I saw.
2016740	2018380	Like bad in a good way?
2018380	2022060	There's like bad in a good way.
2022060	2029720	There's a river of blood with a train on top of it surrounded by dead bodies in that upside
2029720	2037680	down church in Grover's gorge and that's I think I mean that's where God went when
2037680	2040640	I was with him.
2040640	2043960	Alternatively I was thinking about jumping in one of those holes.
2043960	2045560	Holy shit guys.
2045560	2047200	Holy fucking shit.
2047200	2048460	Alternatively.
2048460	2051480	This isn't God this is this is the devil.
2051480	2053680	Even more reason to find him and stop him.
2053680	2056920	I'm definitely open to the idea of this thing being a devil dude.
2056920	2061360	What if we just bulldozed the gorge right on in over on this stupid fucking church.
2061360	2062360	Take that Satan.
2062360	2063360	Right?
2063360	2064360	Yeah.
2064360	2065360	Haha.
2065360	2068200	Like take a how?
2068200	2069940	How would you do that?
2069940	2071880	We fill it in we fill it all in.
2071880	2073120	The whole thing.
2073120	2074960	It was a lot that is true.
2074960	2078160	And then they're not going to stop us with this whole project.
2078160	2084280	Well that's why we reveal their sinister machinations to the world through the news.
2084280	2085760	So everybody's on our side.
2085760	2087760	But we got to get the facts first.
2087760	2096840	We can't just report we smelled some goo and it's all gone.
2096840	2097840	Why not?
2097840	2101960	No damn it Beck he's right.
2101960	2104800	We got to find the facts the source.
2104800	2110080	I mean we got to we either got to go to one of the holes and like drop a camera in it
2110080	2112380	or we got to get on the blood train.
2112380	2114460	That weird nightcrawler guy.
2114460	2116180	Didn't he have drones and stuff?
2116180	2117180	Oh shit.
2117180	2118180	Daddy?
2118180	2119180	Yeah.
2119180	2121800	He would love to plug one of those holes.
2121800	2130340	Let's call daddy and get him to plug a hole.
2130340	2132220	What was daddy's real name?
2132220	2133220	Thomas do you?
2133220	2134220	Kurt.
2134220	2135220	Kurt.
2135220	2136220	What are you learning?
2136220	2137940	I was just refreshing myself on Kurt.
2137940	2140200	He's 30s looks older curly hair.
2140200	2143340	And he had footage of the storm and stuff right?
2143340	2144340	Yeah.
2145220	2146220	Bright.
2146220	2148740	Oh he had brought footage of the phenomenon.
2148740	2153540	I hate to say it but that fucking creep's been on top of this from the start.
2153540	2160980	I did your burp while I was trying to keep mine quiet.
2160980	2162740	Have one of you guys got daddy's number?
2162740	2164500	I definitely got daddy's number.
2164500	2168080	Call him and see who knows he might have even flown a drone down there already.
2168080	2170460	Can we please call him Kurt?
2170460	2174980	Daddy has an inquisitive mind you know.
2174980	2176820	From what I could tell when I met him.
2176820	2181820	See why do you just let him make you call him daddy?
2181820	2186300	Well when people tell me their name I call them that and it's kind of hard to start calling
2186300	2188220	somebody something and then change it.
2188220	2198020	That's something started so progressive and then ended so.
2198020	2199700	I dial daddy.
2199700	2200700	Perfect.
2200700	2202900	Do you have to go find out what daddy sounds like?
2202900	2203900	Yup.
2203900	2206660	Is it just a creep like this?
2206660	2216260	I think it's yeah it's definitely another pushed strained voice.
2216260	2217420	Beck whips out his phone.
2217420	2220860	What is he in your contacts as?
2220860	2223460	He's daddy parentheses Kurt.
2223460	2224460	Unfortunate.
2224460	2228340	K daddy.
2228340	2233780	And Beck Wilder clicks call and throws it on speakerphone that way we don't have to
2233780	2237300	make Lagan Thomas leave the room again.
2237300	2238300	I sniff the bag.
2238300	2239300	I click off speakerphone.

2240300	2243300	He sniffed the bag right?
2243300	2244300	No.
2244300	2249220	Oh okay I sniffed the bag.
2249220	2254540	Don't don't let him sniff the bag.
2254540	2258500	I was rubbing my ear.

2641140	2647260	felt good okay what are our other options uh there's there's several bedrooms uh take your
2647260	2653160	pick several several couches and the various lounging areas and living spaces um julius is
2653160	2658180	gonna wander around the house until he finds a bedroom and then immediately probably go to sleep
2658180	2663780	yeah i don't know for there if you have more to do here but when beck is bedding down he's taking
2663780	2667820	the bag that has that footage that got stolen previously and using it as a pillow he's not
2667820	2674160	letting it away from him yeah in the slightest way amazing cal is up on the uh the top floor
2674160	2682700	in his uh study pacing in front of his window with a uh a glass of scotch and um holding a bible
2682700	2688920	in one hand and occasionally like flipping through it and then picking up uh zen and the art of
2688920	2694780	motorcycle maintenance flipping through that and trying to reconcile what he's seen the past few
2694780	2703700	days with uh his previous cosmology and theology julius strips down to his boxers and he like steps
2703740	2712040	up on the bed and then steps back down and does that about 200 times and then and then lays down
2712040	2721760	in bed can beck fall asleep uh re-watching footage yeah absolutely he just wants to kind of look back
2721760	2726320	at what he's been filming and if you'll give me a search role for anything interesting that he
2726320	2739100	didn't notice before oh i walked right in here uh yeah shoot a 10 40 those are cool dice thanks
2739100	2745220	they're cheery blossoms i sprung this on you if you want to think about it i just thought that
2745220	2750100	would be a thing that beck does oh 100 looking at corners of the frame that he wasn't actually
2750100	2754700	focused on previously i could take my answer off air or like it comes to you in a dream and you
2754700	2763560	remember in the morning yes i want to add that while julius is getting his leg workout in he's
2763560	2769360	trying to compartmentalize killing his uncle so he doesn't ever think about it again smart
2769360	2779480	what kind of compartment are you putting that in uh he's a scary one with all the scary stuff he's
2779480	2789820	done throughout his life he's crushing it in 200 thighs his massive mental thighs i vice luke and
2789820	2801620	thomas if you guys could leave the room joe as beck wilder goes through this footage again and
2801620	2807620	again looking through everything you you catch something that you didn't notice the first time
2807620	2817320	around on the train heading across godel's gate away from grover's gorge and there's a jaguar
2817320	2827960	prowling on top of this train and then it made a jump and you're replaying this spot over and over
2827960	2840460	because in the very very back of the audio you hear this voice that you don't recognize saying
2840460	2852140	oh shit holy shit oh shit oh shit oh shit roll grip
2858140	2866700	that's a crit pass oh my god okay well this adds up this adds up this makes sense you saw
2867740	2879020	a kangaroo wearing a school uniform you saw a humanoid body with the face of a pug the fact
2879020	2886860	that there's a jaguar with human speech that is well within your grasp and understanding of the
2886880	2894480	world with the life that you've been living recently yeah the the final shot of beck is you
2894480	2899080	he's got his headphones on and he's been using a little dial on the camera he's watching through
2899080	2904720	the viewfinder and he's gotten to that point and he's turned it back and turned it forward oh shit
2904720	2911600	turn it back and turn it forward oh shit turn it back turn it forward oh shit and then beck starts
2911620	2919300	to say it along with it oh shit oh shit oh shit
2932100	2937260	30 seconds of silence to get room to edit out all the bad noise so shouldn't we just be making
2937280	2949000	a bunch of bad noise there's someone in your house edit that out computer they aren't very
2949000	2956080	smart in that regard yet don't let them hear you say that don't let them hear you say that
2967260	2986280	my life is great
2997260	2999320	you
