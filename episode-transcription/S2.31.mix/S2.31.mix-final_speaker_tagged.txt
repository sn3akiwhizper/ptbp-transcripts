0.00 161.02 speaker0  Greetings to all of the fine people who consider themselves PTBP enjoyers, and to those who do not yet enjoy, well, you will. I am your master of ceremony, Wolf the Dog. I have a master's degree in radio DJing and a bachelor's of fine arts in Greece applications. This is the station you all know as 694.2 PTBP. take a moment and howl at all of you who have entered the 694.2 PTBP season 2 fan art contest slash drawing. And here's another howl for those who took the extra step to post their entries on Instagram, Remember, there will be a winner of the contest, and sure, they will be chosen by Joe and Justin and Luke and Thomas and Zach, and they will receive any three items of their choosing from the PTBP merch store, and their name will forever be remembered as the winner of this contest, and we will all bow down before their eternal and likely squamous artistry. But two more of you yahoos are going to be randomly picked to receive whatever piece trawl try out another form of media like Fanfic or a video of yourself doing the walk while squatting dance. Fuck, could even win. Remember to submit them entries on the pinned thread over on the Pretending to be People subreddit. And then for additional entries, post that shit on Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook. If Wolf repeats himself, then you know it's true. So take this next bit to heart.
153.30 312.18 speaker1  I spend all day and night typing up them little show notes for y'all, and I wonder to myself, Could probably slice right through Rapunzel's hair or fell a massive beanstalk. out. His old archeologist contact, Dr. Brock Hargrave, left his shovel hidden in the tree line after to smell God. Who's to say which is a happier time for Cal Colorado? What's up?
306.58 329.70 speaker0  Drinking these and burping makes me think of when I was playing Ephraim, Judge Ephraim Courtland. Oh yeah. And I would like drink in any given hour of recording that, I would drink like seven of
327.30 379.74 speaker2  I had no idea you were so committed to that character. I'm not sure I would have been able to go. The burps. Even if I'm not, even if it's not a burp from chugging sparkling water. Yeah, hashtag wet energy.
378.74 402.70 speaker3  Yeah. made up, Springfield.
401.14 410.06 speaker2  Because that's the one that gets me. What I have not heard of.
406.02 450.62 speaker3  And the other girl goes, because I ate a wet Italian beef from. Don't say that. It's so gross. Don't give the wet beef guy business. I love that place. I assume the wet beef is good too, but I'll never order it.
447.98 461.46 speaker2  Big fan of sandwiches though, overall. And like when I've got a wet saucer, maybe I can dip my Sammy into make it all nice.
460.46 463.46 speaker3  Yeah, dude.
462.46 483.46 speaker2  I don't speak French. Sorry. I sneeze. What does it say? At one point it was like, I like my coffee black, my something, something and my beef wet.
482.46 516.82 speaker3  Yeah. What is this? Have you driven by it recently? Oh no, he doesn't. Okay. He doesn't say wet beef.
507.10 536.42 speaker2  I don't even know what he looks like, but I assume it's grosser if he's wet, wet in Italian. Monzo and both together. Yep. Give me something different.
535.42 546.26 speaker3  Monzo innuomido. I think that's sloppy steaks. Okay.
543.54 550.38 speaker2  You're getting my beef wet if you know what I mean. I do know what you mean. You're making my bread hard.
549.38 561.66 speaker3  Soggy.
556.10 588.70 speaker2  Thomas was looking at maybe the darker reflection of himself in the TV.
585.94 608.30 speaker3  How God damn dare you.
603.90 680.74 speaker2  Well, that's why I don't take notes. Every time we record, it's a whole brand new experience. God. I believe Julius Summers was the first one... I think we were specifically not smelling. I didn't smell it though. Okay. Was it from the bag or from touching it?
679.74 695.30 speaker3  Get the shot here. Give me the baggie. Give me the baggie. Beck hands it over. Okay, okay. Sort of reluctantly.
692.18 703.78 speaker2  You're smelling what your wife's cooking.
701.10 750.42 speaker3  Wow, that is actually really strong. That is, okay, so great. This is perfect for a forgetting main character. Yeah. It is Brussels sprouts. we're going to take a whiff. Watch me now as I smell the bag. Slow zoom. Okay, I'm opening the bag. I'm putting my nose in the bag. And what happens?
749.42 753.42 speaker2  the bag. Which is in another bag. Right, which we covered.
752.42 756.98 speaker3  Which is now in another bag.
754.42 758.98 speaker2  Yeah, I wanted to get the full visual. He knows what he's doing.
757.98 762.98 speaker3  Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I meant that other bag. No, no, yeah. I meant the second bag.
761.98 769.70 speaker2  The second bag. Yeah. Is open and sniffed.
765.98 796.26 speaker3  We're feeling a Ziploc bag with a piece of God on the outside.
795.26 800.38 speaker2  Luke.
799.38 831.98 speaker3  New guy. New guy! He probably doesn't think it's God for sure.
825.22 867.80 speaker2  Have you passed out each time God has been around or have you seen, have you gotten a visual on God? Smells like earwax.
848.56 889.48 speaker3  God folks, act just very earnestly, took his headphones off and stuck a finger in his ear. And I thought he was about to stand up and go like outside and pee or something. And then he just stuck his earwax finger in my nose. You proffered it like close enough and you didn't, you know, you didn't make me sniff it without consent, but it was there for me to sniff.
887.68 917.46 speaker2  I'm a decent friend. Yeah.
915.66 960.80 speaker1  I don't even know what that would smell like.
957.76 970.04 speaker3  Binwell I saw it hit and send him through a glass window.
966.12 1074.12 speaker2  I think you passed out the next time that it was visible to someone. Yeah. You've been told what it smells like. You can definitely see where they're coming from as that scent overwhelming overpowers your nostrils. tornado and unholy stomach dropping phenomenon connecting the sky above and the ground below. This vibrating, humming electric and wet mass makes up this towering force of nature. This terrifying, unfamiliar deep below this tunnel travels. All of a sudden you see the middle of a desert and you see the sand just blast away in a circular pattern like ripples all through the sand. This entity is gone and there is just an endless hole and your vision goes down the hole further and further and further into dark, endless nothingness. And then you smell this odd sort of sailing and you're looking at everyone back here at the zeitgeist.
1073.12 1092.28 speaker3  That was cool.
1085.80 1113.48 speaker2  You wonder to yourself almost if you've sort of tuned in to one of these events occurring, but you're not certain of that. You just have this horrible feeling.
1110.52 1171.08 speaker3  was almost peaceful by the end of it. He was still frightened by it, I think ultimately, but there was something about it that was almost nice. the ground. He drops the camera and goes to pick up the camera and you see in his eyes he's wild eyed and he looks frightened, but also like when a little kid gets frightened, there's also
1167.76 1175.36 speaker1  I saw holy shit here.
1173.28 1186.12 speaker3  You guys didn't see the store. Yeah. Yeah. That's it.
1185.12 1195.28 speaker1  I think I saw a hole dude.
1192.16 1240.22 speaker3  This can be like that map guesser game on the internet. It was Sandy. Why do you think that?
1234.24 1289.16 speaker2  do when, when we interacted with this stuff, maybe God will like this or maybe it he'll hate it. Like a that's so Raven, like look into the future a little bit to see where he is. Yeah.
1288.16 1327.56 speaker3  This is something, right? This is something powerful. And that's what we do. Yeah. And give him this stuff. Yeah.
1322.72 1337.04 speaker2  but we might be able to get a good idea of where he is or where he's been.
1333.00 1353.84 speaker3  What do you saw this right when you, just when you smelled the, yeah. What did I look like? Was I standing there for like 20 minutes? Oh, that's been weird looking. Wait, did you, you didn't make me roll for it.
1352.84 1360.16 speaker2  What?
1358.08 1363.48 speaker3  When I smelled the bag, you didn't make me roll.
1362.48 1388.96 speaker2  Okay. It's based on sense. I mean, it obviously doesn't take long to smell it again and see what you see. Wait.
1383.00 1390.96 speaker3  You, you hold it here and then you push this button to turn off the play to the record,
1389.96 1408.56 speaker1  Like why would you? You know what I mean? And then this here you can use to zoom if you need to.
1407.56 1417.36 speaker3  Click. You got it buddy.
1416.36 1419.36 speaker2  to catch him. Yeah.
1418.36 1428.48 speaker3  I'll get the other side. All right. Hi.
1425.68 1460.24 speaker1  Ready? Here we go.
1456.08 1469.88 speaker3  to expect, he's going to try and do what we talked about and maybe instead of focusing on the storm, look for landmarks on the horizon and stuff like that. Very cool. If, if that's what happens, I don't, if he sees the storm again, maybe I see something
1468.88 1494.36 speaker2  else. What do you, uh, what are you feeling like?
1488.36 1513.12 speaker3  smelling like what it smells like when it first starts to rain pet pet decor, petrichor.
1511.00 1570.20 speaker2  Grover's Gorge. The thing flings itself into the body of Chuck Bidwell, thrusting him, I mean, just exploding the sky backwards. And then you see that exact same wet energy that blew past you traveling vast distances, hauling ass in one singular direction over different landmasses, over different landmarks, over different climate systems and weather patterns.
1569.20 1621.96 speaker3  Fail. his heart rate is up again and kind of wide eyed.
1615.76 1647.40 speaker1  I saw Grover's Gorge and I saw the first time I saw the fucking wet energy God, dude. It was flying into Chuck Bidwell.
1646.40 1678.80 speaker3  time.
1676.92 1716.00 speaker1  It was just going. I'm not talking like across town, dude. I'm talking around the fucking globe. I mean this time it wasn't, but I think it was like on its way to, I think the first Fuck. I never learned my directions, right? What can you tell us? It was continents, dude.
1715.00 1723.76 speaker3  There's something there.
1717.00 1728.68 speaker2  Like an episode title, Julius, uh, doesn't want to lose the bag. So he grabs it and is going to try to put it back in the other bag.
1727.68 1729.68 speaker3  Hold on.
1728.68 1738.64 speaker2  Let me show you this thing.
1737.64 1747.04 speaker3  Take this camera. Thanks.
1742.76 1765.92 speaker2  it's the bag with the goo turned inside out inside of a Ziploc bag. I don't know if we've covered this just so we're all clear.
1756.68 1809.60 speaker3  he takes a big, big whiff, uh, as big as he can of the bag. Sorry. Let me try.
1806.36 1948.90 speaker2  me. Joe walks back in. with purpose towards the edge of the cliff in Godel's gate to Grover's gorge and you are on a mission and you make it to the edge. You feel your body falling, you feel free, you're not Julius Summers, you're something else entirely. You hit the ground, a rush of wet energy bursts forth and you are on board. As you blast through the stained glass and enter this upside down church, you see the ceiling, which is now the floor of this enormous cavernous, almost hollowed out inside of this enormous cavernous church. There is a moat at least 10 meters wide running left to right through tunnels that have been bore out on either side. There's just a river of red liquid blood by the looks of it based on the countless bodies that are piled up on the far side of this moat and over the top of this moat is some train tracking and there is a small little train car sitting waiting patiently and then you open up your eyes and you're at the zeitgeist. Oh shit, you're only going to lose one, you're going to be able to hold it together but just barely as this is absolutely stupid. Is that a good description?
1947.90 1953.38 speaker3  Yeah.
1950.78 2047.20 speaker2  This shit's stupid. Okay then. How do you hold onto grip in the face of something so stupid? There's a like a blood subway in the church in Godel's gorge. And then. In a great way until I saw. down church in Grover's gorge and that's I think I mean that's where God went when
2045.56 2048.46 speaker3  Holy fucking shit.
2047.20 2051.48 speaker2  Alternatively.
2048.46 2112.38 speaker3  This isn't God this is this is the devil. Take that Satan. Haha. The whole thing. We got to find the facts the source.
2110.08 2121.80 speaker2  or we got to get on the blood train.
