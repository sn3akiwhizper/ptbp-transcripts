1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,600
Hot damn, y'all. I just heard cheesecake is a real thing that real human people like to eat.

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:17,000
I didn't know I could get all my favorite kinds of messy, curdled cream all in one solidified circle,

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,100
ready to cram all up in my maw.

4
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:24,900
I hope it's as slimy as I imagined it to be.

5
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,500
It's your dreamy, cheesy daddy Wolf the Dog,

6
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:36,300
and I am dreaming of that cheesy, sexy good time live from 694.2 PTBP.

7
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:45,500
We are proud to announce this community has raised $6,502 for the bail project.

8
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:50,000
And since the bail money goes back to them when cases close,

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,200
they're able to recycle every dollar donated at least twice per year.

10
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,900
Go to the link in the show notes to help.

11
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:05,200
The bail project combats mass incarceration and reshapes the pretrial system in the United States.

12
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:10,400
Screenshot your donation and email us pretendingpod at gmail.com.

13
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:17,000
And for every $5 donated, you'll have an entry to win a Pretending to Be People t-shirt.

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,700
The third winner in this giveaway will be announced right now.

15
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,600
And that generous listener is...

16
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,400
Congratulations, Joelle. Keep donating, y'all.

17
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:36,100
There are still two more PTBP shirts left to give away.

18
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,300
I'd love to get one of them shirts,

19
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:44,900
but every time I put clothes on, they melt into a kind of shirt paste after a few hours.

20
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:52,100
One time, I made a sweater out of a bunch of hair clippings I found out back behind a dog groomer's place.

21
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:57,200
And by the time I made it home, it turned into a kind of hair jelly.

22
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,600
Slap that on some toast, throw some paprika on it, and you got a stool going, baby.

23
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:09,400
Have any thoughts on any of that? Then tag at PretendingPod on Twitter or Instagram.

24
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,500
Let me know how you really feel.

25
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:19,100
It's one of the best ways to get the word out about our little show here at 694.2.

26
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,700
And it's free, too.

27
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:29,600
What's not free is that sweet, sweet bonus content over at patreon.com slash pretending pod.

28
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:34,500
But it's worth it. I'm worth it. And I guess you're worth it, too.

29
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:40,000
And for those of you in the Dennis Inn, get ready for part three of Lover in the Ice.

30
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Streaming live into your room, workplace, or fancy toilet setup on Tuesday, June 23rd at 7 p.m. Central time.

31
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,600
My producer says the edited audio of part two will be up before Monday is complete.

32
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:05,400
And that episode will be available to all patrons at the Splashylvania Fastpass holder tier and up.

33
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,700
But Wolfie knows money is evil.

34
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:16,900
So if you can't swing the expense, write up a five star review on Apple Podcasts and I might read it on air.

35
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:21,300
Like this one here from Macha505 who writes,

36
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,900
I'm super impressed with the quality of this podcast.

37
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,700
All the role players are imaginative and committed.

38
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:34,100
And the DM is an incredible story creator and storyteller.

39
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:39,100
My husband and I listen to this weekly. Definitely recommend.

40
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:42,200
Well, that's so nice of you to say, Macha.

41
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:48,800
One day when I understand the merits of modern technology, I hope I can listen to the podcast.

42
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:54,500
For now, I just got to take y'all's word for it and blindly throw my support behind it.

43
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:59,300
Slap my ass and call me by my preferred nomenclature.

44
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:06,400
It's the news after escaping the growing but leisurely ooze by heading down into the sewer system.

45
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:13,900
Gary Daley showed the boys an old blog post by Harold Dorsey that had been wiped from the World Wide Web.

46
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:23,400
Our intrepid adventurers, along with Drew Carey, Tyler and Jimmy Sanders, were led to Harry and Gary's underground hideout.

47
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:28,500
There, Mildred Mitchell, Tildy B's grandma hid in her tent.

48
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:37,000
Casey Kristoff, the longtime janitor at the First Church of Contention, listened in while feigning interest in his book.

49
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,900
And Clara Blankenship, a dream-obsessed archivist with a familiar tattoo,

50
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:50,300
showed them a vlog from the previously missing John Peters that had also been pulled from the interwebs.

51
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:59,000
Catch these hands, my babies, and feel the fire of kudzu with no backbone.

52
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:37,800
My mom just sent me a meme that says, breaking news, John Travolta was hospitalized for suspected COVID-19.

53
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:45,800
But doctors now confirm that it was only Saturday Night Fever.

54
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:51,300
And they assure everyone that he is staying alive.

55
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:59,300
Apparently, he had chills that were multiplying.

56
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:04,800
It's a good thing the angel Michael didn't come for him.

57
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,300
Grease.

58
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:11,300
It would have been a heck of a phenomenon.

59
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:14,300
Oh, that's good.

60
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:20,800
Everybody wants world peace, but it really seems that we've got a real battlefield here on Earth.

61
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,300
Yeah, we're heading toward a face-off.

62
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:37,300
The other day on TV, have you heard about the wild hogs in Missouri?

63
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,800
Them and farmers are having a real face-off.

64
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,800
I already used face-off.

65
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,800
Oh, shit.

66
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:48,800
I got a postcard from my aunt from Paris with love.

67
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,300
Have you ever eaten at Hemingway's up at Bass Pro?

68
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,300
On the wall, they've got a big swordfish.

69
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,800
Oh, wow.

70
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:00,800
Hey, good one.

71
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,800
I couldn't relate it to his COVID diagnosis, but it worked.

72
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,300
Yeah, that's really hard.

73
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:15,300
They said while he was in the hospital, he had to get somebody to take care of his old dogs.

74
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,300
Oh, wow.

75
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:20,300
Isn't it old hogs? Wild hogs?

76
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,300
He's in old dogs and wild hogs.

77
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:25,300
He's in both. Oh, no.

78
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:33,300
He didn't look the way he wanted to because they wouldn't allow him in the hospital to use his hairspray.

79
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,300
Oh, yeah.

80
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:41,300
They had to put him in a special bed because he was too tall because he couldn't get shorty.

81
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,300
Gotti.

82
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,300
Gotti.

83
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,300
Luke's just looking at Wikipedia now.

84
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:51,300
Oh, look who's talking now. Thomas is back in the room.

85
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,300
Clark Bishop, Keith Vigna, and John Lee Pettymore III.

86
00:07:54,300 --> 00:08:03,300
You're in this large underground chamber that Gary Daley led you to in order to hide from Pastor Adam Kane and the First Creek family of contention.

87
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:11,300
Kerry Pages, Drew Andrews' body, is on the ground, cuffed, and nuzzling Tyler, the tireless black lab.

88
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:15,300
Jimmy Sanders is wandering around the place, murmuring to himself.

89
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:21,300
Mildred Mitchell is in the tent furthest from you and hasn't popped out since your arrival.

90
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:29,300
Casey Kristoff, the long-time janitor at the First Church of contention, is leaning up against one of the four concrete columns,

91
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:38,300
acting like he is reading a book while he listens in on the conversation you've been having with Harry Klinker, Gary Daley, and Clara Blankenship,

92
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:43,300
who just showed you a video of John Peters from a few years ago.

93
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:46,300
A video that was scrubbed from the internet.

94
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:51,300
A video wherein he talks about the dreams he had during his coma.

95
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,300
Clara puts down her phone and looks to you all.

96
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:59,300
What does a Nike bag have to do with another world and a man who can burn persons with his hands?

97
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:04,300
I might know a feller who, uh, who, who can shake your hand and make it burn.

98
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:08,300
Uh, that's, that's my, that's my uncle, uh, Don D. Pettymore.

99
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,300
What?

100
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,300
That, that's, yeah, that's my, my uncle can do that.

101
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,300
Probably lots of other people.

102
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:21,300
He mostly did it as like a party trick, but sometimes, you know, if he got a little too drunk or if he really didn't like a feller, he'd burn them pretty good.

103
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:29,300
But like also he'd, he'd, he'd stick it in your mittens when we were kids on a cold day and, and he'd warm you up.

104
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:36,300
So we always took it as like, you know, it wasn't, I didn't think of it as anything sinister.

105
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,300
You know, he did call it devil hands.

106
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:49,300
But it, you know, it warmed, it warmed my little bones up, so.

107
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:54,300
Did he, did he ever tell you why he thought he could do it? Like that's not something most people can do, John.

108
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:58,300
I mean, I guess it just became part of your world as a kid, but it's kind of weird.

109
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:05,300
I never, I never asked, you know, cause yeah, it's just, since I was born, Uncle Don could do that.

110
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,300
Where, where is he now?

111
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:15,300
Well, uh, I can, you know, that's, I actually kind of come, uh, come into law enforcement because of, because of him.

112
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:25,300
And you know, now, as I say, I'm about to say this next thing, uh, it does make the devil's hand sound a lot more sinister, but he's, he's really involved in some, in some nasty business.

113
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:30,300
And, uh, he put up a lot of money for my race and career when I was a younger man.

114
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:38,300
And, uh, I kinda, I kinda, I kinda biffed that, uh, a little bit and ended up owing him a lot of money.

115
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:41,300
And I thought maybe the safest place for me to be was in a uniform.

116
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:46,300
To avoid him, you mean? To keep you safe from, like, loan sharks?

117
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:51,300
Yeah, uh, yeah. And devil hands.

118
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,300
And devil hands, right.

119
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:56,300
So what would he have been doing with a Nike bag? With the Nike bag?

120
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:02,300
This, this devil hands uncle of yours, when was the last time you saw him?

121
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:08,300
Uh, you know, a few, a few years ago, he did the old devil hands on, on Large Eddie.

122
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:12,300
Large, Largette, he, he burned, he burned somebody. Did it kill him?

123
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:16,300
No, no, no. He just, you know, toasted his fingers a little bit.

124
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:23,300
Claire, you said you've been seeing the, have you, have you seen a person who can burn hands in your, in your visions of this rope?

125
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,300
You've been seeing the rope figure though, right?

126
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:30,300
Yeah. Yeah. The rope figure, which like, Keith, you've been really quiet for the past like 10 minutes.

127
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:35,300
Maybe it's just cause Luke's internet dropped last time, but have you seen any of these?

128
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:38,300
I mean, we were talking the rope figure, we were talking these long...

129
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:45,300
Before, before Keith says anything, I do also seem to, and I'm just kicking myself for just thinking of this now,

130
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:52,300
but speaking of the fellows that were chasing the rope figure, come to think of it, last time I saw Uncle Don,

131
00:11:52,300 --> 00:12:00,300
uh, two of them, those weird, tall, lanky, translucent figures, they was chasing us for a while.

132
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:07,300
I took quite a severe head injury, uh, the last time I saw Uncle Don, so a lot of the details are fuzzy.

133
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:14,300
Did you, you felt, you felt like this, the, the, the translucent guys wearing suits that they were chasing you in particular?

134
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:22,300
Well, they were chasing, I see, I was being wheeled in a wheelchair by Uncle Don at the time and he, we took off in flight.

135
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:25,300
I didn't really have much say in the matter.

136
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:32,300
They were after him or me or someone running directly in front of us, maybe we were running parallel to the people they were chasing

137
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:38,300
and we were just running for no reason, but now that I've seen them again, that doesn't seem like a very likely explanation.

138
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:46,300
You know, I must have had repressed memories or something, but you know, when we were messing around with this and I pulled the watch out of my pocket.

139
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,300
Oh, I put it on.

140
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:55,300
Alright, uh, uh, Luke and Joe, take your headphones off.

141
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,300
Okay.

142
00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:18,300
John, the channel on your reality begins changing as expected and then it stops and you're looking at the kitchen of your childhood home.

143
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:26,300
Your daddy, John Lee Pettymore III, younger than you ever remember seeing him, is pacing back and forth anxiously.

144
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:36,300
His face turns hopeful as your mother enters the room, but she slowly shakes her head no as tears begin pouring down her face.

145
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:50,300
Her husband rushes to embrace his shaking wife, her body convulsing rhythmically to the sobs as a negative pregnancy test falls from her grasp onto the cold tile floor.

146
00:13:50,300 --> 00:14:04,300
The channel changes. You see your daddy again, eyes completely wide and bloodshot, knuckles white as he grips the steering wheel of his black 1977 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am.

147
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:14,300
Backlit by a home completely engulfed in flames, he looks into the rearview mirror to make sure he isn't being followed.

148
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:25,300
He speaks into a large car phone. The vector adopted by the Kane family has been eliminated. Casualties, unfortunately, include the rest of the family.

149
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:39,300
You see a Fincher-esque aerial shot of this entire scene begin to slowly zoom in on the fire and there's a young boy crawling out from this completely consumed building.

150
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:52,300
He has a balloon-shaped head and eyes so dark that the irises look black. Your view shifts back onto John's black muscle car driving into the night.

151
00:14:52,300 --> 00:15:04,300
And the camera does that cool thing where it moves into the trunk and there you see a baby swaddled in a black suit jacket sitting on top of adoption papers.

152
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:13,300
Holy shit. Can I get an audio reaction that matches what your face just looked like?

153
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:18,300
He's not a real petty boy. He's a damn Kane.

154
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:37,300
So the watch falls off John's hand. John just sits on the floor, like almost falls. He's down.

155
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:41,300
Whoa, whoa, John, John. I'm trying to ease his fall to the ground. John?

156
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,300
You guys are close enough, you can kind of catch him.

157
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,300
Keith, he put it on again.

158
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:51,300
Yeah, I was about to tell you about the guys, but holy shit. What'd you see?

159
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:58,300
John's eyes are just wide. He's just repeating, adopted the vector. They adopted the vector.

160
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,300
Adopted the vector.

161
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:03,300
Roll Sanity. Thomas?

162
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:10,300
Crit success. Wait, no, no, no, no, no. Sorry. 33 is a crit failure because I don't know.

163
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:16,300
All right. But at least it's not over my power.

164
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,300
You're going to lose two sanity.

165
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,300
That takes me to my breaking point.

166
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,300
Oh, wonderful. Very appropriate.

167
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:27,300
Yes, that is absolutely correct. So Luke and Joe, if you guys want to take your headphones off again.

168
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,300
For sure.

169
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:34,300
You guys should try putting on the watch this episode because he's got some great shit fucking written for that this time.

170
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:54,300
All righty. Thomas, you know the drill. I need you to roll on a D-100 three times and give me the results one at a time.

171
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,300
64.

172
00:16:55,300 --> 00:17:03,300
All right. 64 is going to be Lottery Mania. An extreme desire to take part in lotteries.

173
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,300
23.

174
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:14,300
23 is Cardicoethis. Cardicoethis, which is an uncontrollable compulsion to see maps everywhere. And the last one?

175
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,300
97.

176
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:21,300
And a 97 is Trichotillomania. Craving for pulling out own hair.

177
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:33,300
Wow. These all provide some very interesting role playing options. The last one might be too horrific.

178
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,300
It would be really gross.

179
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:38,300
Though I do potentially have thousands of arm hairs.

180
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,300
And mustache hairs.

181
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:43,300
I think that's the last thing he'd pull out. That's only when it's truly broken.

182
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:46,300
I'm going to go, I think, with Lottery Mania.

183
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:53,300
Okay. An extreme desire to take part in lotteries. And let's go ahead and just throw in gambling into that as a whole.

184
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,300
That would open up some more role player opportunities.

185
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,300
Exactly.

186
00:17:56,300 --> 00:18:01,300
I was just thinking maybe he would try to start his own lottery and really evangelize it.

187
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:08,300
I think within the confines of this game, trying to take bets with people consistently is going to be an easier...

188
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:12,300
Let's do that. Alright. He's a gambling addict.

189
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,300
He's a gambling addict out of nowhere.

190
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,300
Holy shit, he's gonna come.

191
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,300
Hahahaha!

192
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:38,300
John Lee Pettymore the 3rd, as the watch falls off his wrist, he crumples into the ground and Clark Bishop kind of reaches out and takes hold of him.

193
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:41,300
John starts dry heaving. Clark is gonna pat your back.

194
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:43,300
What's that sound like?

195
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:52,300
John? You got something coming up? Alright, get it out.

196
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:59,300
Well anyway, I saw those figures when I was a kid.

197
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:04,300
John turns around on you and he's like, you wanna bet?

198
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:18,300
I mean, yeah. The first time I saw the watch, my dad was giving it to my brother and the alarms were going off at our house and a few of those creatures were, I guess, invading the property.

199
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:30,300
And we got shooed inside and my dad gave that watch to Ferguson and told him that he was gonna be the savior. So I guess that's not true.

200
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:46,300
The savior? Yeah, something like that. He said, when the time comes, the watch would fit him. I wonder if I'm the savior. Maybe it fits me and I put the watch on.

201
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:51,300
Alrighty, Thomas and Joe. Take those headphones off.

202
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:57,300
Listeners, I hope you're ready for Ben's watching episode 2.

203
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,300
Part 2.

204
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,300
The rebinjanine.

205
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:46,300
You recognize Clark Bishop, Keith Vigna, yourself, and John Lee Pettymore III as they approach the bank of Bean's Pond, with John trailing the other two, you and Clark, by a few yards.

206
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:59,300
Focused on searching for something in the water, Clark and Keith fail to see John raise his gun, take a deep breath, and fire two shots, one for each of his partners.

207
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:22,300
He quickly finishes the task with four more bullets before he crouches down beside your bodies. He grabs your wrist and pulls the watch off and slips it over his own wrist, before he begins walking slowly into the frigid water of Bean's Pond.

208
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:25,300
Oh, no.

209
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:47,300
Clark and John, you actually see Keith Vigna's eyes come back to and look at you, and the watch stays on his wrist.

210
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,300
John actually vomits.

211
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:52,300
Keith? Keith? Are you with us? Are you with us?

212
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,300
Yeah, Keith, roll Sanity.

213
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:56,300
The watch is still on, Keith.

214
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,300
Fail, but not over my power.

215
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:12,300
Okay, you just lose one Sanity, and as Keith realizes the watch is still on, he looks directly into the eyes of John Lee Pettymore III, and John, all you see is fear.

216
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:20,300
And Keith, all you see is this ooze coming out of every orifice on John Lee Pettymore III's face.

217
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:35,300
I just saw us die at the pond.

218
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:50,300
John, can you put your gun down and slide it away from you?

219
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:56,300
John puts his hand on his gun. He doesn't draw it, but he puts it on his holster.

220
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,300
Hey, whoa, hey, what's going on?

221
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:13,300
And immediately, Clara and Gary and Harry all kind of back up and go and kind of stand nearby Casey Kristoff, who immediately just kind of like fumbles with his book and then steps away and tries to like move behind one of the pillars.

222
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,300
What do you want my gun for, Keith?

223
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:21,300
I don't want it. I just, I don't want you to have it right now.

224
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,300
Why don't you want him to have his gun, Keith?

225
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:31,300
I like look at both of them, like looking back and forth to him and I walk over to Clark and I whisper something in his ear.

226
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,300
Thomas should take his headphones out.

227
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,300
He took it out.

228
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,300
Oh, he did.

229
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:48,300
Clark, I saw him, us approaching the pond and John, he shot us and he killed us and then he took the watch and he went into the pond.

230
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,300
He just shot us out of the blue?

231
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:57,300
He shot each of us in the back and then four more shots to finish us off and then...

232
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,300
Oh, God.

233
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,300
Yeah.

234
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:07,300
John is just like, this whisper is taking a long time.

235
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:11,300
What'd he tell you, Clark?

236
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:14,300
Come over here and whisper it in my ear.

237
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:18,300
Hey, John, when you put on the watch, what did you see?

238
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:24,300
Well, I saw confirmation that I'm a child of destiny.

239
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:30,300
I suspect perhaps you two are as well, but I know for a fact that I am.

240
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,300
What does that mean?

241
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,300
That might be a little complicated.

242
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:38,300
Why don't you tell me why all of a sudden you want to disarm me?

243
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,300
Hang on, though.

244
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:45,300
If all you saw was being a child of destiny, when you popped out of there, you said adopted the vector.

245
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,300
You kept repeating it.

246
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,300
What did that mean?

247
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:53,300
Well, as it happens, I am the vector.

248
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,300
You adopted yourself?

249
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,300
Technically, he did adopt himself.

250
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:59,300
Yeah, technically, I guess I did adopt myself.

251
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:03,300
This body that you see before you, the body of Kevin Lee Pettymore.

252
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,300
John is not taking his hand off his gun.

253
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:10,300
The body of Kevin Lee Pettymore, the soul and mind of Kevin Lee Pettymore.

254
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:15,300
See, he was sent to, I guess, kill all the gangs.

255
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:20,300
Don't rightly know why, but they had adopted a little baby.

256
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,300
That's me.

257
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,300
I was going to be a cane, fellas.

258
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:29,300
But then my daddy burned down their house and little Adam crawled out of it.

259
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:32,300
He thought he'd killed all them canes, but I guess Adam got out.

260
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:36,300
Might be why he's so ornery.

261
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:48,300
Anyway, I saw me, him, taking baby me, I, with him in a little, you know, with adoption papers.

262
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:53,300
And I also saw a little vision of him and my mama trying real hard to have a baby, and they couldn't.

263
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:55,300
So it was on his mind.

264
00:25:55,300 --> 00:26:02,300
And it seems like, you know, you kind of, well, you see a baby on the table, you just take it, you know how it is sometimes.

265
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,300
The Pettymore way.

266
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,300
Free baby.

267
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:09,300
But yeah, what he said over the radio, remember, he was a part of K-Cell.

268
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:16,300
What he was telling somebody is that he had eliminated the vector adopted by the canes.

269
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:19,300
But he didn't. I'm the vector.

270
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:21,300
And he took me in.

271
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:25,300
And maybe you boys is from similar circumstances.

272
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:28,300
Anyway, that's my story, Ergo, child of destiny.

273
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:30,300
Well, Keith saw you kill us.

274
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,300
Yeah.

275
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:33,300
Did you deserve it?

276
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:36,300
I don't rightly believe so.

277
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:39,300
You killed us at the pond, and you took the watch.

278
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:43,300
Are you wanting the watch real bad right now, John?

279
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:50,300
Now that you say that, I got to suspect I had a good reason.

280
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:53,300
Keith, why don't you try taking that watch off?

281
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,300
Why is it stuck to you?

282
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,300
I think I'm going to keep it on.

283
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:05,300
You know, like I said, my dad told Ferguson, when the time comes, it'll fit, you know?

284
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:07,300
Yeah, but he said that about himself.

285
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:15,300
Well, he said it about, well, my dad thought he was going to be the one, the savior, the chosen one, whatever.

286
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:19,300
And he realized it wasn't him, and he thought it was going to be Ferguson.

287
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:23,300
But, you know, he's gone, so I've got it.

288
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:30,300
And he said when the time comes, it'll fit, and it's not falling off me.

289
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:37,300
And if there's any time for it to be the time of and for a savior, I'd say just right about now is the time.

290
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:42,300
But you're, listen, I've been ball. I am the vector.

291
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:45,300
If anybody's going to be a savior around here, it seems like it would probably be me.

292
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:52,300
Well, I mean, I don't know much about this prophecy other than what I overheard my dad telling Ferguson.

293
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:55,300
Damn, watch.

294
00:27:55,300 --> 00:28:00,300
And I step back away from him a little bit, and I'm very scared.

295
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:11,300
I get in the middle. Hey, wait, hey, if anybody's saving anybody, it's going to be the overseer, which we're under the assumption I am.

296
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:15,300
Oh, la-di-da, Mr. Overseer. Could you oversee ball?

297
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:21,300
Nothing could oversee ball. It couldn't be contained. It burst gloriously from the roof that tries to constrain it.

298
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:27,300
Guys, hear me out. What if it's all three of us needing to come together?

299
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:30,300
Now is hardly the time. Sex magic.

300
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:36,300
No, no, no. None of us can do it. I surely can't do anything by myself.

301
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:43,300
I've always needed your guys' help, and maybe we're each a piece of a puzzle.

302
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:47,300
Well, now, here's an interesting point. You might be onto something there.

303
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:57,300
He said, the vector adopted by the canes. Now, perhaps grammatically ambiguous, but to me, it implies other vectors.

304
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,300
And Gary...

305
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:02,300
Yeah, Gary did that, you know, little witchcraft.

306
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:08,300
He has that spell that was perfect for three of us. If it was any one of us, it was important.

307
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:10,300
Gary, which one of us is the savior?

308
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,300
It's probably me.

309
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:17,300
I'm just saying, my seafood fur will change the world.

310
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:19,300
It is pretty damn good, Gary.

311
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:22,300
Ah, yeah. Alright, we gotta give that to you, Gary.

312
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:30,300
Guys, I've been wanting to get to the pond, but I'm not so sure now.

313
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:34,300
You know, every time we try to go somewhere, we really want to go.

314
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:41,300
The mill. The pond. Some unseen forces trying to scare us away from that.

315
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:46,300
You know, maybe this watch is just showing us bullshit. Maybe we should just go to the pond.

316
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,300
Clark starts nodding emphatically.

317
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:53,300
Yeah, what if it's showing us bullshit? How do we know any of it's anything to put any stock in?

318
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:55,300
I mean, yeah, it could easily...

319
00:29:55,300 --> 00:30:00,300
Well, except for the part where I'm a child of destiny. I felt that in my bones to be true.

320
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,300
That's why I think you should give me that watch.

321
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:08,300
I think maybe we ought to go down into the pond, but maybe I'll keep wearing it and maybe you don't...

322
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:11,300
Maybe you're in front instead of behind us.

323
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:13,300
Is that where I was when the vision was behind you?

324
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:16,300
Yeah, you were a little bit behind us shooting us in the back.

325
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:18,300
That would have been the way to do it.

326
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:29,300
Well, Keith, if it'll make you feel better, here.

327
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:33,300
And I draw my gun and I kick it across to him.

328
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:37,300
I pick it up and tuck it into my belt, my waistband.

329
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:42,300
I actually hate this. Could I get that back? Could I feel very naked? Could I have that back?

330
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:49,300
I'm just going to keep a hold of it. Clark can hold it if you want, but I just...

331
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,300
Give it to Clark.

332
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,300
I hand the gun to Clark.

333
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:55,300
Hey Clark, can I have that gun back?

334
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:57,300
Clark, don't do it.

335
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:01,300
I'm going to hold on to it just as long as we get past the point in his vision.

336
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:04,300
Once we get past the moment in time, things change.

337
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:10,300
Yeah, we'll give it back to you. Once we get to the pond, nobody's behind anybody, we'll give it back to you.

338
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,300
As long as you don't shoot us, that is.

339
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:14,300
Gary, do you have any extra guns?

340
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:16,300
Well, it's a contention, ain't it?

341
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,300
Okay, could you get me one?

342
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:21,300
Yeah, you know, he's just...

343
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:26,300
Then Harry walks over to his tent and kind of unzips a flat and opens it up.

344
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,300
There's a few different choice weapons.

345
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:33,300
I take a little concealed carry pistol, boom, and slip it into my back pocket.

346
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:40,300
Yeah, that one's real nice for keeping it at the bar, you know, people get unruly, they don't even know, they don't see it coming.

347
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:43,300
You kill people at the bar when they get unruly?

348
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:51,300
Oh, that's actually a pellet gun. Let me hand you the one that looks the exact same, that's actually a real gun. Here you go.

349
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,300
Thank you.

350
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:56,300
When I see this happen, I'm like, I mean, well, you're definitely walking in front then.

351
00:31:56,300 --> 00:32:01,300
I shoot a glance over to Keith. I mean, was he holding that gun and not his gun in your vision?

352
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:05,300
Oh, that's a fantastic question. Let me think real hard, real quick.

353
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,300
Zach?

354
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:11,300
Yeah, man, it was his standard issue.

355
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:17,300
No, it was the gun that you have that he gave to us, so it makes me feel a little bit better.

356
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:19,300
I think things are changing then, maybe.

357
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:22,300
You know, the watch is still on, I'm not seeing anything, so.

358
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:28,300
Keith, here's another question. Did you see yourself die or did I just shoot you two?

359
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:31,300
Oh, I would say, you know.

360
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,300
Maybe you just needed a winging.

361
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:36,300
I think a total of six shots does the trick, you know.

362
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:38,300
Apparently you shot us after we were down.

363
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:43,300
Yeah, you shot both of us and then you shot us more.

364
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:47,300
Well, that would do the trick, yeah, probably.

365
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:50,300
How about you just don't shoot us?

366
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:52,300
We'll have you walk in front, just in case.

367
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:55,300
We've kind of moved past this real fast, but I just wanted to ask,

368
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:59,300
Keith, do you have any idea where that watch came from, like how it got to your dad?

369
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:06,300
No, I mean, the first time I saw it was that day when me and Fergie were just playing outside

370
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:13,300
and all of a sudden those creatures popped up in our yard and I don't really know what happened to them,

371
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:17,300
but the first time I saw that watch my dad was giving it to Ferguson.

372
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:23,300
Did you or we look at, like, inspect it? It's not engraved or anything, is it?

373
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,300
It's just a normal watch looking, right?

374
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:31,300
I mean, yeah, it's just a gold watch. It's real nice, but, you know, it's a pretty normal watch

375
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:34,300
other than it gives you visions and only fits me.

376
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:40,300
It might be waterproof, but we'd have to get to the pond to find out. Wink, wink.

377
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:43,300
I think that's our next course of action, isn't it?

378
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:47,300
Yeah, I mean, I think we can leave Carrie here with these guys.

379
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:50,300
I think, you know, she shouldn't be too much of an issue with Tyler.

380
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:57,300
Real quick, what if you gave me my gun back? I just like my gun. I named him Seth.

381
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:01,300
Yeah, in my vision you were shooting us with Seth.

382
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:07,300
Hear the rest. Hear it out. Hear it out. Hear it out. I'll just stay here.

383
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:10,300
I won't come to the pond. I'll guard Carrie Pages.

384
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:17,300
Thomas, I'm not kidding. I have it written in my notes that the Canes named you Seth.

385
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:21,300
Oh, my God.

386
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,300
That's really weird.

387
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,300
That's super weird.

388
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,300
That's fucking wild.

389
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,300
Holy shit.

390
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:29,300
Maybe the gun is actually a kid.

391
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:32,300
What if it's the vector?

392
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:45,300
I mean, do you really? I mean, it's not that I trust you more than this watch, really, but, you know, I'd like you to come along with us.

393
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:48,300
Good things don't typically happen when we split up.

394
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:51,300
What if I trade you this new gun for Seth?

395
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,300
Are you going to kill us?

396
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:56,300
The tent on the far side of the room kind of bursts open, or it tries to.

397
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:01,300
Someone's trying to get out, but they didn't unzip the tent flap first.

398
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:05,300
And Mildred Mitchell is like, oh, my goodness.

399
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:10,300
And then finally the zipper comes loose, and she busts out of there, and she looked haggard.

400
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:13,300
She looks terrible. She's normally all done up all night.

401
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:19,300
She still has one rainbow earring on, but the other one's missing, and her hair's all over the place.

402
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:25,300
And she's holding this piece of paper in one hand that she immediately, like, oh, no, and puts it in her back pocket.

403
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:30,300
And then she's holding a picture in her other hand, and she's like, this, this, this, this is the one.

404
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:34,300
I mean, you, you, you all are the reason that she's gone.

405
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:39,300
But I, just now, standing in this tent, it changed. It changed.

406
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:43,300
It was him, and then it, and then it was him.

407
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:46,300
And she points at John. She says, it was him.

408
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:50,300
And then she points at Keith, and she says, it was him.

409
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:56,300
And she shoves this picture in your face, and it is a picture of the founders of contention.

410
00:35:56,300 --> 00:36:05,300
And there you see Silas Cole, but it is not the face of the Silas Cole that you remember seeing growing up, who is very handsome.

411
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:10,300
A very good-looking, maybe a ridiculously handsome man.

412
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:14,300
But now, that face is the face of Keith Vigna.

413
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:17,300
What the, what the fuck?

414
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:20,300
You didn't roll sanity for me?

415
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,300
I swear, it was, it, it was him?

416
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:24,300
And she points at John Lee Pettymore the third.

417
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:30,300
It was his face right here, where Silas Cole is. It was his face. And then it changed. The picture changed.

418
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:33,300
There was a very handsome face, and then there was Keith's face.

419
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:37,300
No, there was a handsome face, it was back in the day, a long time, a few weeks ago.

420
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:44,300
And then, and then, I mean, even up until a few days ago, and, and then it became Keith, yes, Keith's face.

421
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:49,300
Oh my God, that's who, I knew he looked familiar. Hey, oh my God.

422
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:52,300
And she just kind of like stumbles away.

423
00:36:52,300 --> 00:37:00,300
I just don't, I just don't, does anyone have any pot?

424
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:04,300
Oh yeah, I help her out.

425
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:08,300
I pass her, I pass her my one hitter in.

426
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:12,300
That Kevin always has in his tactical gear.

427
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:16,300
Sean just probably had some stashed around town.

428
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:20,300
He's like, oh, I know this part of the underground. How'd you guys do on your sanity checks?

429
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:21,300
I got a three.

430
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,300
Oh my God.

431
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:23,300
I got a two.

432
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,300
Jesus.

433
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,300
I failed, but under my power.

434
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:32,300
Okay, so Clark, you're going to lose one sanity as you start to realize, Thomas and Luke, take your headphones off.

435
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:40,300
Clark realizes in this moment, whoever had the watch on, becomes Silas Cole.

436
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:46,300
I don't know if that's obvious, just listening to how everything's gone down, but in this moment, you know it to be true.

437
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:50,300
Okay.

438
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:56,300
Keith Vigna, Mildred Mitchell hands you the picture that has you in it.

439
00:37:56,300 --> 00:38:01,300
And she goes, look, look, see, and she points to this reflection, it's like a window.

440
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:12,300
There's a vague, faint reflection, and in it, you think you can make out the general outline, vague aura of Tildi B. Mitchell.

441
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:15,300
And she's there, and it's your fault.

442
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,300
And she points at Clark Bishop.

443
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:19,300
Hey, I didn't shoot the gun. She did.

444
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,300
What gun?

445
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:25,300
I mean, she was gone is what I mean. She wasn't in her room.

446
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:28,300
I mean, we could tell her about the gun that sends people to the past, right?

447
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:39,300
Well, we weren't quite sure what it did, but now that we see this picture of Tildi here, after she shot that gun and disappeared, seems like it sends people to the past, so...

448
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,300
That checks out.

449
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:50,300
I got a good idea. What if, how about we give Jon his gun back, but we bring Mildred with us, that way the vision can't be true.

450
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:54,300
I'm not going anywhere with you. You all are the reason that she's gone.

451
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,300
What if I gave you this gun?

452
00:38:56,300 --> 00:39:00,300
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, okay, fine. I'll go, yeah, sure.

453
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,300
Okay, but first, Keith, you give me my gun back.

454
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,300
Clark's got it.

455
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,300
Give me Seth.

456
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,300
Clark.

457
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:08,300
Clark is real hesitant about it.

458
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:10,300
Put Seth back in his holster.

459
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:14,300
Why are we trying to make more things like Keith's vision instead of less things?

460
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:15,300
Well, Mildred is the less thing.

461
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,300
We're bringing Mildred with us.

462
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:19,300
I just feel very uncomfortable. I would just feel a lot better.

463
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:29,300
While he's trying to get the gun from Clark, I want to, I'm looking at the picture, and I want to take the watch off and see if my face is still on Silas Cole's face.

464
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,300
Hey, Luke.

465
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,300
Yeah?

466
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:33,300
You can't get that watch off your wrist.

467
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,300
Oh.

468
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:38,300
Go ahead and roll sanity. Just you.

469
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:41,300
Oh, that's a fail. Let's see if it's over my power.

470
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:43,300
Yep.

471
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:52,300
Go ahead and lose one sanity as you can't get the watch off your wrist.

472
00:39:52,300 --> 00:40:04,300
So while he's trying to get the gun back, I'm trying to, like, unclasp the watch, and it won't unclasp, and then I'm trying to, like, move it around on my arm, but it's, like, staying in just, like, one position.

473
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:15,300
And I start freaking out, and I look at the picture, and I look at Mildred, and I just fly at her and tackle her to the ground and trying to start just beating the shit out of her.

474
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,300
Do you actually fly?

475
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:20,300
No. I leap at her.

476
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:27,300
Most Delta Green games don't need that disclaimer.

477
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:34,300
I yell, oh, fuck, and throw Jon his gun, and I try to tackle Keith off of Mildred.

478
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:42,300
Okay, let's all roll. Clark, Keith, and Mildred will all roll an armed combat to see how this shakes out.

479
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:49,300
Jon's just got two guns in his hands now, and he's staring wide-eyed. He doesn't really know what to do.

480
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:52,300
Oh, I forgot you were already holding one. Yeah.

481
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:56,300
I was going to give it to Mitchell. She could have shot Keith.

482
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:04,300
I failed. I rolled over. I got an 85 on a 70.

483
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:07,300
Nice. Oh, my goodness gracious.

484
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:08,300
Oh, no.

485
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:14,300
Luke just showed us with his webcam. He rolled an 0-1, and I failed with a 43. Mildred Mitchell's not a fighter.

486
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:21,300
I look up from the picture, lock eyes with her, and tackle her to the ground and just start punching her in the face.

487
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:24,300
I soar over the top of him as I tried to tackle him off of her.

488
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:31,300
Jon's going to try to separate them.

489
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:35,300
You separate them, and Mildred lays unconscious on the ground.

490
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:43,300
I look over at Mildred and look at Jon and then look down at my hands, and I just throw up.

491
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:49,300
And you throw up directly onto this piece of paper that was in the back pocket of Mildred Mitchell.

492
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:54,300
It fell out, and it's on the ground next to her, and you kind of puke on the corner of it.

493
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:59,300
And it is just a piece of paper that she has written on it, and it says,

494
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:10,300
I'm just shaking, and I'm just looking at the piece of paper, and I lay down on my side, and I'm just trying to catch my breath.

495
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:16,300
Clara Blankenship has hidden behind one of the pillars, as has Casey Kristoff.

496
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:22,300
However, Gary and Harry are both standing at their tense edge, guns drawn.

497
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:30,300
Harry has a pistol, and Gary has a semi-automatic rifle, and they are slowly walking toward Keith Vigna,

498
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:33,300
who's on the ground, and they have their weapons pointed.

499
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:38,300
And Gary's like, you stay right there! You stay on the ground! What the fuck?

500
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:43,300
And Harry's like, I've always stuck up for you. I've always stuck up for you, Keith Vigna.

501
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:46,300
You come in here, and you take out Mildred Mitchell like that.

502
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:49,300
I get between them and Keith. They point their weapons at you.

503
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:53,300
I couldn't help it. I didn't mean to do it. It just, what the hell is going on?

504
00:42:53,300 --> 00:43:02,300
Hold on. Hold on, everybody. Calm down now. Should Keith have done that? No. Obviously, Keith.

505
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:04,300
I turn around, and I give you a glare.

506
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:06,300
Weapons down. Weapons down. Everyone. Everyone.

507
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:11,300
They're down. They're down. I put Seth in his holster, and I pocket the other gun.

508
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:17,300
I had a dream that if the temperature gets too high, we all die here. Okay?

509
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:21,300
That was my dream. Claire's over there talking about dreams like,

510
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:27,300
my dream was if the temperature got too high, that we were all gonna die down here.

511
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:33,300
Yet, the dream seemed to be like, maybe metaphorical in places. You ever think about that?

512
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:34,300
About your dreams? No, no.

513
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:37,300
I mean, everybody's dream is different, so what the fuck?

514
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:40,300
Now you're questioning about temperature. Okay, okay. We just gotta all calm down, okay?

515
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:45,300
I'm just trying to understand your meaning. You'd all die if tempers got heated down here,

516
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:49,300
or if the temperature itself got too high. Jesus fucking Christ, John.

517
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:52,300
Yeah, I was saying if our tempers got too high, we were all gonna die.

518
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:59,300
You, Clark, Keith, me, Gary, Mildred, Clara, Casey, all of us.

519
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:06,300
While they're talking, I am slowly, like, scooting towards a tunnel.

520
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:10,300
I mean, you can slowly back away. You're far ways away from one of the tunnels.

521
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:13,300
This is a pretty big room. Yeah, I'm doing that still, though.

522
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:17,300
And I'm looking at everybody. Clark is gonna start getting back to his feet.

523
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:24,300
Harry, I'm sorry. I understand that was alarming. We've all become touchy in the last few days.

524
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:29,300
Things set us off, and it's not good, I understand, but look at him now. Look at him now.

525
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:32,300
He's scared. He doesn't even know what just happened. I guarantee it.

526
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:34,300
He's just worming his little way away.

527
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:39,300
Y'all need to get the fuck out of here. We protected you for long enough. You need to get going.

528
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:41,300
If you're gonna go to the pond, go to the fucking pond.

529
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:46,300
Well, now, hold on. Everyone's sitting around here having visions.

530
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:48,300
Go to the fucking pond.

531
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:50,300
Listen, magic man, we've got some fucking questions.

532
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:52,300
I get up and take off towards the tunnel.

533
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:53,300
John, I think we should go.

534
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:55,300
Harry, is this how you feel?

535
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:56,300
I don't like it.

536
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:58,300
Oh, sorry. Gary, is this how you feel?

537
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:01,300
I don't like it either, but y'all need to...

538
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:04,300
I trust his dream, and I don't want to die today.

539
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:07,300
And I believe all of you. I believe you've been through some shit.

540
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:10,300
It's putting you on edge. It's making you do all sorts of weird things.

541
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:13,300
We've all seen a lot of messed up shit in the past few days.

542
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:18,300
Maybe even our whole lives, but it's just coming to fruition now for some reason.

543
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:24,300
But I swear, what Keith just did to Mildred is not okay, and I know he's gone now.

544
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:27,300
I know he's gone. Okay? He went down that tunnel.

545
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:30,300
Y'all are gonna go have to find him if you want to find him, okay?

546
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:33,300
He's heading south. That's the way you were heading anyway.

547
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:35,300
So y'all just need to go on and get.

548
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:36,300
Alright, Gary.

549
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:39,300
I'm sorry. I didn't want it to go this way.

550
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:42,300
I'm sorry too, Gary. You're right, that shouldn't have happened.

551
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:45,300
Will you keep an eye on Drew there?

552
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:48,300
I need you to maybe keep him here. Don't let him get anywhere.

553
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:50,300
Yeah, well keep an eye on Drew.

554
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:52,300
Again, that's not Drew. That's Kerry Pages.

555
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:55,300
Drew Kerry. That's a funny little thing we say.

556
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:58,300
Make sure you don't feed him anything with too much sugar,

557
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:03,300
and make sure you give Tyler a treat before bed every night.

558
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:07,300
Sorry about all this. Mildred, we are going to, at some point,

559
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:11,300
time cop our way into finding your daughter, I'm sure of it.

560
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:13,300
She doesn't respond because she's unconscious,

561
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:16,300
because Keith just beat the shit out of her and she's an old woman.

562
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:18,300
I say it again louder.

563
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:25,300
Wake up, lazy bones.

564
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:27,300
Oh, God.

565
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:33,300
Now y'all come back to Daily Pho as soon as you fix this,

566
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:37,300
because I trust that you will, and here come Monday,

567
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:40,300
you come get a steaming hot bowl of seafood pho.

568
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:42,300
