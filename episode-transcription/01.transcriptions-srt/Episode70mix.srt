1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,260
Well, well, well. It's one episode after the nice episode. Time to get more somber, I guess.

2
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:19,660
Psych! It's always 69 o'clock here at 694.2 PTPB, my babies. Now, it may be episode 70,

3
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:26,260
but when you're with me, Wolf the Dog, it always feel like some kinda 69 could happen

4
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:34,660
at any time. You can feel that extra nice energy still lingering in the air. Very nice.

5
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:40,700
I wonder if y'all can feel it 26 years in the past. But let's jump to the present, even

6
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:46,980
though you're listening in the past. Hoo boy, this is confusing, y'all.

7
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:53,040
This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Atkull Underdash Saridwin, who tweeted about the

8
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:58,180
show and tagged that pretendin' pod. It's really that simple, y'all, and it makes ol'

9
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:01,340
Wolfie oh so happy. They write,

10
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:07,540
Hey guys, heard about this weird little game number called Coffee Punk. Apparently it's

11
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:15,240
about a bunch of punks on rollerblades stealing coffee from The Man. Go on over to At Neon

12
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:21,580
Dreams 8 on the Twitter and check him out. Well, I can't wait to strap on some blades

13
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:27,860
and roll roll roll away, but the only coffee I like is the kind that has been sittin' out

14
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:34,200
for way too long. The kind you microwave to heat back up, but you know it's never gonna

15
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,420
be the same. Something's changed inside of it. A darkness looms.

16
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:45,660
But anyway, it sounds like a damn blast. Go have fun stompin' on The Man and stealin'

17
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:52,260
all the coffee, ya punks. We make this show to feed our insatiable egos. If you've listened

22
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:24,900
This shit is gettin' outta hand, but really no quicker than reality. Strap in for a mood

23
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:31,340
killer, it's time for the news. James, the executive director of Calm Comfy Campground,

24
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:37,780
got inside the dreams or memories of our four PCs. Then they were in a bit of a canoe race.

25
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:42,580
The Grimes took the lead while Jack Russell had a mental break, leaving him and Bradley

26
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:48,700
Cooper at the back of the pack. But before that concluded, the four PCs and Alan Grimes

27
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:54,340
were standing in a seemingly infinite room full of shelves filled with audio cassettes.

28
00:02:54,340 --> 00:03:01,580
For some of our greener listeners here at 694.2 PTBP, an audio cassette is a physical

29
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:07,900
object made of plastic and polyester type plastic film with a magnetic coating. Most

30
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:15,100
of them hold between 46 and 120 minutes of audio. The names on these cassettes were those

31
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:22,700
of many politicians, CEOs, activists, journalists, religious figures, as well as a group consisting

32
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:29,620
of Charles Digby, Roger Fairfield, Alan Grimes, Walter Grimes, and Martin Cupertino. I'd say

33
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:34,940
it's about time for these PCs to wake the fuck up. Personally, one of my favorite things

34
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:38,980
in the morning times is dream girl with pretty sexual.

35
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:19,260
I pooped in my pants. So we got a comment on the question and answer

36
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:25,980
thread on the subreddit over at r slash pretending to be people on Reddit. And we had it up 109

37
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:32,100
days ago, but we recently got a comment that says the town only has one radio station and

38
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:36,620
it's DJ plays the same song over and over and over again. Does that contribute to the

39
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:43,180
town's low sanity? Does the station schedule include a top 40 show and is it no backbone

40
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:48,260
40 times? What is he talking about? Yeah. Wolf the dog.

41
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:51,420
He brings me a new song every day. Who is Wolf the dog?

42
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:55,700
EJV is a dope new song every time I hear him. Brand new premier.

43
00:04:55,700 --> 00:05:00,620
Did you hear last week he played no backbone? That was so tight. I can't wait to see what

44
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:05,980
you're up to. As soon as I heard it, I downloaded it. Yeah. You should go to Spotify. Check

45
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:13,140
out kudzu, a band that a Wolf, the dog just discovered last week and shared with us. Well,

46
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:18,060
let's not fail to mention the dream girl actual other song. So check out dream girl. Check

47
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:22,340
out someone still loves you. Boris yells, someone's on a couple episodes and that's

48
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:27,780
that band is Primo. We got blue false and to go. Oh yeah. That was a really good, those

49
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:32,220
are the, I think those are that arc. Oh, in that thread. Uh, yeah, I think in one of

50
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:37,700
the Patrion episodes I mentioned a band that I went on tour with free at last. They're

51
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:45,520
fine. Go listen to them. I, when I saw that, I, uh, hadn't listened to them in a long time

52
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:51,680
and, uh, went to their band camp and I forgot that the album artwork is pretty dope by an

53
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:57,800
artist from Ozark, Missouri named Tim Peacock who, uh, now works for the new Yorker. Oh

54
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:02,760
shit. Yeah, that's cool. It's a funny name. Tim Peacock. I like it. Yeah, it's good. From

55
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:15,040
Guadalajara. What? He's from Guadalajara. Oh, is that in Ozark? No, that's in Mexico. Right

56
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:25,600
next to the shitty little downtown they have downtown's. Okay. It's okay. It's not a downtown.

57
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:34,600
There's a town square. There's a bank, a courthouse. Um, there is a little placard that tells about

58
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:39,280
the time that they hung the bald numbers there. Oh, well those people were bad. Okay, so we

59
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:46,120
need to do a roll off. All people aren't bad. Hey, I hope not. What if I just become evil as

60
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:52,160
soon as I shave my head? You have been getting a lot more nefarious. Hey, quick question though.

61
00:06:52,160 --> 00:07:00,480
That's just cause I'm sadder. I liked my hair. Fucking judge me. I liked it too when it was

62
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:15,160
there. I just going back to the ball numbers. I ain't got no hair no more. Okay, so we need to do

63
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:20,200
a roll off and this is will matter for the game that we're playing. So you're all going to roll

64
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:28,120
off against each other against 50 and if you get under 50 pass and if you all pass, whoever rolls

65
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:35,200
lowest loses. How many rerolls do we get? Go through the rounds and if you, if you roll over

66
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:42,080
50 then whoever rolls highest overall will lose. So let's start with Thomas. We'll go around 32.

67
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:57,880
Oh, that's good. Luke. No, I'm saving my luck for me. 74. Oh, 74 Justin. 93. That's going to be

68
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:06,960
difficult. Yeah, you can do it. Get higher than a 93. It's a 49. All right. He is right on the

69
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:14,200
money. Best role and Justin had the worst role, so I'll keep that in mind moving forward for this

70
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:20,320
game. That sounds, he's just going to treat Justin a little worse. Wait, so mine was best

71
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:29,040
personally. Yeah. Well, I'm sad now. You're at the calm, comfy campgrounds. You should be,

72
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:34,920
how could you be anything? But wait, was that Justin rolling or Charlie Charles? It's a,

73
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:42,600
it was just a really great point. What is your name now again? Martin Scorsese. Martin Cupertino.

74
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:49,040
Cupertino. Okay. Cool, cool, cool. It's a really cool fake name to pair with Bradley Cooper. Are

75
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:56,000
we recording right now? I'm asking because you're getting up. I didn't know if you forgot

76
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:03,240
to precariously perched a glass right behind you. I'm going to go ahead and drink this mango orange

77
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:14,240
juice down so it doesn't spill. Where are we recording? Martin Cupertino wakes up. I need

78
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:27,520
you to roll a constitution check. Yes. Crit success. Critical success. 44 on a 55. You

79
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:36,440
feel so strange, like something within you has changed. Like Martin Cupertino is very aware of

80
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:42,960
how his engine runs. And you know, I didn't spend the last 15 years mastering Transcendental

81
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:49,040
Buddhism to not be in touch with my inner workings. But you have so much control that

82
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:56,120
you can keep down anything like strange or painful about how you feel currently. Like you feel almost

83
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:01,840
like, you know, when you're so hungry that you feel like you're going to like pass out. Yeah.

84
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:11,280
That's essentially how you feel. And you realize that your left arm is throbbing. And when you look

85
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:19,760
down, you see that you have a little bit of dried blood right in the crook of your elbow. Like I'd

86
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:25,320
been hooked up to a, like they were taking my blood. Something like that. Or an IV or something.

87
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:31,440
Yeah. Yeah. It left a little mark and you feel pretty weird. All right, Martin. Odds are you've

88
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,800
been drugged, but you've got your wits about you critically. I want to look around the room. Yeah,

89
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:41,840
did I wake up in my bedroom? Yeah, you did. Okay. So I mean, that's, that's all I want to know,

90
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:50,320
I guess. But I rolled 99. That's fantastic. What is this? Where am I? As you get ready,

91
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:57,320
how, what is your, what does your morning routine look like? Martin wakes up at like 4.30 AM. He

92
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:02,440
makes a smoothie. So when you go downstairs on your way to make your smoothie, did you put the

93
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:10,120
floorboard back? Yes. It is removed. You don't notice it and you kind of trip and your leg goes

94
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:17,720
into the hole. I need you to roll a D4. What? You just lose one hit point, but you like wang your

95
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:24,400
ankle to the point to where you have to, like, you can't walk quite normally. Well, that's okay. I'm

96
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:28,880
about to do my stretches. So probably work that out. Smoothie and stretches? Smoothie and stretches.

97
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:35,400
That's Martin's time. Does it feel like the right time of day for him to be waking up? It does. Okay.

98
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:41,160
Then about two minutes after he actually wakes up, his little digital watch starts beeping and he's

99
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:51,520
like, beat you again. Did this, uh, did this night of maybe not quite rest, uh, give you any? Well,

100
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:55,800
it's the last thing I remember being in the room with all the tapes. Vaguely, but it's almost like

101
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:01,680
that memory along with countless others are consistently swirling around in your head. Does

102
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:07,080
it feel more like I just woke up after my first day? Yeah. This place is weird. I want to do a

103
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:13,160
physical like inventory of myself. Okay. You said I feel weird. It looks like a needle's been in me.

104
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,840
Yeah. How do I feel weird? Do I feel like I've been drugged or anything? A little bit. Like,

105
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:23,800
uh, just a little hard to focus or a little out of it. Okay. So you remember how last night when

106
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:29,520
you were pulling up the floorboard and stuff, you were trying to think of how you got to calm,

107
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:35,080
comfy campground and it like tripped you out that you had no memory of even like the boat ride to

108
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:45,320
the Island or anything like that. Now you know full well that you have absolutely no memory of

109
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:51,840
getting here or even finding out about calm, comfy campground, all the memories of your friends

110
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:58,400
telling you that you needed to get help seem off in some strange way, how you found out about calm,

111
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:07,840
comfy campground. That memory itself is warped. Roll sanity. Critical success. 22. Wow. Yes. Yes.

112
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:15,440
Okay. So, uh, with that, uh, not only do you know that this is your second day at calm,

113
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,920
comfy campground, but you also know full well that it's not. Looks like the world's finally

114
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,680
catching up to the possibilities of my kind of thinking. I'll have to figure out what the,

115
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,040
what kind of time dilation device they've got going on here, but in my really helping

116
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:32,200
cube or something, you know, someone gets in a, an online game or really as I don't know,

117
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:36,760
I think it could be handy. You can make people work forever in a time where they're stuck.

118
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:47,480
He's hard. Is so the, the, the floorboard was open. Yeah. Was the stuff gone? Interestingly

119
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:52,880
enough, everything that you took out of the bag is still with you or where you put it,

120
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:57,360
but the bag itself is gone and everything you left in the bag is gone with it. So you

121
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,040
still have the cassettes and the map. I was listening to the episode and I completely

122
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,800
spaced the syringe that was in there. Do I feel like that's a possibility for what I

123
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:10,720
got injected with? I mean, I'd like to start looking around the corners of my room for cameras.

124
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:23,520
Okay. Yeah. Roll search 58 on a 20, even though you have this weird out of place memory of finding

125
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:30,120
out that you were being watched, you kind of think that maybe that memory is faulty because

126
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:37,840
there are no cameras in this cottage. Like turn my TV on, go for it. And flipping around and you

127
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:43,120
get normal channels. Interesting. Not as interesting as watching me presumably, but this is interesting.

128
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:48,160
I've never really watched TV. It's for weak minded individuals. There's a commercial for a

129
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:54,520
mattress place. Come on down to Leroy's mattresses. We got the finest place where you can put your

130
00:14:54,520 --> 00:15:06,200
head down on a bed. Sounds about right. I click it off. Walter, you wake up and Alan is looking

131
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:15,760
right at you. And he's like, how do you feel? Roll constitution. 21 on a 60. You feel fine,

132
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:23,200
but you know something with your system is wrong. And he grabs your arm and he holds it out. And you

133
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:29,640
see on the inside of your elbow pit, there's a little mark where some dried blood is there.

134
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:37,080
And he holds out his arm as well. And he's like, what is going on? Were you down all night? I,

135
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:45,440
the last thing I remember is, uh, well, I was in a canoe with you and then we were at like a,

136
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:50,560
Oh my God. We had to put the shelves, the metal shelves. Were we at a music store or no, we were,

137
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:56,280
we were with the, the floor was made of blight. It was like that scene in the matrix. Oh my God.

138
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:05,040
What was that? Were we there? Did you have that same dream? Is there any way for me to do a

139
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:10,040
systems check on myself by rolling constitution, which you already did. So you know that something

140
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:20,240
is off, but I can't like have like a printout. No, but you do know that something, something is

141
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:28,200
strange because those memories that are part of your dreams, maybe with Alan having the same

142
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:34,600
dream, you, you, you start to realize maybe, Oh fuck, this isn't, this isn't the second day that

143
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:41,560
you've been to calm, comfy campground. It's not the second day. Something is, but linear timeline

144
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:51,480
should tell me that it should be the second day. Yeah. Roll sanity. Ought one. Holy shit. Verified.

145
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:58,840
I don't, my computer doesn't work that way, so I'm not freaked out. I am alarmed though. Yeah.

146
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:05,200
Can I do a medicine or something like for not first, maybe medicine to feel Alan's pulse and

147
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:12,320
see if his heart rate is normal and see if do like a overall check to see if the not armpit,

148
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:19,440
but elbow pit is the only thing off. Oh yeah. Yeah. You can. Oh yes. Yes. Please, please give me

149
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:28,680
up. Give me a physical and you guys can take your time. 89. Oh yeah. I had three. Yes. Yes,

150
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:36,440
of course. So Alan Grimes just begins looking high and low through this cottage. He's like,

151
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:42,720
someone must have been in here. I have an idea. And I go over to the television and start scrolling

152
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:49,440
through channels. Um, when I turn it on, is it still tuned into, um, Bradley Cooper, Martin

153
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:54,840
Cupertino? No, it is not. What is it on when I turn it on? It's on Price is Right. Okay.

154
00:17:54,840 --> 00:18:07,320
But I'm on stage is a bookshelf, a TV stand with a brand new television and, um, some leather

155
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:17,040
couches. Sure. Uh, uh, lazy boys. Yeah. 37 59. And then I start scrolling through. Yeah. And as you

156
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:22,120
scroll through, you find just completely normal channels that you get like right outside the

157
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:29,760
city. But when you come back to wheel of fortune, it pops up 37 50 prices, right? Yes. Sorry. I

158
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:35,760
thought you were saying the price was right, which it was 37 59. You said, well, you would have gone

159
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:44,240
over. Yes. I hear that now. No, I said 37 59. That's that's what pops up. Cause I know I've

160
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:52,320
studied catalogs. Um, anyway, so I can't find any security footage. No, no longer here. Oh, you,

161
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:57,840
you booked for cameras about how many channels are there? Like just average. Okay. I want to do a

162
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:04,880
search role to see if there's a camera in our cabin. Yeah, for sure. A neural search pass with

163
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:15,440
a six on a 36. I think I wrote over that without erasing it. So, and I'm going to add seven. Nice.

164
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:22,240
So as you're looking around, not only do you find more than one camera, you find like four cameras,

165
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:27,400
all posted up in different rooms. You find microphones. Are they like hidden? Like,

166
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:32,680
yes. Supposed to be discreet. Yes. They are quite discreet. And you find microphones hidden in

167
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:40,840
different objects around the rooms. And you also find a shoe print that is quite small,

168
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:47,600
like muddy footprint or like dirt, something. I'm going to, and it is at the front door. When

169
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:54,240
I find those, I'm going to keep them in place as to not arouse suspicion. Sure. Go ahead and

170
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,920
roll stealth to see if you can like find them without, if someone was watching what they

171
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:05,000
realized. Damn. I'm rolling good today. Four on a, I assume 30. Yeah. Yeah. So you can,

172
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:12,160
Adam. Oh, hell yeah. So you can see all of those different cameras and microphones without the

173
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:17,920
cameras and microphones realizing. Okay. I'm immediately going to go over to Alan and non

174
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:29,240
verbally, like he's pointing. Sorry. This is an audio medium. I point at like where the cameras

175
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:34,760
are. Yeah. And I point at like where the microphones are. And I, you do it in a way that

176
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:43,640
is very discreet. Yeah. But to convey, yeah. So I, oh my gosh. What, what do you want per

177
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:49,400
pool? It's pretty nice outside today. Maybe we should take a walk. I think that's a very good

178
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:55,800
idea. Okay. We go outside and yeah, we get five or six steps away from the front door and I'm like,

179
00:20:55,800 --> 00:21:01,680
what is, what is going on here? I have no idea. This is, this is untenable. I, how, how did you

180
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:10,680
find this place? Why? I know why we came here, but how did you find this particular place? Did

181
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:21,120
you use your AOL CD rom? Oh, hell yeah. Alan rolled some dice for sanity, failed miserably.

182
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:28,240
Oh, Oh no. Walter, Walter, the more that I go back into my mind, the more that I'm realizing,

183
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:34,400
I don't think that. Do you remember? Do you remember coming here? He's got his hands on his

184
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:40,280
head and he's looking at you with massive eyes. Do you, do you remember coming to this Island?

185
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:50,800
I, well, we would have had to get here when he showed us that the first thing I remember is that

186
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:56,560
we were just standing at the, on the Island and we walked up the, we walked up the pathway. I

187
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:05,000
assumed maybe I was shut down for the ride here. And then you woke me up when, when we got here.

188
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:12,640
Oh, I, I can't even, I saw an ad. I thought I saw an ad, but when I go back to that memory,

189
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:18,560
I, I, the ad for calm company campground, it's all swirling. It's all, it's all a part of the

190
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:24,480
same. Oh, the memory is, and you just see his head kind of hang. And it's the first time you've seen

191
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:41,280
your father without full confidence in himself. That freaks me out. Oh my God. My computer

192
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:48,760
doesn't compute. This just doesn't make much sense. I, so in the dream, well, I don't know

193
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:57,320
if it was a dream or not. If we were actually there when, when I saw Brad piece of shit's name

194
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:05,400
is Martin. When we saw him on the television, he had tapes from there. Do you think he's part of

195
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:16,160
it? I won't dismiss that idea. He might be part of it. And Jack, Jack Russell, we can't trust him

196
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:23,040
either. Can we Walter look at me and he gets very serious and he puts his hands on your shoulders.

197
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:33,680
We can't trust anyone except for each other. A little bit in the back of my mind tells me

198
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:45,920
I can't trust him either because of, you know, when he tried to sell me, but I say, right,

199
00:23:45,920 --> 00:24:08,000
we can only trust each other. I spent so much time thinking about how that bad memory thing

200
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:15,480
would work out that I forgot that I'd had to role play this character more just pass that. Oh yeah.

201
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:22,040
I have to think on my feet as Roger still. Well, Roger Fairfield wakes up with the book of flora

202
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:34,520
and fauna on his chest. I need you to roll a constitution check. I pass a nine on a 70. You

203
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:41,560
feel super fucking weird. Like something is off with your body. Like you are a very particular

204
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:48,200
person. You know how you feel. Something is wrong and your arm hurts. And when you look down,

205
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:55,480
there is a little bit of dried blood, like a little mark of dried blood right in the pit of

206
00:24:55,480 --> 00:25:03,080
your elbow. Interesting. Is it daytime? It's morning and you can hear Angela in the kitchen.

207
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:08,680
Do I remember things that happened? But all those memories are swirling around. Like

208
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:16,600
they feel like a dream, but they also felt so real. And with everything that's happened,

209
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:28,360
go ahead and roll sanity. I pass a 57 on a 60. You can put it out of your mind enough,

210
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:36,840
but something inside of you tells you that this is not your second day at calm, comfy campground.

211
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:45,480
Breakfast is ready. And the door pops open to the study. She's like, you slept in here all night.

212
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:53,880
I guess so. I guess I dozed off. Are you feeling okay?

213
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:57,880
Yeah. Bright and early. Ready to go. Time to work on ourselves.

214
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:04,440
Yeah. Yeah. You didn't dream about anything?

215
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:10,120
Do you really want to hear? I guess. Okay. So it was crazy. I was standing in the supermarket

216
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:16,200
and everything on the shelves was made out of styrofoam. It was so terrible. You know

217
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,520
how I have that thing with styrofoam? Sure.

218
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:27,000
It just pains me to no end. And I just had to go shopping for some reason. And I kept grabbing

219
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:33,000
stuff and it just made my spine hurt. Zach, I was in character. I was asking Angela.

220
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:39,240
Okay. That's my bad. I fucking hate styrofoam. Yeah, he does.

221
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:44,360
It gives me a physical negative tick. So we went out to brunch one morning

222
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:48,200
and I got a to-go box and I was carving my name into the top of it.

223
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:51,640
You're just saying that. And I thought I was killing you.

224
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:55,160
I didn't know. Maybe Thomas yelled, stop, you're killing him.

225
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,920
And I realized, oh shit, that's a real phobia you got.

226
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:07,560
It's so bad. It's part of the inside of me. It's been happening forever. And I did theater

227
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:15,080
in high school and a lot of high school theater sets are made using a lot of styrofoam. And one

228
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:23,720
day I was walking through the wings backstage and this massive, probably 10 by 10 foot sheet

229
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:30,680
of styrofoam was laying on the ground and people were hanging up another equally sized sheet and

230
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:39,000
they dropped it and it floated down. Oh God, just saying it. It floated down and it landed perfectly

231
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:43,720
to where it slid across the top. Oh my God.

232
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:47,560
I literally fell on the ground and just convulsed a little bit.

233
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:51,080
I don't have this phobia at all, but that kind of got me a little bit. That's a weird

234
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:57,560
sensation I can picture. God, I hate it. Fuck. I actually played in a Pathfinder game with our

235
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:04,920
friend Andy and he was running the game and it was a horror Pathfinder game. And he asked Taylor,

236
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:14,920
what would fuck me up? And she told him. And so when the really creepy thing happened in the game,

237
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:19,080
from underneath the table, he just pulled out two pieces of styrofoam and rubbed them together.

238
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:26,120
It hurt me to the point to where he apologized. Yeah, right. Shot through your spine.

239
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:35,560
But it was good. It was good GMing. Anyway, so that's my dream. It was wild. I don't even know

240
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:41,800
what it means. You didn't dream about the lake at all, did you?

241
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:48,760
No, I know it's kind of weird, but no, I kind of think the Blackwater is cool looking.

242
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:58,600
Yeah, I thought that too. I'm going to get in the shower and I'll meet you, I guess,

243
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:03,640
outside. When's the first? What do we do next? Are we meeting with somebody?

244
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:07,800
She grabs a piece of paper and she's like, yeah, we need to be at the main house next,

245
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,280
coming up pretty soon. So you have time to shower. It's all good.

246
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,480
Okay. I'll meet you outside, I guess. Roll alertness as you go to the shower.

247
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:24,360
I pass another nine on a 40. As you're still in the study before,

248
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:29,560
she turns back and goes back to the kitchen and you notice that the window in this study

249
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:38,200
was definitely closed and locked last night when you went to sleep. And it's definitely cracked

250
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:46,760
open a little bit right now. And on the windowsill, there's a hair tie with some dark brown hair.

251
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:50,200
Not Angela's hair? Not Angela's hair.

252
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:54,760
A hair tie. Okay. So Roger can discern that it's not her hair on site?

253
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:57,240
On site. Okay. I'm going to hold it up. Angela,

254
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:01,320
did you have a friend over or something? What's going on with this?

255
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:05,400
She comes back into the room and is like, what? What? I just found it over by the window.

256
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:09,880
Did somebody come in last night? And her hair is just this

257
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:18,360
flowing mane of curly hair. And she's like, well, I, as you well know, don't live my life

258
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:23,000
with my hair up. I know. I know. I like that.

259
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,880
No, that's weird. What? Would someone? I guess it could have been somebody who

260
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:31,400
stayed here from the last time. Oh, yeah. Last week. For sure.

261
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:35,240
I think they do this like every weekend probably. It's weird that the window, I could have sworn.

262
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,640
Okay. Are you okay?

263
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:44,360
Yeah. I just, I had a, I just had a rough night. I guess I should've, I shouldn't have fallen asleep

264
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:48,280
in that chair. That's probably what did it. Yeah. Yeah.

265
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,920
Okay. And she pops back out. Cool.

266
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:54,360
Yeah. I'm going to go to a shower and meet her up front.

267
00:30:54,360 --> 00:31:00,600
She's going to skip to the big house. Oh, okay.

268
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,920
Oh no. Not like. I thought she was going to skip.

269
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:09,320
I'm going to get drunk. It doesn't matter. No, she's just going to skip to the Lou.

270
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,080
Nice. My darling.

271
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,880
She stopped skipping and explodes.

272
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:27,000
Roll scene. You're following her and she's skipping ahead a little bit.

273
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:34,120
And as you guys are approaching the main house, there's a big like wrap around porch on this

274
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:38,600
hexagonal building in the middle that you like walked up the stairs to go through the main door

275
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:45,080
and standing up there is James wearing the same white dress shirt as yesterday.

276
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:52,760
Maybe not the same one keeping the uniform and next to him is a young girl seems to be

277
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:57,160
10, 11, 12, somewhere in there. And she's got pigtails.

278
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:08,520
And as they see Angela and Roger Fairfield walking up, the little girl gets a big smile

279
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:14,040
on her face and runs off the porch. Go ahead and roll human for me.

280
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:21,160
Fail. 67 on a 10.

281
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:33,320
You notice nothing as this little girl comes running up and she is going Anne, Anne, Anne

282
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:39,880
with a big smile on her face and runs up and tries to give Angela Fairfield a hug.

283
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,840
How does she react? I don't think I would stop it or anything.

284
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:48,040
Get away from my wife, child. That's my wife.

285
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:58,120
And Angela backs up and is like, Oh, hi, I'm, I'm Angela. It's what's your name? And the

286
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:03,080
girl looks up at her confused. It's like, I'm a Maggie.

287
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:17,960
Fuck you, Zach. Can I, is, uh, is, can I tell this girl and with her hair,

288
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:22,520
can I compare it to the hair tie I saw in my room? Is it probably her hair tie?

289
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:27,480
And I think it's probably hair time. Holy shit. Yeah. There's lots of people named

290
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:41,720
Maggie, I guess. Have you ever had a hit of just the mango nectar that you can get in like the

291
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:46,760
bottle? It's weird that it's called have you seen, I have gotten a hit of the mango nectar.

292
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:55,960
It's just the fruit with water in it. It's the nectar of the mango.

293
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:59,320
You heard what I said, Justin. Gross.

294
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:04,280
The nectar of the man go all over the place.

295
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:15,480
Charles Digby. You wake up staring. Who? Who me? You wake up staring at the walkie

296
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:18,840
talkie on your nightstand. Roll constitution.

297
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:27,240
That is a no, no pass. You feel fucking terrible. Yeah.

298
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:35,480
Terrible to the point to where you feel, Oh God, what? Oh, in your arm, like all over you feel

299
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:40,920
weird, but your arm specifically hurts. And when you look down at it, you see that on the inside

300
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:47,560
of your elbow, there's a little bit of dried blood and there's a slight bruise around it.

301
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:56,680
And you feel as if you may have been drugged. Oh, Oh yeah. Like a, like the syringe entrance

302
00:34:56,680 --> 00:35:00,600
and you feel woozy. Oh no. I need you to roll sanity. Okay.

303
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:10,600
Uh, 19 with the pass, whether I have a 10 sand in those memories

304
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:15,880
from last night, they're still swirling around, but you can kind of push them down

305
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:24,040
enough to not dwell on them too hard. But at the same time you have this investigators sensation.

306
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:26,920
Something's awry. Not only is something awry,

307
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:34,840
but this is not your second day at calm comfy campground. Oh, what day is it? You have no idea,

308
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:44,520
but this is not normal. Those memories, they might be real. They might not be, but you don't

309
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:50,520
feel like you just arrived here. Yeah. Is the walkie talkie on? It still is on. Can I like

310
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:55,720
get a little like, hello, hello, like click into it or I can, I don't use a walkie talkie in real

311
00:35:55,720 --> 00:36:02,280
life, but you just click the button and you talk into it. Yeah. Hello. Is, is anyone here? Radio

312
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:09,640
silence. Okay. So get dressed, slide that walkie talkie in my back pocket. Roll alertness.

313
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:19,160
Pass. 48 on a 70. When you went to grab the walkie talkie to use it, you realize that it's

314
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:24,440
been moved. Like it's still on your nightstand where it was, but it's not it. Maybe it's like

315
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:29,560
you sat it there when you were in bed, but when you woke up, it was just out of reach,

316
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:34,840
like on the far side and you had it on the closer side. Don't like that.

317
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:41,160
Can I roll like a search to see if anything else is a mess in here from when I went to sleep,

318
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:44,840
anything else I would notice or is that really the only go ahead and roll search. Okay.

319
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:56,040
36 70. Yes. All right. So as you're like getting ready and stuff, you realize that

320
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:04,200
the front door, you locked it last night. You're positive it's unlocked. Fuck. I'm starting to get

321
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:10,040
antsy, but also kind of like keep my cool. I'll pop open the front door and kind of like,

322
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:15,160
as soon as you open the front door, you see the bell boy is standing there with his hand up. Like

323
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:20,760
he was about to knock on the door and I'm just like, Oh, Oh, what, what crazy timing. Did you

324
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:26,840
see me coming? What's going on? Hey, hi, hi, Mr. Digby. Right. Yeah. That that's me. I just

325
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:31,240
wondering if you've seen Jack Russell, the boat man. You met him last night. Have you seen him

326
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:36,760
around this morning? Have you been, I haven't been out of my cottage since I woke up. I just

327
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:41,960
woke up just now. Oh, okay. Sorry. Oh, late riser there. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Well,

328
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:47,800
uh, no big deal. Not an issue, but, uh, you know, he's not in his apartment, so, uh,

329
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:53,160
maybe just holler. Let us know when you come up. You'll be at the main house soon for another

330
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:58,280
meeting. So yeah. Yeah. If I see anything, I'll, I'll let you guys know. Okay. Thanks. I'll be on

331
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:05,480
my way. Slam the door. Like what the fuck is happening when you turn around? You hear,

332
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:12,280
we'll use that search roll and roll it over. You hear heavy breathing from underneath your feet.

333
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:19,160
Oh God. Is it wood floor? Yeah. I like kind of skip back almost like I'm like trying to

334
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:23,560
Dodge something that isn't there, but I'm like jump in the air and jump back. Is it like following me

335
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:28,920
or is it still where, where the sound was emanating from? That's where it was. Hello.

336
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:34,040
It is someone down there and I kind of like knock on the wood. Roll search again.

337
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:41,000
Ooh, a nine on a 70. Yeah. You can definitely hear that someone's down there, but they're not

338
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,320
responding. You can roll persuade if you want to try to like persuade them to talk to you.

339
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:49,960
Yeah. I'm going to be like, Hey, don't be afraid. I'm here. Like, cause I know something fucked

340
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:53,400
up is happening. So I might be worried that something fucked up is happening to this person.

341
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:06,040
A crit success. 44 on a 50. Can I trust you? Jack? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, as much as you can

342
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:13,080
trust anyone. I'll take it. And one of the floorboards pops up and then another one pops

343
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:21,560
up and he climbs up out of the floor beneath you. Hey, um, and he looks like absolute shit.

344
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:27,960
He's like sweating profusely and his face is pale white. Yeah. Digby. Right. Charles. Yeah.

345
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:32,360
That's that's me. You're a, what did they tell me? You were, you're some kind of investigator,

346
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:38,440
right? Yeah. Yeah. I trust you. You know what the fuck is going on? I have no idea. I have this.

347
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:43,800
I take out the walkie talk. I have this. Is that yours? What, what is some, some little

348
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:51,320
girl or something? Talk to me on here at one point last night. And then I fell asleep and I had all

349
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:56,920
these fucked up dreams. You were there. What were we doing? We were on the canoes on the water,

350
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:02,840
escaping something. I don't, I don't understand something fucked up and creepy. And then out of

351
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:09,640
nowhere, we snapped into this white led room with tapes everywhere. Oh, you've been to the tape

352
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:17,320
room. Yeah. I know your name was on all these tapes. There's hundreds of your name. That

353
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:24,120
explains a lot. My memory is shot right now. It's all split and twine with each other. It's all

354
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:31,400
coming up on its own ends and flipping around inside my brain. And then there's this and I

355
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:36,760
show him my arm with like the bruise. What looks like maybe I got my blood taken or something

356
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:45,080
drugged. He looks super happy and he holds up his arm. Oh mate. He reaches back down into the floor

357
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:50,680
and pulls out a duffel bag and rummages around through there and grabs a syringe out. And he's

358
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:55,720
like, I didn't do that to you, mate. I know I didn't, but I did do it to me. What is this?

359
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:01,160
It's an inoculation. And he keeps his voice down and then he immediately realizes

360
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:06,280
and he starts looking around at the corners of the room. Can I look too,

361
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,680
to see if I see like a camera placement? Yeah, roll search.

362
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:17,320
Nope. Fail. He gets really close to you and he's like, stop looking. They might be watching.

363
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:22,120
Okay. I kind of stare at my feet a little bit. Let's get, ah, fuck. We gotta,

364
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:29,480
we gotta get out of here. But I, oh shit, shit, shit. Do you mind if I hide out here?

365
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:34,120
If you feel safer here, stay here. Are you going to fucking tell me? Are you a snitch?

366
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:38,440
No, no, no, no, no. Something, something bad is happening to all of us here.

367
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:42,920
I couldn't agree more. I don't know what it is, but we, we need to find out.

368
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:47,720
Scream. The room explodes.

369
00:41:55,880 --> 00:42:02,760
You're all sitting in the meeting room that you had orientation in and it is Roger Fairfield,

370
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:07,560
Angela Fairfield, Charles Digby, Mark Bradley Cooper, and,

371
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:17,960
and Walter and Alan Grimes are all sitting there and the door opens and James comes in and he's

372
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:23,560
like, Hey, um, real quick. Do you mind if I borrow you for just a moment, Angela, if you wouldn't

373
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:28,360
mind coming on out here, I need to have a word. Is everything all right? Don't worry. It'll be

374
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:33,880
fine. Uh, yeah, no, it's, uh, it's not a big deal. We just need to, Hey Angela, are you really his

375
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:43,400
wife? Real human fail. He seems fine. And the explanation that he gives is valid.

376
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:52,040
All right, have fun. Do they remember the reveal about Martin? Yep. He's going to act like they

377
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:58,920
don't. I, yeah, I kind of want to like look and kind of be like, do you guys sleep okay?

378
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:07,560
Roger perks up a little. I didn't really. Do you think maybe we all had a shared dream of some

379
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:14,840
kind last night? I that's entirely possible. Walter, tell them, was it the cassette cases?

380
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:24,760
Was it the canoes as well? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I also had those dreams. Do you guys have,

381
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:35,000
and he like reaches out his arms. So does Roger injected. Would your wife with you? I asked if

382
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:40,120
she had any weird dreams and she did, but they weren't ours. Did you look at her arm?

383
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:49,320
You dumb son of a bitch. I didn't, I didn't need to look at her arm because

384
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:57,960
I saw yesterday. What do you mean? What do you mean? She already, she already had a mark on her

385
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:03,240
arm yesterday. I hadn't seen it before. I asked her about it. She told me it was, she and I,

386
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:07,000
we travel overseas often. We have to get vaccinations. She told me it was a reaction

387
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:12,200
to a vaccination, but I didn't have that reaction. Did she have it? Are you saying before you got to

388
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:17,880
the campground? I mean, I noticed it when we got here. Yeah. That's weird. Do you guys all remember

389
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:24,360
that I'm a billionaire? We knew, we knew that you were a villain. We did not know that you

390
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:32,360
were a billionaire. Now maybe you'll treat me with the proper respect. Oh shit. You can tell

391
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:38,520
by the look on Alan's face that he won't. I mean, the thought of don't forget that we,

392
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:42,760
a man like Alan thinking anything about me, that doesn't move Martin.

393
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:49,720
Even if you think that his son is a mechanical boy. Oh, I don't care what he thinks. I'm going

394
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:59,880
to steal his son and deconstruct him at my factory. Walter, Walter says, don't forget

395
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:05,560
that we can check your movements on our television. Yeah. Well, good luck with that. Is it all of us?

396
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:10,200
Is it every, every cabin? I didn't see anything on my TV. I checked this morning. I also didn't

397
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:19,320
find any cameras. I look at Alan and I, um, no, no, no, no, no, no. Listen, I've been practicing

398
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:25,480
martial arts my entire adult life. We saw you do it in your bedroom the other night. I know

399
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:31,480
I'm basically the wind. So if I want to be unseen, you're not going to see me understand.

400
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:39,080
Did any of you, well, I was going to ask if you found cameras in your cabins, but I did. I think

401
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:47,320
we know the answer. I just told you that I looked for cameras and didn't find one. I did not look

402
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:53,800
for cameras. So there could be Roger. We found cameras in our cabin. Who's got your channel?

403
00:45:53,800 --> 00:46:05,400
Who's got our channel? Which one of you has our channel? Alan, I have something to tell you.

404
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:11,880
You're not actually Alan. I brought you here with me. You're a secret government project

405
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:16,040
from the late seventies. You're a clone of Donald duck and Richard Nixon.

406
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:20,680
Father is that, is that,

407
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:29,720
is that mostly I'll keep you around for my own amusement. Is that true? That would explain why

408
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:35,240
we don't remember arriving here. I'm just fucking with them. Do you guys remember arriving?

409
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:43,320
No, no, I just, I know I lost a little sanity when I thought about it in a manner of speaking.

410
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:47,080
I'm kind of like freaking out a little bit now, realizing I don't actually remember

411
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:56,120
saying for you, Roger Fairfield, who didn't realize that he didn't know how we got here.

412
00:46:56,680 --> 00:47:00,520
Of course I know how we got here. We came up the

413
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:12,600
fail. Oh, you got a 97. I got a 94 dice. The two of you know innately inside of you that

414
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:20,760
you have absolutely no memory of being on your way here or even a boat ride to get to this island.

415
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:27,160
You have no fucking clue how you got here. Do we lose sanity? Good question.

416
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:33,320
Shut the fuck up, man. Dude, don't fucking tell him who's dead.

417
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:38,520
Listen guys, this might not be great news necessarily from your perspectives, but I think,

418
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:43,000
I think something to keep in mind, we saw the names of a lot of famous people on those tapes,

419
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:48,440
people who've gone out into the world and done things presumably after they've been here.

420
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:53,720
So, you know, just try to keep your head on straight and hopefully we'll get out of this.

421
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:56,920
Why did you guys come here? To work on my shit.

422
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:58,440
Yeah. It was that.

423
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:02,600
It was Angela's idea. She thought it would be good for our marriage.

424
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:07,480
Do you remember when she posed the idea to you to come here?

425
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:13,480
Yeah. I mean, we, we had a fight. She said that this would help us.

426
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:19,880
That memory begins swirling around and it feels just as distant and confusing

427
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:24,920
as being in the canoes or being in the room with all the shelves.

428
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:31,880
Wow. You, huh, seem to start becoming pale. What is happening?

429
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:43,000
It looks like you have like an eyelash in your eye.

430
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:46,440
Quick, put a spoon in his mouth.

431
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:50,360
You're not supposed to do that anymore.

432
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:52,440
I thought it was a wallet.

433
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:53,240
I put a wallet.

434
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,880
Well, most people have a wallet. Not many people have spoons.

435
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:01,000
Not in general, just on them traditionally.

436
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:06,600
Bradley Cooper's wallet wouldn't fit inside of someone's because you're a villionaire.

437
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:08,040
Oh my God.

438
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:10,600
Billionaire. Say it.

439
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:12,680
Billionaire.

440
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:13,480
That's right.

441
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:14,040
Yeah.

442
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:16,200
I show you my slim wallet. All cards.

443
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:26,040
I look over at Roger. Do you think your wife has left you here to escape or should we try to

444
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:27,000
escape?

445
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:32,440
That's, that's a good point. Uh, Oh God, James, James is probably in on whatever this is that's

446
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:38,520
happening to us. And she's alone with him right now. Roger's going to stand up and start walking

447
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:39,000
to the door.

448
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,120
Roger, wait, wait.

449
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:41,000
Hold on. We need to think.

450
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:41,400
Your wife.

451
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:42,680
Those tapes.

452
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:44,840
She wasn't with us.

453
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:47,800
They didn't, they didn't get, get, they didn't get to her.

454
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:51,400
Do you remember your life with Angela before coming here?

455
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:52,840
Sure. Of course.

456
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:53,720
Roll sanity.

457
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:58,200
Quit asking Jovia remembers things.

458
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,600
We just sit in this room for the next 20 minutes, getting Joe down to zero.

459
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:05,160
I pass.

460
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:09,800
And do you love her and is she?

461
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:12,920
And what is actually, how'd you guys meet?

462
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:13,880
What's your middle name?

463
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:16,440
Okay. So you're a human. Like you are dead.

464
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:20,200
Yeah. I passed my sanity rule. So yeah. Uh, yeah, of course I remember her.

465
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:26,680
Right. When Roger gets up, I look at Alan wanting to follow after Roger, but I,

466
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:28,360
what kind of a look do I get from Alan?

467
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:34,600
Uh, wide-eyed and confused. He is still wondering if he is a Silicon Valley project created

468
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:35,480
by Bradley Cooper.

469
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:37,800
You'll never know.

470
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:45,000
I go over to, um, Alan, I reach under his chin and press up.

471
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,120
Oh, that's my tongue.

472
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:47,480
I think that you're okay.

473
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:51,320
I go over to the robot boy and I do the same thing.

474
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:58,200
My like Husky blue eye, blue gray eyes, black.

475
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:01,720
And I am still.

476
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:04,280
Luke, take off your headphones and plug up those ears.

477
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:07,240
I found the factory reset on this freak.

478
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:10,040
I think Rogers freaked out. What the fuck?

479
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:13,720
Don't you remember from the dream? He's a mechanical boy.

480
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:16,440
That was an idea you floated out of fucking insanity.

481
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:19,800
That's not a real thing that could happen that the boy copped to.

482
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:24,120
Hey guys, he just closes his eyes. They don't go black.

483
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:29,480
Oh, so, okay. Rewind.

484
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:33,960
Sorry. Oh, I was mistaken.

485
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:37,320
Look, he's just closing really hard. He is a little freak.

486
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:40,440
Maybe this kid's not as smart as I thought. He might not be.

487
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:42,280
I knew he wasn't a mechanical boy.

488
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:45,480
Trust me. We're working on that though.

489
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:49,160
Maybe, maybe, maybe touch his chin again.

490
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:50,600
Yeah. Turn him, turn back on.

491
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:51,720
Do it in person.

492
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:53,160
Somebody else can do that if they want it.

493
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:53,720
It's quiet.

494
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:56,520
Oh, Alan, Alan will do it. Yeah. Alan immediately.

495
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:58,760
Like after you, as you guys are having this conversation, he's like, well,

496
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:02,120
don't talk about my son. And he clicks underneath your chin.

497
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:06,040
Alan pulls his finger away from underneath your chin.

498
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:07,480
You back with us, bud?

499
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:10,600
I instinctively punch Martin.

500
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:13,480
Okay. That's going to be contested because he's some martial arts expert.

501
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:16,440
All right. Unarmed combat.

502
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,440
34 on a 40.

503
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:23,800
75 on a 70.

504
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:31,480
He's not expecting it from this like, from this deactivated robot boy.

505
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:33,240
So as soon as I'm back.

506
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:33,960
Roll a D4.

507
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:38,520
Yeah, that's going to be easy.

508
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:39,560
That's a four.

509
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:40,920
No, I meant to give you the other dice.

510
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:46,200
You punch him in the throat.

511
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,040
As soon as I do it,

512
00:52:57,080 --> 00:53:01,560
as soon as I do it, I, I do it and I withdraw my hand.

513
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:06,600
And then immediately I put my hand on his shoulder and I am not supposed to do that.

514
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:07,960
I am not supposed to do that.

515
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:10,280
Yeah. You're violating your prime directive kid.

516
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:23,160
I am so sorry. And I get your fucking hand off me.

517
00:53:31,560 --> 00:54:01,160
Hey.

518
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:05,160
This is real life.

519
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:18,200
No matter how high you look on me, I think that you could fall.

520
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:25,240
I knew I'd make you believe.

521
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:59,880
I'd leave you all without me.

522
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:09,320
Well, oh well, how you doin'?

523
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:13,080
Now I think you could follow me.

524
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:18,680
Cornered, room in at least right.

525
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:28,680
Cornered, room in at least right.

526
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:58,680
Cornered, room in at least right.

527
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:28,680
Cornered, room in at least right.
