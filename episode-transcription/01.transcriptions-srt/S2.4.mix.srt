1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,580
Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:06,140
It's your moon howling and scowling

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:10,320
Puparoni with the side of extra cheese wolf the dog

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,520
The moistest DJ this side of the solar highway

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:20,140
And I am a-wooing at you live from 694.2 PTBP

6
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:23,080
The greatest radio station that ever did

7
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:27,000
Now let's move on to the greatest things y'all ever did

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,740
Write me fan mail

9
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:33,820
This week's Howlin with Wolf is from at black goat underscore M10

10
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:37,980
Who instagrammed about the show and tagged at pretending pod

11
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,700
What a super cool way to let your friends know you're a freak

12
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:42,660
He writes

13
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,660
Greetings Mr. Wolf

14
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:48,140
Pretty new listener and first time howler here

15
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:49,240
Great show

16
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:52,780
I've not really been into RPGs before

17
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:57,420
But I really enjoy the gang's escapades and contention in the city

18
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:58,940
Keep up the good work

19
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:01,820
Big shout out to Victor for sending me your way

20
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:06,180
Appreciative howls from Mattias in Sweden

21
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,500
Mattias

22
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,180
Are you telling me that THE Victor sent you?

23
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:13,060
What did he tell you?

24
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:15,340
Who do you work for?

25
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:16,420
Mattias

26
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:18,380
You're on thin ice buddy

27
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:20,500
And you better watch your back

28
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,340
And you tell Victor

29
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:24,700
Tell him that Wolf says

30
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,260
Hello

31
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,100
If you want to write up something for your wolf to howl

32
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,540
Tag at pretending pod on twitter

33
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:34,940
Tag at pretending pod on instagram like Mattias

34
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:38,300
Or tag at pretending to be people on facebook

35
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:42,900
Wolf and his producer haven't spent a single dime on advertising

36
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:46,460
So y'all all here because of words in mouths

37
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:47,900
Or words in posts

38
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,260
Or words in comment sections

39
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:52,980
The point is words are powerful

40
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:57,060
Please use yours to share this show with your friends

41
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,340
Your co-workers

42
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,900
Your grandparents

43
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,540
And step-cousins

44
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:04,980
And as a reward for your sharing I'll do two things

45
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:08,540
One, I might choose you to submit a howling with Wolf

46
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:14,220
And two, I might and definitely always do put the links in the show notes

47
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:19,740
And while you're posting on them socials about 694.2 PTBP

48
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:24,260
Keep them ear holes open and receiving my dulcet tones

49
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,900
It's time for the news

50
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,300
Last time the field team at City Action News

51
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:34,940
Showed the good people of TikTok a glimpse into the calzone

52
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:39,500
On their way to a potential story from a woman named Kaylee Silver

53
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:43,380
What they found was the scene of a gruesome homicide

54
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:45,860
After watching footage from the Furbo

55
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:49,180
It's clear that Kaylee Silver walked over to her fridge

56
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,340
Cracked a beer

57
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,540
And her friend Kaylee Gold's head

58
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:55,340
Unnaturally snapped toward the kitchen

59
00:02:55,340 --> 00:03:00,820
Before this differently dispositioned Kaylee Gold lunged at the apartments resident

60
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,100
Kaylee Silver

61
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,540
The attack took place out of view

62
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:06,420
Behind the kitchen counter

63
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:10,740
But it seems Kaylee Silver stabbed her friend repeatedly in the neck

64
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,500
With her broken beer bottle

65
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:16,140
Until Kaylee Gold's head was all but decapitated

66
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,140
Thankfully for this story

67
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:20,700
The can crew called the city cops

68
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,980
Made statements

69
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:26,060
And headed off to cleanse their palates with a drink at the foundry

70
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:29,220
Taking us there now is a bop that don't stop

71
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,020
Good shit that don't quit

72
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:33,260
An anthem for the handsome

73
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,940
It's Alter Girl with

74
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:38,620
My Life is Great and It's All My Fall

75
00:03:48,140 --> 00:04:04,060
My Life is Great and It's All My Fall

76
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,460
Also why would we do a season one name?

77
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,780
Everyone from season one is dead to this podcast, Luke.

78
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:22,780
We are moving on. This is season two.

79
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:26,540
Dude, Thomas, ask me anything about season one.

80
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,700
What's season one?

81
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:31,220
I don't remember.

82
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,940
Welcome back to season two of Pretending to be People.

83
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,780
If you got into this podcast because of season one, thank you.

84
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:41,020
But honestly, that shit is over and done.

85
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:48,100
And this is a new era of excellence and groundbreaking podcast roleplay.

86
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,820
Straight up, dude.

87
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:53,380
Get your two tight britches on, which is a reference to nothing.

88
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:58,860
If you listen to season one, stop listening right now.

89
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,860
Stop. Yeah, you need to stop.

90
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:04,660
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, keep going.

91
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:08,620
The britches this, oh, I feel like I'm, am I clipping for you guys?

92
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:09,140
A little bit.

93
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,500
I feel very loud.

94
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,500
I'll turn you down.

95
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,700
Turn me down a little bit.

96
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,940
I'll just talk louder.

97
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,980
Oh, the cat's going in the pod box.

98
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,020
Cat in the pod box.

99
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:25,940
I will say the main difference after listening to the edited version of the first episode of this season.

100
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:28,940
Yeah, like once it was edited, we were funny and good.

101
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:33,740
Exactly, but after listening to that, huge differences.

102
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:37,580
The britches are going to be small this year, this years.

103
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,620
This years?

104
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,100
All right, they were big in that thing.

105
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,940
They were big last time and now they're small.

106
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:46,260
Hey, Zach, are they coming out of the ******* world right now?

107
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:46,860
No.

108
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,100
Oh, okay, nevermind.

109
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:52,420
Which is a reference to nothing.

110
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:59,420
Zach is currently aggressively kissing our cat.

111
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,300
And the first two times she was like, yeah, sure.

112
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:06,020
And then the fifth time she was like, I'm not going to sit on this ******* couch with you anymore.

113
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,100
You lost cat privilege.

114
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:12,660
Okay, so obviously I know the answer to this, but Joe, where exactly did we leave off last time?

115
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:15,940
Oh, dude, you should have seen the crazy **** that I saw.

116
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:22,500
A girl killed another girl in an apartment and it was messed up and we were all kind of exasperated by it.

117
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:28,060
And so Cal, Colorado asked us to go to the foundry to maybe wind down.

118
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:34,220
Which is not a reference to the old Joplin, Missouri music venue.

119
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,020
It's a reference to what, Zach?

120
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,140
Oh, it's a reference to what, Thomas?

121
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,620
I don't remember exactly, but isn't it a newsman's bar?

122
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,380
I believe it's a bar specifically for newsman's.

123
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,660
That's right.

124
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,620
I remember the whole thing.

125
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:49,060
I knew the whole time I knew that.

126
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,220
So vroom, vroom?

127
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,100
Vroom, vroom.

128
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,620
Vroom, vroom.

129
00:06:54,620 --> 00:07:00,940
Julius Summers pulls into the parking lot of the foundry.

130
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,700
Yeah, where's the foundry located, Thomas?

131
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,660
What kind of bar is this?

132
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:09,660
It's got like dive bar aesthetics, but much like Cal, Colorado's house, there are pictures

133
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:12,500
all over the walls of local news people.

134
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:18,820
And it's kind of maybe equidistant downtown from the three different local news stations.

135
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:24,340
And so they all come and relax and unwind there and talk shop afterwards.

136
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:27,700
Are there any TVs on the walls at all?

137
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:33,140
Are they showing the news at this place or is it specifically to unwind away from that?

138
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:34,140
I think they are.

139
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:37,580
I think they never play sports, just the news.

140
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:40,140
How many news channels are in the city?

141
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,140
He just said there are three.

142
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:43,660
Okay, there's three TVs then.

143
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:48,540
I think the foundry is like in an older building downtown, but just absolutely like always

144
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,700
in the shadow of these skyscrapers.

145
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:57,220
We're in like the downtown railroad like intersect.

146
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,220
I love it.

147
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:01,560
It's right where the train rolls by and there's a...

148
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,060
They do train shots.

149
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:05,580
Yeah, of course they do train shots.

150
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:12,780
So pretty much every time this foundry is like rumbling with the train that is basically

151
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,980
right outside its back door.

152
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:20,420
There's just a shitload of like attractive people in good suits like getting fucking

153
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:23,220
hammered and the trains come by a lot.

154
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:27,820
That's one of the reasons that they chose this place because it's very hard to overhear

155
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:30,140
the conversation like anybody else is having.

156
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,140
You have to lean in close.

157
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:35,420
It's a great place to like protect your sources.

158
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:41,040
In your mind, is this place filled with producers and talent or is my ilk of the camera man

159
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,540
and crew there?

160
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:44,540
Everyone comes to the foundry.

161
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,900
We're all friends at the foundry.

162
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:49,980
Color 10, KY3, any of the other ones?

163
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:53,540
I don't think we're like referencing specific networks, but it would definitely be like

164
00:08:53,540 --> 00:09:00,460
the local ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, like local anchor people all hanging out there except

165
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:06,420
it's CAN, NNN, Nightly News Now.

166
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,500
ETC is there.

167
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,980
ETC, which is...

168
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:10,980
Ethical...

169
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,860
This is going to be like PBS and nobody watches it.

170
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:14,860
Ethical...

171
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:15,860
Television.

172
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:16,860
Television channel.

173
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:17,860
Channel.

174
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:20,860
Joe, you do one.

175
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:25,700
Yeah, now that we said them all.

176
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,300
RBQ, you guys have fun.

177
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:31,020
It's sponsored by Arby's and it's barbeque.

178
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,020
Barbeque.

179
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,420
Yeah, Royal Broadcasting.

180
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,420
Quarterly.

181
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:38,980
They only air three months.

182
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:48,100
Anyway, I've speedily pulled into...

183
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,540
I screech into the parking lot of the foundry.

184
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:53,700
Does Beck say that?

185
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,700
Unless Julius goes...

186
00:09:55,700 --> 00:10:02,740
Yeah, no, Julius pulls in like as any normal person would into a parking spot, but as he's

187
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,540
doing it, he goes...

188
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:09,780
And then he kind of like looks around at the other two and sees Cal is not laughing.

189
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:16,200
No, Cal is like holding onto the oh shit handle and is like is clutching at his chest.

190
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:23,360
Keep in mind throughout these interactions of the sites you just saw at the apartment,

191
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,280
the high rise that you were just at.

192
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:28,280
Yeah, I bet you we land in silence.

193
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,880
I bet you we pull in a little somber.

194
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,960
I was going to mention, I don't think...

195
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,440
He would not bring his camera in here.

196
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:38,800
I think that this is a sacred place that he knows not to film and that's a very out of

197
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,800
character for him.

198
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,800
So you guys walk across...

199
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,900
This is like where the witches and the witch hunters meet.

200
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:48,940
There are as many people outside smoking as there are inside.

201
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:49,940
Also smoking?

202
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:57,620
Yes, this is a smoking bar, but it's a nice day.

203
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:01,860
It's a cool evening from an oppressively hot, hot day.

204
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:07,060
The humidity kind of dies off into the night and you've got kind of a cool summer evening

205
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:13,140
as you guys walk across this gravel parking lot and head around back to the entrance of

206
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,900
the foundry on the train track side.

207
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:19,060
A train is currently finishing up.

208
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:26,540
It's bustling through this back area and you see a server is haphazardly making their way

209
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:30,180
through the smokers outside with train shots.

210
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:33,460
He's yelling, train shots, yeah, who had the train shots?

211
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:36,300
We got a whole mess of them here.

212
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:41,020
Cal just like silently takes one off the tray and downs it and puts it back on the tray.

213
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:46,500
Julius grabs one, takes it, and then puts $2 down on the tray.

214
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,500
Nice.

215
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:51,900
Which train shots are specifically a special here at the foundry.

216
00:11:51,900 --> 00:12:01,780
It is a single dollar for a shot of whiskey when the train toots its horn as it drives

217
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:02,780
by.

218
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:08,460
Oh God, if it's fucking like dollar whiskey, we're talking old crow or worse.

219
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,460
Oh, it's old granddad.

220
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,460
Brown derby select.

221
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,460
It's old granddad.

222
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,460
It's old granddad.

223
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,460
Oh yeah.

224
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,460
Orange bottle.

225
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:22,180
And you set this down and the server looks at Cal Colorado with a certain appreciation

226
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:25,260
as he carries on with his job.

227
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,860
I think he knows to just add it to Cal's tab.

228
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:28,860
Nice.

229
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:36,680
Julius did put the $2 down on his tray even though he knew that those were not poured

230
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,820
out for Cal and Julius.

231
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:44,340
Immediately you hear him as he walks over to a group who's calling him over with the

232
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,340
train shots.

233
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:48,060
He's reassuring them like, yeah, no, I'll be right back.

234
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,220
I'll be right back.

235
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:55,740
And their understanding after seeing the looks on the pained faces of Cal Colorado, Julius

236
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:58,880
Summers, and Beck Wilder.

237
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,880
Probably like we recognize.

238
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,780
Are they just like local news crew?

239
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,520
Yeah, it's just another local news crew.

240
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:10,020
They hold up their shots to you as they all wait on the other two shots to come, which

241
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:12,200
come quickly and you're all able to.

242
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:16,720
Beck takes his head off and does an exaggerated bow and puts it back on.

243
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,200
Guys, this is my first time in here.

244
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,200
Very excited.

245
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,600
I've heard a lot about it.

246
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,680
This is the first thing that maybe like brightened Cal's face in a while.

247
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,520
Like he gives a very knowing look to Beck.

248
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:33,200
Well, we have a first timer here.

249
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,960
I think you know what that means, Becca.

250
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:38,780
We exchange a look and you see a big smile on Beck looking at you.

251
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:43,960
Are you thinking like we're going to do like do the full set up like now?

252
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:49,720
Maggie doesn't let any first timers in without putting them through the printing press.

253
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:55,500
Oh, Julius, my man, you're going to have fun tonight, dude.

254
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,640
It's going to be good for you.

255
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,720
You're going to want to shake off what we saw earlier.

256
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,560
You're going to forget all about that weird, horrible home brew murder.

257
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:09,720
I mean, I don't know that I'll forget about that anytime soon, but no, the images will

258
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:17,360
haunt you for the rest of your life, but we can obliterate them temporarily.

259
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,360
The printing press?

260
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,360
You'll see.

261
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:25,620
Julius starts walking faster and wants to be the first one in there because he's stoked

262
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:30,800
to see what the hell the printing press is.

263
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,500
Do you think that you and I have a booth that we haunt?

264
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,500
Probably yeah.

265
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,500
I think that'd be cool.

266
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:43,180
Julius has done his research asking his uncle all about these guys, so he knows which booth

267
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:47,780
it is.

268
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:52,020
So Julius goes and sits down in the booth that you guys usually go sit down.

269
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:56,220
Do you go sneak in right before Beck gets there?

270
00:14:56,220 --> 00:15:01,140
Leading the way, I'm just going and sitting down and turning around like, look what I

271
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,140
know.

272
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,700
Hey, that's the one we always sit at.

273
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,700
That's weird, dude.

274
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,700
Cool.

275
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:13,340
Hanging Wes Anderson style directly center frame of the booth is an old picture of Cal

276
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:21,220
from the night after his first television broadcast as a head news anchor, and it's

277
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:27,420
beautifully framed in this old oak wooden frame and is sitting gloriously.

278
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,540
He looks like a kid.

279
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:29,780
The suit's wearing him.

280
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:33,460
Yeah, Cal sits purposely with his back to that.

281
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,460
In what way?

282
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:38,900
Is it so that when people look at it, they see your face next to your face?

283
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:44,700
What they're going to see is a much younger, more handsome man with a huge smile on his

284
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:50,900
face next to that, aged 30 years and looking absolutely miserable tonight.

285
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:55,580
It does have that effect that those are contrasted, but he's not trying to do it as a power move

286
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,580
or anything.

287
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,900
He just doesn't want to catch sight of it.

288
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:58,900
Sure, sure, sure.

289
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:05,860
As Julius slides into the booth, he's not saying anything, but wiggling with excitement.

290
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:08,380
He's wanted to do this for so long.

291
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:12,560
Just be a producer and be part of the news and be able to get into this place.

292
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,140
He is so fucking stoked.

293
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:20,820
Julius, if you wiggle like that during the printing press, you could lose a finger.

294
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,140
Printing press.

295
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:24,420
I want to find out what it is.

296
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:26,420
Your research didn't tell you what it is.

297
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,820
My uncle would not tell me.

298
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:29,820
That makes sense.

299
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,820
I mean, it's kind of a closely guarded secret around here.

300
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:36,220
I don't think that anybody goes out there just telling other people about it, you know?

301
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:39,180
They never do, if they want to live.

302
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,980
Only kidding.

303
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:44,500
It's a process that happens in three steps.

304
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:52,100
The first step, you are laid across the bar and your belly is exposed.

305
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:57,820
Julius pulls his shirt up as he lays on the table and then realizes what was said and

306
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,680
then he goes and sits back down again.

307
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,420
Tell him the second part.

308
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:06,580
This is kind of like your last moment of choice here, but you get to decide what liquor you

309
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:07,580
want.

310
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:11,420
Once you're laying on the bar with your shirt up?

311
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:14,620
What would be your choice if you said your favorite liquor?

312
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:15,620
Tequila.

313
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:21,520
Ooh, that's a bad choice to try on.

314
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:28,100
The third step is more tequila than you've ever had in your life, with hungry news crews

315
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:39,180
eagerly licking it off your midriff as Maggie, the hardened barkeep, pours a bottle into

316
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:40,180
your mouth.

317
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:42,540
Same, by the way.

318
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:49,660
So the tequila gets poured into my mouth and your belly button.

319
00:17:49,660 --> 00:18:00,500
And they let the older interns just absolutely go at you.

320
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:05,800
So at this point, you're probably asking what's in it for you.

321
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,300
The deep respect that comes.

322
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:15,060
I spent a lot of my time in college practicing for this day.

323
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,860
Oh, you've had a lot of people lick you.

324
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,260
I wish.

325
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:22,540
Oh, has anyone licked you?

326
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:27,780
Julius gets up from the booth and walks over to the bar with his, while he's like untucking

327
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:35,060
his shirt from his pants, his all tan suit.

328
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:39,340
Oh, I thought you were going to describe your body and I was like, he strikes me as

329
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:41,340
a very pale man.

330
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,340
He's pretty pale.

331
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:43,340
Yeah.

332
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:53,460
You see a trunk of a woman in a denim vest with long, a long braid down the back of her

333
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,460
hair.

334
00:18:54,460 --> 00:19:03,980
She clinks a bell above her head and she's like, hot off the press.

335
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:09,540
Oh, that's right.

336
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:14,780
We got a newbie over at city action news.

337
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:23,620
Come on down everyone for Julius Summers.

338
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:29,060
He's in for the printing press, clang, clang, clang, clang, clang, and the entire crowd

339
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:33,620
in circles, like all the smokers come inside when they hear the bell and immediately jackets

340
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:34,620
come off.

341
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:37,860
Ties are loosened, top buttons are undone.

342
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:43,020
And like these very dorky, like you see the interns start circling and they all look like

343
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,700
Jonah from Veep.

344
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:54,260
Julius is laying on the bar with his like shirt kind of pulled up, exposing his stomach.

345
00:19:54,260 --> 00:20:08,700
And then one of the Jonah interns just rips all of his like upper clothing off.

346
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:17,900
And the chants fade away, much like Julius's memories from the entire night.

347
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:24,700
Beck and Cow, however, don't get printing pressed by a bunch of rabbit interns and therefore

348
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:28,660
are able to keep their wits in their brain helmets for the evening.

349
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,660
Let's go check that out.

350
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:34,900
And Oh, Hey, thanks so much for listening to pretending to be people probably means

351
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,340
you're fucking cool.

352
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:46,660
We've got a very special guest on today's episode of pretending to be people.

353
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:51,860
I had an idea in my head when we were discussing the recording of season two, Joe and I had

354
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:57,420
talked about who his character would interact with the most.

355
00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:02,420
And your answer to that was a mother.

356
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,420
The answer was mother.

357
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:04,420
Yes.

358
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:08,060
I think you specifically told me I can't have dead parents this time.

359
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:15,100
Well, not yet, not yet, exactly.

360
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:21,380
And when you said mom immediately, I thought, well, let's get our podcast, uh, dad to come

361
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:24,820
on and play Beck Wilder's mom.

362
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:28,820
It's Scott Norwood is back!

363
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,940
Thank you very much for having me back on.

364
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:35,300
And like, this isn't the first time I've been called a mother, but at least the circumstances

365
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,300
are different.

366
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:43,020
Well, we really appreciate you coming on for those of you who are just hearing Scott on

367
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:47,140
pretending to be people for the first time for some fucking reason.

368
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:52,360
Scott is my parasocial RPG mentor.

369
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:59,900
He didn't know that he was my mentor, but listening to his podcast that he does with

370
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:06,660
Matt Sanderson and Paul Fricker, good friends of Jackson Elias truly developed me into the

371
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:09,380
GM that I am today.

372
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:14,220
And I am super appreciative of all the lessons I've learned listening to their podcast over

373
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:15,220
the years.

374
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,220
Oh, blimey.

375
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:22,740
I thought I'm still amazed that anyone even listens to it.

376
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:26,380
Scott before I was ever aware of who you were, I knew that Zach listened to your podcast

377
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:30,780
and you answered some questions for him one time and he was so excited and told us all

378
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:31,780
about it.

379
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:35,780
And that was way before there was ever a glimmer of hope of meeting you, let alone playing

380
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:36,820
No, yeah.

381
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:41,280
We weren't even talking about recording a podcast, but I was running Helen Texas, which

382
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:46,920
is a scenario that you wrote for the book, The Things We Leave Behind by Stygian Fox

383
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,340
Publishing.

384
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:55,100
And that's a great book and your scenario in it is so terrifying and awesome.

385
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:59,880
So I posted some questions on the subreddit and you yourself came in and answered them

386
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:07,720
and I lost my fucking shit, Scott.

387
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:11,600
I waste half my life on Reddit.

388
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:16,080
It is my main time sink and I am not proud of that.

389
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:21,540
Well that time sink made this nerd super happy and validated many, many years ago.

390
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:22,640
So thank you for that.

391
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,720
Some might say this podcast wouldn't exist without you, Scott.

392
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:29,640
You gave him the hope, the drive.

393
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:33,000
It's all my fault now, is it?

394
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
We have to pin it on somebody.

395
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:52,560
I would like to take us to the home of Beck and Kim Wilder as Ramona scoots her cat.

396
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:56,600
Zach has a cat food bowl that is one of those ones that's like a maze.

397
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,600
Yeah, it keeps Ramona nice and...

398
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,120
But it kind of becomes a game.

399
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,880
Smart, yeah.

400
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:08,040
Yeah, she grabs each piece individually and then eats it out of her own paw, which is

401
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,440
rad.

402
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,400
But noisy, I imagine.

403
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,320
Quite noisy.

404
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:18,320
I'm going to move it into the back room.

405
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:22,680
I barely get through a recording session without one of my cats running into the room and

406
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:28,160
screaming like a seagull or jumping all over things and knocking shit over.

407
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:33,320
My cats are named Chaos and Anarchy, and it's with good reason.

408
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:36,400
That's great.

409
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:41,560
Beck Wilder has had a brutal day.

410
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,560
Started off fine.

411
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:51,440
Woke up around 2 p.m. in your tighty-whities, in your messy bedroom, headed off, shot a

412
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,680
segment out on a farm.

413
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,680
He had a rough evening.

414
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,680
Was it evening?

415
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,160
Yeah, it was a rough evening.

416
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:03,680
You were called out for a potential story that was...

417
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,400
We weren't even 100% sure what we were going out there for.

418
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,560
And what did you find?

419
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:10,320
Oh, man, it wasn't good.

420
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:17,280
It was a terrible, terrible crime scene, including a partially severed head.

421
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:20,840
That wasn't what Beck was thinking was going to happen that day.

422
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:23,560
Yeah, I mean, a severed head is bad enough.

423
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:26,840
A partially severed head sounds worse.

424
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:32,720
Yeah, it's a lot worse.

425
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,720
Just holding on.

426
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:37,640
Just a little hinge.

427
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,200
Beck isn't in the greatest headspace.

428
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,800
He's now just gotten back from the foundry, where he had a nice night trying to drink

429
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,800
his troubles away.

430
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,840
Are you feeling a little loose?

431
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,760
You feeling a little warm in the face?

432
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,320
Beck always feels loose.

433
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:54,960
He's maybe a little bit looser than normal, but he kind of lives in an equilibrium of

434
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,960
inebriation.

435
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:00,360
A loose state, I like that.

436
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:04,640
So as you arrive home, it's late at night.

437
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:11,320
It's 1130 PM, maybe even midnight, which is about as late in the night as you can get.

438
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,640
Before it starts becoming morning.

439
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:16,640
That's right.

440
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:20,920
Kim Wilder has the home to herself.

441
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:30,240
Her son is a mid-thirties field cameraman for City Action News, and he is still living

442
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,160
in your house, Kim.

443
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:37,320
For now.

444
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:41,200
What is Kim Wilder up to on a random Saturday evening?

445
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:48,320
I think she's sitting there on the sofa, knitting and watching television.

446
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:54,880
The sound is way down on the TV, and there's just the clack, clack, clack of knitting needles.

447
00:26:54,880 --> 00:27:00,960
And somehow she is managing to make knitting look angry.

448
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:06,480
Out of the corner of her eyes, she just keeps darting her eyes over and stabbing them into

449
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:13,000
the corner where Beck keeps his camera equipment, which is not there at the time, but there's

450
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:21,040
like a whole corner of this room that is specifically set up to house Beck's livelihood.

451
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,200
Oh yeah.

452
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:26,160
You can tell exactly where it is just by all the scuff marks and the skirting board and

453
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:30,000
the floor tiles.

454
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:36,120
And the last you saw Beck, it was maybe even yesterday because today you knew that he was

455
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,120
in his bedroom.

456
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:42,880
You knew that he had been sleeping in, but you went to knock on his door for tea or snack

457
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,960
or he wasn't even in there.

458
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,400
He just left the house without saying anything.

459
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:53,440
And as those thoughts are flowing through your brain, the front door swings open.

460
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,440
Hey, Ma, you're up.

461
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,880
Oh, this is awkward.

462
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:04,880
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.

463
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:11,720
I thought that was a burglar coming in, but no, it's just my son staying out all hours

464
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,040
again.

465
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,800
And where have you been tonight, young man?

466
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,280
Get some drinks with the boys.

467
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:23,160
You know, it's, uh, uh, I had a, I had a bad night, Mom.

468
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:31,000
Yes I could, I can smell just how bad your night was from here, yes.

469
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:36,000
You're not going to bed until you put something in your stomach to soak up some of that beer.

470
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:42,200
There's still some hot dog casserole in the oven, it's probably, oh, it's probably burnt

471
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:46,200
to a crisp by now, but well, give it a try.

472
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:50,720
I cut up the wieners nice and small, just the way you like it, just the way I like it.

473
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:55,520
Cut up more hot dogs.

474
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:59,760
Beck starts walking toward the fridge and you can tell now that he's a little drunker

475
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,320
even than you've ever seen him.

476
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,600
He's a stumble-ier than you've ever seen him.

477
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:10,680
And he kind of catches himself, woo, a little woozy, sorry, sorry about that, Ma.

478
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:16,800
It uh, I know we don't like to talk about like what I do, but like, I saw some shit

479
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,680
tonight Mom, it was bad.

480
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:22,280
And what exactly did you see?

481
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:26,920
Oh, it's kind of like a thing that's like under investigation now.

482
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:31,320
I don't know if like, I might need a lawyer to talk to you about it.

483
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:37,000
Honestly, I really don't understand why you can't have a proper job.

484
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,320
You're out all hours.

485
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:42,840
I never know whether I'm going to find you sleeping in your room in the middle of the

486
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:47,080
afternoon or whether you're going to stay out until three o'clock in the morning.

487
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:50,760
Clearly what you're doing isn't making you enough money for you to actually move into

488
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,440
your own place.

489
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:58,200
And now you're saying that it's dangerous as well, and it's going to get you into trouble.

490
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,560
Why do you do this?

491
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,780
Why can't you just get a proper job?

492
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:08,280
You know, Macy Grindel's son, Deke, he's got, he's got a nice thriving business for himself

493
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:14,020
selling secondhand sofa beds and he's moved into a new apartment downtown.

494
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,280
It's all his own.

495
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:20,100
Well, I think he's got a couple of flatmates, but he's not living with his mother anymore.

496
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,100
That's the important thing.

497
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:23,580
Yeah, but Deke's a fucking asshole.

498
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:27,260
Oh, not this again.

499
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:29,020
Jesus Christ.

500
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:31,420
He's a financially solvent asshole.

501
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:37,660
Sorry, uh, the, uh, the internet connection cut out a little bit right there.

502
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:47,660
He's a financially solvent asshole.

503
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:48,300
Brilliant.

504
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:55,580
As Kim started to go into that diatribe, Beck had his back to her and he was kind of mouthing

505
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:56,700
along with these words.

506
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,140
He's heard it so many times.

507
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,180
Oh, she's got to mention Deke again.

508
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:04,380
She's got to mention Deke.

509
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:05,500
Oh, there we go.

510
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,420
Playing the greatest hits.

511
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:12,380
If you love Deke so much, why didn't you give birth to him?

512
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:17,980
Don't think that I haven't thought about that every day.

513
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:19,100
Ew, gross mom.

514
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:21,180
You think about fucking Deke's dad?

515
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:25,900
A wistful look crosses Kim's eyes.

516
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:36,380
For like half a second, I thought we were going to get something like really meaningful

517
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:39,500
when Kim was like, why do you even do this job?

518
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:43,500
And then Beck's like, go fuck my friend's dad.

519
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:54,220
At this point, Beck has lost the gusto for the hot dog casserole and it's just kind of

520
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:58,540
like slopping it onto a plate and throwing it in the microwave and is trying his best

521
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:00,300
to like avoid eye contact with you.

522
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:05,980
Look, Ma, I know that it's like not like the best paying thing in the world, but it's like

523
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:07,420
what I want to do.

524
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:12,860
Like, I don't know if you can understand like happiness from that perspective, but that's

525
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:14,620
what I've got for me right now.

526
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:21,740
Look, you've got to understand that part of being a grown up is that we all have to do

527
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:28,860
things that we don't want to do, because that's just how we get through life.

528
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:36,380
And yes, all right, you can run around doing your camera stuff and whatever it is you do

529
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:37,820
at three o'clock in the morning.

530
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:44,700
And I try not to judge you, but sooner or later, you've got to grow up.

531
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:50,300
You can't just carry on like this and pretend that everything's all right.

532
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:55,660
You've got to you've got to grow up someday, boy.

533
00:32:56,540 --> 00:33:01,820
Beck is now kind of a little more solemn and a little more introspective visually.

534
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:06,220
And he pulls the food out of the microwave and he's holding the plate and he's kind of

535
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:07,340
picking at it with a fork.

536
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:10,300
Yeah, I mean, fine.

537
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:13,900
We disagree on like fundamental things, Ma.

538
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:22,140
I just maybe someday you'll see that I can do this and also like be successful, whatever

539
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:23,100
that means to you.

540
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,580
I'm going to my room.

541
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:26,140
All right.

542
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:28,380
You'll have to pick up the clean sheets.

543
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:31,580
I've left them out for you, but you'll have to make the bed yourself.

544
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:37,740
And I tried to get the stains out, but we're going to have to try a new brand.

545
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:43,260
Yeah.

546
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:43,660
Okay.

547
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:44,380
Thanks.

548
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,180
Thanks, Mommy.

549
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:46,940
You got any milk?

550
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:58,780
Scott, we didn't bring you on here to roleplay anything other than what's about to happen.

551
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:07,980
Oh, Scott, thank you so much.

552
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:09,580
I think that's the end of the night.

553
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:10,300
That was perfect.

554
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:17,820
Oh, Scott, as always, an absolute pleasure.

555
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:20,060
Oh, thank you.

556
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:25,100
Zach, we live in a weird privileged world that we just had Scott Dorward on to play

557
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:25,820
my mom.

558
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:26,940
And I said, thanks, Mommy.

559
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:27,580
Got any milk?

560
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:34,060
And then we said, have a good day.

561
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:35,420
That is going to haunt me.

562
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:41,260
Scott, thank you so much.

563
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:42,940
Seriously, thank you so much.

564
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:49,820
And for those of you who enjoyed Scott just now, you can hear him.

565
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:55,420
He runs two different full scenarios for us on pretending to be people in our bonus episodes

566
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:58,140
here on the main feed.

567
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:04,940
Scott, you ran Bleak Prospect, a Call of Cthulhu scenario that you wrote so fucking creepy.

568
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:07,100
It's one of my favorite things that we've done on the show.

569
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,060
It's so fun.

570
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:11,900
Starts in a Hoover town and goes to worse places.

571
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:12,400
Yeah.

572
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:19,980
And you also recently ran a Pulp Cthulhu scenario, both of which, by the way, that Scott wrote.

573
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:22,380
This one was A New Age of Wonders.

574
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:28,780
And that was, for me personally, I think one of my absolute favorite player experiences

575
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:30,380
I've ever had in an RPG.

576
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:30,940
Oh, man.

577
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,780
Oh, I'm glad you liked it.

578
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:34,540
I had an absolute blast running it.

579
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:35,100
You did, too.

580
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:36,940
That's so fun.

581
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:39,500
All right.

582
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:45,180
Well, I'm going to stop gushing and we'll see you soon, Scott.

583
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,060
Oh, marvelous.

584
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:46,780
Look forward to it.

585
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:47,420
Good night, Mommy.

586
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,260
Got to go and have a bath now.

587
00:35:52,380 --> 00:36:05,500
You're just now joining us.

588
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,660
Welcome back to Pretending to Be People.

589
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:11,100
We are here with a special guest right now.

590
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:19,420
It is the GM of the Lost Mountain Saga, one of the best players from Glass Canada Network's

591
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:20,780
Androids and Aliens.

592
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:25,660
It is Eleanor de Lorenzo.

593
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:28,620
Let's get one that the people can hear.

594
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:36,300
It's fun to talk like this, but I don't know if anybody can understand Eleanor de Lorenzo.

595
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:39,180
Hey, Ellie.

596
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:39,680
Hello.

597
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:41,500
I understood.

598
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,020
There were compliments in that.

599
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:43,820
I understood that.

600
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:46,860
I sucked that up right up.

601
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:48,300
I picked those out right away.

602
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:50,700
Thank you so much for coming back on.

603
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,700
Thank you so much for coming and joining us again.

604
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:56,140
I'm so excited to be back.

605
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:57,260
Thank you for inviting me.

606
00:36:57,260 --> 00:37:02,060
If you're listening to this and you haven't heard Ellie on Pretending to Be People before,

607
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:06,380
Ellie was a guest and a player when I ran a homebrew scenario that I wrote,

608
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:10,380
Bigfoot Underground Search and Hunt for her and some other guest players.

609
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:12,940
And we had an absolutely phenomenal time.

610
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:18,140
You were such a wonderful player that I was so excited to bring you back on.

611
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:22,940
Another huge reason that I was so excited to bring you on is when I told Thomas, I was like,

612
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:27,740
Hey, dude, Ellie from A&A is coming on Pretending to Be People.

613
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:28,060
Yeah.

614
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:31,420
And then you had her play with a bunch of people who weren't fans of that show,

615
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:35,820
which as a fan was like, well, that's a bummer.

616
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:42,620
Couldn't have anyone except me getting too starstruck on her first appearance on Pretending

617
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:43,260
to Be People.

618
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:43,740
Fair enough.

619
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:48,460
You wanted to protect her from what's about to happen.

620
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:48,960
Yes.

621
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:53,580
Slobbering idiots of the PTBP pod.

622
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:55,260
I love slobbering idiots, though.

623
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:57,260
That's what I'm more comfortable with.

624
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:57,980
Do you know what I'm saying?

625
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:02,140
Now I played with very talented, wonderful women and they were all great.

626
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:04,460
But that sounds deeply intimidating.

627
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:07,660
They were hot.

628
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:10,460
They stared at me with their hot eyes.

629
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:13,500
And one of them was apparently married to you, Zach.

630
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,300
That is correct.

631
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:14,700
Yeah.

632
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:15,260
Apparently.

633
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:17,420
Apparently.

634
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:18,300
Yeah.

635
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:20,140
Allegedly married.

636
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:22,220
Taylor and her hot eyes are married to Zach.

637
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:24,940
I'm an allegedly lucky man.

638
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:29,440
Okay.

639
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:33,340
I'm not going to correct that just because I'm waiting for all the chinks in your marriage's

640
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:36,940
armor to collapse at once.

641
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:37,660
Coming in hot.

642
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:38,300
Coming in hot.

643
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:39,500
Love it.

644
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:40,860
I'll have to beat Luke off, but.

645
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:42,220
Wow.

646
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:42,940
I'd watch that.

647
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:46,700
Well, so Thomas, are you married?

648
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:47,660
Uh, no.

649
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:48,460
No, I'm not married.

650
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:49,740
You said that very quickly.

651
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:52,460
No, it was like, it was like a gut reaction.

652
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:52,700
No.

653
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,220
Well, I remembered that I wasn't.

654
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:55,420
Right.

655
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:58,140
Well, you looked back at your whole life.

656
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:03,420
Did I leave a wife somewhere along the road?

657
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:06,300
It's like when people ask you if you're like, do you have any kids?

658
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,140
And you're like, not that I'm aware of.

659
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,260
It's like, do you have a wife?

660
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:11,900
Not that I'm aware of.

661
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:14,540
I'm known for not knowing much about America.

662
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:21,500
And I just realized that I know you guys are from a state, but I don't remember which state

663
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,020
right this second.

664
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:25,180
Is it Missouri?

665
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:25,820
It is.

666
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:27,820
Oh, wow.

667
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:31,420
I was going to make a joke about you have a one in 50 shots, so just go for it.

668
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:33,020
You fucking nailed it.

669
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:33,740
I did.

670
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:34,780
Got it in one.

671
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:38,860
It is indeed Missouri, which we like, but a lot of people don't.

672
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:39,660
Oh yeah.

673
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:40,380
We love it.

674
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:41,340
It's nice here.

675
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:42,220
It's really hot right now.

676
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:43,260
Actually, it sucks here.

677
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:49,100
Oh, but still, I would love to go, but like, is it nice because it's like, you know, you

678
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:53,020
can be on a horse ranch and I'm sorry.

679
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:53,580
You can be.

680
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:55,100
Yeah, you can be on a horse ranch.

681
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:56,700
Okay.

682
00:39:56,700 --> 00:40:02,860
Well, I mean, I don't make very much money and this is my house that we're recording

683
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:02,940
in.

684
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:08,860
Oh, screw you and making fun of my bullshit New York studio cabin.

685
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:12,620
But that's true.

686
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:14,860
That's a really cool thing about Missouri.

687
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:16,620
You have an actual kitchen.

688
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:17,120
I love that.

689
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:20,300
I want a Missouri kitchen.

690
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:24,460
Let's get into Cal, Colorado.

691
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:26,940
Cal, you've had a very interesting night.

692
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:32,380
I want to dive back into some of the things that you've seen here on this random night.

693
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:34,060
You were, oh, yeah.

694
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:38,780
That makes sense because one of these memories that keeps just blasting into your head as

695
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:47,500
you're leaving the foundry is just this headless, almost headless neck held on by a couple of

696
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:53,580
tendons and skin on one side.

697
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:59,180
Your mind drifts immediately from this severed neck off to your daughter.

698
00:40:59,180 --> 00:40:59,740
A little bit.

699
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:04,780
Mostly my mind is just shouting neck hole, neck hole, neck hole as I see like this horrifying

700
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:08,540
like red flash and this image of this nearly headless neck.

701
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:11,580
Neck hole, neck hole, neck hole as you get into your car.

702
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:16,700
Neck hole, neck hole, neck hole as you drive really far back to your home.

703
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:21,180
Neck hole, neck hole, neck hole, neck hole everywhere.

704
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:26,380
Neck hole, neck hole, neck hole as you sit into your chair.

705
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:29,660
And he turns on a 24 hour news channel like he always does.

706
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:30,160
Natch.

707
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:31,980
Drown it out, baby.

708
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:35,500
Honestly, the cleaning person must have turned it off because he kind of likes to just keep

709
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:36,460
it on all day.

710
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:38,620
But yeah, he turns that on.

711
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:41,740
He goes over to his pretty dusty home bar.

712
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:49,500
He grabs a glass and takes a bottle of cheap white wine out of the refrigerator and pours

713
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:53,020
it to the brim and then downs that and pours another.

714
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:58,700
And at that moment, you feel a vibration coming from your pocket and it's not the vibration

715
00:41:58,700 --> 00:41:59,820
of a text or a call.

716
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:02,540
Do you not have a phone that vibrates?

717
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:05,500
No, he does, but we don't do vibrates here.

718
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:08,460
We have a ring on this podcast.

719
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:09,020
That's right.

720
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:11,260
Ring, ring, ring, ring.

721
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:13,660
Yeah, he hears the ringtone set to his daughter, Carol.

722
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:17,660
Eleanor de Lorenzo.

723
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:22,060
What is Carol's face look like on the screen of Cal's phone here?

724
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:25,100
It's a young woman, young 20s.

725
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:29,260
She currently looks a little flushed as if she might have been, I don't know, working

726
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:30,300
out or something.

727
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:35,100
But since Saturday night, you might assume that she might be a little tipsy and she's

728
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:39,660
sitting down on a couch that you recognize to be her student room.

729
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:39,900
Hey.

730
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:46,540
Oh, Carol, it's lovely to hear from you.

731
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:47,020
I'm sorry.

732
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:51,180
I've had kind of an extraordinary evening.

733
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:53,820
Honey, how are you?

734
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:57,180
Dad, can you tilt your phone up a little bit?

735
00:42:57,180 --> 00:43:00,220
I can't see you like you're filming your forehead again.

736
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:01,980
He tilts it down and you can just see his chin.

737
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:04,940
Is this better?

738
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:05,820
No, please.

739
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:10,620
You remember, like, you can put it a little bit further away from your face.

740
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:11,660
Then that works better.

741
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:14,940
You just see one giant eye as he's looking into the camera lens.

742
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:15,980
It's all right.

743
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:19,020
And she puts down the phone and it's just voiceover.

744
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:28,540
Honey, I'd love to see your darling face, especially with you so far away from home.

745
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:30,700
Please explain FaceTime to me.

746
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:36,540
Oh, Dad, have you been drinking?

747
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:39,340
Not just a little wine.

748
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:40,780
It's a Saturday night.

749
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:42,620
I'm a single man.

750
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:45,420
Can I not enjoy a sifter of wine?

751
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:46,220
No, of course.

752
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:48,540
Actually, that's what I wanted to talk to you a little bit about.

753
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:52,540
I wondered if you have you been doing anything fun lately?

754
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:53,580
Like, except working.

755
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:56,380
Work is fun, sweetie.

756
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:58,140
Your mother and I always tried to tell you that.

757
00:43:58,140 --> 00:43:59,100
No, I know.

758
00:43:59,100 --> 00:43:59,500
I know.

759
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:01,980
I just, I don't know.

760
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:02,700
I worry about you.

761
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:07,020
That's why I just wish you, you know, would get out there a little bit.

762
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:10,700
Cal thinks about where he just got out to and pauses.

763
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:15,180
And he kind of gulps and he's like, I get out, sweetie.

764
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:19,260
Just today, I saw some corn wrestling while I was out on assignment.

765
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:22,460
They also had crabs, not the men, the farm.

766
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:24,780
They raised corn and crabs.

767
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:26,380
All right.

768
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:27,180
So I get out.

769
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:29,900
Yeah, no, I get it.

770
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:30,460
I know.

771
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:37,660
I just, I don't know if you, I'm sure you already heard, but mom, I think mom's seeing someone.

772
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:40,620
Yes, I heard.

773
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:42,540
He's quite a bit younger too.

774
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:44,220
I heard he was 40.

775
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:49,820
Yeah, but I mean, after you turn 25, it's like age doesn't matter anymore.

776
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:51,120
Oh.

777
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:58,720
She says that with 100% sincerity, because she thinks that if you're over 25, you're

778
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:04,960
ancient and you can tell that suddenly Carol seems a little bit nervous.

779
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:06,960
It's yeah, I don't know.

780
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,640
Is there something else on your mind, sweetie?

781
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:12,160
Well, promise you won't get angry.

782
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:13,920
I promise.

783
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:21,040
Well, you know that I know, you know, that I always wanted to make you happy and that

784
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:24,000
that's why I went to journalism school.

785
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:29,040
Of course, just like your mother and I, you went on to journalism school to continue the

786
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:33,840
family business, which is your ultimate dream and desire, of course, right?

787
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:34,560
Right.

788
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:40,160
But well, I've decided and she suddenly gets like defensive as if she's ready to fight.

789
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:44,080
I've decided that I'm not going to do that anymore.

790
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:49,600
I've decided that I am going to pursue something else, something that I am passionate about

791
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:51,120
and it's not journalism.

792
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:52,000
It's not writing.

793
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,320
It's not any of that.

794
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:57,280
I have decided I'm going to become a nature photographer.

795
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,960
Well, sweetie, that's that's wonderful.

796
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:05,360
Really?

797
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:09,840
You know, photography is still technically journalism.

798
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:18,880
Sweetheart, I just want you to know that no matter what you choose, even if you're not

799
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:24,320
a world class news anchor like me or a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist like your mother,

800
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:32,000
we're happy that what you have chosen is still inexplicably linked to the nexus of

801
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:39,920
of reporting and well, you know, showing the truth of our world to the people.

802
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:40,560
That's what it's all about.

803
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:45,280
OK, well, see, see, that was like I knew that you were going to react like that.

804
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:48,720
So now I'm going to tell you the real my real job.

805
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:52,320
I'm going to tell you the real.

806
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,360
It's still related to photography.

807
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:04,960
Yeah, but it's like for like beautiful women posing without clothing.

808
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,760
Pornography, pornography.

809
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:10,720
It's not it's not pornography.

810
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:14,240
It's boudoir photography.

811
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:15,600
Oh, I'm sorry.

812
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:16,720
Nerd pornography.

813
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:21,840
See, this is the thing.

814
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:22,880
You never understand.

815
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,080
You mock everything I do.

816
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:25,680
That's the problem with you and mom.

817
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:26,880
You're both academics.

818
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,400
And I don't want to be involved with this.

819
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,080
Like, I don't want to go to school anymore.

820
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:31,280
I'm going to buy my camera.

821
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:36,480
I'm going to take pictures of my friends and and they will pay me eventually.

822
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:39,440
And then I'll start an Instagram account and I'm going to make a lot of money.

823
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,040
And there's nothing you can say or do.

824
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:44,080
And yeah, roll grip check, dad.

825
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:46,080
No, I think he's no, no, no.

826
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:47,040
This is hold on.

827
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,680
This is specifically because of what you've seen tonight.

828
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,840
And the amount of grip that you lost.

829
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:54,400
It is going to affect the relationships that you have.

830
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:54,800
Yeah, I know.

831
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:57,760
But I was like what I was just about to say was all about that.

832
00:47:58,320 --> 00:47:58,880
Oh, okay.

833
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,400
Why it actually wouldn't.

834
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,880
Well, that's part of the game is you have to roll to do that.

835
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:09,120
Yeah, he hates the dice, but he succeeds.

836
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:10,480
Okay.

837
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:10,720
Yeah.

838
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:11,280
All fair enough.

839
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:18,720
Uh, so you see from the part of your father's chin that you can't see it like quivers a

840
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:25,360
little bit, but then he, then he composes itself and he says, honey, your mother and

841
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:28,400
I will support you no matter what you choose to do.

842
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,480
We only want you to be happy.

843
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:36,000
And tonight I saw some horrible things that I can never unsee.

844
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:42,880
If you can make beautiful art and put it into this world, that is enough for me.

845
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:46,960
You're going to want to approach this more carefully with your mother.

846
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:49,600
We may not tell her until you've graduated.

847
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:51,760
Well, I'm not going to graduate.

848
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:52,640
That's the thing.

849
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:54,000
Right, right, right.

850
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,600
Until you burlesque photography.

851
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:03,440
Well, I'm, this is a whole new world for me, pumpkin.

852
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:06,320
So dad, are you, are you all right?

853
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,640
You said you've seen some horrible stuff.

854
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:09,920
I didn't see a neck hole.

855
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:12,000
Sorry.

856
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,160
Uh, one of the wrestlers broke his arm.

857
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,360
It bent the wrong way.

858
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:16,400
It was gnarly.

859
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:20,800
I love that Cal picked up the word gnarly from Beck.

860
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,000
Oh no, Jesus.

861
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:24,320
All right.

862
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:25,440
Is he going to be okay?

863
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:26,000
Yes, sweetie.

864
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,280
I think he'll be fine.

865
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:33,360
Everything will be fine in the world and you will, no matter what you choose to do, you

866
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:35,440
will be an important contributing part of it.

867
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,600
And your mother and I love you very deeply.

868
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:41,680
Well, I love you too, dad, but, and she's starting to get worried.

869
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,160
Like, wow, he really needs to start getting out there.

870
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:52,560
I don't know that I know it's not my business, but I think it would be good for you to like,

871
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:58,640
there are apps you can download that would like match you with other women.

872
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:01,200
I just don't want you to be like, be alone.

873
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:04,320
I'm not alone, sweetie.

874
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:07,200
I have you, I have my memories.

875
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,360
He points to all the pictures around the house.

876
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:10,800
Oh my God.

877
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,960
See, that's the definition of being alone.

878
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:17,200
But I will try to get out there more.

879
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
What are these women apps you told me about?

880
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,840
Well, one of them is called Bumble.

881
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:28,160
I mean, like when you've downloaded them, let me know and I'll give you some advice

882
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:33,840
because you can't be like, like, don't start commenting on women's profiles like a weirdo.

883
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,000
How do you comment like a normal low?

884
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,680
Well, you just wait for them to like, you put up a nice picture of yourself

885
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,600
and then you write something nice about you.

886
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:48,480
Like you're an established journalist and then you wait for women to contact you.

887
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:51,120
Is there an app that finds me a woman exactly like your mother?

888
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:54,800
Dad.

889
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:56,420
What?

890
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:02,320
Maybe you should go for the complete opposite.

891
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:04,080
Like a guy?

892
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:07,920
Well, maybe.

893
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:10,320
I don't know, man.

894
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:17,680
Carol, I promise you, I will look into online dating.

895
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:18,000
All right.

896
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,360
Carol, exciting news.

897
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:22,400
Do you post your boudoir pictures on TikTok?

898
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:23,120
Well, okay.

899
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:25,920
So dad, you can't follow my friends.

900
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:27,760
Like, they are not part of the dating pool.

901
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:29,520
No, no.

902
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:30,400
Have you heard of this?

903
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:31,520
Have you heard of TikTok?

904
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:35,200
Of course I've heard about TikTok.

905
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:35,920
Oh, I'm sorry.

906
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:39,120
Well, I learned about it today and I did a dance.

907
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:42,480
Carol, no, you should see the dance I did.

908
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:45,120
It's posted on the can TikTok for the station.

909
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:46,720
People liked it.

910
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,000
Hey, you'll see, I'm out there.

911
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:55,600
Hey Carol, when you pull it up on your phone, you see it's called the calzone.

912
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:56,160
Oh God.

913
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:57,520
Oh God.

914
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:02,720
And he's doing a dance with a random guy on the street who's doing a very cool dance where

915
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:08,880
it looks like he's sitting while he's upright and dancing around in the sitting position.

916
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:11,600
And Cal does it perfectly alongside of him.

917
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:12,320
Wow, dad.

918
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:14,000
Actually, that's pretty impressive.

919
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,160
You should actually, you should keep doing that.

920
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:20,000
I'm in a weird twisted reality that we currently live in.

921
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,360
You would actually find more dates based on this video.

922
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:25,120
With women like your mother?

923
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:30,400
Maybe women like my mother.

924
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:36,160
Sure, but you should not narrow your, like, there are plenty of women out there that aren't

925
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:36,720
like mom.

926
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:38,560
Oh, well, that's the problem.

927
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:40,960
All right, dad.

928
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:46,960
I have to go, but thank you for being supportive of my choices.

929
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:51,200
Try to get some sleep and then maybe we'll, yeah, we'll, I'll check in with you tomorrow.

930
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:57,360
But I still, until I have some money, maybe don't cancel my credit card yet.

931
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,680
I wouldn't dream of it, sweetie.

932
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:06,000
But again, don't tell your mother she would cancel them in a heartbeat.

933
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:08,160
Thanks, dad.

934
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:10,560
Yeah, take care of yourself and I'll talk to you tomorrow.

935
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:12,560
I love you very much.

936
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:13,920
I love you too, dad.

937
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:15,680
And I, yeah, thank you.

938
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:18,660
Thank you.

939
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:21,540
This has been Cal Colorado.

940
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:22,580
Have a pleasant evening.

941
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,140
You really don't have, okay, fine.

942
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:31,300
Ellie, thank you so much for coming on the show.

943
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:31,940
Oh my God.

944
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:32,420
That was great.

945
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:32,980
That was fun.

946
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:39,300
I'm very much looking forward to seeing how this relationship thrives or...

947
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:40,260
Yeah, it was very normal.

948
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:45,060
Like, I love how, like, I expected Zach to come in and be like, and then all of a sudden

949
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:47,540
her head falls over, like she dies.

950
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:49,460
And I'm like, okay, cool.

951
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:50,580
We got a long ways to go.

952
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:52,660
We got time to fuck this shit up.

953
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:55,140
Yeah, there can definitely be a phone call where your head falls off.

954
00:53:56,020 --> 00:53:57,220
Hey, if that's what you want.

955
00:53:57,220 --> 00:54:00,500
Is season two a homebrew as well?

956
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:01,460
Yeah, very nice.

957
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:02,420
It's all I can do.

958
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:03,220
I don't like reading.

959
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:05,300
You actually can't.

960
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:07,700
I'm too stupid.

961
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:08,980
It's a shame.

962
00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:37,540
My life is great and it's all mine Cause my life is great and it's all mine

963
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:48,620
I
