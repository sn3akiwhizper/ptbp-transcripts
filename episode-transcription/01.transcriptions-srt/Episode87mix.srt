But no really, it's Wolf the Dog.

3
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:17,260
And I am here to meme and scream till I deem this a proper scene that seems to lean mean

4
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:24,160
from a serene scheme that beams live from 694.2 PTBP.

5
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:30,840
Pee-pees, sheepies, tee-hees, creepies, wee-wees.

6
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:38,280
Hey, do you want to give my producer here some solid info on what you like about this

7
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,520
here show?

8
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,200
What we could improve upon and that sort of such ain't happenin's?

9
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:49,180

19
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:37,640
I click every link I see no matter where it's from or who sent it to me, and that's wild

20
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:42,760
because I don't even know how to get on the fuckin' internet, Bill Gates.

21
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:49,460
If you're sick of basic ass juice, there's no excuse for not mixing in equal parts gin,

22
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:52,500
cherry liqueur, and chartreuse.

23
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,060
It's time for the news.

24
00:01:55,060 --> 00:02:00,420
Last time, Keith and Pastor Adam Kane went through the impassable metal plate, the door

25
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:05,700
at the bottom of Bean's pond, and Daddy passed the fuck out due to impact.

26
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:12,700
Keith shot him in both feets before headin' out down an old mine elevator to a cavernous

27
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:13,700
laboratory.

28
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:19,700
Above ground, Clark didn't throw away his shot, which he missed, but it led Casey Kristoff

29
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:26,160
to have his hand blown off by a shot from the clandestine carbine of Anne Love, codename

30
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,160
Karen.

31
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:33,040
And then, there was a very good conversation happenin' between Clark Bishop and Anne Love.

32
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,480
They got into a whole thing about the asylum?

33
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:39,440
Woof, I bet there's more of that comin' soon.

34
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:46,160
Down in the underground lab, Keith found the drafts for an old camera, radio, gun, and

35
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,160
helmet.

36
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:52,360
He also found the blueprints for a ball, the 25th of which worked.

37
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:58,540
M-A-R-Y, you ain't got no alibi, you ugly.

38
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:04,820
Except for you, dear listener, you are beautiful beyond imagination, and you obviously remember

39
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:10,800
that Keith then attempted to cast a spell of eternal life on himself that caused his

40
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,140
nails to pop off like a movie theater concession stand.

41
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,700
Mmm, butter.

42
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:23,900
Now, dear listener, what is your favorite thing to put on top of a heated dry corn?

43
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:28,220
Some say butter, some say premarison cheese.

44
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:32,020
I say it's kudzu with no backbone.

45
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:04,740
Anne Love, code name Karen, looks right at Clark Bishop and says,

46
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:10,420
W-wait a second, so...

47
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,420
Where's Leon?

48
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:14,140
He's, uh, he's helpin' with somethin' else.

49
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:18,340
Yeah, but he was sent for... did you send him somewhere else?

50
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,700
Yes.

51
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:26,460
Roll Persuade.

52
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,460
I pass.

53
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:29,340
Uh, 35 on a 40.

54
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,340
Okay.

55
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,900
Well, we better get going.

56
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:37,060
Wait, Anne, I gotta... what do you know about Maggie?

57
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:41,980
I mean, I know the takeover has been pretty brutal.

58
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:42,980
The takeover?

59
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:43,980
That's kinda what I'm wondering about.

60
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,860
Well yeah, because Jim had to die, right?

61
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:52,260
Because of the revelations of the Overseer, which he wasn't stoked about, but Maggie was

62
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:55,020
seemingly completely on board with.

63
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:59,820
And when that actually came to fruition, she saw her place and came to claim it.

64
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,200
Why did Jim have to die?

65
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,220
Because of the revelation of the Overseer?

66
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:06,100
I read a bit of that, and I don't remember seeing...

67
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,620
Okay, walk and talk, walk and talk.

68
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:12,220
This is all... we gotta get to your, uh... you still live at your parents' house, right?

69
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,220
We can't...

70
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,220
Keith's down in the hole.

71
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,900
We can't leave Keith down there.

72
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,120
Oh, right.

73
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,100
Can you help us get our buddy out of this hole?

74
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,820
She looks down at it, and she kinda, like, steps on it.

75
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,540
I don't know, seems like an impassable metal plate.

76
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:25,540
Hahahaha.

77
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:29,180
I don't... we haven't even, like, tried to pick it up or anything.

78
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,660
I'd like to try to do that.

79
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,540
Okay, three, two... remember?

80
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,660
Legs, not back.

81
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:34,660
Three, two...

82
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:35,660
Hey, Councilwoman?

83
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:36,660
You gonna help?

84
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:37,660
Three, two, one.

85
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:42,460
And you guys, you can't get your fingers more than half an inch underneath it.

86
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,960
And there's just mud.

87
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,460
It's seemingly just this metal plate.

88
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:49,460
There's nothing under... what was I saying?

89
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:50,460
I doubt it.

90
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,460
I don't know.

91
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,100
Maggie?

92
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,100
Sure.

93
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,100
Hahahaha.

94
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:59,580
Oh, right, the Revelation of the Overseer.

95
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:05,380
So, like, when you couldn't get your parent's book, cause I failed, Kevin here failed, we

96
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,380
failed.

97
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:09,660
Also, you know, sorry about all that.

98
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,960
But we couldn't get the book, so he tried to create his own, right?

99
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,580
But when it happened, the only thing that came out of it was that fucking picture, that

100
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:23,980
creepy, creepy picture of the guy, the hood, the light says, you know, he should not...

101
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:26,220
It's only through death that he shall rise again.

102
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:30,540
Oh, such an excellent member of the circle of knowledge you've already become.

103
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,900
And there was a letter in it, right?

104
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:36,360
Cause letters pop out of that one, it's like, you can't do shit with that book, but sometimes

105
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,360
letters pop out?

106
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,360
I don't know.

107
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:42,480
But it was called the Revelations of the Overseer, and it was this thing that was just like on

108
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:47,820
and on about how Jim had to die in order for the world to be safe and blah, blah, blah.

109
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:50,360
So anyway, Jim obviously didn't like that a whole lot, but...

110
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,160
You were friends with Jim, right?

111
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,680
Friends is an interesting term.

112
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,200
Well, you said he kind of recruited you, like, you guys had a relationship before the circle

113
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,200
of knowledge.

114
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,200
Yeah, he was my handler.

115
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,200
He was our handler.

116
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,200
Uh...

117
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,200
Cool!

118
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:13,040
Would you happen to know what the meaning behind a tarot card with a devil on it might

119
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,040
be?

120
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,040
Does that ring a bell for you?

121
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:20,120
I mean, Satan, but that seems more big picture and not really what we're doing here.

122
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:24,640
Seems like we never really made that a focus and therefore just kind of fell off the plot

123
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,720
line structure of this whole thing.

124
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,720
Satan?

125
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,720
Yeah.

126
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:34,800
Jack was Satan, you're a big bad.

127
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,160
Well I think it was more of like a code name.

128
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,720
Basically we're not here to try to take down Myriad.

129
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:46,760
That would be, that would take a bit of, you know, intelligence and time.

130
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:50,360
So you know about Myriad, you know those creatures.

131
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:55,080
Jim told us what he wanted to about Myriad, yeah.

132
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,160
What was that?

133
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,720
We really need to get going if we're going to make it to CCC.

134
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:04,040
Circle of knowledge to a circle of knowledge member, what is Myriad to us?

135
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:11,880
To you I don't know, but Myriad is the group that runs the government, is that a good

136
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,880
way of saying it?

137
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,880
Yeah, it checks out.

138
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:18,400
Basically we made a deal with them to use their technology if they could, you know,

139
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,160
have some sway in political matters.

140
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,160
You met Marvin, right?

141
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:27,360
He was a rebel, I guess with a cause, if that cause is just attaining power.

142
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,220
And then why did you kill my parents?

143
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,760
To get the book that we never found.

144
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,760
Sorry about that.

145
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:35,000
If we found it I would have felt better about killing your parents, but I bet it's still

146
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,500
at your house, so if we could go get that actually, that would be dope.

147
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,400
You killed them because you couldn't find it?

148
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:47,800
I was sent there to kill, yes, Jim essentially hired us to go get the book, but he, he told

149
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:52,440
me it all means necessary.

150
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,680
I mean even though they were his friends, technically, I guess if you want to call that

151
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,680
friendship.

152
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,000
He had them under the San Ferra Blum situation, so I guess it's not really friendship, but

153
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,680
even that couldn't get the information out of them.

154
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,120
San Ferra Blum, we've heard that mentioned.

155
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,360
What is that?

156
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,360
It's the project!

157
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,200
At Calm Comfy Campground!

158
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:18,640
It's the whole thing, with the flowers, and the city, you know, we've been using it in

159
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:24,520
the city for a while, and then Myriad wanted us to go country-wide with it, but then James

160
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:31,760
for some reason freaked out about that plan and fucked everything up for, not for long,

161
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,280
Maggie's going through with it.

162
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,320
But what does San Ferra Blum do?

163
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:40,240
Pacifies the mind, essentially, so it makes people more malleable, right, so like everyone

164
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,600
in the city basically works for Bar Corp at this point, which is one of our subsidiaries

165
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:51,400
that we own, so basically the idea is that it's like, people are calling it New World

166
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,680
Order, but basically it's just making sure that chaos doesn't happen.

167
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:58,840
Could this New World Order protect a man of means such as myself?

168
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:03,040
Kevin, are you talking about the money from all the cocaine we're probably gonna sell

169
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,000
as soon as this is over?

170
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Hahahaha!

171
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,200
Cause if so, then hell yeah.

172
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,200
Yes.

173
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,320
Going to sell.

174
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,320
What did that mean?

175
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,320
That seemed like a thing.

176
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,320
No it didn't.

177
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:22,040
Hahahaha!

178
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:31,140
You know, this is an audio medium and I can't convey my inner intentions with a glance or...

179
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:37,480
You can join the Den of Sin for $15 to get those glances on our Patreon content over

180
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:41,320
at patreon.com slash pretending pod, that was all, and love talking.

181
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:49,640
Uh, yeah, no we're definitely gonna be of means, but Kevin, you are primed to join Circle

182
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:54,840
of Knowledge, and with that comes, you know, whatever you want, but more than money it's

183
00:10:54,840 --> 00:11:02,080
a sense of pride of saving the world from total destruction, but also on top of that

184
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:06,360
you get literally anything you want cause money doesn't really matter anymore for us.

185
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:11,360
Well, but, I mean, with the San Ferablam and Marriott stuff, aren't you kinda just destroying

186
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,240
the world in the name of saving it?

187
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:17,160
I had some qualms with that too, Maggie didn't mention this New World Order stuff, I was

188
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,240
signing up to stop a monster.

189
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,240
Yeah, well that's how we're doing it.

190
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,240
By creating one?

191
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,120
Well, I don't, I wouldn't say that we're creating a monster necessarily as...

192
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,360
You know, Maggie showed me that creature, have you seen it?

193
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,040
The Gigantombropypicus?

194
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,880
I didn't, she didn't tell me its name.

195
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,920
Oh yeah, that shit is mad fucked.

196
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,920
I'm sorry, what?

197
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:37,920
Gigantombropypicus?

198
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,080
Yeah, sorry, I'm not in your club, what's...

199
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:45,920
Seriously, Kevin, you are absolutely gonna join the Circle of Knowledge after this, which,

200
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:54,040
if we could get to the CCC, that was the original, the original game plan.

201
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:58,720
But I guess we could get the book first, get the book and then go to CCC, cause the book,

202
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,000
I mean your town here, no offense, completely fucked probably unless we figure out a way

203
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,960
which the book is probably the way that we can solve all this ooze and goo or whatever

204
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,960
you're talking about.

205
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:13,040
Did you know that Adam thought that he could somehow change all this?

206
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,040
Who's Adam?

207
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,680
Adam is the man, uh...

208
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,680
He's down in that hole.

209
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,680
In the hole.

210
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,680
Oh, the helmet guy?

211
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,680
Yeah.

212
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,680
No, I don't know who that is.

213
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,080
Do you know what he thought was down there?

214
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,080
Have you seen this door before?

215
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:27,320
Do you know anything about what's going on here at Bean's Pond?

216
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,320
No.

217
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,320
Did you say how you found us?

218
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:36,000
Well yeah, I came to town to break into your house, and then I saw this big floating wall

219
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:45,780
of water that was filled with fish, and I thought to myself, you know what, that might

220
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,840
be a place that I wanna go.

221
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,380
And then it turns out my old partner's fucking here.

222
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:52,360
And she kinda like goes up and elbows you?

223
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:56,120
When we got to town, we were saving the fish wall thingy for last.

224
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,640
Oh, well we did opposites, I suppose.

225
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,520
Seemed like the most exciting thing.

226
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:07,000
Maybe we should just go for the big fish wall next time.

227
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,160
That's what Anne Love would do.

228
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,040
Oh, by the way, my name's Anne Love.

229
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,720
I don't know if you knew that.

230
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,960
Hi, my name's John Lee Pettymore.

231
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,200
Same as my daddy and my daddy before.

232
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,840
Oh, for real?

233
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,840
That's like, that's your actual name?

234
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,840
Yeah.

235
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,160
Oh damn, that's me.

236
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,160
Okay, cool.

237
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,160
John.

238
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,160
Nice to meet you, John.

239
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,200
Thanks, man.

240
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,040
Alright, you guys wanna go continue to save the world?

241
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,040
We gotta kill this cat, though.

242
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,040
Provisionally.

243
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,040
Oh, we should kill this cat.

244
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,040
I don't care.

245
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,040
We gotta kill this cat.

246
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:39,920
At that point, Agent Shrink Cat, who's on top of the radio, has turned from being extremely

247
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:46,080
hopeful that John Lee Pettymore would help him ooze his way into this radio to like,

248
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,080
wait, what?

249
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:51,640
I thought he turned on us after my offer of, he threw gun, he threw dirt in my gun.

250
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,840
Yeah, he thought you were gonna kill him.

251
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:58,520
He recently, though, has been pointing at, he was pointing at the on-off switch on the

252
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,520
thing?

253
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:03,160
Yeah, he was pointing at the broken tube of the radio, and then he was pointing at John.

254
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:08,160
He was mostly just afraid when you failed the role, it was less of a, like, turning

255
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:13,260
him on you, more of a, he's still afraid that you're gonna try to kill him kind of thing.

256
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:17,160
But with the conversation that's been happening since then, especially the one where he got

257
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:26,120
outed as, uh, a member of a, uh, posing force, if you will, of the unnatural, he's gotten

258
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,120
worried.

259
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,120
Hold on, Ann.

260
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,120
I think he's more of a use to us alive than dead.

261
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,360
Okay, well, you know.

262
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,360
I wink at the cat.

263
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,480
The cat winks back.

264
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,520
Cool.

265
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:45,160
And Carrie Pages is, like, sitting in the mud, just kind of, like, drawing in it.

266
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,160
Hey, Drew.

267
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:53,440
Hey, yeah, no, sorry, um, this is all going way over my head, and I would rather not have

268
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:59,460
this knowledge if it means that, if it's gonna make me feel worse in my head space, then

269
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:02,000
I would rather not have this knowledge.

270
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,160
So I would like to go home, I guess.

271
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,680
Drew, I understand.

272
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,880
I totally understand.

273
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,720
Drew, I was, I was hoping I could ask you a couple questions before you, before we got

274
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,720
you home.

275
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,720
Is that okay?

276
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,000
With some of the knowledge that's in your head space?

277
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:23,120
Yes, no, of course, um, I am willing to answer any questions from you guys, obviously, as

278
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,320
long as Miss Karen...

279
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,320
Karen, we'll...

280
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,500
Yeah, we'll be right with you, Karen.

281
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:32,320
We'll head your way after we finish talking to Miss Pages here.

282
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,320
Councilwoman?

283
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,320
Yes, of course.

284
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,480
Can you tell me what you learned from your time at, uh...

285
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,480
Big winks.

286
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,480
Yeah.

287
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,600
At the side of Adam there?

288
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,600
What happened?

289
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,600
Were you at the church?

290
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,160
Well, he points to the radio.

291
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:53,560
They used that to switch our bodies, of course, and then I was blindfolded and held in a,

292
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,800
in a side room until I was brought here.

293
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,520
Oh, good.

294
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:05,160
How did the, how'd they get ahold of you in the, in the first place?

295
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,840
Were you, were you attacked, kidnapped?

296
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,080
Did you seek them out?

297
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,080
What happened here?

298
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,080
Oh yeah, no, right.

299
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:17,000
So, I was out and about, and I was getting a cat carrier for you all, and then we had

300
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:23,840
a phone conversation, and then I believe it was that old, um, oh, what's his name?

301
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,840
That ne'er-do-well.

302
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,840
Terrence.

303
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:31,880
Yeah, Terrence Liquor and, uh, the other one, the Rocky Balboa little fella.

304
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,880
Fade.

305
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,880
Oh yeah, Fade.

306
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:38,880
Uh, Fade, can't pronounce his last name, was, uh, they, they came and they, they grabbed

307
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,120
me and they, they brought me to the church.

308
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:46,120
And did they ever mention a plan or a goal with you?

309
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:50,760
Well, yeah, they were going to sacrifice everyone's bodies in order to get the pastor to go back

310
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:57,760
in time to save the world, I guess was their plan, but it never made much sense to me because

311
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,200
I had all the faith in the world and the three of you.

312
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,200
Aw.

313
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,200
Thanks, Drew.

314
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,200
We're still working.

315
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,880
Yeah, how much, how, how much progress did they make on that sacrifice and everybody's

316
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,880
body's part?

317
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:15,560
Well, no, it was supposed to be an all-at-once deal, so, I mean, yeah, I mean, bodies were,

318
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:19,160
were useful, but he, he was mostly keeping everyone alive.

319
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:25,960
I would assume that they're all still at the first church of contention, but then looking

320
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:32,220
around, I guess the first church of contention is unguarded currently.

321
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:35,160
It does seem like the water's here and not there.

322
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:38,080
I mean, there might be enough puddles there for everyone.

323
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,260
That's what they were calling the pools where they could hide from this, they kept calling

324
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,400
it residue.

325
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,400
We call it goo.

326
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,400
Oh, from the goo.

327
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,400
I like that much better.

328
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,400
Well, you were there.

329
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,400
You're Drew.

330
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:54,920
Yes, I am and I've always liked that much better.

331
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:59,040
It's hard to do one voice when you're trying to be in the mind of another.

332
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:03,440
I can only imagine.

333
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:08,120
Del Blanc, they always talk about a sign that he was such a great voice actor.

334
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:15,280
He did like Porky Pig and, uh, he could do his other characters doing his other characters.

335
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,480
So he could do like Elmer Fudd doing Porky Pig or whatever.

336
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,480
Yeah.

337
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,480
What would that sound like?

338
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,480
I can't do either.

339
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,480
Normally.

340
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:30,600
Why, get that wasque, wasque, wasque, wasque rabbit.

341
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,600
Nailed it.

342
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,600
Yeah.

343
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,200
I turned to John.

344
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:40,480
My one idea now is we could send Drew back to his body with the radio and the four wheeler

345
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:46,680
and we give him something to do, maybe put him back in his own body and we could go with

346
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,680
Anne here.

347
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:52,520
I was only eavesdropping a little bit, but that sounds fantastic to me.

348
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:57,120
If you could direct me in the right direction, then I could get back into my own body and

349
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:05,480
not be, and Drew kind of looks down and it's like in Gary Page's body.

350
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,720
Do we trust the sewer people with the radio?

351
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,040
I trust Gary and Harry for sure.

352
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,400
Who's all down there?

353
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,520
Mildred Mitchell's down there.

354
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,720
And then your body is down there.

355
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,320
Last we left it, it was unconscious.

356
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,320
Is it hurt?

357
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,040
It took a couple of spills, but nothing you can't handle, Drew.

358
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,040
Yeah.

359
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,440
Okay, well let's get going.

360
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,000
That sounds like a great idea to me.

361
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,460
If you'll excuse me, Kitty.

362
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:32,380
Back at Ang's house during that firefight out on the lawn, I picked up another snub

363
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,380
does revolver.

364
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:39,540
I'm going to hand that to Kerry, just in case it comes in handy.

365
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,860
You got protection.

366
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:41,860
Okay.

367
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:47,720
And Kerry gets really emotional, looks at John Lee Pettymore the third and says, your

368
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:57,240
son taught me how to shoot one of these and I will never forget him for that and everything

369
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,800
that he's done for me.

370
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:04,800
Big grin comes across my face and I put both hands on his shoulders and I said, no, Drew,

371
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,320
bubble gum tree.

372
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:13,320
And Kerry Page's eyes light up and Drew just like throws his arms around you.

373
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,760
Hey little buddy.

374
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,760
John, is this really you?

375
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,760
More or less, yeah.

376
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,760
Oh my God.

377
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,980
This whole time I thought that it was, Oh my God.

378
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,480
So we're all really indifferent.

379
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,360
I mean, Clark, you're still Clark.

380
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,360
Yeah.

381
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:32,820
I mean, except for Clark and well, Keith is kind of MIA down the bottom of the pond,

382
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:35,120
but otherwise it's just all a big switcheroo.

383
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,460
Oh boy.

384
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:38,920
This must be really confusing for everyone.

385
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:43,480
Some folks have trouble keeping up with it, yeah, but not us.

386
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:51,800
Well, John, I don't know how to repay you for, thank you.

387
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:58,040
Then he turns, she turns, he turns to and love.

388
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:03,480
And thank you, you, I think saved my life and puts out a hand.

389
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:06,920
Maybe, maybe don't, maybe don't, maybe don't put out a hand.

390
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,920
Oh, yep.

391
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,920
Okay, sure.

392
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,220
Uh, I'll just take this four wheeler then.

393
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:17,380
If you guys want to direct me in the appropriate direction to hit the sewers and kitty, are

394
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:19,620
you going with them or are you coming with me?

395
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:22,660
And the cat is like pointing at the radio.

396
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:30,140
I still think, I still think that we should kill it.

397
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:34,060
Noted.

398
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:38,620
This page is Harry put up a sign at clinkers showing you where to go.

399
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:41,580
If you, if you can get to clinkers, you can, you can find them down there.

400
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:47,980
You look to where clinkers would be because it's just like a block past this water wall.

401
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:55,380
Anyway, here's water wall.

402
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,380
Throwing it back to you.

403
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:58,380
What do you guys want to do?

404
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:01,900
John, do you think we should, uh, like leave a note or something?

405
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,620
Keith is still just down there.

406
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:05,840
I assume he's going to come back up at some point.

407
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,440
You could probably write it in the mud.

408
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,440
Go get rained away.

409
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,440
I don't know.

410
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,960
Hey, I'll probably figure it out, but if you want to leave something in the mud, that's

411
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,960
fine with me.

412
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,280
I'm going to pat down my uniform.

413
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,520
Do I maybe have a notepad on me?

414
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:21,600
As you guys are doing this, Drew is getting on the four wheeler.

415
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:26,820
Wait, are we really going to go with and love the calm, comfy campground?

416
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:30,960
We need to get in this fucking hole and gives you a salute.

417
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:37,160
And then with the cat on the back, I feel like they drive up out of beans pond.

418
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,160
We should have gone with him.

419
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,160
Okay.

420
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:48,040
When we started this entire campaign, my total, my absolute hope was that Drew Andrews and

421
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:54,520
the body of Kerry pages would be driving the four wheeler that was brought here 25 years

422
00:22:54,520 --> 00:23:02,840
ago out of a dry beans pond with agent Trent, Chad, a city asylum employee in the body of

423
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:12,480
Dr. Marie Andrews is cat Salem out and then toward clinkers to find a hidden message in

424
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:20,120
the signs to find out where they are in the sewers and love is like, Hey, is that my four

425
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,120
wheeler?

426
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,600
I felt like this has been pretty railroaded the whole time.

427
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:27,400
You're right.

428
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,400
It was obvious.

429
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,360
You wanted us to get to hear it, man.

430
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:38,320
We've been, I remember when you guys went to the city, I was like, Oh fuck.

431
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:44,440
They don't understand my vision at all.

432
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,440
God damn it.

433
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,440
This has been fun.

434
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,440
All right.

435
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,440
It's not over yet.

436
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,440
Not even by a little bit.

437
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,880
So let's keep going.

438
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,560
The four wheeler drives up and out and, and love looks at you and is like, why wouldn't

439
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,840
you want to go with me?

440
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,840
We need to go to Bishop's.

441
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,240
We need to get the book.

442
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:04,540
If you finally tell us where it is, then we could have it in the circle of knowledge.

443
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:07,320
We can do whatever we want.

444
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:10,200
Honestly, I'm not a big fan of Maggie.

445
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:14,800
If you guys want to take over the three of us could take over and, and could you just

446
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,080
give me, give me one, one second.

447
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,960
And I want to pull John away a little bit.

448
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:24,360
John, um, do you remember that whole business at the, at the college in our, in our last

449
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,360
lives?

450
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,360
Yeah.

451
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:31,600
Right before all that happened, Leon wanted to take me to the common comfy campground

452
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:36,320
and at the last minute had a change of heart and decided that we should investigate the

453
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:40,660
college stuff, which I think we found out after the fact, it seemed kind of like a personal

454
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:46,720
thing for him, but his actual mission was to get me to the common comfy campground.

455
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,760
So it seems like the circle wants us there at least.

456
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,760
Yeah.

457
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:56,800
But we learned a lot about the circle just now that kind of makes it seem a little unsavory.

458
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:01,560
I don't, I didn't like all that new new world order business, but the, the creature is real.

459
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:06,320
The creature I saw and it could, it could end at all.

460
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,320
Yeah.

461
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:13,800
What if we kill Ann though and just focus on trying to get Keith out of that hole.

462
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:17,480
I feel like someone or something is throwing a lot of distractions at us.

463
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:21,040
I just want to focus on one thing.

464
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:25,880
As much as I hate her, there's nothing that she could say or do that would ever make me

465
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:28,720
call myself on her side.

466
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,300
But at this point she's saying some of the right things that she doesn't necessarily

467
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:35,840
care about Maggie, which we've had her doubts about Maggie.

468
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,800
She knows a lot about what's going on.

469
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,800
Clearly.

470
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,800
She's not like got good intentions.

471
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:44,800
I mean us in power means the new world order thing wouldn't happen.

472
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,800
I think that happens no matter what we just be running it.

473
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:53,760
I don't know if that'd be so bad if we could, if we could change it from the inside.

474
00:25:53,760 --> 00:26:00,680
I just want to watch my Smokies and sit around with my money and my family.

475
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,680
How about, how about this?

476
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:05,880
How about we just, you and I both know that killing her wouldn't be too much sweat off

477
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,000
our backs, me especially.

478
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,480
So let's just have that in our back pocket.

479
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:13,080
The first time things get hanky, we can pop her.

480
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,080
No questions asked.

481
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,460
I think you're taking, I think you're trying to take us to comp company campground right

482
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,840
now is the definition of hanky.

483
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,840
Seems hanky to me.

484
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:23,520
That's what I'm saying though is what about Keith man?

485
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,280
I mean, yeah.

486
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:28,280
What about Keith?

487
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:40,960
Well, when you put it that way, I don't know, dude.

488
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,960
I don't trust her.

489
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:42,960
I don't think we should go.

490
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:43,960
I don't like it.

491
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,960
I think we got to help Keith.

492
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,400
Well, how, how would we, how would we do that?

493
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,400
Fuck.

494
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,400
They opened the door somehow.

495
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:53,520
I kind of wondered maybe and knows more about it than she's letting on.

496
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,200
I was asking her about it.

497
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,200
That's what I thought.

498
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,760
I was hoping she would know that.

499
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:03,120
I'm kind of wondering now if it opened because Keith was near it, it has his name on it.

500
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,120
Yeah.

501
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,120
That's not a bad thought.

502
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,120
Oh, you know what it was?

503
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,120
I bet it was the watch.

504
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,400
He had the watch on.

505
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,040
That savior and son of a bitch.

506
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,240
Well.

507
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:21,240
And at that exact moment, you hear a rushing of a waterfall as whatever unnatural force

508
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:28,800
was holding up either side of this water wall relinquishes control and like a sheet of ice

509
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:35,520
or a long cloth or a string of beads, this floating moat comes crashing down into the

510
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:45,040
ground on mass, erupting both away from and into Bean's pond where the three of you are

511
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,280
currently chit chatting.

512
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:52,360
I need both of you to roll swim checks.

513
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:57,440
That's something I sure as shit didn't put any points into.

514
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,960
Ann Love rolled a four.

515
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,960
Good for her.

516
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,960
Oh my God.

517
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:01,960
I pass.

518
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,560
So I have the baseline 20 and I rolled a 10.

519
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:06,520
I have the baseline 20 and I rolled a 54.

520
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:09,440
Clark, you see this thing.

521
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,720
It's just.

522
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:19,000
And from all sides simultaneously, this mushroom shaped lack of pond is filling back up and

523
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,400
becoming a pond.

524
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:27,200
And as you're trying to run, we got muddy feet and it's filling all the way to the top

525
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,480
as you swim.

526
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,640
You uh, you can stay afloat the entire time where you're only, you don't take in much

527
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,440
water as you're making your way up out of there.

528
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:40,960
John, you actually have some issues as John Lee Pettymore the third is trying to swim

529
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:41,960
out.

530
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:42,960
You feel.

531
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:43,960
You're kind of roboty.

532
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,280
Is it sinking him?

533
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,280
Holy shit.

534
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,280
That's perfect.

535
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,280
Yeah.

536
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:52,560
John, you feel the weight of the metal in your endoskeleton pulling you further and

537
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:57,560
further down into the murky fish frenzy that is beans pond.

538
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:02,760
Oh, and you feel the intense buzzing inside your skull that you felt when you dunked your

539
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:09,320
head into the truck bed puddle and the static is growing and growing, but suddenly you're

540
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:14,560
moving upward toward the surface at a rapid clip.

541
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:23,440
And as you break through the top of the water, you hear fossilism, fossilism, fossilism,

542
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:30,200
and you see and love holding out one hand toward you and her other hand down at her

543
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,200
feet.

544
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:39,400
And she is standing on the pond and you are standing on the pond.

545
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:44,360
She puts her hand on your shoulder and as you catch your breath, she walks you off of

546
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:52,120
this teeming overflowing pond and onto the bank next to Clark Bishop, still ankle deep

547
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:59,040
due to the excess water in the wall.

548
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,040
Holy shit Kev lucky for you.

549
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:13,040
I was here and we were going to kill you.

550
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,520
What up dude?

551
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,520
How you would have been.

552
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,080
Oh, we got a screen share right off the bat.

553
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,080
Oh boy.

554
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,080
What are we?

555
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,080
I just typed in borf.

556
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,080
Okay.

557
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,480
You didn't know what you were doing when you typed in borf.

558
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:28,960
Oh, that is a, um, there's a furry.

559
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,760
I like this one better.

560
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,760
Oh boy.

561
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:36,760
Ooh, this is a borf gets you a lot of good stuff.

562
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:41,160
On our call of Cthulhu game, uh, Luke learned what yiffing was.

563
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,160
Oh yeah.

564
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,160
Furry sex.

565
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:47,640
That was, I don't know if that came from the chat or if that just came up.

566
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:53,480
I don't remember why it came up, but when you look up borf, there's a fair amount of

567
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,840
animal fucking going on in here.

568
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,360
Oh, this guy's name's borf too.

569
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,520
He's a little alien.

570
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,000
It looks like a flubber became a person.

571
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,720
It's like a flubber and Ghostbusters mix.

572
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,720
Ew.

573
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,720
Yeah.

574
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,040
Oh, can you imagine if Robin Williams had been in Ghostbusters?

575
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,040
I can't imagine.

576
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:14,320
It would go a little something like this.

577
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,280
Hey everybody, gotta get the ghost.

578
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,280
Gotta get the ghost.

579
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,280
Oh.

580
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,280
Is that good?

581
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,280
It was good enough.

582
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,280
Trying these letters.

583
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,280
We gotta call.

584
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,280
We gotta call.

585
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:31,400
It's a something.

586
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,400
Funny always gets good stuff.

587
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,400
Okay.

588
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,520
Look, do you remember where we were last time?

589
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:40,540
That is a baby with a handlebar mustache.

590
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:42,320
It's a very good look.

591
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,080
Advanced sharing options.

592
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,540
Who can share?

593
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:46,540
Only host.

594
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:47,540
Aww.

595
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:48,540
There it is.

596
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:52,400
I guess I'll get out of this then.

597
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,080
What a shame.

598
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,320
It's fun being on Zoom calls with you, Luke.

599
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,220
Let's play games.

600
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:01,180
Let's play games.

601
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:10,760
Last time you went down an elevator shaft, an old mining elevator down and then opened

602
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:18,620
up a sealed blast door like from a bunker, entered a large cavernous room.

603
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:19,660
Your ears popped.

604
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:20,660
You did the yawn.

605
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:21,660
I did.

606
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:25,280
Sorry, what was that?

607
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:29,460
It's a shame that this is only an audio medium because...

608
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:39,320
Unless you subscribe to the Patreon, then once a month you get to watch me do this.

609
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:44,780
So you went down here, you found papers that were blueprints for the four items that we've

610
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:50,780
come to know as the items that were in the trunk that Jon Peters brought to his home

611
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:58,100
from the green box over at, I want to say, A Plus Storage was the name, and those four

612
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:03,500
items were the gun, the helmet, the radio, and the camera.

613
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:11,540
And you found scientific math that did not quite add up to come up with the engineering

614
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:13,580
to make those items possible.

615
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:21,140
You also found some notes about different spells this person was trying out in an attempt

616
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:31,460
at eternal life, and then you finally found twenty-five attempts at making a manipulating

617
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:41,700
activator colon robot, A through Y, with the final one being codename Mary saw the picture

618
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:48,340
of a small metal sphere that was one inch in diameter, and at the bottom it said host

619
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:50,500
found.

620
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,580
And yes, I was excited.

621
00:33:52,580 --> 00:34:00,540
You tried out one of these spells for the eternal life situation, you gave it a go,

622
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:06,620
and when you said the words enough times, or maybe the right way, or maybe with the

623
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:13,460
correct pronunciation, your bones began to vibrate, and then you felt all of your toenails

624
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:21,180
and fingernails popping like popcorn off of your body, and at that exact moment, you heard

625
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:27,660
the blast door that was on the far side of this room, something rammed itself.

626
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:29,860
Probably something spooky.

627
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:30,860
Might be a dragon.

628
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:31,860
Look at my new name.

629
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:32,860
I don't get it.

630
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:34,460
Because it doesn't have nails.

631
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:35,460
No nails required.

632
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:36,980
Oh my god.

633
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:41,140
It says dovetail joint, and I'm not a craftsman.

634
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:49,060
Okay, so, when I look at my hand, like, what's that look like?

635
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:56,460
Well, it looks like a hand, but instead of nails, there is a wrinkly bed of skin.

636
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:59,980
So the nails popped like popcorn and fell off?

637
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:00,980
Yes.

638
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:03,740
If I touch them on the ground, are they still like nails?

639
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:04,740
They're brittle.

640
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:07,460
I put one in my pocket.

641
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:08,980
I put all of them in my pocket.

642
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:13,580
Okay, as you're collecting them, they are brittle like cat's nails.

643
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:15,580
They're like ogres.

644
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:16,580
They're like ogres?

645
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:17,900
Yeah, they have layers.

646
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:25,060
So as they kind of splinter apart as you're touching them, they're like extremely weak

647
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:26,060
nails.

648
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,060
Okay.

649
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,420
I've got ten of those in my pocket.

650
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:30,940
Okay, so probably a hundred shards.

651
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:36,260
Okay, I want to take my shoes off and empty the nails out of there, and then put my shoes

652
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,260
back on.

653
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,260
What was your foot situation?

654
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:39,780
Did you have on boat shoes?

655
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:41,060
Yes, I did.

656
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:42,060
So no socks.

657
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:45,260
These were all just in your smelly smelly.

658
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:46,260
And they stink.

659
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:47,260
They stink.

660
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:50,460
Also, remember, I fell into- no, no, no!

661
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:51,460
I took my shoes off.

662
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:52,460
Oh yeah, you took them off.

663
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:59,260
So looking on the ground, you can look back and see the trail of muddy footprints, and

664
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:04,900
you're not quite sure whether it's all mud on those footprints on the concrete ground,

665
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:05,900
but you see these shards.

666
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:08,200
I'm going to put my toenails in my pockets too.

667
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:11,060
So you've got roughly 200 shards of nail.

668
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:12,060
In that left pocket.

669
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:13,340
In only the left pocket.

670
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,700
Left cargo pocket.

671
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,820
Like in the button up one.

672
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:20,420
You remember those Halloween games when you were a kid where they'd have you put your

673
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:21,420
hand into a bowl?

674
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:23,420
Like spaghetti and grapes.

675
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:30,460
Yeah, imagine what it would be like to put your hand into just 200 shards of brittle

676
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:31,460
nail.

677
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:32,460
No, thank you.

678
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,180
I almost just threw up saying that.

679
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:41,900
Okay, so now that I've got that done, I'm going to clean up.

680
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:44,060
Another slam into this door.

681
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:48,460
Do I physically feel any different other than not having nails?

682
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:51,580
God, it's an emptiness?

683
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:57,420
It's for sure emptiness, but it feels infinite in its helpfulness.

684
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:01,100
Okay, am I still bleeding out of my bullet wounds?

685
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,100
Yes, very much so.

686
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,100
Okay.

687
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:07,760
I'm going to peer through the window on this blast door and see what's making the commotion.

688
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,620
As you're peering through this circular...

689
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:12,220
What are those called?

690
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:14,980
Circle window.

691
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:15,980
Like a porthole?

692
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:16,980
And a sub-mer...

693
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:17,980
Yes, thank you.

694
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:22,260
So you're looking through this essentially porthole on this blast door.

695
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:28,220
The lights in this cavernous room shine down at just the perfect angle to illuminate a

696
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:35,340
small circle of the floor of whatever room is behind this blast door, which is otherwise

697
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:38,860
drenched in perfect darkness.

698
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:49,980
And in this well-lit ring, you can see the grayish, withering, nail-free feet of a human.

699
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:56,940
Immediately this creature rushes the door once more, and it smushes its face against

700
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:58,940
the glass.

701
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:06,860
Staring at you with wild eyes is the skeletal, pallid face of a teenage girl.

702
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:09,820
Her skin is thin and decaying.

703
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:18,020
Small tears have opened up sores on her cheekbones, nose, and chin, where bone is peeking out

704
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:20,740
under infected lesions.

705
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:27,780
Her scalp looks the same, where it isn't covered by patches of this thin, brittle hair.

706
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:36,620
But still, enough of her is there to recognize Tildi B. Mitchell.

707
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:40,140
No fucking way.

708
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:44,940
And when she makes eye contact with you, she shrieks.

709
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:51,420
I gotta get her out of there.

710
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:55,900
Gonna help her.

711
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:58,460
I'm terrified.

712
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:00,460
Roll Sanity.

713
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:05,420
39 on, I'm sure I have less than that.

714
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:06,420
7.

715
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:08,420
I wouldn't roll a d4.

716
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:09,420
3.

717
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:15,740
You stumble backwards, and you fall to the ground, and a panel in the concrete right

718
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:19,980
next to you begins to kind of pshhh.

719
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:23,060
And this square in the concrete kind of opens up.

720
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:28,220
It's weird, you get the innate feeling that your watch was close enough to the ground

721
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:29,620
in this exact spot.

722
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:34,980
And as this panel lifts up out of the ground, it seems like you can remove a square of the

723
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:39,540
concrete in the ground a foot down.

724
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:46,700
There is a revolver, an old timey revolver, with weird, odd metal all over it, and these

725
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:51,780
glass tubes, and it's got a green light that's lit.

726
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:54,180
I wanna reach in and grab it.

727
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:55,300
Is there anything else in that hole?

728
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,300
No there is not.

729
00:39:56,300 --> 00:40:03,940
Okay, I'm gonna put it down on the ground very carefully, as to not break any tubes.

730
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:10,460
And I want to, in this whole room, I'm gonna just walk around with my watch, like an inch

731
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:13,260
from the ground, to see if anything else opens up.

732
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:14,900
Ooh, okay, fun!

733
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:15,900
Yeah.

734
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:18,900
Go ahead and roll.

735
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:19,900
Roll on natural.

736
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:21,900
What do I have in there?

737
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:22,900
50.

738
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:26,660
Now he's showing me, he's showing me what he rolled on the camera.

739
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:28,580
He rolled a 50 on a 50.

740
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:29,580
Hell yeah.

741
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:30,580
You motherfucker.

742
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:31,580
Okay, absolutely.

743
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:32,580
Abso-fucking-lutely.

744
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:38,460
When you go, and you're like, basically, you're that dude on the beach.

745
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:39,460
Gotta find some quarters.

746
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:42,820
Just trying to find some quarters, baby, and hopefully they're from the right year.

747
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:43,820
You know?

748
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:44,820
Yeah.

749
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:45,820
2019.

750
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:49,340
Oh, those 2019 quarters are super rare.

751
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:50,340
Yep.

752
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:54,140
The newest, the newer the coin, the better they are.

753
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:56,260
2020 would be a real find.

754
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:57,740
I don't think they exist.

755
00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:00,820
Well, that's why it would be so rare.

756
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:10,260
And another concrete square, about a foot by a foot, opens up out of the ground and

757
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:18,060
looking down into this spot, you see a single metal sphere, about one inch in diameter.

758
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:22,420
Ooh, I don't know if I want to touch it or not.

759
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:24,420
Um, hmm.

760
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:27,180
I want to check and make sure I still have my photo on me.

761
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:33,620
When you look at the photograph that you have in your pocket, it is still your face as Silas

762
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:34,620
Cole.

763
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:35,620
Okay.

764
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:38,980
What were the words on that piece of paper that was her face wrapped?

765
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:40,220
Roll intelligence.

766
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:45,220
I think one, a couple episodes ago, I remembered it, but I'll roll again.

767
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:48,060
Yeah, if you don't remember, then you have to roll.

768
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:53,020
Forty-four on a fifty.

769
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:54,500
Hell yeah.

770
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,660
You're just a, just to make sure, you know?

771
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:58,140
I trust you.

772
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,140
I like doing it though.

773
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:00,140
Yeah, it's fun.

774
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:01,140
It is fun.

775
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:02,140
Show me what you got.

776
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:07,940
I look at the photo and I'm like, hmm, oh yeah, those words, I remember exactly what

777
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:09,100
they are there.

778
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:11,780
Because you wrote them, you pulled out a Sharpie and you wrote them on the back of the picture.

779
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:13,980
I wrote it on the back of the picture.

780
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:18,900
And then I also wrote, this is Keith Bean's picture, don't steal it.

781
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:25,300
It says, ianaha fersat sayiya.

782
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:28,460
When I think of those words, how do I feel?

783
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:29,460
Any different?

784
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:30,460
Nope.

785
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:36,180
Keith thinks up for a second, he's like, well, we've already chanted something weird today,

786
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:46,700
so ianaha fersat sayiya, ianaha fersat sayiya, ianaha fersat sayiya.

787
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:49,780
Roll just a check against fifty.

788
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:54,340
Ooh, sixty-four on a fifty, so I fail.

789
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:59,160
So that means I get to choose what it does.

790
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:03,740
This spell had basically a mechanic where I didn't know that you were going to go bat

791
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:08,100
shit crazy and fuck up Mildred Mitchell.

792
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:14,960
And I made this spell where all four of us had a twenty-five percent chance of being

793
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:20,020
the one who got to come up with what the spell does.

794
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:25,100
But since it's only me and you here, I just have you roll basically a fifty-fifty shot

795
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:27,980
to decide who gets to choose what the spell does.

796
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:28,980
And I get to choose.

797
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:30,820
It can only be three words.

798
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:33,100
What the spell does can only be three words.

799
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:34,100
Yeah.

800
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:36,040
Makes brain smart.

801
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:39,760
Oh boy, okay.

802
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:44,380
Don't say penis falls off, oops.

803
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:47,660
I prayed for that one before I lost my fingernails.

804
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:49,500
You did indeed.

805
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:54,540
There's lots of combinations of three words you could make.

806
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:55,540
Okay.

807
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:56,540
I'm nervous.

808
00:43:56,540 --> 00:44:04,300
As you begin to chant, you feel your bones once again begin to vibrate, but Keith Beans

809
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:06,180
is more than bone.

810
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:13,820
Keith Beans is partially made of metal, and all of that metal begins to heat up.

811
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:21,900
You can feel it inside you throbbing with pain right before your skin begins splitting

812
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:22,920
open.

813
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:33,740
It starts at your index finger and your body slowly begins to unzip the rip peeling apart

814
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:40,460
and the seam shooting up your forearm past your elbow, continuing toward your shoulder

815
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:49,820
as the metal inside this arm begins falling out and clanking on the concrete floor below.

816
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:57,360
The opening of your body does not cease, however, and your skin continues to burst open, unzipping

817
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:05,060
itself up your neck, and it finally halts its progress at the tear duct of the eye.

818
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:10,540
The glass scientists had to surgically set back into its socket.

819
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:14,780
The pain is searing and unbearable.

820
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:23,140
Your metal septum shifts to one side and slides out of your nostril.

821
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:30,860
An endless stream of cocaine pours onto the ground, forming an anthill mound of white

822
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:34,100
powder on the uneven concrete.

823
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:46,260
Half of your upper body is an empty, slashed-open skin seam, and with that, the real pain begins.

824
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:51,860
Bones begin cracking and forming.

825
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:54,780
The bone and muscle starts growing.

826
00:45:54,780 --> 00:46:00,780
Your nerve endings are lighting up like the finale of a fireworks show, this torrid pain

827
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:07,500
taking away your breath, your body is covered in sweat, and you feel like this horror will

828
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:16,860
never end, but finally, your skin begins zipping itself back up, and when it's finished, you

829
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:19,620
can't even find the seam.

830
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:28,420
The only evidence of what you just lived through is the pile of cocaine and metal skeletal

831
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:34,700
structures strewn about on the ground below you.

832
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:35,700
Does it still hurt?

833
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:37,500
It hurts like a motherfucker.

834
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:42,020
Well, I don't think Keith could have pulled off the one-armed Voldemort look, so I'm glad

835
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:45,300
it came back at least.

836
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:47,040
Keith is freaking the fuck out.

837
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,460
How long does this process take?

838
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:52,100
It takes, what, ten minutes?

839
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:54,140
So what are you doing while this is happening?

840
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:55,820
Are you just standing there letting it happen?

841
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:57,460
Are you walking around?

842
00:46:57,460 --> 00:46:58,460
Are you falling over?

843
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:04,820
I'm like just staring at my arm and like, yeah, just like in shock, staring at my arm

844
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:08,700
and like feeling my nose and trying to keep it together.

845
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:15,620
And the spell has completed its intended purpose, as you are made whole again.

846
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:17,060
And I need you to roll sanity.

847
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:20,660
Yeah, I'm gonna fail that unless it's a miracle.

848
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:24,620
Okay, I have a 4% chance of this being a good roll.

849
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:26,580
Oh, I bet you can do it.

850
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:28,100
Nah.

851
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:29,100
87.

852
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:30,100
Okay.

853
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:31,100
Oh, 57.

854
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:32,100
Still a fail.

855
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:37,340
Uh, go ahead and, uh, what do you think?

856
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:38,340
Roll a d4 for me.

857
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:41,260
Okay, I hope that- Your body just fell out of itself and then

858
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:45,820
reformed with human bone- Hope that I don't roll a 4 on this bad boy.

859
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:46,820
You won't.

860
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:47,820
There's no way.

861
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:48,820
Fucking shit.

862
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:49,820
No shit.

863
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:53,820
He's showing me the- He rolled a 4?

864
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:59,060
Oh, Keith Beans.

865
00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:00,740
I don't feel very good.

866
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:06,060
As you hit zero sanity, according to the rules of the game that we definitely always follow

867
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:08,020
to a T- To the T.

868
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:10,820
The handler gets to take over control.

869
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:12,300
Spill the T, baby.

870
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:13,700
Don't mind if I do.

871
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:19,380
Keith Beans, in his newly formed body, walks over to the workstation across this cavernous

872
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:20,740
laboratory.

873
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:25,700
She stuffs as many of the blueprints and notes as he possibly can into the big ol' cargo

874
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:32,260
short pockets, along with his stash of nail shards, before he sets his eyes on the gun

875
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:37,980
he so carefully placed on the ground to avoid cracking those glass tubes.

876
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:46,180
Those glass tubes which he can now see are full of this undulating pitch black ooze.

877
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:52,540
And Keith picks up this odd looking revolver, eagerly considering the lit green light on

878
00:48:52,540 --> 00:49:00,580
the side, which is next to this cylinder, which he slides open, revealing a single oversized

879
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:04,660
bullet that fills the entire chamber.

880
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:12,460
This bullet looks old and dusty, and Keith smiles as he resets the cylinder and pulls

881
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:14,660
back the hammer.

882
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:23,660
With a squeeze of the trigger comes a blinding flash of light, and Keith Beans finds himself

883
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:28,660
standing on a dirty, sandy trail.

884
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:34,220
The smell of piss and shit wafts through the humid summer air, and looking down the

885
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:40,720
road, Keith sees a man just a bit ahead of him walking into town.

886
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:46,860
The camera pans down just in time as Keith Beans strips his shorts off.

887
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:52,120
We steadily move forward over the shit and mud covered shorts and the dusty footpath

888
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:59,680
and words appear at the bottom of the screen in an old western font that reads,

889
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:03,840
Contention 1880 something.

890
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:10,680
As the camera pans back up there in the distance we see a fully naked Keith Beans sprinting

891
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:12,680
toward his target.

892
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:19,840
He hollers out, Hey, Silas Cole, and the man turns around just in time for a sucker punch.

893
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:25,740
As soon as Cole hits the ground, Keith grabs his chin in the back of his neck and extinguishes

894
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:30,560
this man's life with a single twist.

895
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:39,480
Keith is standing over this man's body now, which is face down in the dry, cracked dirt.

896
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:43,120
Face down in the dirt.

897
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:45,680
And this dead body says it doesn't hurt.

898
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:51,160
One day, one job, bad bad, and enough.

899
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:59,400
Yep, guys, if you haven't checked out Red Jumpsuit Apparatus, I'm telling you, top tier,

900
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:01,800
top tier shit.

901
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:08,640
Back to the body on the ground, Keith's hands are trembling as he rolls Silas over a dead

902
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:16,360
man in his mid-20s, stiff as a glass of moonshine, dressed in the fashion of the day, and a tri-folded

903
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:21,600
piece of parchment falls out of this deceased man's jacket pocket.

904
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:27,760
It's a job advertisement for the Contention Mining Company, and it reads,

905
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:33,520
We is hiring able bodies, readying untapped sight.

906
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:35,160
Plenty of work.

907
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:36,880
Hesitate not.

908
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:37,880
Whew!

909
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:41,400
What the hell's gonna happen?

910
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:43,400
Fuck yeah.

911
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:52,640
I'm fucking insane, and in the past, I'm gonna fuck some shit up.

912
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:54,480
It's my town now.

913
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:31,480
How am I the only one trying to pull over?

914
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:42,280
How can you have enough drowning out all the noise?

915
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:46,280
There's nobody home.

916
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:54,280
Nobody home.

917
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:58,280
Fight, fight, streamy night.
