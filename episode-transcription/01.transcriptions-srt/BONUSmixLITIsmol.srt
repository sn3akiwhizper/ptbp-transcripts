Content warning this episode is mighty raunchy and nasty

20

21
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:58,500
Violent if you're ready for the ride then buckle up because

22
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:05,460
Yeah, it's gross. I've been told by my producer to plug the patreon

28
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:42,940
Wi-Fi now, I don't know what the hell Wi-Fi is

29
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:47,340
But I've heard that it can be a bit important for people especially

30
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:54,660
Producers so anyway later this month you can hear Luke run the boys through a scenario of his own

31
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:59,560
Creation his first time running a game and it's a damn home brew

32
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:04,580
I wish someone would home brew me up some delicious nog to drink on

33
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,700
something spicy something creamy

34
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,060

35
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,060

60

So we are here with a very specific purpose and we're gonna jump right into it because I am itching Oh

61
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:48,040
All over my body to play this game like I'm Ray Charles. So let's begin

62
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,640
Right now

63
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:56,200
It's the first week of January in the year of your choosing

64
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,980
2020 wait you choose 2020 I choose

65
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:07,480
2020 I'm gonna do 78 does that mean as federal agents were fully aware of the looming?

66
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,920
coronavirus threat as

67
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:16,400
Federal agents you would be but just know that the civilians on the ground have no idea what's coming

68
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,460
So you need to get your like financials in line now that way

69
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:24,140
You can do better than the people who don't have knowledge

70
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:31,020
an apocalyptic ice storm struck LaFontaine, Missouri on January 2nd an

71
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:38,660
Extreme cold front from the Northeast caused a 30 degree drop in ground temperature over a matter of hours

72
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:43,620
simultaneously humidity reached a hundred percent and a thunderstorm

73
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:52,180
Blanketed the region the rain already barely above freezing coated everything in layer upon layer of ice

74
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:59,380
Roofs collapsed under four inch sheets trees exploded as SAP flash froze in the trunks

75
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:03,380
transformers shorted out and fell flaming from their posts

76
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:08,720
Cars not crushed by falling debris skidded off impassable roads or froze up

77
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:14,900
Flights in and out of the area were canceled the governor declared the city a disaster area

78
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:19,680
But the ice and continuing winter weather prevented dispatch of services

79
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,920
inside LaFontaine a mothballed green box a

80
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:32,240
Storage facility rented by the conspiracy in the old days sent a silent alarm to Delta Green on the night of the storm

81
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:38,480
the contents of the box were never inventoried after the organizational restructuring in 2001 and

82
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,860
Friendly caretaker on site is not responding

83
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:50,520
Delta Green doesn't know what caused the breach or what potential threats might now be in the field and they need eyes on the ground

84
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,140
your eyes

85
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:56,520
the nearest available operatives the players agents your

86
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:02,760
Characters each get a call from a known Delta Green case officer the afternoon of January 5th

87
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:07,160
The call comes in the unusual way in the usual unusual way

88
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,660
From one of the half dozen numbers arranged ahead of time

89
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:15,880
But which frequently change the caller did his best or her best to sound like they were

90
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:22,900
Confirming an ordinary dinner or business meeting. They gave a time and place a private

91
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:27,160
TSA conference room at Lambert Airport, st. Louis, Missouri

92
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:36,220
1145 p.m. That night it was up to each agent to make personal arrangements and get a last-minute flight

93
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,660
to Lambert now

94
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:44,740
I'm gonna get an introduction from each one of you and because we're playing a closed game

95
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:47,940
I'm gonna have everyone else take off their headphones

96
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:51,240
while we're recording each person's

97
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:57,040
Introduction because there might be some stuff in the introduction that you don't want the other players to know and that's completely fine as your Delta

98
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:04,620
Green agents, you won't know each other's identities because we're playing along the the actual rules is written Delta Green strategy

99
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:07,060
So if you actually do learn information about each other

100
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:13,920
I will probably have it come back to bite you at the end of the scenario because that's what happens with knowledge you get burnt

101
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,940
okay, so

102
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:20,060
Let's start. Let's go alphabetical order. So that begins with

103
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:28,940
Joe already everybody else take your headphones off and we'll do how about I you can also deafen the chat or

104
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:32,980
Defen the call. Okay, whatever works as long as you're not listening and

105
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,700
And

106
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,660
when you are

107
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:42,420
Wanted back Justin's not like oh, he's listening to his character voice. He's trying to get in character. I love it

108
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:47,300
so, uh, whenever we want you back, we'll we'll do the the the

109
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,360
classic

110
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,740
bomb

111
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:52,300
banana

112
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:59,660
Making a birds with your hands a bird single bird not multiple birds two birds follow. How will you know which oh

113
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:05,460
I guess it's just your duty to know out the alphabet, which is cool with me

114
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:13,380
Yep, duties and alphabets, baby. Everybody stop listening now, and it'll just be me and Joe

115
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,860
Hello Joe hi Zach

116
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,900
What's up, baby? What's cracking?

117
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,560
You ready to do this? I am

118
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:35,100
I'll just start. Yeah. Yes, please. I'm playing agent Wentworth

119
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:40,820
Some of you might remember that I've played this character before

120
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:48,140
You might not have gleaned from that last time though that he is a hitman he's a straight-up hitman

121
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:51,260
He he goes he jet-sets around killing folks

122
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:56,460
For the government for whoever because

123
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:03,380
It's he just responds to his handler miss Turner who he's been with forever for as long as he can remember and

124
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:08,780
He just drops everything at the at the drop of a hat to do whatever she asks. I

125
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:16,040
Specifically asked Joe to play this character or at least like persuasively suggested it

126
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:20,580
Yeah, for sure. You liked it and I was like, I loved it

127
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:25,680
It was like one of he was one of my favorite characters we've had on the show. Sorry to interrupt carry on

128
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,360
So he got the call from miss Turner and

129
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:34,280
That said that he needed to report to Lambert Airport in st. Louis by 1145

130
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:39,220
she went ahead and arranged for the tickets and left me a credit card and

131
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:44,960
$500 in cash and we also since this is kind of our thing. She has these

132
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,980
custom-made carry-ons that hold

133
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:55,700
Two pistols for him and she left all that at a dead drop for me and I just went on straight to the airport

134
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,700
but before I left I

135
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:03,340
Told the landlord of my apartment building that I needed him to look after the cat for me

136
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:09,700
And he asked why and I said I was gonna go and assess the situation in La Fontaine, Missouri

137
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:17,980
Because I had deduced that that would be the only reason they would send me to st

138
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,980
Louis, Missouri during one of their

139
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:26,600
Worst natural disasters ever and I've always felt like a little bit of the truth helps to sell a lie

140
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,580
That seems like a big part of the truth

141
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:37,660
There's they're sending me there to assess something that's all I said

142
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:42,740
And let's see what else was there the oh

143
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:46,860
Yeah, as I was walking out the door, I remember that they're in the middle of an ice storm

144
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:53,660
So I grabbed a really nice thick black pea coat and a wool stocking cap because I thought things might get chilly

145
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:59,460
And indeed it's gonna start really fucking cold

146
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:06,580
Middle of an ice storm. So that makes sense. Shall we bird? Shall we make our bird hands together? Oh

147
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,340
Yes

148
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:12,060
They're not watching. You can see it and they love it

149
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,820
They all love it so much

150
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:20,340
Justin's Justin's on it. He's on it. He's got you can all tell what's happening. Well, thankfully Justin

151
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,340
Exactly. All right, I'm out. Bye Joe

152
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,820
And hello Justin

153
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,820
Hey, what's up?

154
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:40,940
How is it going, man? It's gone pretty damn good here in the Ozarks

155
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,720
You're playing my character is not

156
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:53,700
Okay, interesting. So I don't know why I was doing that fun time voice, but you know

157
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:58,580
My character's name is William T Wiggins

158
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:02,540
he is a coroner in a small town in Illinois, so

159
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:05,180
someone close to

160
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:09,860
The East border with st. Louis. I'm gonna assume not too far

161
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,900
He's a short and pale

162
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:17,540
Lad with black hair like like jet black hair

163
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,620
I

164
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:26,820
Almost like to imagine like a middle part but like a handsome middle part like it looks better than the the normal one very sleepy

165
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:33,140
Very sleepy looking thousands middle part. Yeah, like very sleepy with bags under his eyes

166
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:39,540
Seems to always have his mouth covered by a scarf or a mask or shirt collar, etc

167
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:47,180
He is always wearing a really nice suit even when he's doing his coroner duties and

168
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:51,160
black leather gloves when he's not habits when he doesn't have the

169
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:57,700
The medical gloves on he's very strange, but also quite good at his job

170
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:02,900
All right, and what did you bring with you here on this this trip to st. Louis?

171
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:06,880
So I had a handful of things I was gonna bring and let you

172
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:13,240
Veto some of them if you want to hit me with him also, what's your last name again real quick Wiggins William T

173
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:19,600
Wiggins, how could I forgot Billy Wiggins? Is that a person did I fuck up and make him a person?

174
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,200
Oh, you're just making fun of his name. He doesn't like when people call him Willie, by the way, so I

175
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,680
Won't let him know that you did that cuz you're an omnipresent God in this world

176
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,220
That's really cool of you

177
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:36,140
But just know that you're gonna somewhere deep down inside of your character and know that God

178
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,980
I

179
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:44,380
So I wanted to have like surgical masks and gloves

180
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:48,940
Leather gloves a scarf magnifying glass

181
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:54,820
First aid supplies of some kind I didn't know if those are allowed

182
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:59,660
Do you think a scalpel would technically be allowed on a plane?

183
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:04,820
If you were like, I'm a coroner it's a tool for me or is it too knife like

184
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:09,700
Hmm I bet you're not allowed to

185
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:14,740
Unless it's in your but you you could probably put it in your like checked luggage

186
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:17,980
I don't know. Let's say I did that because I'm a coroner

187
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:25,420
So I figured I'd have some kind of cutting instruments like a lighter and some cigarettes like a little zippo lighter and also

188
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,580
A necklace where like if he dies

189
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:35,540
It brings him back to life and also there's a big gun that he can grab from another dimension and

190
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:39,940
It does all it does to deep 30s of damage

191
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:52,660
But I'm glad you let me have the necklace

192
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,660
I

193
00:17:55,740 --> 00:18:02,460
Does he have a necklace no, he's just for sentimental value do is he a corner with a chain?

194
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,800
Like a sick chain

195
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:10,740
Parted parted hair. How old is this? I said 42 early 40s

196
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:19,100
Yep, I mean, I love the idea of him with like a cheap sterling silver chain around his neck just listening to nu metal

197
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,100
Hell yeah, that's up to you

198
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,740
That's if you want that

199
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:30,500
Also, he's he's a five foot seven. He's a shorter shorter than the average human bear

200
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:35,040
All right, and did you say goodbye to anybody? Did you have to cover? Yes, I did

201
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:39,420
Whenever I got the call

202
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:44,360
William was in the morgue doing his work slicing up bodies and whatnot

203
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:49,040
When he got the call, I'm assuming it was probably in the middle of the night

204
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,800
he dropped something into a cadaver and

205
00:18:53,840 --> 00:19:00,120
Looked over to his assistant and said well, well Thaddeus I shall be leaving now

206
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:03,760
There's a personal familial emergency. I must see to

207
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:08,620
Please take care of this any points inside of the corpse

208
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:10,960
Mishap

209
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,960
I'm sure you shall be rewarded

210
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:17,280
Handsomely also, I don't know why we're cutting into this corpse

211
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:23,280
Clearly he has been shot in the head multiple times and then he walks away from Thaddeus

212
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,240
his only friend

213
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:33,640
Thaddeus has seen this happen before or Thaddeus knows I'm just like super weird and I

214
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:39,840
Do kind of whatever I'm very like on a whim. I'll just leave on a whim. I'll just leave

215
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:46,240
And so Thaddeus is used to me being kind of like wishy-washy and just kind of like

216
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,920
I'm having a bad day

217
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:57,120
I I must retire and we've been working together for I'm gonna say like at least a year now and so he

218
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:04,520
He's used to me. Just kind of like getting getting weird about stuff and leaving but I'm good at my job. So he's like

219
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:11,600
It's like a TV character when it's like oh, he's a detective who's super weird, but he's so damn good. We can't help it

220
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:15,640
We have to keep hiring him like monk

221
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,480
Classic example

222
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:26,160
But yeah, so yeah Thaddeus is the shilube Thaddeus always has Williams back because

223
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,720
William is quite nice to him even though he's super weird and and

224
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,520
He's kind of like a treats him like kind of like a son in a weird way

225
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,400
Okay, fantastic

226
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:41,200
Anything else that we should know before we jump in Oh also

227
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:46,400
Interesting side fact that I came up with before this while I was creating the character

228
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:52,960
He is a I decided he is a in his off time. He likes to do fencing

229
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,520
Naturally

230
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:01,160
So you got to put points in melee weapons. He's like weirdly athletic for a a

231
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:05,800
Guy who is a coroner it but it's the only like sport. He likes his fencing

232
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:09,940
He thinks like everything else is stupid and not for smart people because he sucks

233
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:14,580
Yeah, it seems like a super cool dude who I would beat super into hanging out with. Yeah

234
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:19,180
Perfect

235
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,400
Or are you trying to make fun of my character no

236
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:27,560
No, no, I would never shall we shall we fly the birds? Shall we fly the bird for Luke?

237
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,560

255
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:47,080
The number that I don't recognize but I think I know what it is

256
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,920
We're sitting in a car together

257
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,000
and I when I talk I act like I'm talking to my daughter and

258
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,900
After the phone call I look at him I'm like hey

259

260
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:06,800
Daughter just had a emergency. I don't really want to get into it, but I've got to go. Can you can you?

261
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,320
Hold this down on your own

Sure and then I get out of the car take a uber home get a backpack and fill it with

263

Hand and feet warmers since I know I'm going somewhere cold

283
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,240
That there's a resource online you can find it on the subreddit or just Google

284
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:10,040
Delta green character generator or pre generated characters that had they just have 900 whole

285
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,560
That's incredible. So I

286
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,240
Wanted to be a federal agent

287
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,100
There were literally dozens of those filled out

uptight by the book agent characters

295
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:58,380
Googling realistic firearms for an FBI agent to have and I didn't I didn't spend any time looking up

296
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:00,900
What is realistic position in the hierarchy might be?

297
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:08,540
Why don't why don't I check that out and I'll get back to you I'm going a little too Irish now

298
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:20,420
Yes, so you're gonna be playing a fee a FEMA oversight personnel like a suit so

299
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:23,100
Are you going with mr. Lighthouse? Oh

300
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:32,420
I've gone totally Irish now and I can't go don't you know, you just go up north in there over there like that

301
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:34,420
They're over. Yeah Fargo. Okay

302
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:38,260
No, I'm I'm uh, that's just my Delta green

303
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:41,960
Codename and okay, I think I'll go with

304
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:46,620
With mr. Smith Oh, mr. Smith. Oh

305
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:54,060
Yep, hey Irish, okay, so mr. Smith needed to make his way to st. Louis by 11 45 p.m

306
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:59,260
That night who did he have to make excuses to on the way there mrs. Smith, you know

307
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:05,380
She's kind of I I am a federal agent she's used to it

308
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:12,140
Irish she's you don't call it out. You know do it incredibly. I'm going okay. Hold on

309
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:15,900
It just has to be just a little bit more upper Midwest. So

310
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:18,660
Then I then my normal voice so

311
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:23,020
So he excused himself to her and

312
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:27,940
Years ago. She thought he was maybe like having an affair

313
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:34,580
On one of these like he would he had to bust out every night at like 10 p.m

314
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:42,580
She ended up following him and she saw him sitting with like she staked out him and his partner staking out

315
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,740
Just a boring

316
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:46,260
like

317
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:54,500
Financial crimes like stakeout and she saw him like sadly eating junk food and she knows he hated

318
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:56,620
Like he hated his partner at that time

319
00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:04,940
Bummer that like big not like they couldn't work out but like they they solved this. They got the job done man, but like

320
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,940
Sitting in a car all night with him was not his cup of tea

321
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:13,020
so she he what she watched him do that a few times and

322
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:19,300
A few times. Well, yeah, she's got it. She's got an investigative personality just like him. Oh

323
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:22,420
Yeah, they're they're detectives in both

324
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:25,220
paranoid

325
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:30,700
Well, I wouldn't go that far, you know, I mean sorry codependent. Yeah, I mean

326
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:33,940
That's what that's what you need, right?

327
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:35,860
someone you

328
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:37,860
Do people who can depend on each other?

329
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:42,380
Yeah, it's a nice thing. Yeah, I don't see what's wrong with that

330
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:50,460
So, what did you bring with you on the trip to St. Louis well

331
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:54,100
Even though he's a very mid-ranged

332
00:28:55,900 --> 00:29:02,220
Shootist if you had to quantify, you know, but he has he has taken up skeet shooting recently

333
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:07,420
Oh cool, and he's as an FBI agent. He's already TSA pre-checked and all that shit

334
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:09,940
But he is like he's got his

335
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:12,660
Hold on. I pulled up the regulations

336
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:22,220
He's got his unloaded shotguns and a locked hard-sided container as checked and declared luggage

337
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,380
Wow

338
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,620
Well done

339
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:27,620
The container is completely secure

340
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:34,860
The firearm cannot be accessed because obviously locked cases that can be easily opened are not permitted. Sure. So he's got two

341
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:37,860
Two skeet shooting

342
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:40,340
Shotguns. Oh, yeah in a hard case

343
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:48,660
Damn, that's intense. And you I assume you have just your regular federal agent service. Yes. He has a nine millimeter Glock

344
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:50,180
Okay

345
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:52,180
Do you know what that means? Yeah, they

346
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:56,240
The trend in law enforcement apparently has been to go

347
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:59,940
Towards a lighter more high-capacity

348
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:03,180
automatic pistols

349
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:05,380
Here's a here's a chilling sentence

350
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:13,820
While some law enforcement agencies have transitioned to larger calibers from the nine millimeter in recent years

351
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:18,700
they do so that the expense of reduced magazine capacity more felt recoil and

352
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,060
given adequate

353
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:26,480
Projectile selection no discernible increase in terminal performance

354
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:29,980
No, thank you. That just means

355
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:35,140
Higher caliber weapons are harder to fire because they kick on you

356
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:42,220
So the stopping power that like might make you feel psychologically good with them

357
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:50,580
Isn't really as good as having a pistol you can shoot rapidly and accurately in terms of disabling someone

358
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:55,260
Wow or terminal performance as they sure

359
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:59,780
Turn it Wow, that's fun. So of course, he's got his nine millimeter Glock

360
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,460
All right anything else

361
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:09,140
That'll do that'll do just guns. A lot of people brought just guns. Oh

362
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:13,460
Well, yeah, he's got I mean anything he knows what he's meant

363
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,860
He's got

364
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,860
He's got a parka

365
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:19,940
He's got a good

366
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:27,100
I'll let you explain. Well, all right, I mean having heard my accent, you know, he's prepared for Oh for the cold weather

367
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:30,860
For sure old weather. Are you ready to give him the the birdie? Yes

368
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:43,800
How do we get Luke's attention he's asleep

369
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:46,740
Luke asleep

370
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:49,220
No, I think he's just asleep

371
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:52,220
Oh here he comes

372
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:57,540
I'm really self-conscious that you guys talked for way longer than I did

373
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:03,420
Baby baby was asleep in there. He's back home

374
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:08,580
Stop practicing your character voice. It's horrifying

375
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,700
I'm from Illinois

376
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,700
Oh

377
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:18,520
Dude did you keep going weird with your accent to I

378
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:25,660
Was trying to do an upper Midwest and I kept going wicked Irish. Oh, yeah. No mine. I already forgot

379
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:27,660
Well, mine was so I'm gonna have to remember

380
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:30,020
When I talk next

381
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:35,180
TSA agents at Lambert, which is the airport in st

382
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:42,660
Louis allow the agents into the conference room inside is a balding man in his early 50s with a heavy pond

383
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:47,340
And deep circles under his eyes. He does not offer his name here

384
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:51,900
But the agents know him as DHS Special Agent Patrick Hill. They have met him before

385
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,800
He's a Delta Green case officer and he arranges missions

386
00:32:55,860 --> 00:33:03,220
He's the go-between and cutout between the agents on the ground and the rest of Delta Green and the mission is the agents job

387
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:07,220
The agents are his job. Ooh, what a cool thing to say

388
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:10,740
Let's get this out of the way

389
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:14,480
Back before 9-11 people did our group's work out in the cold

390
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:21,700
We got activated reactivated anyway during see during the transition decisions were made. I didn't make those decisions

391
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:28,420
I don't know the people who did but they were made and now we're here. So I don't know more. I can't no more

392
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:30,620
We're all only here because we were

393
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:38,380
Closest or available and I'm not going with you because I've been up for two days trying to find you a ride into the goddamn

394
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:40,940
Missionary got it. Okay, so around sometime

395
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:49,260
2002 some team or another was tasked with repurposing assets from the old group into the new program

396
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:54,860
you guys know with all them the government switch over there and at least one of the ones we knew about and to my

397
00:33:54,980 --> 00:34:00,120
Understanding it was it's like a cost risk analysis based on the needs of the moment and the current budget

398
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,120
you know how this shit goes so

399
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:07,980
They tended to report that moving things out of unsecure private storage to secure

400
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:11,480
Official locations just wasn't worth it in the end

401
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:14,960
I don't know if it was because the contents were too volatile or

402
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:19,000
Someone couldn't be bothered to find a truck or they didn't trust the transition. I don't know

403
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,200
Okay, I mean it's the you know who these people are

404
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:25,380
I wasn't there but one of those storage sites that they used was in La Fontaine

405
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:28,860
Yeah, that La Fontaine the one from the news

406
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:33,660
I'm sure you guys if I am well aware right right the ice storm

407
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:39,500
Yeah ice storm so they installed an alarm on the door right of the security place and they got some friendly

408
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:41,820
from the utility company one

409
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:44,420
He looks down at his papers

410
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:46,220
skip Mills

411
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:53,220
To keep an eye on the place gave him some bullshit about maintaining a secret counterterrorism storage site or something

412
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:59,140
Do it for God in country the typical patriotic make your life special bullshit

413
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:03,940
I don't know. He was just strictly observing report didn't even have a key as far as I can tell

414
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:06,340
But the idea was to come back to the Fox

415
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:11,060
Got I got to find the Fox first, but then he's gonna come back to the box

416
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:14,740
I suppose in a few months when when things that eventually settled down

417
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:17,580
Well

418
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:19,580
It's been a few months a

419
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:25,140
Few because I was talking about 2002 right now and it's 2020

420
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:32,660
Yeah, so here we go see that's 18 18 years a month

421
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:38,620
He just stares at you which is more than a month of Sundays

422
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:40,620
The

423
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:50,540
Storage unit is at knurls rent a space unit zero one seven one. Yeah, I know upset clusterfuck, but

424
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:54,300
Obsec clusterfuck you're preaching to the choir

425
00:35:55,260 --> 00:36:02,100
Obsec operational security clusterfuck for those of you who you know might do math out loud to people. They just met

426
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:04,460
You're preaching to the choir

427
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:08,500
Anyway, the site is designated GB to to for you know, like

428
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:16,660
Yeah fucking green box to 24 ice storm hits the city hard on the night of the second and the parrot box that

429
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:22,600
Security system sent a silent alarm to someplace way above my pay grade right and it reports a breach

430
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:28,260
Shit is so far buried in the shuffle the nobody and signals pucks up on the damn thing until two days later

431
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:32,080
That's when they dragged my ass out of bed. So we have nothing on the ground

432
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:36,480
I don't know if this Mills was on the silent alarms call list or not

433
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:41,700
All I know is that I can't get a hold of him, but then I can't get a hold of anyone

434
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:47,680
Phone lines are down across the entire city. Most of the cell towers are dead

435
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:51,360
Something like 70% of buildings are without power still

436
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:55,560
Yeah, all the cell towers are dead. So I guess they're gonna miss out on

437
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:57,880
anyway

438
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,920
We're

439
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:06,360
Blind down there. All we know is that the door to GB to to for has been opened for going on a week

440
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:12,720
And we don't know what was inside. We don't know if this Mills guys on the level. We just don't know

441
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:16,280
And you have to find out who tried to say something

442
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,120
I'm sorry. I said, oh dear

443
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:25,280
Like oh god, I got you a ride on a National Guard disaster relief convoy

444
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:31,160
It leaves in a few minutes you're on an oversight group working for FEMA

445
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:38,200
Don't abuse the cover. You're just suits. Okay, just watching you're making sure everything's going

446
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:41,520
All right, and this legend is paper thin

447
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:47,200
I can't for the life of me think of why anyone would put you all in the same room together. I mean

448
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:51,040
Fucking lucky you is the best I can do on short notice

449
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:58,000
Paperwork is on the table. I got you some office space squared away at the city utilities company

450
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:03,320
Which is where that skip Mills guy was fuck knows. I spent enough time on the radio trying to find their boss

451
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:09,160
From there find out where this Mills guy is and what he knows

452
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:14,740
Head out to GB to 24 and inventory the content see if you can tell if anything's missing

453
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:21,000
Okay, right because if you go there it's a green box the stuff in there

454
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:25,500
Should be kept away from people and if it's missing

455
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:29,680
Then other people are seeing it

456
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:32,540
Nod your heads. Can I get nods?

457
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:39,060
Good job, everyone. Fuck me. Okay. Now if something's out there

458
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:44,260
You got to do it needs to be done text me if you need anything, but keep those messages

459
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:48,420
Clean-and-coated I'll do what I can from here, but

460
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:56,140
There's a hundred miles of solid fucking ice around you in every direction and more alphabet soup

461
00:38:56,220 --> 00:39:01,140
Agencies and media in the theater than you can shake a dick at so don't expect miracles

462
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:02,900
hell

463
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,900
Don't expect anything

464
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:06,940
You're on your own

465
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:08,940
So do you guys?

466
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:13,300
Understand what your mission is. This isn't sorry. I wasn't the tired guy anymore

467
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,500
Right

468
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:21,620
Yeah, the container is open we have to go find the friendly

469
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:26,900
figure out why the container is open whether or not anything dangerous escaped and

470
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:35,180
Neutralize whatever that might be and we have to talk to skip Mills and see what they are. That's the friendly

471
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:37,180
That's the friendly

472
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:43,460
They're friendly or are they can I can I ask this guy a question or is he out of the room?

473
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:47,180
Mr. Out of sleep, mr. Hill

474
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:54,060
You have fucking used my what the shit dude you introduced yourself as mr. Hill

475
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:59,380
No, I told you as the out of body narrator that you knew who I was

476
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:01,380
Oh

477
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:08,260
Sir yeah Wentworth. Do you have a last known?

478
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:12,700
Residence address for this skip Mills. I understand

479
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:18,620
He was the attendant at the storage units, but you surely knew where he lived. He looks through these papers

480
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:21,660
And he's like shit. I mean

481
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:25,460
Boy yeah, where are we at here? Oh

482
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:29,740
God and he looks through some more papers and then he finds

483
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:34,620
The apartment or it's a house. Yeah, I found the house. There's an address

484
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:40,260
Excellent. Oh that will make things much easier. I don't know I

485
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:50,380
Look at the other people in the room and I stand up from my chair. Are we prepared go ahead and describe what you look like

486
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:53,140
He is

487
00:40:53,140 --> 00:41:00,780
He's well-dressed. He's very nondescript. In fact, he's so nondescript. It would almost be striking except how nondescript he is

488
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:02,940
He's wearing a black pea coat

489
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:10,740
You can tell that there's maybe a suit underneath and he's wearing a wool stocking cap and leather gloves and you reach down and grab your

490
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:18,360
Identification as FEMA oversight and you can introduce yourself with whatever name is on it, which is

491
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,180
Barry

492
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:28,060
Fredrickson, is that how you would choose to introduce yourself to the rest? I mean, I don't think he would say anything

493
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:35,420
All right, and who's he looking at as each of you grab your FEMA

494
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:38,300
oversight IDs

495
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:40,300
Well according to this, um

496
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:43,220

a big but like not cool-looking mustache

503
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:26,960
I know that game. He kind of looks like the bonafide suitor from Oh Brother Where art thou

504
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,040
Bad he's a cedar

505
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,520
He's so he's bad actor

506
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,780

517
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:20,540
slightly more handsome than average but not like handsome enough to

518
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:26,940
For anyone to be like wow, that guy's handsome. I thought you were gonna be like slightly more handsome than Thomas's

519
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:33,980
And

520

Yeah, he just says I guess I'm Henry smoochy

521
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:41,380
Looks over at the other guy the last I think that's me

522
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:44,360

523
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:51,620

Me you guys all feel really good about your chances

527
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:11,060
Terrence fast night is uh, you don't have to be faster than the bear

528
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:19,500
That may prove very true in this area Terrence fast night is about five seven

529
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:22,880
average frame jet black hair with a middle part

Dressed in like a nice

531
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:28,420
Brown suit with a white dress shirt and tie

532
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:30,980

00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:33,900
Surgical mask over his

534
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:39,800
His mouth. So sometimes it's a little hard to hear him and he's very he's a little quiet and reserved

535
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:47,340
But he's very well dressed and seems put together. It looks very tired. And that's that's that's me. That's me, baby

536
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:52,740
Cool. I didn't describe what my guy was wearing, but it's just like a it's a big old parka

537
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:57,420
Tight he's he's he's wintered up, but it's also it's like clearly

538
00:44:57,740 --> 00:44:59,060

539
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:06,620
Ten to fifteen year old like out of fashion ski equipment. Perfect. The colors are wrong for

540
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:09,220
2020 I

541
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:17,940
Went skiing for the first time in a very long time like since I was a child a couple spring breaks ago

542
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:21,100
And because my uncle is money

543
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:27,700
My uncle has money and unlike everyone else in the old family and he was like come up to Breckenridge

544
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:30,780
I'll pay for everything and I was like, yes, please and when I got there

545
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:34,100
I was like you have like equipment for me to use and he's like hell yeah

546
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:37,620
And he starts cracking up and then he pulls out this full

547
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:45,840
Baby blue like bright baby blue and bright orange like to head to toe back and forth like

548
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:50,240
Badass like bright snow suit and it was so cool

549
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:55,680
And every single person as I was like walking everywhere was like, holy shit that guy

550
00:45:55,680 --> 00:46:02,700
Oh my god, that's right. And then they saw me get off it like the green one like the easiest slopes and I'm like

551
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:10,920
Flailing on the way down and everyone's like, oh look at that ass hat who spent a thousand dollars on his gear and can't ski for

552
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:12,360
Shit, right?

553
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:18,580
I actually lost a ski and had to like ask people to help me try to find my

554
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:26,260
If it makes you feel any better nobody was really judging you you were just that high

555
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:35,280
Like altitude though, right like my god, yeah altitude and an illegal state just like, Missouri

556
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,280
Did

557
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:43,460
You guys okay speaking of crazy rich people things did you guys see that reddit post yesterday about the

558
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:47,280
the razor crazy carts

559
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:49,320
No

560
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:53,560
No, there are these little electric guys going around the plaza. Yeah. Mm-hmm

561
00:46:53,640 --> 00:47:00,140
Yeah, they're like they're like seven hundred dollars each to get one that can support an adult. I can do that

562
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:02,140
I just got twelve hundred dollars for no reason

563
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:05,100
Do you guys want to spend your stimulus

564
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:11,820
Little electric carts that we can they're made for like drifting

565
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:20,100
You mean we can Tokyo drift finally, yeah, we could just Tokyo drift around the empty streets of Springfield

566
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:23,220
new patreon goal

567
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:28,740
By us crazy. We'll take a cool video. We'll play Mario Kart against each other

568
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:31,700
so I'm gonna go pee and

569
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:35,760
We will jump into La Fontaine, Missouri

570
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:42,800
Okay, you guys are gonna be riding in the back of a Navistar defense 7,000 MV troop transport

571
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:48,860
Which is gonna be very cold. It's one of those like trucks military trucks with the covered wagon shit on the back and

572
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:52,820
So you're gonna be in there packed with

573
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:59,020
soldiers like National Guard like National Guard people members as well as like

574
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:03,860
Blankets and food and clothing and shit just all packed in there

575
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:08,020
so if you guys want to like do a quick think about how you might want to have a

576
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:14,380
Conversation during this time so that we can get to know your characters and so that your characters can get to know each other

577
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:18,340
Then that might be a good way to jump into the scenario

578
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:26,560
So I'm gonna leave. All right, bye wait for me, please we promise we won't play without you

579
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:32,360
When he gets back, let's just tell him we're done we think we figured it out the DMS gone

580
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:38,700
So we solved the it's an open game now, but it was a bunch of angry raccoons that slid into the storage thing

581
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:45,520
But one of us did die and up in the battle

582
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:51,820
I'm gonna pee too, I guess yeah, I was gonna say I should take advantage of this

583
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:55,800
I'm just gonna sit here and stare into space earlier when they left me alone

584
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:58,440
I sang a song so you're up. Okay

585
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:02,320
Sorry, Zach. I'm gonna readjust myself

586
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:09,720
I'm gonna do some stretches if you've been sitting at your computer for a long time. You should do some stretches too

587
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:11,520
We could do them together

588
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,520
Hell, I'm gonna stand up

589
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:25,520
Is this dream terrible I did a stretch and people said that they were stretching too. I am a health guru

590
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:29,240
Did you do a stretch that changed because every time I moved my arms

591
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:35,320
I saw my pit stains were getting they got out to the point to where my entire sleeve was covered at the bottom and

592
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:41,920
It was so wet. I couldn't take it. I should unbutton my pants, but I think YouTube will ban us if I do that. Oh

593
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:48,800
I don't think so. They can hear the unbuttoned and they're like shut it down. I have my cool Kanye pants on

594
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:55,040
They're very comfy with the with the pocket. Yeah, I'll show the people nice

595
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,600
Hoodie-pocket hoodie-pocket. What are you doing you? Oh

596
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:06,440
It's like a it's like a baby kangaroo or a tiny loop once I clone myself

597
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:09,160
That's where he'll live

598
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:16,120
And he'll live in my afro so I can cook good French food to

599
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:21,480
Raduluki got it. Nice

600
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:23,880
Ha

601
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:26,040
I'm drinking one of these

602
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:27,880
Dude

603
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:29,880
Truly pretty good. That's

604
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:32,600
That's exactly what's in here. Nice the mango

605
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:36,680
I got the orange and I added a little stevia to it just to give it a little more sweetness

606
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:40,200
Oh shake it up. These things are too sweet for me. I

607
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:45,200
Really? Sorry not to be that not to be that guy. Oh you add sweetener to it

608
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:51,000
My drinks dries a biscuit that was poorly made

609
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:57,880
Does that mean with whipped or with frothy coffee? Well, yeah, dude frothy milk, I mean

610
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:00,920
Just a little barista

611
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:07,360
Somebody ordered a cappuccino dry for me when like when I first started at the coffee shop and I was like

612
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:11,080
They went all the juice in it

613
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,920
That's dirty

614
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,400
Best bartender in Springfield right here, baby

615
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:19,400
Let's

616
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:22,040
Dive back in

617
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:27,440
The briefing said LaFontaine was ill-prepared for winter weather

618
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:34,120
The city had sold most of its salt trucks and plows to keep from declaring bankruptcy during the reception

619
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:39,900
But nothing the reception heard you for this the reception they threw a massive reception

620
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:41,900
And

621
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:46,220
They could they had they had they sacrificed a bunch of kids

622
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:49,340
But like the ice storm still came and it was a sick party

623
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:55,380
So no regrets ease and honestly fuck those salt trucks and plows that party was dope

624
00:51:55,700 --> 00:52:00,180
Yep, nothing prepared you for this level of destruction

625
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:07,980
Nearly every road is blocked with felled trees phone and power lines dangle everywhere the few

626
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:16,480
Emergency responders you see are still chiseling vehicles out of the ice like sculptures and most who succeed seem to have

627
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:18,940
impotently skidded off the road

628
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:26,640
The majority of homes remain damaged and without power their residents are left to freeze in winter temperatures

629
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:34,700
Getting to the few operational shelters requires trekking on foot across the eerily beautiful city of ice

630
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:36,660
Upon arrival

631
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:41,820
They're crammed into crowded shelters filled with cots and hastily packed

632
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:47,680
Suitcases and even the lucky ones with vehicles rugged enough to escape often have to find a path ahead

633
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:51,380
through the felled trees and the roar of chainsaws is

634
00:52:52,140 --> 00:53:00,020
Constant even after five days relief teams have made scant headway a few major roadways are cleared and salted

635
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:05,180
The commercial and university districts to the south have power restored

636
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:09,340
Honestly, that doesn't sound like scant headway to me. It sounds like they got the the major

637
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:18,700
Commercial and university districts restored very little relief though has come to the north side the poor side of town the convoy

638
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:20,860
inches through

639
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:28,960
The north of LaFontaine is the oldest part of the city cut off from the rest by a moat of abandoned warehouses

640
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:30,760
Railyards

641
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:38,620
Factories and other remnants of the city's industrial past the massive old growth trees dotting its residential

642
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:42,480
Neighborhoods caused more damage here than anywhere else

643
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:50,100
The only lifeline south the Zora Neale Hurston bridge remains a clogged icy mess

644
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:54,080
It will be difficult to tell who needs help in northern LaFontaine

645
00:53:54,280 --> 00:54:01,420
Only the locals can distinguish which homes were abandoned to the storm and which were left vacant by the real estate crash

646
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:03,080
still

647
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:05,080
Progress is being made

648
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:11,840
Operating out of the headquarters for city utilities workers are slowly getting LaFontaine livable again

649
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:19,440
It appears that while the storm will certainly be expensive. None of the relief workers will be haunted by any lost lives

650
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:26,760
So that's good everybody who's like seemingly got trapped in their houses and shit made their way to a shelter

651
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:28,560
It's uncomfortable

652
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:35,760
But patrols and emergency shelters are so far keeping those without power fed and warm

653
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:37,880
And as you guys are rolling through

654
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:42,360
the camera kind of like zooms up to the back of this

655
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:49,920
Transport and then through we see soldiers in the very back and then like kind of a muffled wall and all throughout the middle aisle

656
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:57,040
Just like clothes and food and blankets and supplies and then in the next part

657
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:02,120
The four of you sit two on one side two on the other facing each other

658
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:09,840
So hey there fella. I don't think you told us your name. I say to to Joe it's character

659
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:14,780
It's Barry Frederickson, that's a good one. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you picked a good one for sure. I

660
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:17,940
They just get they gave me

661
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:26,720
Terrence fast fast night. I think fast night. That's a that's kind of a cool name. It's practically fast bender

662
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:34,280
You know, it's it's not as cool as my real. Oh, yeah. I mean it is my real name right now, but it's

663
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:37,280
and

664
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:44,500
Terrence looks down and stops immediately talking. So we're alone in this compartment. Yeah, let's go ahead and say that way there

665
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:45,800
We don't have like

666
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,800
prying ears

667
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:49,600
Immediate

668
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:54,400
Opsec breaches exactly like I just to like get an introduction to you guys are

669
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:58,600
You look over and you see two young National Guard recruits

670
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:01,240
eyes wide

671
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:05,040
You just have time to draw your firearms

672
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:07,040
So

673
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:13,280
Yeah, mr. Mr. Fast Knight there so you're saying in real life you have a

674
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:21,160
Cooler name than your code name. Yeah, we're not I don't think we're supposed to say though

675
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:23,960
As far as I know

676
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:31,120
I'm I'm still new to all this. I I I don't know. I know I'm needed and so I came well

677
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:32,520
I just want to say, you know, I'm sorry

678
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:37,140
Cuz this there's a lot of it this job can be stressful in a lot of different ways

679
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:40,840
and I think not being able to go by a pretty cool name is

680
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:48,120
It's up there one that people it's just one people don't typically think about so I just want to say like I'm glad someone

681
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:55,800
Understands my great duress. I am under and I'm sorry about that. My guy is looking the kind of puzzle between you two. I

682
00:56:56,800 --> 00:57:01,220
Am unaware of how the coolness of a name factors in to our mission

683
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
You know, that's a fair point

684
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:08,540
we should be playing this by the book and

685
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:17,280
But anyway, yeah, you got a friend in me buddy. Why thank you and Terrence Fast Knight slips his little

686
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:23,940
Like surgical mask up over his thing because he's uncomfortable being in a crowded dirty truck

687
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:30,820
Well, I don't think we came here to make friends do you guys have any ideas for what we get there well

688
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:32,820
Yeah, we just find

689
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:36,200
We find skip Mills and

690
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:42,700
We figure out what the heck is going on down at that green box were you all

691
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:46,260
Able to read the briefing. Oh, yeah

692
00:57:47,020 --> 00:57:49,740
There is a chance this skip Mills

693
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:53,140
Sought shelter, perhaps we can get records of

694
00:57:53,660 --> 00:58:00,040
Intake at these shelters didn't Patrick Hill who we all knew beforehand, but I forget what he told us. His name was

695
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:05,140
Didn't he didn't he give us his his address where he's known to be now

696
00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:09,840
he did but as the briefing said most homes have been left abandoned and

697
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:13,940
Shelters are at capacity. Oh, that was his okay

698
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:18,660
I thought he just told us directly where he was that would have been a lot handier. He certainly did

699
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:25,180
I'm suggesting that he might not be home. I suppose we could look at a map of some kind and

700
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:31,340
if there's a shelter near his home that he'd probably go to the nearest one or

701
00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:34,540
The closest one to these storage

702
00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:39,060
I'll call around as some shelters and I get my phone out and Google

703
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:44,220
LaFontaine, I believe that your cell reception will be not so good here

704
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:46,220
Based

705
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:49,260
Off

706
00:58:49,260 --> 00:58:55,000
What they said that all the towers were all jacked and such we're heading to city utilities

707
00:58:55,380 --> 00:59:01,880
Which I don't think I made this clear. They're up and running their skills. It's where skit Mills worked

708
00:59:03,260 --> 00:59:08,780
Okay, so you're being dropped off at CU City Utilities, which is where skit Mills worked

709
00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:11,480
I thought he works at a story, you know, he's yeah

710
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:18,720
And it was the attendant thing just a side job of his he was a friendly. He didn't work at the storage place

711
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:25,100
Okay, so he was just told he's just the guy when they were packing the green box that he was like

712
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:29,340
Right next door at his own storage unit and they're like

713
00:59:38,780 --> 00:59:40,780
Yeah

714
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:42,900
Yeah

715
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:47,440
Like five innocent witnesses today because they play like us and they were just

716
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:52,300
Like damn it skip. We just can't have any more blood on our hands

717
00:59:54,540 --> 01:00:00,960
So you guys are dropped off in front of the city utilities building before the truck joins the rest of the vehicles in the motor

718
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:03,060
Pool parking lot around back

719
01:00:03,060 --> 01:00:04,660
so basically the

720
01:00:04,660 --> 01:00:12,200
HQ of this whole operation is gonna be in the parking lot behind city utilities in a big motor pool where everybody's got

721
01:00:12,460 --> 01:00:14,140
generators

722
01:00:14,140 --> 01:00:21,260
cars are all back there and these trailers are popped up back there and as you guys go into the city utilities building you see

723
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:29,100
It is clogged with activity complaining customers entering their second week without electricity pack the lobby like cattle

724
01:00:29,620 --> 01:00:32,660
Overworked receptionists do their best to calm the crowd

725
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:40,780
Exhausted linemen trudge in and out returning for more equipment or just trying to catch a few minutes sleep in the locker room

726
01:00:40,780 --> 01:00:46,780
and as you guys walk in you see a woman who is short squat has

727
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:52,900
big glasses and she's wearing a car heart pulled all the way down and

728
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:58,700
She comes up and she's like, hey, hello. Hello. Are you the FEMA oversight group?

729
01:00:58,820 --> 01:01:00,500
Hey there

730
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:06,500
Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. This is me. I'm Tanya Cambria

731
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:10,620
It's nice to meet each one of you. Thank you so much and she goes to shake your hands

732
01:01:14,060 --> 01:01:16,540
My guy does yeah, I should yeah and

733
01:01:17,180 --> 01:01:21,420
Enthusiastically I shake her Terrence holds his hand out like

734
01:01:22,180 --> 01:01:24,180
Like he's waiting for someone to kiss it

735
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:26,180
Very

736
01:01:27,660 --> 01:01:30,020
Very gingerly, hey, okay cool

737
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:33,440
And she like puts her elbow out and kind of like hits your hand a little bit

738
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:38,420
He like kind of if you want to do one of those that's fine. He gives a little slap with his fingy tips. Ah

739
01:01:39,420 --> 01:01:44,460
All right. It's a pleasure to meet you Mark. Mark Smith gets like a

740
01:01:45,260 --> 01:01:49,920
Little physically uncomfortable and anxious scene that like breach of normal

741
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:53,100
social decorum

742
01:01:53,100 --> 01:01:55,820
It's like, oh, you know, it takes all types

743
01:01:55,820 --> 01:02:00,880
But where I come from, you know, you shake a hand if someone's trying to shake your hand. Yeah

744
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:06,280
No, well, I'm much more on your side of the equation here, but that's where we're at these days and no

745
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:09,200
I didn't fully didn't say it out loud. That's just what happened in my gut

746
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:12,660
Well, I just heard it and so I responded role-playing

747
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:19,380
I found it. I found what came out of the unit

748
01:02:24,100 --> 01:02:30,340
Miss Cambria, what is it? You do here? Oh, I'm just a I'm just trying to put all this keep it all together

749
01:02:30,860 --> 01:02:32,300
Let's see

750
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:38,140
You know, I knew there's gonna be a response team about but Oh office manager

751
01:02:38,140 --> 01:02:39,420
You can call me whatever you want

752
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:42,860
But basically if you're talking to just me and you I run the place

753
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:48,260
Obviously these people they don't know what they're doing and I got some office space for you, right?

754
01:02:48,660 --> 01:02:53,540
Look at that's what I told you take did you were you told that I had office space for you because look at me

755
01:02:53,540 --> 01:02:57,240
Of course, I've got office space for you. Come on down. Okay

756
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:02,420
My voice is this now and yes, you're starting to

757
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:09,940
I'll do what I want and you were just starting to sound like some kind of Star Wars merchant like

758
01:03:09,940 --> 01:03:18,600
I've got office space Roy. You went British and then I went you said office space

759
01:03:21,460 --> 01:03:26,320
All right, so yeah, no I was going for a more of a Mike Wazowski so

760
01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:29,420
Yeah, if you come out through here

761
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:35,060
God, yeah, the temporary office that I've set up for you is a prefab trailer. It's in the parking lot

762
01:03:35,060 --> 01:03:42,380
Okay, and she walks you through the back of the building and like moving through come on down move out of my way as she's

763
01:03:42,380 --> 01:03:44,380
passing through this sea of

764
01:03:45,340 --> 01:03:47,340
tired and stressed out

765
01:03:49,140 --> 01:03:55,840
Civilians and so you guys make your way through the back Mills hasn't been here in a couple days few days now

766
01:03:55,840 --> 01:04:00,980
And so you can just use his office. This is what he was using before miss Cambria

767
01:04:00,980 --> 01:04:08,100
You know, we can't thank you enough we all as FEMA agents were responding to Springfield back in all seven. So

768
01:04:08,780 --> 01:04:13,360
So we know what it's like to go through this kind of major

769
01:04:15,660 --> 01:04:22,100
Meteorological event there. Well, it's good to have people like you. Yeah. Thank you very much miss Cambria. Yeah, we all know that

770
01:04:23,420 --> 01:04:25,140
snow

771
01:04:25,140 --> 01:04:27,140
when too much is

772
01:04:27,660 --> 01:04:32,160
Is bad you always talk like this. Oh, I'm very sad now

773
01:04:33,140 --> 01:04:37,380
Sorry cut out in the middle of what you're saying like nothing came out of your mouth

774
01:04:37,820 --> 01:04:43,000
So I didn't hear you sound like a crazy person if you could repeat yourself, maybe I'll react more accordingly

775
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:49,700
Yeah, I thought I might have just been me there. But it totally cut out. It wasn't even like a drop of discord. Oh, I

776
01:04:50,420 --> 01:04:52,420
Talk slowly also

777
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:55,220
Snow

778
01:04:55,220 --> 01:04:57,420
When when too much is

779
01:04:58,380 --> 01:04:59,860
bad

780
01:04:59,860 --> 01:05:04,800
Yes, I get it. All right, so and you pop out through the back door and you said

781
01:05:05,540 --> 01:05:11,120
Hit me with it before we leave miss Mills. Okay, it's Cambria miss Cambria miss Cambria

782
01:05:12,660 --> 01:05:18,060
Yeah, we need to speak with mr. Mills, do you know where we might find him I wish oh my gosh

783
01:05:18,060 --> 01:05:23,520
If you could tell me where he is, that would make me a happy lady. But here I am. Look at my face

784
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:26,520
Am I happy lady to you

785
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:33,760
It looks like you're doing the best you can under the circumstances. Oh, that's real sweet of you to say

786
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:34,880
I'm really glad that you

787
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:40,280
Professionals are here to really keep an eye on things and she like points around as you guys are about to open the door

788
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:46,960
And she's like brace yourselves cuz it's a fuck ton of idiots and cold weather out there and she busts open the door

789
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:51,560
And you see that the parking lot has been cleared of its thick coat of ice and large

790
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:59,200
Command tents and the diesel generators heating them take up the space nearest the building and otherwise the cold keeps the parking lot

791
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:06,160
Mostly empty save when trucks drive in to be resupplied or repaired in and out as they go

792
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:12,160
but as you guys move past those tents, you see there is a trailer that is a

793
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:14,400
makeshift office

794
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:21,000
It's the relief effort HQ and it's where you guys have been sent because you are the suits in charge

795
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:23,320
How's that feel? It's just a disaster

796
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:29,400
It feels bad, well, you know, I don't think anybody will

797
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:36,020
particularly think it's out of the ordinary if the federal government just really

798
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:39,800
drops the ball on disaster response for a couple days, so

799
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:44,400
It should I think it's more decent cover than we're being given credit for

800
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:46,080
You

801
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:51,560
know, I I think that that guy Mills, you know, he had that exact kind of

802
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:56,400
Feeling inside his entire body when he was here. I'm sorry. I thought you left

803
01:06:56,400 --> 01:07:00,760
We I wasn't gonna say anything like that for you. You said you yeah

804
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:06,440
Oh, I pushed open the door and I I told I told Luke that I was gonna walk all the way with you guys

805
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:07,520
That way, you know

806
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:13,260
If you if you were worried because I wanted to say one more thing about skip Mills and then have you guys roll humid

807
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:18,320
Oh, oh, yeah, that makes it that's standard investigatory a procedure

808
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:22,120
So actually you don't have to roll

809
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:25,680
We're gonna play this scenario as written

810
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:31,360
so there will be a few times where so in Delta green if you just have a skill at a certain number you

811
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:36,600
Pass so if you're not under stress and there's no like time limit on the thing

812
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:44,320
Then you don't have to roll for it, which I except we never do that. No, no, we don't we don't play that way

813
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:49,040
We play a different way. And so here we are. So if any of you have humans at

814
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
30% say aye aye

815
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:54,320
or

816
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:56,320
At 30% or above that

817
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:59,440
Yeah, like way above

818
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:06,500
I forgot. I'm still this lady. I'm still this lady. I gotta wear my beanie. I like it. He's my head warm

819
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:10,560
It's uh, I'm at a 60 miss Cambria

820
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:17,520
Oh, well, then you of course would know that as I'm talking about skip Mills and I'm saying stuff like wow

821
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:23,400
Government workers. Am I right? Some of them love some of them hate some of them come to work

822
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:29,040
Some of them don't this guy dips out in the middle of a national emergency

823
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:33,720
Maybe not national national for us. I mean my life is my country, you know, and so

824
01:08:34,260 --> 01:08:37,100
You would know that like she's pretty uncomfortable

825
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:41,180
She's like very comfortable talking shit about him

826
01:08:41,260 --> 01:08:47,260
but you can tell that she was very very confused and then she says but I

827
01:08:47,620 --> 01:08:51,900
Will say when he did come in three days ago the last time he was here

828
01:08:51,900 --> 01:08:59,100
His face was covered in scratches and sweat and it was awful. He looked fucking terrible

829
01:08:59,100 --> 01:09:04,020
I am sorry for the cursing but this is an emergency and it's like theater in high school

830
01:09:04,020 --> 01:09:10,380
You could just cuss whenever you want. It's fine. Everybody loves it. You know, it's liberating. You're all looking at me right now

831
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:15,380
I'm not gonna say anything about attraction of people or anything like that, but

832
01:09:16,140 --> 01:09:18,780
I'm someone who doesn't get the male gaze

833
01:09:19,380 --> 01:09:24,420
You know from from from people in his age group too often

834
01:09:24,420 --> 01:09:27,780
But boy howdy the last time he came in here it was

835
01:09:28,620 --> 01:09:30,140
not

836
01:09:30,140 --> 01:09:36,660
Comfortable. Oh, I mean he was he was yeah. What is your age difference there? Well, I'm 85

837
01:09:41,180 --> 01:09:45,780
She's like how old is mr. Mills she's probably like mid 50s

838
01:09:48,220 --> 01:09:51,820
You just lied you just lied to federal agents there

839
01:09:53,980 --> 01:09:57,540
Well, you never ask a woman her age or a man it's rude

840
01:09:57,660 --> 01:10:02,220
You can't ask people how old they are unless it's their birthday and even then you just count the candles

841
01:10:02,780 --> 01:10:10,260
Ma'am in an emergency any bit of information might be relevant. We need you to please be forthcoming with us and even I'm actually

842
01:10:10,620 --> 01:10:12,620
69 yeah

843
01:10:12,780 --> 01:10:14,780
Sorry

844
01:10:15,340 --> 01:10:20,220
No, it's fine you can laugh that's exactly the kind of like dirty humor

845
01:10:20,220 --> 01:10:24,180
It was that kind of dirty humor that looked like it was in this this guy's eyes

846
01:10:24,180 --> 01:10:29,460
I mean what he sees in his 30s early 30s people like that don't you know often?

847
01:10:29,460 --> 01:10:35,660
I've had a professional relationship with Skip Mills for years and not once has he ever looked at me like I was a piece of

848
01:10:35,660 --> 01:10:37,660
Meat that he wanted to fuck

849
01:10:37,820 --> 01:10:43,020
Sure, we get it. He was really giving you the eyes there the last time you saw him. Yeah, did I make that clear?

850
01:10:43,140 --> 01:10:48,020
Yeah, speaking of which just before you dive in any further to this conversation. That's definitely over

851
01:10:48,620 --> 01:10:53,760
No, no, I have I have a question for her. Okay, hit the question then we'll move what was what was mr

852
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:55,760
Mills duties here

853
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:06,860
Ma'am try not to laugh. I need to know what his responsibilities were his duties

854
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:11,920
Well, I'm looking them up obviously

855
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:17,340
Sure figure it out. I'm pretty sure that he was running the

856
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:21,320
He was he was he was in charge. That's why you guys are here

857
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:29,320
We needed FEMA oversight because our city utility supervisor during a power outage with ice all over the city is

858
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:31,800
Nowhere to be found

859
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:33,800
three days nowhere to be found

860
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:38,320
You know, it sounds like he was one horny dog and

861
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:44,120
Those might have been those might have been love scratches, you know on his own face

862
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:47,760
Yeah, cuz the your lover scratches. Yeah

863
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:53,560
When your lover scratches

864
01:11:54,520 --> 01:12:00,480
Across the face. Has anyone tried contacting him? Of course. What did you say? Have you been to his house?

865
01:12:01,480 --> 01:12:07,360
We've been no we're not gonna go to his house. Why would we yeah, of course like we're gonna go to his house

866
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:11,320
Do you know how much money and time it takes to get anywhere in this fucking city right now?

867
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:14,440
Yeah, I mean like we said we were in Springfield

868
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:16,240
So, you know it could take some time

869
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:20,880
But money is a weird way to qualify how it would take to get down to a fellas house

870
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:26,320
It's not like I am the office manager. I look at the bottom line

871
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:29,400
Financials, that's what I'm all about

872
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:34,400
Sure. Sure man hours. We get it. We get it. Okay. Bye lady. Thank you

873
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:38,720
Did we get a definitive on skips age 30s early 30s?

874
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:44,920
You have a job to do. I have a job to do. Let's all do our jobs and she turns around

875
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:48,000
She bails. Well, I say we go to his house

876
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:53,480
I think probably what he saw in her is that she was such a strong, you know minded personality

877
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:58,400
She's really, you know, I respect the hell out of that lady. She was quite strong and

878
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:01,400
attractive to

879
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:03,800
To some of us I think

880
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:09,440
She really didn't make much of an impression on me, but to each their own well, you know some men have a natural

881
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:16,640
Predisposition against not natural. It's been ingrained by society against powerful women and it's really toxic

882
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:18,640
You gotta get over it. You just need to learn to

883
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:26,120
Admire and respect somebody like that instead of feeling threatened. Okay, that's great advice. So you guys

884
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:27,880
were

885
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:32,800
You guys are so cold while you're having this conversation and you're all just looking at this door of this

886
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:35,440
prefabricated trailer that is

887
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:40,560
right in front of you before we jump into this and Joe will hop to you first, but

888
01:13:41,240 --> 01:13:43,240
due to the

889
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:44,680
content of

890
01:13:44,680 --> 01:13:47,920
Delta green and role-playing games in general

891
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:55,120
I know that we have an understanding of each other and that we are close friends and we have been playing together for a long

892
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:58,640
Time and I've yet to have something happen in a game

893
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:05,160
Where one of you came up to me afterwards and we're like, I felt uncomfortable during that and I wish you wouldn't have done it

894
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:07,920
However, that's the goal. No

895
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:11,440
Hold on to your butts

896
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:14,620
So basically I want to implement a safe word

897
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:19,260
For this game and honestly just moving forward in all of our games

898
01:14:19,260 --> 01:14:26,960
So if anyone is made uncomfortable at any time by the what is happening either whether it's me doing it or someone else

899
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:34,560
Doing it in a scene just say the word and we'll immediately fast forward like cut to the next scene and then afterward off-mic

900
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:38,440
We'll talk about it and how we can do better and make sure that that wouldn't happen again

901
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:43,400
Is that cool with everybody or doesn't even have any suggestions about how to do that better works for me

902
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:48,940
I think it's our safe word. What is the safe word is the question?

903
01:14:50,020 --> 01:14:52,020
Kraft mac and cheese. I

904
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:57,440
Ran out of mac and cheese a few days ago, and it's really nice and innocent. I like that a lot

905
01:14:57,440 --> 01:15:02,200
Let's go Kraft mac and cheese. All right, so if anyone says Kraft mac and cheese out of context

906
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:04,480
Then we know

907
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:11,520
To bail and move on I think that's too bad. This one takes place at the haunted craft factory

908
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:18,840
Yeah, the people voted for

909
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:21,360
named mac and cheese

910
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:25,920
Boy

911
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:31,360
Boy, all right. So as you guys are diving into

912
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:37,080
The utilities manager's office. Oh, he's the manager. Of course. He is it says right here

913
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:41,720
He's the manager of city utilities. Just like the main dude

914
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:43,320
This is what the one you're looking for

915
01:15:43,320 --> 01:15:49,980
So Tanya drops off the group in front of Mills office and returns to her work and the prefabricated trailer

916
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:52,640
suffices as a base from which

917
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:56,040
sorties sorties sorties

918
01:15:56,640 --> 01:16:01,800
Sorties means small parties that are sent out to for missions and such to go and yeah

919
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:08,260
Oh know that I didn't either if you played enough strategic RPGs like me and Thomas did you would be?

920
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:19,160
Fucking idiot if your family had exposed you to as much military history as a child like any proper American family should be then

921
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:23,060
You'd be well acquainted with what a sortie is sir

922
01:16:23,060 --> 01:16:26,800
Fair that's why I when we're besieged

923
01:16:28,460 --> 01:16:34,120
What was that when we're besieged I'm gonna be in charge of things none of not you fellas

924
01:16:34,260 --> 01:16:40,100
Maybe Justin is you're my colonel. Yay, finally, I would have died in the initial blast

925
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:44,860
Yeah, we probably would have positioned you somewhere

926
01:16:45,620 --> 01:16:47,620
Hey

927
01:16:48,700 --> 01:16:55,020
Before we start I do have to go use the restroom before before we dive in deep before we go into the office

928
01:16:55,460 --> 01:16:57,460
Yeah, that's fine

929
01:16:59,140 --> 01:17:06,140
I'm never mad at you. I want to get to the meat of this thing. Well the miles I mean the Mills meet

930
01:17:06,900 --> 01:17:09,600
Give me that Mills mate. Oh boy

931
01:17:14,860 --> 01:17:16,340
Oh

932
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:19,120
Hey guys, yeah, when you go into the office

933
01:17:19,860 --> 01:17:23,420
It's heated and as soon as you walk in you're like, oh

934
01:17:24,860 --> 01:17:32,860
Hell yeah, because I wait Zach comes before we get any further we should clap again. Did you start recording again? Mm-hmm

935
01:17:32,860 --> 01:17:38,020
Oh, that's good. We've been I've been recording the whole time. I just forgot to sync us up when I restarted it

936
01:17:38,020 --> 01:17:42,520
Oh, we can do another class. So you have you've recorded two files now. Is that what you're saying?

937
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:47,880
I immediately started recording again. Oh, okay. That's fine. And I anyway I shouted real loud right there

938
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:52,280
So it should be easy to find in the file, but I'm gonna be off sync for the last

939
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:59,000
Very this is gonna be super confusing that it sounds good. All right, let's do the clap

940
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:01,640
one two three

941
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:04,600
Six seven

942
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:07,680
Nice

943
01:18:07,680 --> 01:18:13,060
It's wild how behind it all is for me. Yeah. Yeah, it looked really really bad

944
01:18:15,720 --> 01:18:17,580
Thankfully that's streaming baby, sir

945
01:18:17,580 --> 01:18:23,620
I think it's literally physically impossible for us to clap on track together through streaming technologies

946
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:29,780
We could spend a while trying so you guys go into this office. It's warm. It's nice

947
01:18:30,580 --> 01:18:36,780
You are stoked to be there there's a few fold-out tables a desk and a computer and

948
01:18:38,060 --> 01:18:41,060
The only other thing that you notice is it kind of smells

949
01:18:42,020 --> 01:18:44,020
What is that?

950
01:18:44,220 --> 01:18:48,380
Like Bradford pears weird, that's like real bad, right?

951
01:18:49,100 --> 01:18:52,560
It smells like come does smell like come. Yeah

952
01:18:53,660 --> 01:18:57,700
Wow, it might not be trees even it kind of just smells like come in here

953
01:19:00,780 --> 01:19:02,780
Oh, damn it

954
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:07,620
Is okay, I want to I want to search for come

955
01:19:09,860 --> 01:19:15,280
Does it does it actually smell like come do we need to look yes, um, it absolutely smells like come in here

956
01:19:15,620 --> 01:19:19,540
And as you kind of like, I mean you said it so as you're walking around

957
01:19:19,540 --> 01:19:25,080
you can't kind of focus in on a centralized place and it's the desk and if you're like

958
01:19:25,640 --> 01:19:29,160
Really moving your nose around the chair

959
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:35,280
Behind the desk has a little bit stained on the front of it. And then if you bend over

960
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:40,040
the underneath of the desk like if you're just like

961
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:42,440
smelling around

962
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:44,440
That's good audio

963
01:19:44,440 --> 01:19:47,560
You're just getting a nose full of this guy's jaw sauce

964
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:54,200
Just like she's all up down here and you would notice that like the ground

965
01:19:55,080 --> 01:20:01,060
Where his feet were is like the carpet is stiff and hardened and there is residue

966
01:20:01,460 --> 01:20:07,520
Stained under the desk like the up and up underneath it. So he's shooting up there

967
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:12,720
Wants to check out his computer one, two, three. I'm sorry

968
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:19,160
So I was like I was reading this

969
01:20:19,640 --> 01:20:25,520
Scenario again after I put it in the poll and people started voting for it and I was like, oh fuck a

970
01:20:29,240 --> 01:20:33,820
Cum horror show like the first clear is like there's fucking cum everywhere

971
01:20:39,320 --> 01:20:42,680
I think I think Terrence would willfully

972
01:20:43,320 --> 01:20:45,320
like raise his hand because

973
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:47,120
He's like I

974
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:51,680
deal with quite awful things every day so I

975
01:20:52,360 --> 01:20:54,560
Can do this and what do you do?

976
01:20:55,240 --> 01:20:56,720
Checking the computer. Yeah

977
01:20:56,720 --> 01:21:03,360
Let's see what he was making all this fuss about you move the mouse around and the computer's already logged on

978
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:07,080
Still logged in just just for the record while this is happening

979
01:21:07,080 --> 01:21:11,600
I want my guy to be walking around the office like if there's file cabinets

980
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:16,960
He's going through some of those just okay just doing what you would do to search a room for signs of this person's life

981
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:21,400
Yeah, smoochy. What are you doing? Same? Yep, and Smith. What are you up to? I'm

982
01:21:22,720 --> 01:21:28,600
Observing them all and taking diligent notes in my in my FBI issued notebook

983
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:33,400
That absolutely makes sense and I'm like, hey there make sure you don't disturb any of that cum

984
01:21:36,120 --> 01:21:37,840
Fast night as

985
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:42,600
You're going through the computer you notice that there is a program that monitors the power grid

986
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:48,120
In the town the power grid monitor program, but it needs a separate password

987
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:54,160
But as you're going through the computer you find Mills's home address like immediately

988
01:21:54,720 --> 01:21:59,280
On some correspondence or sorry, that's actually Joe you guys already had his home address

989
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:04,560
but you confirm it here in the office and then the web history is really

990
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:07,560
It's really horrifying

991
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:11,360
Fast night as you're as you're scrolling through

992
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:18,560
The the porn the porn the sheer amount of porn on this computer

993
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:25,080
that has been that it was accessed three days ago all between like the hours of

994
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:30,320
630 a.m. And 1 p.m. On January 3rd

995
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:34,840
It's like it's pornography in the sense of like past past

996
01:22:36,440 --> 01:22:38,440
Films of people

997
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:44,800
Fucking each other this is getting it gets weirder and weirder and weirder and darker

998
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:51,520
And then more violent and more violent and then like he is trying to find the most punishing

999
01:22:52,720 --> 01:22:55,920
Regardless of gender regardless of anything

1000
01:22:56,480 --> 01:23:00,680
Anything it's all about how violent the videos can get and

1001
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:09,160
As you're just like looking through the names of these videos you have to roll sanity. Oh

1002
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:17,720
These videos so fucked up just reading the titles of them makes you roll sanity for how gross I

1003
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:24,800
Pass 52 on a 70 you lose zero sanity as

1004
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:30,440
You have a 70 sanity. You're the sanest dude ever. Hell yeah, bro

1005
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:33,920
Yeah, I've also got one of those

1006
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:41,680
One of those seventies so due to your line of work as a female oversight agent

1007
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:46,120
I would assume that you you're you're like pretty strong

1008
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:54,760
Mentally for this kind of stuff. Yes, my past life has prepared me quite well for horrors and

1009
01:23:55,720 --> 01:23:57,720
Nasty shit happening to bodies

1010
01:23:59,080 --> 01:24:03,600
You feel me bro, he says out loud as he's searching the computer

1011
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:12,080
Imagine having to touch that mouse and keyboard Wentworth and

1012
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:17,480
Smoochie who has searched and who has SIG it or criminology

1013
01:24:17,480 --> 01:24:21,640
I've got a search of 40 and I've got a criminology of 30

1014
01:24:22,120 --> 01:24:24,120
60 search and

1015
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:29,740
What was the other two criminology only 10? Can I pitch in on either of these? Yeah, what do you got?

1016
01:24:30,260 --> 01:24:32,260
70 search and 50 criminology

1017
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:37,140
Okay, you guys know with all of that star-studded skill points

1018
01:24:37,140 --> 01:24:43,000
You guys see as you're looking about you see that on the backside of a desk calendar

1019
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:50,400
Ecclesiastes 28 is written on it in ink pen on the back of a calendar and

1020
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:53,240
Then go ahead and roll

1021
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:57,280
SIGINT or criminology, I believe that is

1022
01:24:58,520 --> 01:25:04,360
I have a search notice again, but who had criminology. I have a 50 criminology

1023
01:25:04,360 --> 01:25:10,320
That is what I was asking for. Please roll criminology. I fail 82 on a 50. What was it?

1024
01:25:10,720 --> 01:25:16,440
Ecclesiastes what 28 28 and then Justin as fast night continues

1025
01:25:17,160 --> 01:25:21,760
He gets the gist of the history of what's going on on this computer and

1026
01:25:23,560 --> 01:25:29,400
Who's got computer science who's got the best computer I have 20 I have none

1027
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:32,240
I got none Thomas

1028
01:25:32,840 --> 01:25:39,040
Hold on. Sorry. I've got the I've got Ecclesiastes 28 pulled up over my character sheet and I

1029
01:25:39,560 --> 01:25:41,560
Have none, okay

1030
01:25:41,960 --> 01:25:45,500
Okay, so 20% go ahead and roll that computer science there fast night

1031
01:25:46,440 --> 01:25:48,440
Oh

1032
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:50,960
Crit fail 77

1033
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:56,200
Explodes and kills me

1034
01:25:57,200 --> 01:25:58,800
Okay, so

1035
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:07,080
You slip you slip and come and delete the file. So as you're going through here, you're trying to figure out what is

1036
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:13,920
Going on and you see this power grid monitor program that's still up and you decide you're gonna try to get into it

1037
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:18,960
Right. And so as these boys are looking around the room, you're just like typing typing

1038
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:24,480
You're like, oh, I bet his password is his address and then he typed it in and then you're like, oh

1039
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:26,480
I bet his address is

1040
01:26:27,320 --> 01:26:31,800
Mills and then you type it in and then you're like maybe skip Mills and then capital S

1041
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:35,720
skip Mills and you do it until it's like you've been locked out of the system and

1042
01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:40,900
At that moment you turn around and they're like, hey, I found Ecclesiastes 28 written on the back

1043
01:26:44,040 --> 01:26:51,440
Mark Smith starts reciting it from memory. Oh, no, and he's kind of he kind of looks a little confused when no one else joins in

1044
01:26:54,880 --> 01:27:00,400
Yeah, Ecclesiastes 28 woe to the crown of pride to the drunkards of

1045
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:04,640
Forgive me pastor's son, but uh, f Ryan

1046
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:07,160
Is that right? I'm

1047
01:27:07,160 --> 01:27:10,000
If I really go for the pronunciation, it's a frame

1048
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
Okay

1049
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:16,160
Yeah, well whose glorious beauty is a fading flower

1050
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:20,840
Which are on the head of the fat valleys of them that are who overcome with wine

1051
01:27:22,360 --> 01:27:25,760
Fat valleys, I guess that might be like a fupa there or something

1052
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:32,440
Behold the Lord hath a mighty and a strong hold on fellas

1053
01:27:32,440 --> 01:27:35,700
Don't laugh cuz you're about to laugh more because verse 2 starts

1054
01:27:36,380 --> 01:27:39,740
Behold the Lord hath a mighty and a strong one

1055
01:27:40,620 --> 01:27:42,100
which is

1056
01:27:42,100 --> 01:27:44,860
Which is what I said to my wife when I woke up this morning

1057
01:27:47,220 --> 01:27:53,460
It's like oh look at that sometimes when you really got a pee it's like I didn't even know it could get that big but

1058
01:27:55,580 --> 01:28:01,300
Which as a as a tempest of hail and a destroying storm as a flood of mighty waters

1059
01:28:01,500 --> 01:28:04,580
Overflowing shall cast down to the earth with that with the hand

1060
01:28:05,420 --> 01:28:12,740
The crown of pride that drunkards of f Ryan shall be trodden under feet and the glorious beauty

1061
01:28:12,940 --> 01:28:18,940
Which is on the head of the fat valleys shall be a fading flower and as the hasty fruit before the summer

1062
01:28:19,660 --> 01:28:24,420
Which we need that looketh upon it seeeth while it is. I'm going way Irish

1063
01:28:26,820 --> 01:28:29,560
Why I think I'm getting to the end of the point

1064
01:28:31,380 --> 01:28:33,380
Have you not looked this clue up before

1065
01:28:35,060 --> 01:28:40,940
Anyway, basically if they don't it doesn't take too kindly to these drunkards of f Ryan interesting

1066
01:28:41,540 --> 01:28:46,360
Whose glorious beauty is a fading flower was that 20 Ecclesiastes 28?

1067
01:28:46,700 --> 01:28:54,440
Yes, and I'm of course quoting from the new King James version you asking that in character because he just resigned out loud

1068
01:28:55,020 --> 01:28:58,620
No, I was asking out of character cuz when I do it, I don't think I pulled up the same thing

1069
01:28:58,620 --> 01:29:00,980
I don't see f from listed anywhere in here

1070
01:29:00,980 --> 01:29:02,980
Oh

1071
01:29:04,380 --> 01:29:08,340
Boy if I pulled a Bible boner and quoted the wrong verse

1072
01:29:10,580 --> 01:29:15,860
I love how much this like hardcore religious guy talks about his dick

1073
01:29:19,980 --> 01:29:23,900
No, what are you talking about a dick when you talk about pulling a boner?

1074
01:29:27,620 --> 01:29:29,620
Okay, yeah

1075
01:29:31,340 --> 01:29:36,440
Bacon well, well, we'll make note of that and you can recite it later if it comes up

1076
01:29:36,740 --> 01:29:42,620
But I think that might just be the password for his computer. Have you tried that yet Terence?

1077
01:29:43,180 --> 01:29:44,660
ashamedly looks

1078
01:29:44,660 --> 01:29:51,540
Like it looks over. I I did I did too many. I did too many of the bad ones and

1079
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:54,220
Now we are all locked

1080
01:29:55,220 --> 01:29:57,220
out of

1081
01:29:57,340 --> 01:29:59,740
the computer the come pewter

1082
01:30:01,660 --> 01:30:04,040
Did you guys like my awesome joke, I mean

1083
01:30:05,340 --> 01:30:12,100
Did you find anything in the computer before it locked you out? I I saw disturbing pornography

1084
01:30:13,060 --> 01:30:16,860
that would shake a normal person to their core, but

1085
01:30:17,540 --> 01:30:19,960
one such as I is not phased by

1086
01:30:21,100 --> 01:30:23,100
humanity's depravity

1087
01:30:23,100 --> 01:30:25,100
Okay

1088
01:30:29,740 --> 01:30:33,580
What a cool sentence to say to new friends I

1089
01:30:35,900 --> 01:30:37,900
Lean over to to

1090
01:30:38,220 --> 01:30:44,140
Frederickson Barry Frederickson, I'm like not exactly a fella you'd want to have over for you know

1091
01:30:44,140 --> 01:30:50,860
Meet a dinner of meat and potatoes, you know with with maybe like the Hendrickson's or maybe just your kids

1092
01:30:51,420 --> 01:30:56,220
That man's proclivities do not concern me do I hear all this urchin do I hear this

1093
01:30:57,260 --> 01:30:59,260
We're in a tiny office

1094
01:31:00,040 --> 01:31:04,140
Yeah, I mean it was implied that he was leaning over and saying that to me under his breath

1095
01:31:04,140 --> 01:31:07,620
But if you want it, okay, I roll to hear it roll to hear it. Oh

1096
01:31:09,380 --> 01:31:15,640
Boy good thing I have the lowest alertness possible. It's good for Delta Green. Oh, yeah

1097
01:31:16,240 --> 01:31:18,240
Seeing what's coming

1098
01:31:19,120 --> 01:31:21,120
So does Terrence

1099
01:31:23,320 --> 01:31:26,040
We haven't seen what was coming only what came

1100
01:31:28,340 --> 01:31:31,320
So, what's the plan I think we ought to head to this guy's house

1101
01:31:31,960 --> 01:31:38,240
So was the the confirmation of his home address the only other thing that I found in my young. Yeah. Okay

1102
01:31:38,720 --> 01:31:40,760
Can I do a search role on the place as well?

1103
01:31:41,120 --> 01:31:47,400
You can not would it would it be fruitless? Yep, you're good. Oh

1104
01:31:48,040 --> 01:31:51,320
Yeah, actually go ahead and roll roll search for me real fast

1105
01:31:52,380 --> 01:31:54,380
Fuck 83 on a 70

1106
01:31:55,080 --> 01:31:57,320
Perfect. I didn't have anything. I

1107
01:32:00,320 --> 01:32:02,320
Admire the gambit I

1108
01:32:03,240 --> 01:32:07,560
Like that you're like, you know what I'm gonna challenge myself to have something exactly

1109
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:11,160
You found a cool candy bar and a can of coffee

1110
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:14,160
You're feeling fucking good ad

1111
01:32:14,680 --> 01:32:16,680
15 sanities

1112
01:32:19,280 --> 01:32:21,560
Random free candy bar gives you 15

1113
01:32:24,320 --> 01:32:28,880
Someone comes up and says something not mean to you gain a sanity point Oh

1114
01:32:30,680 --> 01:32:33,960
Poor Terrence, I feel like in this office

1115
01:32:33,960 --> 01:32:40,040
There would be a paper map of the city for his records and I want to use it to try and locate

1116
01:32:40,200 --> 01:32:46,520
His house in comparison to where we are how far away it is. Oh something also I meant to ask earlier is

1117
01:32:47,040 --> 01:32:54,080
This does the city utilities. Do they have internet up and running here city utilities does have the internet live right now

1118
01:32:54,080 --> 01:32:57,720
All right, so we could what we could do even though we don't have

1119
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:05,800
Access to the internet on our phones like when we go out and about we can download a local map of the area on

1120
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:07,600
Google Maps and

1121
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:10,920
Then we just have that. Oh, I think that's really smart

1122
01:33:10,920 --> 01:33:15,040
we can also do some scout and find out how to get from here to there and

1123
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:22,100
Smoochy you were talking earlier at there about finding out where the shelters are you could get to Google in that while we have

1124
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,200
All we have that Wi-Fi I will do that

1125
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:33,160
So essentially what you've got is you've got the shelters are on the south side of town and then along the other

1126
01:33:33,480 --> 01:33:37,340
so the main shelter that's being used is

1127
01:33:39,300 --> 01:33:40,920
Written

1128
01:33:40,920 --> 01:33:46,220
Written down on my sheet. It says Truman Memorial High School

1129
01:33:47,200 --> 01:33:54,560
In the south down there is being used. Is there a phone number listed for it? Of course, why wouldn't there be?

1130
01:33:55,200 --> 01:33:57,000
Alright, give it a call

1131
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:04,900
Okay, roll a 50% luck straight up and down on whether or not the phone line works this time around. I got a one

1132
01:34:08,080 --> 01:34:10,440
Crystal-clear. Yeah

1133
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:14,480
Reception

1134
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:20,520
Truman Memorial High School Becky speaking. Hey Becky

1135
01:34:20,520 --> 01:34:22,520
Um

1136
01:34:23,200 --> 01:34:29,840
You guys are using the school as a shelter at the moment, correct? That is correct. Um, do you happen to

1137
01:34:30,700 --> 01:34:35,780
Have a list of the people staying there like a check-in sheet of any kind, you know

1138
01:34:35,780 --> 01:34:40,400
We tried to start one but at the end of the day it got real out of hand

1139
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:44,680
I'd say we got about half the people's names down right now, but we're working on it

1140
01:34:44,680 --> 01:34:48,240
Could you check and see if there's a name on there? I'm looking for somebody

1141
01:34:49,080 --> 01:34:54,940
Gosh because you rolled a critical success, I guess I got the sheet right in front of me

1142
01:34:56,680 --> 01:35:04,680
Yeah, I'm looking for mr. Mills Mills Mills Mills, I'm a speed reader nope, okay

1143
01:35:04,680 --> 01:35:06,680
I

1144
01:35:13,320 --> 01:35:19,580
Guess I'll ring you up if I need anything else. Who is this? I'm in charge

1145
01:35:27,240 --> 01:35:28,760
Security

1146
01:35:28,760 --> 01:35:32,520
We're civilians, I'm FEMA I'm with FEMA. Oh

1147
01:35:33,240 --> 01:35:40,200
Okay, you should lead with that next time is what I'm gonna say because if you called back here with just a normal success

1148
01:35:40,200 --> 01:35:42,200
I'm asking who you are first

1149
01:35:42,520 --> 01:35:47,240
Yeah, well save this number as FEMA. So everybody knows

1150
01:35:49,640 --> 01:35:52,760
Did you call from your what did you call from

1151
01:35:52,760 --> 01:35:54,600
I

1152
01:35:54,600 --> 01:35:56,600
Could I have there was a phone in the office?

1153
01:35:56,600 --> 01:35:59,360
Skip Mills office, but could I have call?

1154
01:35:59,360 --> 01:36:04,060
I'm gonna give you I'm gonna tell you that it would be smarter if you would have called from the office

1155
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:10,120
Okay. Yeah, I I didn't have reception. So I use the cum covered telephone to call. I

1156
01:36:11,480 --> 01:36:14,680
Want to be clear the cum was in one location

1157
01:36:16,920 --> 01:36:21,440
You just did that he wasn't trying to Peter Parker's way through the office, okay

1158
01:36:21,960 --> 01:36:23,960
So I use

1159
01:36:31,040 --> 01:36:37,920
So you find out that Skip Mills is not at the shelter well he I tell them

1160
01:36:38,600 --> 01:36:41,900
well, they didn't have his name on the list there, but she also said that uh,

1161
01:36:42,640 --> 01:36:44,760
Not everybody's name is listed. So

1162
01:36:45,440 --> 01:36:50,200
I think that we should try his house first and and go there as a

1163
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
Bug backup plan

1164
01:36:53,040 --> 01:37:00,680
Jay Hawkins is saying and I agree that the classic spider-man noise is the whip not goose

1165
01:37:11,640 --> 01:37:15,660
Spider Wang spider Wang goose, whatever a spider King

1166
01:37:15,660 --> 01:37:25,060
On the phone, no, we didn't just under the desk look out here comes Skippy Mills

1167
01:37:27,580 --> 01:37:33,900
Good good one Garth. I like was he looking on the top of his desk for a dice that he dropped

1168
01:37:35,180 --> 01:37:37,180
You never know

1169
01:37:39,580 --> 01:37:41,580
They do end up in strange places

1170
01:37:41,780 --> 01:37:47,660
That's true, I can't actually fault it there's a chance that thing ricocheted about 12 times and landed back there

1171
01:37:48,940 --> 01:37:50,940
Behind the scenes everybody

1172
01:37:51,540 --> 01:37:58,400
Well, okay, so it does bear noting that when we got the idea for letting you watch

1173
01:38:00,220 --> 01:38:04,900
These recording sessions we didn't know they would very quickly become

1174
01:38:06,240 --> 01:38:08,800
remote technological nightmares, yeah

1175
01:38:09,800 --> 01:38:12,640
We thought it would be a fun time with us all in the room

1176
01:38:14,440 --> 01:38:19,240
So, thank you for bearing with us and joining and I hope your quarantines going good

1177
01:38:19,320 --> 01:38:24,440
Yeah bear down on finals guys fat dog. Yeah, it's fat dog this

1178
01:38:28,920 --> 01:38:31,000
Very insensitive of you Zach

1179
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:36,560
God I his face when he's like

1180
01:38:39,400 --> 01:38:42,600
That's where I got it from sorry we're talking about community

1181
01:38:43,240 --> 01:38:49,160
Okay, I was like, I don't remember this coming up. Yeah, it's it's a community episode. All right

1182
01:38:49,160 --> 01:38:52,000
I'm gonna go pee and then let's crack back into this

1183
01:38:53,160 --> 01:38:55,040
Are you serious?

1184
01:38:55,040 --> 01:38:57,040
No, so, okay

1185
01:38:59,040 --> 01:39:00,520
Joe

1186
01:39:00,520 --> 01:39:06,360
Yo, Barry Fredrickson gonna look over for your name Fredrickson looking at the map while

1187
01:39:07,120 --> 01:39:09,560
Smoochie is on the phone you notice that

1188
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:14,200
Skip Mills lives a few miles away from here in

1189
01:39:15,080 --> 01:39:18,200
the north side of LaFontaine

1190
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:24,640
Earl's rent a space is on the way there. It's in between the two locations cool

1191
01:39:24,640 --> 01:39:29,760
It's tempting is it might be to hit that up. We should maybe check it on the way back. Oh

1192
01:39:31,640 --> 01:39:33,640
Shit I'm not a southern character

1193
01:39:33,640 --> 01:39:39,440
It's immediately default role-playing voice, oh it's hard. Oh

1194
01:39:41,720 --> 01:39:44,640
Don't you know so yeah, that's what I sound like

1195
01:39:45,120 --> 01:39:50,960
And always have so don't let nobody tell you any otherwise and if I go leprechaun

1196
01:39:50,960 --> 01:39:54,120
It's not because I'm actually secretly a leprechaun. So

1197
01:39:55,160 --> 01:39:57,160
Can we roll to check on that?

1198
01:39:57,160 --> 01:39:59,160
a

1199
01:40:00,240 --> 01:40:02,240
Leprechaun

1200
01:40:03,720 --> 01:40:04,800
Love it

1201
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:11,560
So, you know, they told us that the first thing we need to do is to find Stephen Mills. Skip Mills. Skip. Yeah

1202
01:40:11,560 --> 01:40:13,560
skip I just I

1203
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:21,240
Definitely, I'm not this is you just know I'm not saying this is the group because we're not supposed to give out personal information

1204
01:40:21,960 --> 01:40:23,760
but

1205
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:28,400
Definitely one of his kids is named skip and after seeing this come covered office. He's like

1206
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:32,060
He's like no, no skip would do this

1207
01:40:33,400 --> 01:40:35,400
This is a Stephen for sure

1208
01:40:37,880 --> 01:40:45,160
Okay, okay so I I agree I think we should go find skip and then on the way back we can hit that storage box

1209
01:40:45,160 --> 01:40:47,000
and if he

1210
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:52,320
Turns out to be some help. I think we'll need all the help we can get with that thing. Probably I agree

1211
01:40:52,320 --> 01:40:58,880
Yeah, yeah real quick before we go. Well, you know what? Maybe we should just get the drop on them at the shelter

1212
01:40:58,880 --> 01:41:02,600
I was gonna say maybe we should have that call that lady that Becky back and

1213
01:41:03,200 --> 01:41:06,640
And say hey, could you just start looking around for old skip there?

1214
01:41:06,680 --> 01:41:09,680
But maybe we don't want to alert him that we're on to him

1215
01:41:09,920 --> 01:41:13,240
Perhaps you could have her call us if she discovers him there

1216
01:41:13,320 --> 01:41:16,040
That's what I was getting at, but I don't want her tipping him off

1217
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:20,960
But if she does come across the information, you know without probing, yeah, I don't I don't know

1218
01:41:21,520 --> 01:41:23,600
You know what to expect from skip but uh

1219
01:41:24,280 --> 01:41:28,240
My conversation with that lady. I don't know if I could convince her to

1220
01:41:28,920 --> 01:41:34,560
To even try to go look for him. Oh, wow. I didn't say it was it was she real rude dinner

1221
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:42,200
No, I mean, I guess I could call back if you guys think but uh, it kind of just seems like we're

1222
01:41:42,200 --> 01:41:44,200
Not

1223
01:41:46,040 --> 01:41:53,360
Going anywhere, yeah, let's just go. Yeah, I'm just gonna say it you could go somewhere. Oh, yeah. Yeah, let's go to skips house

1224
01:41:54,240 --> 01:41:56,240
Any idea how to get there?

1225
01:41:57,440 --> 01:42:04,360
Yeah, we've got them and like how are we gonna get there walking right? I think we should probably oh that's you're simple

1226
01:42:04,480 --> 01:42:08,600
We got it. It's too cold and slippery out there. We got to take a vehicle

1227
01:42:08,600 --> 01:42:14,520
I'm sorry, but I'm from the north and they're just you know, it it riles me up here and these folks say such

1228
01:42:14,840 --> 01:42:16,880
How far is the house from where we are?

1229
01:42:20,280 --> 01:42:24,400
Can we can we get a vehicle from the city utilities to use

1230
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:30,400
Exactly. They've got all kinds of they've got all kinds of vehicles for doing just this sort of sort of work

1231
01:42:30,440 --> 01:42:36,560
Yeah, does anyone have bureaucracy? I do what's it because I'm so good at talking to people. I have 50

1232
01:42:37,280 --> 01:42:43,720
Holy shit, so I let's does anyone else have a higher bureaucracy than that? No. Okay, so

1233
01:42:45,920 --> 01:42:49,240
Do you want to play this out Justin? Oh, you know it transport

1234
01:42:50,680 --> 01:42:55,760
Can I go talk to Tanya my one true love? Oh, oh she oh there she is

1235
01:42:56,320 --> 01:42:57,480
Sorry

1236
01:42:57,480 --> 01:43:02,520
Sorry, I had to turn it about that way. You see the logo, you know Carhartt

1237
01:43:02,520 --> 01:43:06,560
It's uh, it's not a little it's a lifestyle brand now and it also keeps you warm

1238
01:43:06,680 --> 01:43:11,280
Is Tanya just hanging out outside or something outside of the trailer or do we need to work our way back?

1239
01:43:11,280 --> 01:43:15,680
Yeah, no, you can't leave that there. If you leave that there, then we'll have to come get it later

1240
01:43:15,880 --> 01:43:20,880
What do you think? No, you can't just do that. Oh, if everyone did every what you're doing every single day

1241
01:43:21,920 --> 01:43:29,680
Excuse me. I'm sorry to interrupt what seemed to be extremely good leadership skills, but yeah

1242
01:43:29,680 --> 01:43:31,680
well, that's all I have I I

1243
01:43:31,920 --> 01:43:34,920
We need to borrow one of your big trucks

1244
01:43:35,560 --> 01:43:37,960
Not the small ones but a big

1245
01:43:38,800 --> 01:43:40,800
snow truck of some kind to

1246
01:43:41,400 --> 01:43:48,720
Go find skip. Do you think we could swing that? He slips her a $1 bill as he's saying

1247
01:43:54,840 --> 01:43:57,400
And I wink and I go I know how this works

1248
01:43:58,160 --> 01:44:03,480
She dies laughing she thinks this is the funniest thing she's ever seen she's like

1249
01:44:08,840 --> 01:44:13,640
People people in the government have no sense of humor these days. That's fucking hilarious

1250
01:44:15,480 --> 01:44:22,400
Joking only she rifles through this big keychain that she has and she finds one that's got a

1251
01:44:22,400 --> 01:44:28,240
Honestly, I'm out of my element here and it's not in the scenario

1252
01:44:28,240 --> 01:44:31,920
What kind of vehicle would they be using to to drive around town?

1253
01:44:31,920 --> 01:44:37,760
Do you think this is a big old like a monster truck a pickup truck with the weird stuff in the back a month?

1254
01:44:37,760 --> 01:44:40,600
Yeah, it's a monster truck. I changed my mind town monster truck

1255
01:44:40,600 --> 01:44:46,260
It's used for it's used for parades and stuff for the city utility. It's called this. It's called the snow angel

1256
01:44:48,600 --> 01:44:51,560
It is like a disco ball that's always rotating on the back

1257
01:44:52,400 --> 01:44:57,240
yeah, no, it's a pickup truck with a disco ball hanging from the mirror up front and

1258
01:44:58,320 --> 01:45:00,320
monster truck no and

1259
01:45:00,760 --> 01:45:07,360
Not even one of those pickup truck monster trucks. Ooh, yeah, like where it's like a little it's like a regular-sized pickup truck

1260
01:45:07,360 --> 01:45:11,360
But it has big old monster truck wheels. Oh, yeah, we can do that. That's yeah

1261
01:45:12,240 --> 01:45:14,800
You got big ass and truck nurse

1262
01:45:16,940 --> 01:45:19,300
Okay disco balls I

1263
01:45:20,300 --> 01:45:24,180
And it's got a big old sick-ass machine gun on the back

1264
01:45:26,500 --> 01:45:32,580
It's got there's no balls on the back that are branded city utility. Oh hell yeah, we'll take it

1265
01:45:32,580 --> 01:45:37,820
We'll take it on our way out. I want to go over in the corner of the office

1266
01:45:37,820 --> 01:45:41,220
We're in and in my backpack. I pull out what looks like a

1267
01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:48,700
Smoke detector and I stick it on the ceiling and turn it on. Oh sick. What'd you just put in there?

1268
01:45:48,700 --> 01:45:50,980
Yeah, what was you fill in your fellow?

1269
01:45:51,620 --> 01:45:56,480
Investigators and on what you just put what I did there. Yeah, it's uh, it's got a camera in it

1270
01:45:57,220 --> 01:45:59,340
See if anybody comes back here

1271
01:46:00,060 --> 01:46:01,340
You know

1272
01:46:01,340 --> 01:46:03,440
Just in case very cool

1273
01:46:07,020 --> 01:46:11,740
You don't you know, I think that's pretty cool too don't start any fires cuz it doesn't work like that

1274
01:46:11,780 --> 01:46:14,540
It's just do you have more of these?

1275
01:46:15,420 --> 01:46:20,660
I've just brought the one don't don't you know that now would be a good time to talk about what we all brought to this

1276
01:46:20,660 --> 01:46:27,340
Year party. I think that's a great idea after you guys see me stick that on there you say that and I just put my

1277
01:46:27,340 --> 01:46:30,120
I have like a hiker size backpack

1278
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:34,180
Put it on the ground and start pulling stuff out of it to show you guys

1279
01:46:34,300 --> 01:46:39,640
I've got a bunch of hand and feet warmers just in case cool. I've got two

1280
01:46:40,340 --> 01:46:42,780
GPS trackers like tiny GPS trackers

1281
01:46:43,620 --> 01:46:47,040
I've got that smoke detector that I already stuck on the ceiling

1282
01:46:47,220 --> 01:46:52,420
I've got a pair of night-vision goggles a pair of handcuffs a pair of binoculars and

1283
01:46:53,220 --> 01:46:58,020
A grapple hook with 15 feet of rope tied to it. That's cool Joe

1284
01:46:58,300 --> 01:47:04,880
He looks at you guys and he pulls a little notebook out of his pocket out of the inside coat of his pocket

1285
01:47:04,880 --> 01:47:07,620
I simply brought the only tool that I need

1286
01:47:08,180 --> 01:47:13,760
Typically we find new tools in the field. Wait, what is it a pocket knife? No pocket notebook

1287
01:47:13,900 --> 01:47:19,260
Okay, I admire that kind of old-fashioned Terrence Terrence thinks that that's really fucking cool

1288
01:47:19,780 --> 01:47:25,020
Instinct. Yeah, I got a don't you know, I think that's pretty fucking cool tool Terrence opens up

1289
01:47:25,020 --> 01:47:31,340
He has like a leather. What do you call like us? What is it when it's like a little like a weird hard leather suit?

1290
01:47:31,780 --> 01:47:36,340
Yes. Yeah, he like pops it open and he has a

1291
01:47:37,020 --> 01:47:42,540
scalpel and some other little metal instruments some gloves and surgical masks a

1292
01:47:43,700 --> 01:47:50,300
magnifying glass some first-aid supplies a cool book and a lighter and some cigarettes and

1293
01:47:50,460 --> 01:47:54,260
I think did I say gloves and scarf? I can't remember if I said that I zoned out. I

1294
01:47:55,420 --> 01:47:59,420
Just brought the essentials and some a couple extras

1295
01:47:59,980 --> 01:48:04,840
What about what about you? Well, here's what here's what I got and marks myth

1296
01:48:06,340 --> 01:48:10,300
He has just like a carry-on like wheeling little suitcase thing

1297
01:48:10,780 --> 01:48:18,320
and he's got some some warm sweaters some warm socks a book about like the history of the FBI like a

1298
01:48:18,680 --> 01:48:21,860
Book about like an historical event in the 30s or something cool

1299
01:48:22,100 --> 01:48:28,260
But then he also sets down like his his checked luggage and it's this big long hard case and you see two

1300
01:48:28,580 --> 01:48:33,020
Like target shotguns in it. It's like, you know, I'm I'm

1301
01:48:33,660 --> 01:48:36,100
When you know when I'm not shooting

1302
01:48:37,060 --> 01:48:42,380
Unknown horrors for for the big DG there. I I took up shooting skeet

1303
01:48:43,340 --> 01:48:49,100
And it's pretty it's I've traveled all over with these before so is no problem checking them on the plane there

1304
01:48:49,480 --> 01:48:53,340
So if anybody else needs if anybody thinks they're handy with a shotgun there

1305
01:48:53,340 --> 01:48:59,260
Oh, I'd say I'm slightly above average with a firearm. I'm almost exactly average. Yeah, I

1306
01:48:59,980 --> 01:49:04,820
Know my way around a shotgun, but I don't believe I'll be needing one right now

1307
01:49:05,580 --> 01:49:11,740
You know, it's here. They're too big and if I shoot it on middle to shoot me backwards like a cartoon

1308
01:49:12,460 --> 01:49:13,740
character

1309
01:49:13,740 --> 01:49:17,260
That is a yeah, that is an issue with these sometimes there

1310
01:49:17,260 --> 01:49:22,580
So I'd say just go ahead and bring those with us in the truck and hopefully we don't have to use them anyway

1311
01:49:22,580 --> 01:49:24,580
Yeah, so I got those in socks

1312
01:49:25,500 --> 01:49:28,780
Can I have you guys do the headphones off for just real quick and I'll do a quick wave

1313
01:49:30,100 --> 01:49:32,100
my

1314
01:49:32,980 --> 01:49:36,700
Guy was very purposefully not telling them about the two guns that he has

1315
01:49:36,700 --> 01:49:42,020
He discarded the carry-on and put him into holsters on underneath his coat and very specifically

1316
01:49:42,280 --> 01:49:47,020
Only pulled out that notebook from inside his coat. He didn't open this coat. Fantastic. Yeah

1317
01:49:50,700 --> 01:49:52,700
You're back so

1318
01:49:53,180 --> 01:49:58,500
You guys are going to skip Mills's first. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so you load up the truck

1319
01:49:59,260 --> 01:50:03,740
And you head a few miles to the home of skip Mills in

1320
01:50:04,300 --> 01:50:08,640
LaFontaine and as you're driving through it's the same site that you saw earlier through the back of

1321
01:50:09,260 --> 01:50:11,260
that truck the

1322
01:50:11,300 --> 01:50:15,020
City was just completely destroyed

1323
01:50:15,020 --> 01:50:21,300
I mean I we live in the Midwest and we have the internet so we know what that looks like

1324
01:50:22,100 --> 01:50:28,300
Well, dude, do we Zach some of us some of us some of us lives through it Zach

1325
01:50:28,420 --> 01:50:32,420
And some of us apparently we're at Zach. Yeah yours truly

1326
01:50:33,060 --> 01:50:36,380
Didn't I moved here one year after I moved here in Oh eight?

1327
01:50:36,460 --> 01:50:41,260
Perfect the great ice storm of ott7 struck struck Springfield drunk

1328
01:50:42,500 --> 01:50:44,980
Springfield it struck it down for two full weeks

1329
01:50:45,700 --> 01:50:53,060
Covered an ass it was stuck at my friend's house and we couldn't play Guitar Hero because there was no electricity. That's horrible

1330
01:50:53,060 --> 01:50:55,260
I bet that's the worst thing that happened

1331
01:50:56,260 --> 01:50:58,260
It was actually really fun

1332
01:51:02,620 --> 01:51:05,180
Yeah, you guys loving this quarantine, all right, so

1333
01:51:07,020 --> 01:51:12,100
You guys get out to this house in a dilapidated a dilapidated a dilapidated

1334
01:51:12,860 --> 01:51:15,660
neighborhood a few miles from city utilities

1335
01:51:16,260 --> 01:51:24,300
Nearly all the residences on this block are foreclosed and those that aren't are busy recovering from the storm

1336
01:51:25,180 --> 01:51:28,100
The windows of this house have been papered as

1337
01:51:28,820 --> 01:51:32,380
You park even you can hear jazz music

1338
01:51:33,100 --> 01:51:34,620
loudly blaring

1339
01:51:34,620 --> 01:51:40,860
From inside and as you all get out, I want you to tell me what you're bringing with you as you smell

1340
01:51:42,020 --> 01:51:48,440
Who an odd stench that it seems really familiar since you've been in that office for a while

1341
01:51:48,700 --> 01:51:51,360
But even through this like frigid air

1342
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:59,560
It's just Bradford Tree City out here is like you're walking through the campus of Missouri State University in fall

1343
01:52:00,440 --> 01:52:02,440
famous canals like

1344
01:52:02,460 --> 01:52:03,680
jism

1345
01:52:03,680 --> 01:52:07,520
Yes, I I leave my backpack in the truck

1346
01:52:07,520 --> 01:52:13,140
But I bring with me one GPS tracker and then I put a new

1347
01:52:13,480 --> 01:52:19,820
Set of foot warmers in my shoes and hand warmers and my gloves nice continue on staying warm, baby

1348
01:52:20,140 --> 01:52:27,180
Terrence would have his suitcase with him at all times. It's not like a super humongous suitcase because I'm not carrying anything like

1349
01:52:28,080 --> 01:52:33,220
Enormous in there. It's a tiny suitcase. Yeah, like a mid-sized not like those huge

1350
01:52:33,220 --> 01:52:38,420
I don't know. I'm just thinking of how people have those like enormous ones. I just have my my nine millimeter

1351
01:52:39,120 --> 01:52:43,060
Under my under my parka as we step out of the monster truck

1352
01:52:43,460 --> 01:52:49,540
I've got my gun and a pair and a pair of socks. Okay, I throw an extra pair of socks into my

1353
01:52:50,140 --> 01:52:53,780
Into my back pocket when you hop out. I look back at the truck

1354
01:52:53,780 --> 01:52:56,700
I'm like, do I know that you have that gun on you or not?

1355
01:52:56,700 --> 01:53:01,660
Yeah, don't know all of us except for Joe have our service. I don't have a gun on me

1356
01:53:01,660 --> 01:53:06,140
I don't have a gun either. I've thought when he sent the circle thing that said no guns

1357
01:53:06,140 --> 01:53:11,780
That means I couldn't have a gun that is what yeah for sure unless you were with the force

1358
01:53:12,060 --> 01:53:15,580
But he but he's with the force is what it sounds like he described

1359
01:53:16,700 --> 01:53:18,740
Did you describe out of character the?

1360
01:53:19,380 --> 01:53:23,700
Yeah, I think you said FBI mustache at one point nevermind. We don't necessarily know that you're

1361
01:53:27,260 --> 01:53:34,220
No, well first of all, what do you guys how are you involved with all this if you're not I've never met anybody who wasn't

1362
01:53:35,420 --> 01:53:40,220
Like me on one of these missions, but first of all, what do I mean by like me?

1363
01:53:40,220 --> 01:53:44,980
I don't mean anything by like me because you don't know I'm no I'm no federal agent

1364
01:53:44,980 --> 01:53:48,900
I'm a I'm a second Second Amendment enthusiast and

1365
01:53:49,660 --> 01:53:55,140
I'd rather not get into my personal details and to be honest. I really don't care about yours

1366
01:53:55,580 --> 01:53:59,100
How is he come on like that guy's gotta be a cop listen to him?

1367
01:54:00,460 --> 01:54:01,860
anyway

1368
01:54:01,860 --> 01:54:07,100
Mind if I bring one of your shotguns? Well, I kind of I kind of was leaving them behind cuz it was inconspicuous

1369
01:54:07,100 --> 01:54:14,400
We also you know, hey, I thought you all would be strapped as it were Mark Smith would know that looking around

1370
01:54:15,740 --> 01:54:21,020
This neighborhood is desolate. Honestly the idea of being inconspicuous in a place like this

1371
01:54:21,980 --> 01:54:25,940
seems strange because when you look around it is

1372
01:54:26,620 --> 01:54:34,560
Ghost town. I mean frozen iced over but still like there is nothing and the only the only reason that it feels

1373
01:54:36,020 --> 01:54:42,660
Normal in any way is the music coming from this house, but that combined with the smell and also

1374
01:54:43,340 --> 01:54:48,180
What you have come to expect from Delta Green leads you to believe that

1375
01:54:49,220 --> 01:54:51,220
You know, it's probably just house full of

1376
01:54:51,980 --> 01:54:54,360
Come that's gonna come alive. Oh, yeah

1377
01:54:56,380 --> 01:54:57,580
So

1378
01:54:57,580 --> 01:54:58,420
cube

1379
01:54:58,420 --> 01:55:02,940
Mark Smith looks around and he like sees he just hears the wind howling

1380
01:55:03,380 --> 01:55:08,460
Behind the jazz and like a dog barking in the distance, but he doesn't see any other activity

1381
01:55:08,980 --> 01:55:12,620
And he thinks about what he's seen on these on these missions before

1382
01:55:13,620 --> 01:55:14,780
You know

1383
01:55:14,780 --> 01:55:20,360
Dad might not be a bad idea there and I hand him I hand him one shotgun and I take the other

1384
01:55:20,900 --> 01:55:25,460
when you hear those dogs barking will you roll for me an

1385
01:55:26,580 --> 01:55:30,780
intelligence or a science biology or a

1386
01:55:30,780 --> 01:55:32,780
Now

1387
01:55:32,980 --> 01:55:40,620
That everybody now just Thomas when you say certain things it unlocks me to ask you for a role sometimes

1388
01:55:41,820 --> 01:55:47,140
39 on a 75 intelligence when you're listening to those dogs barking

1389
01:55:48,060 --> 01:55:50,900
You could have sworn that you heard one. That's like

1390
01:55:53,180 --> 01:55:55,660
Like howls out in pain and then you hear a

1391
01:55:55,700 --> 01:55:57,700
Oh

1392
01:56:00,380 --> 01:56:05,900
That doesn't sound like a dog did any of you fellas hear that hear that dog maybe just get

1393
01:56:06,900 --> 01:56:11,220
It by an owl there. I heard something. I don't know I didn't

1394
01:56:12,020 --> 01:56:16,420
I might have just heard barking but I wasn't paying no attention. I was looking at this shark

1395
01:56:18,340 --> 01:56:20,340
It's always yeah, it's always good

1396
01:56:20,980 --> 01:56:28,660
To be be aware of the firearms in your possession at all times because it's really cold outside the moment

1397
01:56:28,660 --> 01:56:33,340
You're not that's when accidents start happening. But what are we waiting around for? Let's go. Come on

1398
01:56:33,340 --> 01:56:35,540
We got a cum monster to catch real fast

1399
01:56:35,540 --> 01:56:39,060
I assume that the this is a neighborhood that doesn't have power is that the case and

1400
01:56:39,460 --> 01:56:42,500
If that is the case, do we see lights from the house that we're approaching?

1401
01:56:42,740 --> 01:56:48,020
So there are lights in this house that you see on but the windows are papered over

1402
01:56:48,500 --> 01:56:51,220
But you can kind of see some light through the paper

1403
01:56:51,220 --> 01:56:54,900
but mostly you can tell that there is power due to

1404
01:56:55,500 --> 01:57:03,300
You know the music blaring you can assume unless it was some sort of wireless speaker with a pre-charged phone

1405
01:57:03,920 --> 01:57:06,580
easily possible in these times, however

1406
01:57:07,260 --> 01:57:12,760
Most people aren't like flaunting their electricity or flaunting their battery life

1407
01:57:13,760 --> 01:57:18,720
When they don't write power the rest of the neighborhood is dark around us, yes, okay

1408
01:57:18,920 --> 01:57:21,360
Yeah, and looking around like it said earlier

1409
01:57:21,400 --> 01:57:25,840
You honestly can't really tell the difference between the homes that have been foreclosed

1410
01:57:25,960 --> 01:57:31,440
And the ones that people are living in that don't have power anymore, but this definitely does seem like a place where?

1411
01:57:32,320 --> 01:57:38,360
Where power is is few and far between cool. I forgot if you answered me earlier. Is it day or night time right now?

1412
01:57:38,360 --> 01:57:41,720
It is morning. Okay, you guys arrived in it like

1413
01:57:42,400 --> 01:57:46,280
8 a.m.. 7 a.m.. Somewhere in there, so it's probably

1414
01:57:47,080 --> 01:57:51,400
9 a.m.. By now cool. What took it's just really far from the airport

1415
01:57:51,400 --> 01:57:58,240
We were at the airport at 1145 right it says in my notes that the agents arrive at 7 a.m.. On January 6th

1416
01:57:58,240 --> 01:58:03,480
I don't know why that is if you arrived in st. Louis at 1245

1417
01:58:03,480 --> 01:58:06,640
But maybe you had to wait we had to wait for lion's choice to open

1418
01:58:06,640 --> 01:58:14,960
Honestly you probably had to wait for this like and then we do and then we drove the 10 minutes to La Fontaine

1419
01:58:17,260 --> 01:58:23,920
Yeah, no you you definitely just had to wait for the rest of the like the trail the supplies and everything to get all packed

1420
01:58:23,920 --> 01:58:25,920
Up and oh that makes sense they realize

1421
01:58:27,080 --> 01:58:29,080
Yeah, and then like you know

1422
01:58:29,760 --> 01:58:31,200
Gary wasn't there yet

1423
01:58:31,200 --> 01:58:36,920
And so they had to wait on Gary and then they realized that they'd loaded up with the wrong supplies into this truck

1424
01:58:36,920 --> 01:58:41,020
And so they had to switch them out with the supplies that were going into the other truck

1425
01:58:41,020 --> 01:58:44,560
But they're both going to these her. It's cold out here. That's good

1426
01:58:48,080 --> 01:58:50,120
How do you guys approach the house quickly

1427
01:58:52,360 --> 01:58:56,640
So any of you fellas have any kind of crime fight in

1428
01:58:57,360 --> 01:58:58,760
experience

1429
01:58:58,760 --> 01:59:02,840
Official vigilante or otherwise oh, yeah, okay?

1430
01:59:03,320 --> 01:59:09,640
Well, why don't you and I any is anybody here real good at talking as it were?

1431
01:59:10,120 --> 01:59:12,760
Super cold um yes, I am

1432
01:59:13,400 --> 01:59:18,800
General alright, I don't know if he's gonna be super receptive to seeing us just with the shotgun

1433
01:59:18,800 --> 01:59:23,480
So we might want to keep those a little bit hidden, but why don't you talk to this fella, okay?

1434
01:59:23,480 --> 01:59:26,440
I took the shotgun under my duster

1435
01:59:26,440 --> 01:59:33,600
And I knock on the door the music is so loud from inside that you know that no matter how hard you knock

1436
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:41,200
You're probably not gonna get a response this music is like blaring. Okay. I checked the door is it locked nope I?

1437
01:59:41,960 --> 01:59:43,480
Open it up

1438
01:59:43,480 --> 01:59:50,000
What do I see when you open it up one you are here looking at me with a stench you're hit

1439
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:57,160
Just like like almost like your hair just goes stands back as it's just like a waft a big

1440
01:59:57,360 --> 02:00:00,880
waft of this smell that you have smelled

1441
02:00:01,400 --> 02:00:02,520
now

1442
02:00:02,520 --> 02:00:04,020
many times

1443
02:00:04,020 --> 02:00:05,480
today

1444
02:00:05,480 --> 02:00:07,480
that reminds you of

1445
02:00:08,160 --> 02:00:13,200
Come I don't know. I'm trying to think of a different way to say that of like it reminds you of

1446
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,000
your room and

1447
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
Creator

1448
02:00:18,040 --> 02:00:19,240
But

1449
02:00:19,240 --> 02:00:22,200
You find as you guys walk into this home

1450
02:00:22,960 --> 02:00:28,460
Mills has turned his home into a sickening tribute to the flesh

1451
02:00:28,760 --> 02:00:36,600
The walls are plastered with pornography of every shade some printed from the internet and some from purchased

1452
02:00:36,840 --> 02:00:44,120
Magazines the TVs and computer screens are all transmitting filth the home reeks of

1453
02:00:45,040 --> 02:00:51,040
Organic decay and the heat is set as high as it will go

1454
02:00:52,400 --> 02:00:59,520
It is toasty it is a toaster oven in here and the the oh

1455
02:01:01,760 --> 02:01:05,900
God everyone everyone roll Constitution except for

1456
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:08,440
except for

1457
02:01:08,440 --> 02:01:12,120
Fast night you're good. No shit. I rolled a one again

1458
02:01:12,800 --> 02:01:19,120
No way, I promise that is wild less interesting, but I rolled an 83 again

1459
02:01:21,120 --> 02:01:23,120
No way

1460
02:01:24,440 --> 02:01:27,680
Yeah, technically that's just as crazy guys so I

1461
02:01:29,720 --> 02:01:31,720
Failed mine I was a 97

1462
02:01:33,720 --> 02:01:35,720
So the two of you are

1463
02:01:36,480 --> 02:01:42,760
Immediately taken aback by everything about this and oh geez cut monster

1464
02:01:44,520 --> 02:01:47,320
Wentworth just covers his nose with a glove and

1465
02:01:48,160 --> 02:01:52,360
Maybe wretches a little but yeah, it's the most emotion you guys have seen in

1466
02:01:53,240 --> 02:01:56,000
Frederickson for God knows how long and

1467
02:01:56,640 --> 02:01:58,080
maybe ever and

1468
02:01:58,080 --> 02:02:03,540
As you are adjusting to the inside of this home

1469
02:02:03,820 --> 02:02:08,720
It's hot as fuck Terrence walks in and the first thing he notices is the heat not the

1470
02:02:09,980 --> 02:02:15,180
Noxious fumes that are being emitted from everything. Where does the music sound like it's coming from?

1471
02:02:15,420 --> 02:02:17,420
The music is coming from upstairs

1472
02:02:17,980 --> 02:02:19,180
would

1473
02:02:19,180 --> 02:02:26,120
Anyone care to accompany me upstairs for to turn this off? I'm already headed up the stairs

1474
02:02:26,120 --> 02:02:28,120
So, oh, that's cool that you just did

1475
02:02:30,540 --> 02:02:32,540
Well, I did it five seconds ago

1476
02:02:34,540 --> 02:02:36,420
Okay, so

1477
02:02:36,420 --> 02:02:42,540
Justin is going up the stairs with a smoochie following behind. What are the other two doing?

1478
02:02:43,120 --> 02:02:45,120
Wentworth is just staying downstairs

1479
02:02:45,700 --> 02:02:50,500
Trying to overcome how grossed out he is and using the time to like

1480
02:02:51,300 --> 02:02:55,940
In his acclamation to the room. He's using it to scan the room and take it all in

1481
02:02:56,060 --> 02:03:02,420
See if there's anything he can glean from the scene downstairs. What's your human? I mean the baseline 10, okay

1482
02:03:02,420 --> 02:03:05,140
And what is your medicine? I've got a first aid of 30

1483
02:03:05,740 --> 02:03:07,740
Okay, and what is your alertness?

1484
02:03:08,100 --> 02:03:10,100
70 on the alertness, okay

1485
02:03:10,940 --> 02:03:12,940
Thomas does

1486
02:03:13,100 --> 02:03:15,100
Mark Smith have

1487
02:03:15,380 --> 02:03:16,700
human or

1488
02:03:16,700 --> 02:03:17,660
medicine

1489
02:03:17,660 --> 02:03:24,100
60 human no medicine 50 alertness. Okay. So as you guys are kind of walking around

1490
02:03:25,340 --> 02:03:27,340
downstairs

1491
02:03:27,340 --> 02:03:30,560
Justin and Luke as you guys are heading upstairs go ahead and take your headphones off

1492
02:03:33,420 --> 02:03:35,420
As

1493
02:03:36,980 --> 02:03:42,140
You guys are walking around oh gosh, let's see Mark Smith you notice that

1494
02:03:42,860 --> 02:03:44,860
skips descent into madness

1495
02:03:45,980 --> 02:03:47,980
It takes a path

1496
02:03:48,780 --> 02:03:56,260
Seems to be layers and layers of pornography that he's can coon himself in with are getting more and more

1497
02:03:56,780 --> 02:04:03,620
Violent more and more deviant and you kind of begin to think as you're looking around

1498
02:04:04,140 --> 02:04:11,400
That this was some sort of attempt to cage himself in with his own twisted urges

1499
02:04:12,260 --> 02:04:14,260
coating the walls and

1500
02:04:14,420 --> 02:04:16,420
stimulation to prevent himself

1501
02:04:17,020 --> 02:04:19,020
from leaving and

1502
02:04:19,980 --> 02:04:24,640
Joe we've got Frederickson with alertness noticing that

1503
02:04:25,240 --> 02:04:32,360
This is not the house of a bachelor or at least not one as mundane as Mills was before the store because the interior

1504
02:04:32,720 --> 02:04:34,720
design is gaudy and

1505
02:04:35,640 --> 02:04:43,500
There are pictures of skip with his mother all over the mantle and I'm gonna go ahead and give these

1506
02:04:44,400 --> 02:04:46,400
one of these bird fellas

1507
02:04:46,760 --> 02:04:53,920
To get these boys back in here. Hey Luke, he can't hear me. That's the whole point. His headphones are literally off to

1508
02:04:54,800 --> 02:04:56,800
We couldn't yell out enough

1509
02:05:05,080 --> 02:05:11,360
Hi, hey and then so let's have Thomas and Joe take your headphones off as the other two go upstairs

1510
02:05:15,520 --> 02:05:20,600
Hmm clump clump clump as the two of you are walking up the stairs

1511
02:05:24,640 --> 02:05:25,520
Oh

1512
02:05:25,520 --> 02:05:28,800
Terrence fast night as soon as you turn the corner

1513
02:05:28,960 --> 02:05:33,480
He's got like one of those where you like walk up the set of stairs and then turn a corner to go up to the

1514
02:05:33,480 --> 02:05:38,440
next set of stairs as soon as you hit that corner and you look up with

1515
02:05:39,160 --> 02:05:46,040
Henry smoochy literally on your back like right looking over your shoulder the two of you see a

1516
02:05:46,440 --> 02:05:48,840
man in his early 30s and

1517
02:05:49,800 --> 02:05:52,320
He is completely naked

1518
02:05:52,800 --> 02:05:54,800
Cool that's all

1519
02:05:55,320 --> 02:05:57,640
No, that's not so he is

1520
02:05:59,800 --> 02:06:04,360
He is just covered in blood and scratches all over him

1521
02:06:04,360 --> 02:06:08,060
He is emaciated and he looks gaunt and his eyes are like

1522
02:06:08,680 --> 02:06:12,920
Completely like back in his head like he is not paying attention to you at all

1523
02:06:12,920 --> 02:06:19,280
But his dick is in his hand and he's just like slowly like hitting it against his thigh

1524
02:06:19,600 --> 02:06:26,160
Making this like pat pat pat pat pat sound and he turns and looks at you guys and

1525
02:06:26,800 --> 02:06:29,280
you see something in his eyes and

1526
02:06:30,520 --> 02:06:31,920
I

1527
02:06:31,920 --> 02:06:36,320
I need you to roll a humid either one of you or both of you. I have psychotherapy

1528
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:41,320
That'll do it. Okay. Oops. Yeah, I didn't pass on humid. I

1529
02:06:42,800 --> 02:06:48,440
Did not pass either. Okay, so this guy is just like looking at you with these big eyes and he starts

1530
02:06:49,200 --> 02:06:51,640
walking towards you and he's like

1531
02:06:52,560 --> 02:06:54,440
Hey

1532
02:06:54,440 --> 02:06:57,400
Hey, hey, hey. Hey. Hey, are you guys um

1533
02:06:58,320 --> 02:07:00,320
You guys are you guys are?

1534
02:07:01,400 --> 02:07:03,400
You guys are real, right?

1535
02:07:05,120 --> 02:07:09,200
Skip yeah skip is this you I need you both through all sanity. I

1536
02:07:12,040 --> 02:07:17,840
Passed 23 on a seven. I got a 17 on a 50. Oh, yeah. No, you guys are real you guys are

1537
02:07:18,640 --> 02:07:20,640
Oh, yeah

1538
02:07:20,720 --> 02:07:22,720
Well, I bet you're real

1539
02:07:23,520 --> 02:07:25,520
Kind of shoulders back

1540
02:07:25,520 --> 02:07:31,520
He puffs his chest out and he starts kind of like doing one of these where he's like kind of dancing

1541
02:07:31,520 --> 02:07:36,920
Well a little shoulder movement side to side back and forth and his hips are kind of moving back and forth

1542
02:07:37,240 --> 02:07:39,240
And he's like, what's up guys?

1543
02:07:39,720 --> 02:07:42,920
What's up, you coming into my house? You wanna hang out? You wanna have a time?

1544
02:07:43,480 --> 02:07:47,560
Skip, what are you guys doing? What are you what are you doing? Why aren't you at work?

1545
02:07:47,560 --> 02:07:52,080
Like no you guys are good. Maybe just one of you probably for now

1546
02:07:52,080 --> 02:07:56,260
I don't think I could handle both at the same time if you know what I mean, are you looking at you?

1547
02:07:56,960 --> 02:08:01,880
That's fun. Yeah, what are you guys doing? Who wants to who wants to come who wants to come first?

1548
02:08:01,880 --> 02:08:06,040
I mean over here not I mean if you want to we could but I read that's probably what?

1549
02:08:06,960 --> 02:08:13,800
You guys into this skip no. No the fuck is going on here. Sorry. I just I haven't really happened

1550
02:08:13,800 --> 02:08:15,120
I

1551
02:08:15,120 --> 02:08:19,760
Really haven't been able to practice my game in a while. You know what I'm talking about

1552
02:08:19,760 --> 02:08:23,240
But can I see where the music is coming from? Yeah, it's behind him in a room

1553
02:08:23,240 --> 02:08:26,360
Yeah, you can use like a serious understand him

1554
02:08:26,360 --> 02:08:31,280
But yeah, it is probably just a stereo blaring in one of the rooms. I get frustrated trying to

1555
02:08:31,800 --> 02:08:34,760
Figure out what the hell's going on with him and all the loud music

1556
02:08:34,760 --> 02:08:39,120
So I just I want to go into that room and shut the music off. Okay, so

1557
02:08:40,080 --> 02:08:42,040
Justin what is fast night doing?

1558
02:08:42,040 --> 02:08:45,200
I want to shout downstairs for the the other

1559
02:08:45,680 --> 02:08:50,420
Agents to come up here with us since we found skip sounds good Justin take your headphones off. Okay?

1560
02:08:52,080 --> 02:08:54,080
Luke as

1561
02:08:54,120 --> 02:08:56,120
Henry smoochy or rather

1562
02:08:56,440 --> 02:09:02,680
Glick goes into you you walk right past him and he's like, oh, hey, this guy's up first

1563
02:09:03,200 --> 02:09:04,760
sounds good and

1564
02:09:04,760 --> 02:09:06,560
He gets this

1565
02:09:06,560 --> 02:09:08,120
Huge smile on his face

1566
02:09:08,120 --> 02:09:14,320
He follows you into the room where you're going to turn off the stereo and you turn it off

1567
02:09:14,480 --> 02:09:17,080
It's dead silent. And when you turn around

1568
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,000
As his mouth just like

1569
02:09:22,320 --> 02:09:27,680
fully opens up and coming out of it is this wiggling worm that is like

1570
02:09:28,040 --> 02:09:30,240
It's got segments on it

1571
02:09:30,240 --> 02:09:36,720
But more importantly on the tip of it is just this black gaping hole and on the outside of it

1572
02:09:36,720 --> 02:09:40,120
there are four bone like needles that are coming out like

1573
02:09:40,600 --> 02:09:45,960
Tink-tink-tink-tink-tink-tink-tink-tink and they all like a claw like a claw arm

1574
02:09:46,400 --> 02:09:52,520
Basically in a machine where you win games, but this one they're made of bone and they are

1575
02:09:53,280 --> 02:09:57,160
Extremely sharp and they are coming right for you

1576
02:09:57,160 --> 02:10:02,560
Okay, wait just to clarify this thing came out of his mouth is it still connected to him or yes

1577
02:10:02,560 --> 02:10:08,480
so it seems to be in order mouth worm thing and then

1578
02:10:08,880 --> 02:10:15,000
Mouth on the end of the worm and then around the mouth are these Ford bone needles coming out

1579
02:10:15,200 --> 02:10:20,480
also, I love watching Joe and Thomas's face as they're watching this Joe's face is

1580
02:10:20,480 --> 02:10:23,560
Cracking me up. Anyway, I

1581
02:10:24,560 --> 02:10:27,040
Need a roll from you

1582
02:10:27,960 --> 02:10:33,240
Yeah, so get those dice ready. What are you doing to try to combat this or are you gonna happen?

1583
02:10:34,240 --> 02:10:36,240
well, no, I

1584
02:10:37,800 --> 02:10:45,560
Let out a scream like ah, oh actually roll sanity first just for important reasons

1585
02:10:45,560 --> 02:10:47,560
Oh

1586
02:10:49,480 --> 02:10:56,580
27 on us 50. Okay, so you're still gonna lose one sanity. Okay, and you can scream if you want to

1587
02:10:57,560 --> 02:11:02,480
Yeah, I scream and while I'm doing that I raise my shotgun up

1588
02:11:02,480 --> 02:11:05,720
I don't and I pull the trigger but the safety's on

1589
02:11:06,360 --> 02:11:10,960
What why would you make the safety on without rolling cuz I didn't turn it off cuz

1590
02:11:11,520 --> 02:11:15,760
He was saying how he likes gun safety, so I try to do that and

1591
02:11:16,920 --> 02:11:22,440
Before I can like flip it over to turn the safety off. I just like shove the barrel into the thing's mouth

1592
02:11:22,520 --> 02:11:23,280
Okay, cool

1593
02:11:23,280 --> 02:11:28,880
so I'll let you roll firearms if you want to if it's higher than melee weapons because you're using the firearm as a

1594
02:11:29,400 --> 02:11:33,300
Melee weapon and I am rolling and I succeeded with a 28

1595
02:11:33,980 --> 02:11:36,840
Okay, I got higher firearms. So I

1596
02:11:36,840 --> 02:11:38,840
I

1597
02:11:38,960 --> 02:11:40,960
Got an 85. Oh

1598
02:11:41,480 --> 02:11:44,600
I doubt that's a success. No, that is fit

1599
02:11:45,520 --> 02:11:50,160
Okay, so it's gonna be one of these I'm gonna bring the rest of the boys in here

1600
02:11:56,400 --> 02:12:03,340
I turned down the monitor volume on my headphone, so I wouldn't accidentally catch any words, but I still heard a jump-scare in there

1601
02:12:04,340 --> 02:12:06,340
I heard some screeches

1602
02:12:08,980 --> 02:12:10,980
Lordy Lordy

1603
02:12:12,300 --> 02:12:17,780
Smith and Fredrickson from downstairs the two of you here first Justin

1604
02:12:18,820 --> 02:12:21,780
someone skips up here and it's it's uh

1605
02:12:22,300 --> 02:12:24,300
Ten seconds later you hear ah

1606
02:12:25,220 --> 02:12:31,540
Do we hear any like running or footsteps or pounding or anything or just the screen for now? You just hear the screams

1607
02:12:31,540 --> 02:12:32,740
a

1608
02:12:32,740 --> 02:12:36,700
Little comforting quick. What's it called when you go back and change something?

1609
02:12:37,380 --> 02:12:38,900
retcon

1610
02:12:38,900 --> 02:12:39,780
and

1611
02:12:39,780 --> 02:12:41,780
quick retroactive

1612
02:12:42,100 --> 02:12:45,620
Conflagration, what's that word mean? So a proactive re envisioning

1613
02:12:46,580 --> 02:12:53,460
So the two of you would actually hear fast night hauler and then you would hear the music go

1614
02:12:53,980 --> 02:13:00,740
Completely silent and then you would hear Henry smoochie scream out and then the two of you decide

1615
02:13:00,740 --> 02:13:07,360
Yeah, so it's probably a pretty good idea to go up there then I will follow your lead so calm the energy here

1616
02:13:08,020 --> 02:13:12,100
So calm as the two of you get up to the stairs

1617
02:13:12,180 --> 02:13:13,620
You see that

1618
02:13:13,620 --> 02:13:21,220
Terrence fast night is at the corner turn of the stairs waiting for the two of you and you both approach just in time

1619
02:13:21,380 --> 02:13:26,340
To see Henry smoochie get pushed out of this room

1620
02:13:26,820 --> 02:13:31,620
Backwards so he's flying out of the doorway of this room up against the wall

1621
02:13:31,620 --> 02:13:38,260
And he slams is the back of his head into the wall and you see right on top of him right in front of him

1622
02:13:38,260 --> 02:13:40,260
Is a naked?

1623
02:13:40,780 --> 02:13:42,780
bleeding cut-up

1624
02:13:42,820 --> 02:13:47,780
emaciated gaunt just disgusting human being with his dick out and

1625
02:13:48,540 --> 02:13:51,620
He more importantly than the dick out

1626
02:13:52,620 --> 02:14:00,280
Protruding from this man's mouth is this weird segmented worm and you see from the side you've got these bony

1627
02:14:01,020 --> 02:14:08,260
needles that are extremely sharp and there are four of them on the end of this like worms mouth that are coming out and

1628
02:14:08,900 --> 02:14:13,140
they are attached just on either side of the eyes and

1629
02:14:13,740 --> 02:14:16,220
just inside the jaw of

1630
02:14:16,940 --> 02:14:21,260
Henry smoochie and this worm is truck is slowly

1631
02:14:21,820 --> 02:14:29,740
going into like the bones are holding it in place and the worm is like moving slowly and

1632
02:14:30,140 --> 02:14:37,860
Trying to wiggle its way into the mouth of Henry smoochie and that is where we're gonna call it for this evening

1633
02:14:42,940 --> 02:14:44,940
Thing cooking up

1634
02:14:46,220 --> 02:14:48,220
Thing

1635
02:14:49,620 --> 02:14:55,620
Patrick Swayze, where are you? We all know it's wrong Kurt Russell not Patrick Swayze, whatever. Holy shit

1636
02:14:55,620 --> 02:15:01,540
Well, okay. This is getting fucked up. Damn. I just thought the horror was come. I

1637
02:15:02,860 --> 02:15:06,780
Didn't think nothing else bad bad was gonna happen. I could make it really easy for you

1638
02:15:06,780 --> 02:15:11,980
I wrestled a gun away from one of the guys and I shoot myself. So there you go

1639
02:15:13,260 --> 02:15:15,260
that story

1640
02:15:17,060 --> 02:15:20,560
Want to make it easier for you, I was just gonna shoot the creature but

1641
02:15:23,100 --> 02:15:28,420
Yeah, that's a that's a way to do it I was gonna yell let it happen I'm enjoying this and

1642
02:15:31,380 --> 02:15:33,380
Like peace out everybody

1643
02:15:34,180 --> 02:15:37,340
Okay. Yeah, that's just let's just get back into character do that real quick and then we'll be done

1644
02:15:39,940 --> 02:15:42,220
Yeah, you know what if we all accept the worm

1645
02:15:42,220 --> 02:15:44,220
I

1646
02:15:44,980 --> 02:15:51,820
Fuck I fucking accept the worm become worm. Oh didn't think of that DM digit that everybody would band together to

1647
02:15:54,700 --> 02:16:00,660
That's step in line let the monster eat you you guys can try to take over the town of you know

1648
02:16:01,500 --> 02:16:03,500
Wherever you're at that I wrote down somewhere

1649
02:16:05,340 --> 02:16:07,340
Wherever you're at

1650
02:16:08,180 --> 02:16:11,300
You guys can we you guys play the monsters and

1651
02:16:11,940 --> 02:16:15,820
Okay, that would be fun. But can we do it in one where we're not come worms?

1652
02:16:17,820 --> 02:16:19,820
I'll only do it if I get to become

1653
02:16:37,340 --> 02:16:39,340
Oh

1654
02:17:07,340 --> 02:17:09,340
