1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Hey folks, I'm Zach, the producer, whoever that asshole is, totally fucked up.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:21,000
They forgot to remind Wolf the Dog that the Den of Sin will be live this upcoming Tuesday, the 28th of July, for an extremely special stream.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Luke is running a homebrew.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:35,000
This is the first time any of these players have run a DG scenario, and I consider myself blessed as fuck to get to join the rank of the PCs for this one shot.

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I have so much respect for Luke as a player, and so much love for this dude as a human, and I cannot wait to play in a game at which he is at the helm.

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:01:03,000
And for all of you at the Splashylvania Fastpass holders at the $5 and up level, I will have part 3, the conclusion of our playthrough of Lover in the Ice, edited and uploaded in this coming week.

7
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So be on the lookout for that, and if you are not a patron of this fine podcast you've listened to a stupid amount of, don't worry.

The higher that number grows, the less stupid I feel about spending so much time working on this super fun and silly show.

10
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:35,000
You'll immediately have access to 12 bonus episodes, as well as the ability to vote in polls that decide which scenarios I run for the boys.

11
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Seriously, I did a quick skim, my fault, and I ended up running Lover in the Ice, my fault.

12
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It did win the poll, that's why I ran it, my fault.

13

It's patreon.com slash pretending pod.

16
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:23,000
On a real human note, I seriously, I spend a dumb amount of time making this podcast, and I'm dumbfounded and humbled by the responses we've received.

17
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
When we were about to start, we talked about our pipe dreams for the show, right?

18
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Mine was fan art. I said, if someone makes fan art for our show, this will all have been worth it, and holy shit, I had no idea what was coming.

19
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You guys have made some of the dopest, ugh, it just, it's so heartening.

20
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I had no idea how invested we'd all be in putting out this show every week for thousands of people.

21
00:02:51,000 --> 00:03:03,000
That seems silly, even as I say it, but I just want you all to know, we really appreciate having you all along for this ride, this fucking wild-ass ride we're all on.

If you're dealing with instability right now due to COVID or being a poor college student, or legitimately just because capitalism fucking blows, do not worry. Fret not.

24
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:33,000
We completely understand. Keep listening to the show. Tell your friends about it. If you could, just blow up the internet.

25
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Hit those RPG subreddits hard with recommendations. Tell your friends about the show. Just anything you can do helps, and it makes me smile, and it makes me hard.

26
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I know Wolf has joked about taking other people's iPhones and reviewing our show on Apple Podcasts. That, that wasn't a joke.

27
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:08,000
That would help us tremendously. We really don't want to put ads on this show. We really like it the way it is, and we really hope you do too.

28
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Fuck, I've been going on way too long. Let me send it over to my luff in the fog, Wolf the dog.

29
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Aw yes, my children's children. It's good that you came to visit your old canine granddad, Wolf the dog.

30
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Come sit on Pop Pop's lap while he regales you with the weird stuff that happened and will happen in this shithole of a town and multiple other realities, live from 694.2 PTBP.

31
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:49,000
This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Roxy, who tagged that pretending part in an Instagram story. They write,

32
00:04:49,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Greetings listeners of 694.2 PTBP in whatever you call the present, from about 25 episodes, I mean a few days in the past.

33
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:13,000
The opportunity arose to send this message to the future via radio broadcast technology operated by the exceptionally smooth radio presenter Wolf the dog.

34
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:22,000
So I decided to let my beloved Andy know that his cute little butt is the cutest in the whole universe. I mean universes.

35
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Also, my contention uniform just arrived from the future, although I'm not sure what the meaning behind the pink square with skeletons dressed as the village people actually is.

36
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Agent Roxy from the European Bureau of Chronologics in Athens, Greece. Oh Roxy, you know how to butter up a wolf's ears and soul, that's for sure.

37
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:55,000
But I will not accept you talking of others' meat buns on this here show. The only thick ham hawks I want people admiring are mine.

38
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Damn, now I want to eat some hawks of ham. Time to fuse some clues. The truths get me loose like an amuse-bouche, it's the news.

39
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Last time, Drew Carey, Pages, Andrews reunited with John before taking off on the four-wheeler with Agent Trent Catt and the odd-looking Broken Tubed Radio,

40
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:25,000
heading to Clinkers to find the hidden underground location of Gary, Harry, Mildred, Clara, and Drew's body.

41
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:37,000
The wall of water fell, crashing into and filling back up Bean's pond. Clark swam to safety, and John was lifted out of the water by a chanting and love.

42
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
The two of them then walked across the water to Clark on the shore.

43
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Down in his secret underground laboratory, Keith Beans found the super unnaturally fucked up Tilly B. Mitchell behind the blast door, screeching and roaring like some sort of wild creature.

44
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Falling back, he stumbled upon a hidden compartment in the uneven concrete floor, revealing an odd-looking old revolver with glass tubes and a green light lit.

45
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Looking for other buried treasure, Keith found another small metal sphere, or ball, if you will. I'm honestly so shocked he didn't just grab this ball, y'all. I was so proud.

46
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:31,000
But then, this dumb motherfucker starts chanting the spell he remembered was on the paper that fell out of Mildred Mitchell's pocket when he straight up NFL blitzed this old-ass lady.

47
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:41,000
So Keith's body split open, discarding his metal bits before his human anatomy reformed inside and zipped itself back up.

48
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:59,000
And with that, Keith Vigna Beans lost his goddamn mind. He walked over to the strange, old-timey revolver, found a massive, dusty cartridge in the cylinder, and pulled the trigger, triggering a blinding flash of light.

49
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Keith Beans came to the Old West. Contention in 1880-something. He saw the original Silas Cole walking down the dusty path towards town, chased him down, snapped his neck, and took his wrongful place as the founder of our beautiful, quiet little town here.

50
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:31,000
If you love contention, then this is your commission. The admission of our religion to all that we can condition, which consists of listening to Cuz You With No Backbone.

51
00:08:49,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Alright, do you guys have anything interesting to say, or should we dive right into episode 88 of this podcast here that we make together?

52
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
If you put zeroes between the eights, it says boobs.

53
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:18,000
The wall of water and fish previously surrounding Beansburg.

54
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:28,000
You are just going to blast past Joe's amazing revelation like that, Zach?

55
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I have never thought about it.

56
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
If you put zeroes in between it...

57
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Hang on, let me pull up my calculator so I can show you.

58
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Oh, he did it.

59
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Well guys, if you guys don't, I'm gonna leave real quick, but I'll be back in five minutes?

60
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Okay.

61
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Is that because you were so turned on by the number boob?

62
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:05,000
If you think that's enough time to get your little dick done.

63
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:13,000
It's so small that it takes forever. This is great. This is grade A content.

64
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I've idly wondered almost every time if showing you guys my dick would be a crime. Like, literally.

65
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I think probably, which is why I haven't done it, but I'm surprised Luke has it.

66
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Yeah, it's pretty wild. We're Luke-less right now, at the top of this episode here. Nope, we're not Luke-less.

67
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I just don't want that I think about showing you guys my dick every episode part in...

68
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Oh, too bad.

69
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Okay.

70
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I thought you were saying that we shouldn't say that Luke's not here, that way we could all react to him showing us his dick right now.

71
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Wow!

72
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
It's weird.

73
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:10,000
The wall of water and fish previously surrounding Bean's pond has now filled up the entirety of the previously dehydrated bowl.

74
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:21,000
There's plenty of this water teeming with fish left over, and now the streets are gushing with a fair amount flowing down into the storm drains.

75
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Clark, you were able to swim to the shallow shore safely.

76
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:36,000
John, your partially metal skeleton weighing you down combined with a failed swim check led to your needing to be saved by the very woman you claim to not trust at all.

77
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Ann Love pulled you up out of the water, chanting, and she lifted you on top of the surface where the two of you walked, Jesus-style, over to Clark.

78
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I need you both to roll Sanity for witnessing this unnatural ability.

79
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Fail. 45 on a 20.

80
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I also fail a 48 on a 9.

81
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Go ahead and lose 1d4 Sanity.

82
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Oh no. A 1.

83
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Oh, nice.

84
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Is it a 1 of those 1 plus?

85
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It was not a 1d4 plus 1, because if you would have succeeded, you would have only lost a 0, and you would have gotten to roll another check that I would have asked for.

86
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:23,000
But since neither one of you did succeed, you both just lose 1d4, which for Clark was 1 Sanity, for John is 2 Sanity.

87
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
So I'm at 16. I was wrong. I was at 18, not 20.

88
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Oh, even worse. Or better. Worse. Better? 1 or 2?

89
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I never know.

90
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Can I see 3 again?

91
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,000
And Anne kind of walks you over to- that was so stupid. Anne walks you over to-

92
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I just had an eye appointment the other day, so it's on my mind.

93
00:12:48,000 --> 00:13:04,000
And she looks into both of your eyes. She's just cackling with laughter as she realizes how freaked the fuck out both of you are that-

94
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know, right? I can do that.

95
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
You made him walk on water. He was walking on water.

96
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I mean, it was mostly me, but, you know, I can let him, if you will. And I will.

97
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Can you show us how to let people?

98
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Sure.

99
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Oh, shit. Do you guys want to get into this?

100
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

101
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
If it allows us to walk on water, that seems helpful.

102
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Yeah, I mean, no. This spell is good for anything. You can walk on water, you can put people into walls. Like, you can do all sorts of stuff. It's so dope.

103
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Could you put yourself on the other side of a door?

104
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Clark's heart sinks when she mentions the put people into walls thing.

105
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
His face falls.

106
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Clark did what?

107
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I don't want to learn it. I don't want to learn it.

108
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Yeah, I guess you could walk through doors, for sure.

109
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
What's it called?

110
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:06,000
For the first time, you probably won't be able to just say it. You'll need to, like, read it off a paper. So, do any of you have- Oh, everything's all wet.

111
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I guess we'd need to find something to write it on first off.

112
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I'd like to search the area for-

113
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Yeah, I think that's a good call.

114
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Ready, utensils?

115
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Go ahead and roll search.

116
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I got a 73 on a 50.

117
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Well, I mean, just like I did- Okay, so, we can figure this out later, but why do you want to be able to walk through a door? Is the book on the other side of a door?

118
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Maybe, actually.

119
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Wait, for real? Do you know where the book is?

120
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Hold on, man. I've got to take this.

121
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:53,000
He's just going to- He didn't take the call. He just told me he's going to take it. Now he's just texting?

122
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Continue.

123
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
We're talking about the book that you killed my parents for, is that right?

124
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Yeah.

125
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
What made you decide to come and get it now? They've been dead for years.

126
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Well, it's kind of the end, if you will, if we don't solve it. And I personally, and Maggie as well, of course, really thinks that the book could solve it.

127
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:22,000
And if not, we're banking on this other guy to take care of things if he shows up.

128
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Who's that?

129
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
The Overseer. It'd be really cool if the Overseer showed up, but-

130
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I elbow Clark really hard in the ribs.

131
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Oh, yeah. Hey, we don't know who that would be, right?

132
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Right. That's right.

133
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Because we don't want to just go blabbing out. What is the Overseer supposed to do?

134
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:55,000
It's not really known too much, but basically like the revelation of the Overseer was that Jim was going to die.

135
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:01,000
And now that he's dead, it kind of seems like it is only through death that he may live.

136
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:09,000
And so this guy is this like rogue dude with, he's got some sort of light in his mouth or something like that.

137
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:19,000
And I don't know how, I don't know how, but when you look at it, you could just feel the power, right?

138
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
And it's this idea that like he started the circle of knowledge.

139
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
And so therefore at the end, you know, he'll be able to come back and save us.

140
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
And you haven't seen him.

141
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
No, God, no. Wait, have you?

142
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
No. Clark looks at his feet.

143
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Roll. Persuade.

144
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I pass. Yes, I pass. A 40 on a 40. That passes, right? You can meet it?

145
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
It does indeed. It was a contested roll.

146
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Oh, so I kicked ass, right?

147
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Oh, okay. Yeah, no, none of us have seen it. I mean, that would be wild.

148
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:10,000
And, you know, there's this overseer thing. There's the beans thing on the door.

149
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:19,000
You're not aware of like a third thing, like a third prophecy or thing and a third special thing for another special person who might.

150
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Nope. Probably no other special people.

151
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Right, right. Probably not. Yeah.

152
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Who are you thinking of?

153
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
No, nobody. Nobody in particular.

154
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Like me?

155
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I guess it could be anybody.

156
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
But yeah, if you guys need to get through a door to find the book, then we can make that happen.

157
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Oh, yeah, our friend Keith had the book.

158
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Roll Persuade, because add a negative 20, please.

159
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
You don't need to apply the negative modifier.

160
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Because I already failed.

161
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Why are you okay?

162
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
He didn't have the book. I lied.

163
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Did you just want me to take you to a...

164
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Yeah, if you could magic us through the door, we really miss our friend Keith, and he would really come in handy at calm, comfy campgrounds.

165
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
The little fellow who went through with the guy with the helmet on his head?

166
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I know. I know he doesn't look like much, but he's scrappy.

167
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Not to mention whatever's down there seemed important to that guy and might help us in our journey.

168
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
That guy with the helmet would almost certainly know where the book is.

169
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
How?

170
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
He's just really familiar with all of this shit.

171
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Kind of like you. He just knows the whole hell.

172
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
You guys should probably have a beer or something, maybe, and talk about this all.

173
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
He's real dangerous, too. He was the one doing all the fish magic.

174
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:48,000
And he wants to kill a bunch of people to go back in time and stop all of this, which might put a kibosh on whatever you're working on.

175
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
He was trying to go back in time to do what?

176
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I don't rightly know. Become Silas Cole or something?

177
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Huh. Hey, John, right?

178
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Ann.

179
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Yeah, did you use the radio?

180
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Today.

181
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Ever?

182
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Ann, I don't rightly remember.

183
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I've been a lot of things in the past few days.

184
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
What do you mean by that?

185
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
He just kind of points at his Kevin face.

186
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Right, right. So you weren't always...

187
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
No, ma'am.

188
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Okay. Quick question, then. Who the fuck are you?

189
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
And why were you acting like you were my partner? I...

190
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Ann, I'm your son.

191
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I don't see how that would remotely be possible.

192
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Well, it was kind of a big leap, but I am Kevin's son.

193
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Wait, so you're not the Kevin that I knew at all.

194
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
You're just the body, but you didn't use the radio?

195
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Oh, no. I'm ball.

196
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
It's this whole other deal.

197
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Clark's eyes are wide, staring at John.

198
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Yeah, this is... I forgot I was deceiving you.

199
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Role-playing, baby.

200
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
And by your ball, you mean...

201
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
My conscience is contained in a small metal sphere...

202
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Yeah, a vector.

203
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
...which rips out a vector.

204
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Well, you are the ve... So you're one of...

205
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Are you telling me there is a special thing for me?

206
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Yeah, I guess there is.

207
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Clark's hand is going to his pistol. Does she look scary?

208
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Roll humant.

209
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I fail. A 46 on a 30.

210
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
She looks the same as she did 30 seconds ago.

211
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
She looks the exact same.

212
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
She's not, like, making a move of aggression of any kind.

213
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Okay. Well, that's wild.

214
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Okay, what do you remember?

215
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Sorry, I've never talked to one.

216
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Do you mean about, like, the process or...

217
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Well, yeah, like, do you have human con...

218
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Like, do you think you're human?

219
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
And she looks at Clark and she goes,

220
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Oh, my God, he thinks he's human.

221
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
John puts his hand on his gun.

222
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
He's human. Look at him.

223
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
He's been with us the whole way along.

224
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
He just looks a little different now, that's all.

225
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Wait, so you're, like, all done up, all metal-like, right?

226
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Like, I can kind of see...

227
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Is that... Was that already in, Kevin?

228
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Or is that part of you?

229
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Does your skeleton grow out?

230
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Like, does the ball make a skeleton for you?

231
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
It's all part of me.

232
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Calm down. Calm down.

233
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
You look a little upset. I'm not upset.

234
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I'm very curious.

235
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Curious as hell. You are special.

236
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
You're extremely special. You wanted to be special.

237
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
You're damn special.

238
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
You said you never talked to him,

239
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
but that presupposes that you've run into him before.

240
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
What do you know about him?

241
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Yeah, I was sent here to take care of him.

242
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
That's why me and Kevin were...

243
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
And Kyle were sent here by Jim

244
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
to get rid of these balls.

245
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
He didn't tell you why or what they were or what they could do?

246
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
They were being put in babies?

247
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
So there was this place called Cole's Orphanage

248
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
that we had to completely get rid of, wipe out,

249
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
take off any trace that had ever existed, anything like that,

250
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
because, I mean, it was...

251
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
It was a big issue, right?

252
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Because these people, they were adopting children,

253
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
but they weren't fucking human.

254
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
And that's what we were trying to stop from happening, right?

255
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
And so we were just trying to get rid of them,

256
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
but the only thing that Jim said was, don't touch them.

257
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
So we didn't.

258
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
So in your experience, how did you take care of them

259
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
if you couldn't touch them?

260
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
There's a certain way that I can handle things.

261
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
It doesn't involve a bag of any kind, right?

262
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
A bag? What kind of bag? Why'd you ask that?

263
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Just a thing that we've heard might work, but yeah.

264
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
You, uh, what, do you use your magic?

265
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Yeah, in a way.

266
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
So you were just out there killing babies.

267
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
What?

268
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Yeah, I guess me and your dad were out there killing babies,

269
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
if you really want to think about it,

270
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
whether or not he's actually your dad, but...

271
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Holy shit.

272
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
They weren't babies, though.

273
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Yes, they were.

274
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
No offense, no offense. It's fine, it's fine.

275
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I'm clearly impressed,

276
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
but they needed to be taken care of at the time.

277
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
And I know one thing.

278
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I'm more human than you will ever be.

279
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Okay.

280
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Well, shall we go?

281
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Let's go to the church, Clark.

282
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Yeah, and I don't know about this anymore.

283
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Her eyes narrow.

284
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Huh.

285
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Okay.

286
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
What are you gonna do about it?

287
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
We don't know, man.

288
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
What's your end goal, then?

289
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
What's your end goal?

290
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
If we went and got that book,

291
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
ended up at Calm Comfy Campground, what happens?

292
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Okay, well, like, best case...

293
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Like, best case scenario, based on what Maggie said,

294
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
if we could actually get the book,

295
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,000
then we would be able to either call for the Overseer,

296
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
because we don't know whether he's actually gonna show up or not, you know?

297
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Like, it's not a determined thing ahead of time,

298
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,000
but she thinks that we could summon him

299
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,000
in order to save the world.

300
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,000
I'm sorry, but doesn't the creator of your organization

301
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
showing up at the end of all things

302
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
to, like, tie it all up in a neat little bow

303
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
just seem a little too fairytale?

304
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
I don't think that he's who you think he is

305
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
if you think it's a fairytale.

306
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
No, he does not strike me as a Prince Charming.

307
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
No.

308
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
No, King, perhaps, but not a...

309
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
No, not a good one.

310
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I mean, most of those fairytales

311
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
aren't really about good people either,

312
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
but don't you think it's still pretty convenient for yourself

313
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
that you'd just be able to summon this guy

314
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
and he'd end it for you?

315
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Yeah.

316
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
What do you want to do?

317
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I've been talking a lot. What is your guys' plan?

318
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
If I wasn't here, what would you guys have done,

319
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
besides, you know, your friend dying?

320
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
We'd probably wander around

321
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
trying to gather more information

322
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
until it was too late and everything exploded.

323
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
That's...

324
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
That's...

325
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
You're more than welcome to do that if you want to,

326
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,000
but based on our whole conversation that we've been having here,

327
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
it seems like you want to get down into the bottom of the pond

328
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
through that door to meet up with your friend.

329
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
And if that's right, if you take me and show me the book,

330
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
because I saw that weird face you made earlier,

331
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I think you might have an idea of where it is.

332
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
If you can show me the book, I will get you through the door.

333
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Can I have a moment to speak with my associate?

334
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Sure.

335
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Clark, she walks away with her back turned toward you.

336
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
John, do you know where the book is that she's talking about?

337
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I don't know where the book is.

338
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
She thinks it's at my house,

339
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
but I mean, I've lived there for my whole life.

340
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I've never seen a book there that...

341
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
I thought I had told you.

342
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Maybe I had my mind as a jumble,

343
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:49,000
but yeah, I had a vision of Kacelle going to your parents' house,

344
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:55,000
and Kevin found the book and didn't tell the others.

345
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I don't know what he did with it.

346
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
She did tell us that Jim tried to make his own book

347
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
when he couldn't find the one your parents had.

348
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Right.

349
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
So then, yeah, her guess is as good as ours.

350
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
It could be at my house.

351
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
I didn't ever see a book up there.

352
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I mean, I wasn't lying when I was telling her

353
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
that Adam Kane might be the person who knows the most

354
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
about where that book might be.

355
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
He seems to have been amassing a lot of supernatural bullshit

356
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
underneath our noses this whole time.

357
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
He certainly mastered the object, it seems like.

358
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
He knew about them and how to work them.

359
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Yeah, I mean, when I saw that squirrel with the radio,

360
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I was like, I don't...

361
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Or the cat, rather.

362
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Squirrels and cats.

363
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I was like, I don't even remember what that thing does.

364
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,000
So kudos to Adam Kane.

365
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
The radio was the one that switched bodies.

366
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
I wasn't sure what the helmet did until now I've got a hunch

367
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
after seeing the things we did.

368
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
What do you think the helmet does?

369
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
It makes us see things.

370
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
It's gotta be.

371
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
I tell you, moments ago, I was bashing in the windows

372
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
of the van that was on fire, and then it disappeared.

373
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
It wasn't there.

374
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Hey, hey, you know, you just gotta let that go.

375
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I just...

376
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
So does Adam.

377
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
We're going to say that to him, and if he doesn't,

378
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
then we'll move on from there.

379
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Get over it, Adam.

380
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I don't know what to do, John.

381
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
We could maybe find the book with her

382
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,000
and then jump her and take it.

383
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
I mean, what if she's right?

384
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
What if the whole thing is right?

385
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
What if using the book that she finds calls what we think

386
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
is maybe hold me down, and he's willing to help us

387
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
because it's me?

388
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Old G's been a little weird around us, though.

389
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
I mean, not exactly.

390
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Not forthcoming, for sure, but he does seem to be helping.

391
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Oh, shit.

392
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Okay, Clark, what if you write a letter to yourself

393
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
to open in the future saying like,

394
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
hey, come back right now to this moment?

395
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Yeah.

396
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
That'd be cool.

397
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Yeah.

398
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
We were looking for paper moments ago, though,

399
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
and we didn't find any.

400
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
We'll really have to keep an eye on now.

401
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Also, things got real tense with Ann,

402
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
and she's probably not going to teach us magic anymore.

403
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
You guys should roll alertness for me.

404
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
She's gone.

405
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Wait, what is my alertness?

406
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Damn it.

407
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
80 on a 60.

408
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Ah, fuck.

409
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
A 76 on a 70.

410
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
She's just been in the circle with us this whole time.

411
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
No, you guys are good.

412
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
You can keep talking.

413
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
I'm getting a weird feeling about Ann.

414
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Let's check in on her.

415
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Ann?

416
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:49,000
As you say, I'm getting a weird feeling about Ann.

417
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
You hear the chanting that has been happening behind your back

418
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,000
this entire time that is growing louder and louder.

419
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:05,000
It's Stefani Nazifalo.

420
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Gwen Stefani.

421
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:12,000
And she has a large knife,

422
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,000
and she is holding it over her head,

423
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:22,000
and she is coming down at John Lee Pettymore, the third skull.

424
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Because she's getting the jump on you,

425
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
you're going to be at a negative 40.

426
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
And I'm sorry about that.

427
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
She passed with a 30.

428
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
My eyes grow wide, and I scream,

429
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
she's coming for my ball!

430
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
And I try to artfully roll out of the way using athletics.

431
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Wait, I'm at, oh fuck, I'm at minus 40?

432
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Yeah, what's your athletics?

433
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,000
I try to persuade her to stop.

434
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
What's your athletics?

435
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,000
I'm just trying to find anything else I could use.

436
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Oh, I'd like to use my robot constitution

437
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,000
and my metal plates to just take the fucking blow.

438
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Alright, athletics, 50 at a minus 40.

439
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Okay, so you have to roll an ought one

440
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
in order to win the contest.

441
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
I rolled a 73.

442
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Well, that was really close.

443
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
It was as close as any other number would have been

444
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
to what you were looking for.

445
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
And, Clark Bishop, think about what you're doing

446
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:27,000
as she is going to stab down.

447
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
This knife goes directly into the top of your head, John Lee,

448
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:37,000
and you feel your skull crack as you take nine damage,

449
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,000
and blood begins to just gush out of the hole.

450
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
How much, wait, how many hit points did you have?

451
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
I had 20.

452
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Okay.

453
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Good, I just realized that, not good,

454
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
whatever it would have been,

455
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
but I just realized that we had a whole gunfight earlier

456
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
that might have been an issue with nine hit points.

457
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,000
So you're down to 11, and blood is just like gushing out,

458
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
and Clark Bishop, blood is spurting out

459
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
of John Lee Pettymore III's head.

460
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Clay!

461
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
And, what the fuck, and I want to tackle her.

462
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Get her to the ground?

463
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Yeah, that'll be unarmed combat, and she'll be at a negative

464
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
since she already attacked this turn.

465
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Okay.

466
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
A 46.

467
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
She passes 43.

468
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
I pass 46.

469
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
How do you want to take her to the ground?

470
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
As soon as she...

471
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
It's not that kind of podcast, Joe.

472
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Calm down.

473
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
And she's not into that.

474
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
I get her center mass and get her to the ground,

475
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
and I want to put an arm across her throat

476
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
so if she does try to start chanting again, she can't.

477
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Ooh, nice.

478
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
I'm pressing into her throat.

479
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Does that end the combat?

480
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Do I need to talk to her now?

481
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
No, it does not end the combat at all.

482
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
John Lee Pettymore, it's your turn.

483
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
You've got a large knife.

484
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
I'd say yay long, about a foot long,

485
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,000
and a good three inches of it are in you.

486
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,000
I need you to tell me how three inches of knife

487
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
being in my skull affects my mind brain.

488
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Yeah, no, I'm a scientist.

489
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Or does it at all since it didn't hit ball?

490
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Yeah, I mean, we're at the point now where, you know,

491
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:21,000
ball controls everything, so your brain is only there

492
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,000
as a human function to...

493
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Maybe it's grabbed onto your brain

494
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,000
to try to emulate empathy and emotion of some sort,

495
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
or maybe that was in ball all along.

496
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
You don't really know, but you know that in this moment,

497
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,000
you can't really see straight because everything's wobbly,

498
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,000
and you feel like you're gonna throw up,

499
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,000
but you are not at a mechanical disadvantage currently

500
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
for some reason.

501
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
It might be because you're metal.

502
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Ah, fuck, let's see.

503
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,000
John takes the pistol given to him by Harry,

504
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
and although he's wobbly,

505
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
he plants himself with his robot feet

506
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
and sort of steadies himself

507
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
and brings his arm up and shoots it in.

508
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
32 on a 60.

509
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Roll a D10 for damage.

510
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Ten.

511
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Fuck.

512
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Whew!

513
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Where do you shoot her?

514
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Clark knocked her to the ground.

515
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Yeah, he's like on top of her.

516
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Then I'm sorry, Anne, but I shoot you in the knee.

517
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
As you blast through her knee,

518
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:38,000
you see the entire calf just kind of like twitch and shake

519
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
off kilter from where it's supposed to be.

520
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Her leg now goes down and then off out to the side

521
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
as it kind of blasts those ligaments off

522
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
that keep it where it's supposed to be.

523
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Oh, my God.

524
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
And it hits an artery,

525
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:56,000
and blood is just pouring out of her leg.

526
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Oh, no.

527
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
And it's Anne Love's turn,

528
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
and I've got Ramona on the desk.

529
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Hi, Ramona.

530
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Ramona, save us.

531
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Ramona, will you get down or get in my lap or something?

532
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Come here.

533
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
There she is.

534
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
All right.

535
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
She's going to grapple with your arm,

536
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
and as she's doing it, she is trying to chant

537
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
and roll unarmed combat.

538
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
She passed with a 25.

539
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
I passed with a 37.

540
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
You motherfucker.

541
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Fuck yes, Joe.

542
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
And it's Clark Bishop's turn.

543
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Oh, shit.

544
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Okay.

545
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Oh, boy.

546
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,000
I want to grab the wound behind me

547
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
that has now been inflicted.

548
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
I'm trying to cause so much pain that she passes out.

549
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Holy shit.

550
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Okay, roll first aid against her constitution.

551
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Holy shit.

552
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
He really is a game master.

553
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
She passes with a 17.

554
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
I fail a 95 on a 30.

555
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Okay, so you describe this nastiness, please.

556
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
You did this.

557
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Clark felt the spray of blood across his back

558
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
and knew that there was a wound back there,

559
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
so he reached behind him blindly to grab it,

560
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
and he wanted to clamp down as hard as he could

561
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
just to inflict pain.

562
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
That was his only goal.

563
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
She screams out,

564
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
but she clenches down on her teeth so hard

565
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,000
that as you're looking right into her mouth,

566
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
she's...

567
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
One of her teeth breaks.

568
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Oh, my God.

569
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
And she spits it at you.

570
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Okay, this is beautiful justice for Clark.

571
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I just want to remind the audience

572
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
that this would feel real good for Clark.

573
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
I don't feel great about it as Joe.

574
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
But this woman killed his parents.

575
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
John Lee Pettymore, what's your excuse?

576
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Oh, she said you weren't human.

577
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Yeah, I am human. I'll show her.

578
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
All right, Knifehead, you're up.

579
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
John Lee Pettymore walks up and shoots her in the head.

580
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
You're going to take that away from Clark?

581
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Roll firearms.

582
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
He was talking himself out of it.

583
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Now she's pinned down on the ground, right?

584
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Yeah, what'd you roll?

585
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Let's say I rolled a 98.

586
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Not a critical failure, but...

587
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Not a critical failure.

588
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
With a 98, you walk up.

589
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
She looks at you through gritted teeth

590
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
and one of the teeth is chipped off and missing

591
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
and then she's gritting.

592
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Another part of her tooth just cracks off

593
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,000
and you watch the enamel flake off of the other teeth

594
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
like peeling of an onion.

595
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
God damn it.

596
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Just enough so that she can get this out

597
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
so you fucking know.

598
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
She says,

599
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
non-human.

600
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Non-human.

601
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
You bastard.

602
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
You bastard.

603
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
John winces as a piece of enamel hits him in the eye.

604
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
And he sighs and he shakes his head and he says,

605
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
all cops are bastards.

606
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
And he pulls the trigger.

607
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
And it clicks and you're out of ammo.

608
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Fuck!

609
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Holy shit.

610
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Clark, roll unarmed combat.

611
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
She's gonna try to throw you off.

612
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
She crit succeeds.

613
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Oh my god.

614
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
And I failed.

615
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Just a regular fail.

616
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
An 81 on a 70.

617
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
55.

618
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
She throws you off.

619
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
And immediately begins chanting.

620
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,000
I'm going to spend luck for Anne Love

621
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,000
to take another turn and she continues chanting.

622
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
John T. Fella!

623
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
John T. Fella!

624
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
I've got to grab some new headphones real quick.

625
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
These are cutting in and out.

626
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
I thought you were going to say that I just broke them.

627
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,000
That's just what John says and he dips.

628
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
She's like, yeah, no.

629
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
No big.

630
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Tell Murphy hi.

631
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Say hello to Murphy for me.

632
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Oh, this is not going how I planned it all either.

633
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Going into this, it was a debate about how we were going to,

634
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
which place we were going to go.

635
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
That wasn't.

636
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
That's what I thought too.

637
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
I prepped a couple different options.

638
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Just like, I don't fucking know where they're going to go.

639
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:10,000
John Lee Pettymore the 3rd, as she is chanting,

640
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:16,000
you feel the blade on top of your head

641
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:21,000
slowly sinking deeper into your skull.

642
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Now, it says here that it's 2D10.

643
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Oh shit.

644
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,000
This knife does 2D10 damage when it has the spell being cast on it.

645
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
So I'm going to show you the roll.

646
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
He is moving his camera down so we can get a better view of the desk.

647
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Is it 28?

648
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
So 8, 9, 10, right?

649
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Yep, 10.

650
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
That puts me at 1.

651
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Jesus Christ.

652
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
He's holding on.

653
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Very importantly, you have to roll a constitution check here to stay conscious.

654
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Okay, because of his robot bones, he gets a plus 10, which puts him at 70.

655
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Fuck.

656
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Fuck.

657
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
It's a fuck because he dropped the dice.

658
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Alright, do you want me to tell you what it says on the floor or can I re-roll it?

659
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
The way you said that.

660
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Thomas?

661
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Is a floor dice a cock dice?

662
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Do you remember every single time we rolled off the table when we used to play in the same room?

663
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
What was the rule?

664
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Call it from the floor.

665
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
No.

666
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
If one falls off, you re-roll both.

667
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Oh, awesome.

668
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Okay.

669
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Man.

670
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
So I didn't just roll a 94.

671
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Thomas, there's a bug on you.

672
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
I rolled a 64.

673
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Do you think you got a fly up by your collar?

674
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
No, it's this firefly.

675
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
It might be the same one I saw last night.

676
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
It's like really old.

677
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
How do you know?

678
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
It's gray.

679
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Kind of, yeah.

680
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
It's wizened.

681
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Or it's really sick.

682
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
It's a wizened firefly.

683
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
But it looks wizened.

684
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,000
It's like little chips of color have been flaked off its shell and shit.

685
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Oh, that's sad.

686
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
What'd you roll?

687
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
A 64 on a 70.

688
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Oh, yeah.

689
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
You're going to be able to stay conscious, but you feel...

690
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Yeah, and for some reason in the back of your throat, it's like a phantom sensation.

691
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Like the knife is all the way down inside your throat, even though you know that would

692
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:35,000
be like wild if that was true, but it like hurts as you scream.

693
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,000
We need an ultra violence tag for this episode.

694
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:45,000
And as you scream, Clark is looking at you and he sees a shimmer in the back of your mouth.

695
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Oh my God.

696
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Maybe I'm the overseer.

697
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Maybe you've got one hit point.

698
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Clark Bishop, it's your turn.

699
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,000
I want to try and shoot her to make her stop chanting.

700
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Roll firearms.

701
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Oh my God.

702
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
It's a 99.

703
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Oh, that's good.

704
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
That's really good.

705
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,000
I told you not to roll so much before the episode, Joe.

706
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Oh no.

707
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Clark, you're so freaked out by...

708
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:35,000
You look back at John Lee Bettymore and you see this shimmering as the knife is just literally

709
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:40,000
moving further and further into his skull without anyone touching it.

710
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:45,000
And then as he's screaming, you see it in the back of his mouth.

711
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,000
And as you go to fire the gun.

712
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Yeah, just fumble it out of the holster so terribly wrong.

713
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:55,000
And it lands directly in between you and Anne Love.

714
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
John Lee Pettymore with one hit point left.

715
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Blood dripping down as if your head is a chocolate fountain.

716
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Blood is covering everything, including all over your eyes.

717
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:15,000
So you're going to be at a negative 20 for any action you take that requires sight.

718
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Where was Anne Love?

719
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Is she still just on the ground in front of me?

720
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:25,000
No, she's standing and I'm picturing she's like backed up to the pond, essentially.

721
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:30,000
You're all just standing in murky, muddy water, splashing about.

722
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:35,000
So the gun just fell to the point to where you can't see it in this murky, muddy water

723
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:39,000
because there's enough water covering the grass in this area that it is even spilled

724
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
over in the streets behind you.

725
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,000
So she's just like at the edge of Bean's Pond.

726
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
The overfull Bean's Pond.

727
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Yeah, I just want to try to reach out and crush her with my robot hands.

728
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Like, crush her skull.

729
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,000
You can run up to her and try to attack her with your hands.

730
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,000
She passes a 14 and he's shaking his head no.

731
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
89.

732
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Oh no!

733
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:15,000
I'm like blind with blood, so I just imagine myself just like stumbling straight forward

734
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
and falling into the muck.

735
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:22,000
And she kind of, as you're falling forward, she puts her foot out and kicks the top of

736
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:28,000
your head so that the top of the knife goes straight into the ground and just...

737
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:37,000
And the body of John Lee Pettymore lies flaccid face down in muddy water.

738
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,000
I'll see you guys next time, Loop.

739
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Bye, Thomas!

740
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Bye, guys.

741
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Do I need to be on call at all this evening or is that pretty much it for...

742
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Well, hold on, Joe. Take off your headphones.

743
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
I'm off.

744
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Hey, how much luck do you have?

745
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
25.

746
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Fuck.

747
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
I need 30, right?

748
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
You need 30.

749
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
God damn it.

750
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,000
I was going to have... The ball could have popped out and I was going to have you control it.

751
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Oh, I could... How much is it to avoid major damage?

752
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Oh, yeah. You should have done that earlier, but you can do it on this one.

753
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
I'll do it on this one.

754
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Okay. Sounds good.

755
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Okay.

756
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:28,000
So that one only did one hit point of damage, so you get to keep your one hit point.

757
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:34,000
It hits on a rock coming out of my chin and can't go all the way through.

758
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Yeah, there's a rock floating along in the water that gets stuck right above your chest on your throat

759
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:50,000
and so as it dinks in, it just right into the rock instead of all the way through, finishing you off.

760
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,000
And you're still going to lay flaccid there and you're just going to stay on the call

761
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,000
and we'll let Joe think whatever he wants to think, but you're going to lose 10 luck.

762
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,000
I would suggest spending the other 15 during this.

763
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Can you show me the luck chart real quick?

764
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:11,000
What you can do now is you can avoid unconsciousness for one point per round, but it doubles each round.

765
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
So one luck the first round, two, right?

766
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Yeah. And then four and then eight.

767
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:19,000
And then after that, there's just adjusting any rolls.

768
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,000
You can adjust one to one.

769
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
For...

770
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Like if you rolled it...

771
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
So up or down for...

772
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Gotcha.

773
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Okay.

774
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,000
I've got to hit the restroom real quick if we want to keep Joe in suspense for just a little longer.

775
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Actually, I'll probably finish out the episode with Joe.

776
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Okay.

777
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,000
We'll do one round with just him while you're kind of coming back.

778
00:47:41,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Joe, Clark Bishop sees John Lee Pettymore fall face first into this murky, mucky, muddy six-inch splash zone.

779
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
God, no!

780
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Right in front of Anne Love as she just kicks the back of his head down toward the ground.

781
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:17,000
And she looks up at you and her eyes are massive.

782
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Take me to the fucking book, Clark!

783
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,000
You killed him! You killed him! I'm not taking you anywhere!

784
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
And I want to shoot again.

785
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Did you have a second gun? Did you have two guns?

786
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Oh, fuck. God fucking hell.

787
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,000
I did have two guns until I gave one to Drew.

788
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
You gave it to Drew, who I realized...

789
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
In re-listening to the episode, already had a gun.

790
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Already had a gun!

791
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Yeah. Yeah. Imagine how great I felt re-listening to that episode.

792
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
And especially now.

793
00:48:54,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Drew's just driving off with his two guns.

794
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
God damn it.

795
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
He gives one to the cat.

796
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Well, fuck. She said take me to the fucking book.

797
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Clark's freaked the fuck out. Just saw John die.

798
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Anne, I don't know where the book is. I don't know where the book is.

799
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:21,000
I can't help you. You fucking killed John! Why?

800
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Any anger left on her face dissipates as a smile creeps in

801
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:38,000
across both corners of her mouth, lifting upward as she stares you directly in the eyes.

802
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Well, Clark? The vector was my mission, wasn't it?

803
00:49:51,000 --> 00:50:19,000
How am I the only one trying to pull over?

804
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:30,000
How can you have enough drowning out all the notes?

805
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,000
With no mind at all.

806
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:38,000
No mind at all.

807
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:43,000
No mind at all.
