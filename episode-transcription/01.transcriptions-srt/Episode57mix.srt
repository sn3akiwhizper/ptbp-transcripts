1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,080
What's cooking my babies, it's your gumbo master wolf the dog, and I'm here on this

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:12,400
early evening on December 6th to cook you up a fresh pot of goo.

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:19,400
This gumbo was made with nothing but the discarded shells of river bugs, various types of blood,

4
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,400
and celery.

5
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:28,720
Mmm makes my tummy rumble just thinking about it, and my tummy is causing reverberations

6
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:34,680
all throughout the galaxy live from 694.2 PTBP.

7
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:40,340
Speaking of my tummy, I'm hungry for love, so you know what time it is.

8
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,820
It's time for Howlin' with Wolf.

9
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:47,040
This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Eric from New York, who writes,

10
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:51,420
Hello Adam, I'm glad you're enjoying the podcast so far.

11
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:55,520
If you've made it to this message it means you've probably passed where I am in the

12
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,520
story.

13
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,600
Sorry Wolfie, I'll get listening ASAP.

14
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:07,240
I hope Catherine, Phoebe, Ripley, and little baby Aurelia are doing great in Maryland.

15
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:14,480
I hope baby Aurelia isn't too traumatized by this ultra-violent podcast.

16
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,440
Love from New York, Eric.

17
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:23,460
Well Eric, I would recommend you inform that baby to not stand too close to the radio when

18
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,220
I admit my auditory secretions.

19
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:33,180
I've been known to warp the minds of the young, turning them into disciples who will

20
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,940
not stop until my power is absolute.

21
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:40,640
Coochie coochie coo, my little baby babies.

22
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,860

27
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:16,240
The most recent one is a Q&A episode where Justin even showed up to help answer all the

28
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:20,400
questions you fine folks asked over on the subreddit.

29
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,820
But you don't have to even ask questions to your old wolfie because I already have

30
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:29,360
the answers you seek here on the news.

31
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:35,800
Last time, these overworked, underfed, and over-aggressive dumb fucks dressed up vaguely

32
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:41,480
like Burt Macklin from the hit television series The National Broadcasting Company's

33
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,480
Parks and Recreation.

34
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:48,760
And then they said very few words before making it to the office of Bruce Robin, literally

35
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:55,160
over the body of a stylish woman who was thriving in the city as a high-powered PA.

36
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:58,040
Once inside, things did not go any better.

37
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:02,480
Keith Victor claimed to be from a secret organization called Myriad.

38
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,440
Bruce began chanting and reached for his gun.

39
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,240
Clark Bishop dove over the table, knocking Bruce over backward in his chair and sending

40
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,780
his handgun just out of reach.

41
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:18,600
After a back-and-forth three-on-one fistfight except for the knives and guns, John Lee Kevin

42
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:24,520
Moore the three-and-a-half looked away for just long enough for Bruce to finish his chant

43
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,460
and fire his gun into his own head.

44
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:32,720
Taking us now to the most happening place in the city, a fancy chief executive's penthouse

45
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:38,240
office that is completely covered in a sequence of numbers I dare not repeat on these soundwaves

46
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:43,180
written in the blood of the almost-billionaire Bruce Robin, it's a brand new track from your

47
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:50,980
best of 2019 list's top artist, Kudzu, with the premiere of this tasty fuckin' jam, No

48
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,300
Back Bone.

49
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:25,700
Have you guys gotten all your Christmas shopping done?

50
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:26,700
Not even close.

51
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,700
Nope.

52
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,540
And it's making me real nervous.

53
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:35,380
We're coming up on that time where your friends realize how much you care about them.

54
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:39,060
Joe, you're getting nervous?

55
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,060
At this point?

56
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,060
Yeah.

57
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,060
Thomas is like, you don't know nervous.

58
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:50,940
I don't know nervous either, which is why I do a lot of my shopping between the 22nd

59
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:53,680
and 24th-ish.

60
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,300
There was one year that I got like three things Christmas Eve and it was just fuckin' terrifying

61
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,540
and awful.

62
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:02,980
Like you received three presents on Christmas Eve and it was terrifying and awful.

63
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:03,980
No.

64
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,980
It was that I wouldn't get my gifts.

65
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:06,980
Actually three ghosts.

66
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:12,020
Last year I got four presents that took it away from Christmas Day and it was so disappointing.

67
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,600
Luke, how many people do you buy presents for?

68
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,460
My mom, my dad, and my sister.

69
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,460
That's it?

70
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,460
Yep.

71
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,460
So I'm not supposed to get you anything?

72
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:21,460
Is that what it is?

73
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,460
Oh, I've gotten you guys.

74
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:26,020
I have the only thing I've bought so far is for you guys.

75
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:28,780
Aww.

76
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:29,780
That's nice.

77
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:33,980
Am I allowed to use Patreon money to get you guys Christmas gifts?

78
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:36,340
No.

79
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,340
The answer's no.

80
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,860
That'd be a hard write off.

81
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:44,420
So we were talking when we came in today before we started recording about the numbers.

82
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:49,460
The Painfully Easy Cipher, I believe the episode was titled.

83
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:53,180
And you guys did some work and figured out some of the...

84
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,180
Translations.

85
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,180
Translations.

86
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:59,780
Even for some of the past numbers that have been in this show.

87
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:03,140
Do you guys want to give a rundown of where you're at on that?

88
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:05,580
I did most of the work so I'll take this.

89
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:09,620
Yeah, what do you got written down, Joe?

90
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:15,340
Well, so it turned out to be a pretty simple, I think they call it an alphabet cipher?

91
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,340
Is that what they call it?

92
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:17,340
A substitution cipher.

93
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,340
A substitution cipher.

94
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:23,220
So the first ones in the apartment that was kind of ransacked and shitty we think say

95
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:28,900
Harriet Marks, M-A-R-K-S, which is not a name that rings any bells for any of us.

96
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:35,500
And then the one that Thomas was writing on the desk in the last episode was Bruce Robin,

97
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,460
the name of the man that had just committed suicide in front of us.

98
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:45,420
But we also remember that way back in the graveyard, the creepy kind of maybe reminded

99
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:49,980
us of Marvin creatures standing on a mausoleum yelling at us.

100
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:52,060
And he started spouting numbers.

101
00:06:52,060 --> 00:07:01,260
And in particular, I think he was referencing me, Clark Bishop, and he did a string of numbers

102
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,860
that turned out to spell overseer.

103
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:04,860
And we asked...

104
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:05,860
Yeah, that's nothing.

105
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:06,860
That doesn't...

106
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:07,860
You probably...

107
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,020
I don't remember anything of it.

108
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:13,660
And we also asked him who he was.

109
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:22,300
And he replied with numbers, we think spells out D-C-F-B-I, which is really fucking cool.

110
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,300
What the hell?

111
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,300
Yeah, I don't know.

112
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,740
I don't know what it means.

113
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:26,740
So yeah.

114
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:27,740
So we did that off, Mike.

115
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:31,020
We'll see how that comes out in character.

116
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:34,900
I remember those numbers clearly.

117
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:37,620
Once we left off, we just woke up in a room with numbers.

118
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:40,580
I think it was the Bruce Robin numbers, or did we know?

119
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,660
And we had written them with Bruce's blood.

120
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:43,660
All over each other.

121
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:44,660
And we're naked.

122
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:49,540
Unclothed in the office of Bruce Robin, and you are surrounded...

123
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,540
Oh, fuck.

124
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:54,540
Oh, my God.

125
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,260
That was sick.

126
00:07:56,260 --> 00:08:00,580
Zach just hit a button on a remote, and the lights in this room turned red.

127
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:06,700
Yeah, he got some LED lights, y'all, and he deployed it at a really cool time.

128
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:09,620
That was awesome.

129
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,320
You guys are surrounded by blood.

130
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:17,220
It smells of deep iron and soulless humanity in this room.

131
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:22,220
And the reason that you came to is because the two double doors leading into this office

132
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:27,620
busted open, and three police officers come in as you come to.

133
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:33,300
The officer in the back is a good-looking older man with gray hair, and I need Clark

134
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:38,360
to roll intelligence.

135
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,940
I pass an eight on a 55.

136
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:45,340
I need Thomas and Luke to take off their headphones and plug the ears.

137
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:52,840
Joe, you recognize this man dressed as a city police officer as Leon Simpson of the circle

138
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,840
of knowledge.

139
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,840
Cool.

140
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,100
Okay, you guys can come back now.

141
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,100
What do you say?

142
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:03,060
The man in the back drops a couple duffel bags on the ground and promptly puts three

143
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:06,960
bullets in each of the other two from the back.

144
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:11,220
They drop to the ground, and he walks into the hall behind him.

145
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,220
What the fuck?

146
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,220
Leon?

147
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,220
I call after him.

148
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:20,660
You then hear a single gunshot from the hallway.

149
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,100
Oh, shit.

150
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,100
You know that guy?

151
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,620
He's, guys, he's with the circle, he's on our side.

152
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:27,740
He's with Maggie, at least.

153
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:30,380
He just killed two cops, though.

154
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:32,380
We're three cops.

155
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,540
How's that gonna make him feel?

156
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,100
I walk over to my clothes and put them back on.

157
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,100
Covered in blood.

158
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:41,340
Are you gonna wipe yourself off before you get your old clothes back on?

159
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:45,600
I'd like to put on the clothes of one of the corpses that Leon just made, whichever one

160
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,760
is the least bloody.

161
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:53,120
You can change into that, but there will be three bullet holes in the back of the officer's

162
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,120
uniform with blood stained on the back of your back.

163
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,680
Also, the blood that's on you is gonna seep into that material and stuff.

164
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:07,880
But the gray-haired officer, Leon Simpson, walks back into the office, and he walks up

165
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,320
to one of the duffel bags that he dropped on the ground and reaches in.

166
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:19,760
He throws on a nice pair of over-the-ear headphones, pulls a pair of forensics gloves on, wipes

167
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:26,680
his gun, walks over to Bruce Robin, places the gun in Bruce Robin's empty hand, and begins

168
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:30,440
defacing any writing in the room with numbers on it.

169
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:35,380
Essentially, he's just trying to clean it up and make the room look less esoteric and

170
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:38,140
more murder-suicidy.

171
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:42,080
Is he playing something in his headphones that we can catch from outside the headphones?

172
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:45,520
Can we hear the bleed-through of sound from his headphones?

173
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:50,840
For the sake of flavor, you can hear some outlaw country being played.

174
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:55,860
I sheepishly take off the dead man's clothes as I see him professionally cleaning up the

175
00:10:55,860 --> 00:11:03,720
evidence and I lay it in a pile at his feet and shuffle off covering my penis.

176
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,960
He hasn't acknowledged us, right?

177
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,880
I wanna do a waving hands in the air in front of him.

178
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,880
Leon!

179
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,880
Leon!

180
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,400
He takes his headphones off and he's like, don't fucking touch me.

181
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,400
What are you doing here?

182
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,400
I gotta clean up.

183
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,400
I gotta get out of here.

184
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,040
Should we wait for you to clean up then?

185
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,560
Yeah, I mean, you know, don't spread it around anymore.

186
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,680
And he puts his headphones back in and he keeps working.

187
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,520
How did you know we were here?

188
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,600
He's got his headphones on.

189
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,600
He's not paying attention.

190
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,200
How did he know we were here?

191
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,120
I guess Maggie could have sent him.

192
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,440
That has to be it.

193
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,220
He's with a circle.

194
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,220
He helped me before.

195
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:38,800
You guys remember when I got those tranquilizer darts that helped us mind control?

196
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,800
Yeah.

197
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,800
I nod over to him.

198
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,800
Got them from him.

199
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,800
Oh.

200
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,080
I'm gonna go and see if there's something, if I can open his duffel bag and see if there's

201
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,240
anything else in there that might help in cleaning.

202
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:53,440
Yeah, he stops and looks over at you just to like gauge what you're doing.

203
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,280
But when you open it up, you see there's some stuff that you could use to help clean up.

204
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:04,680
And then also in a second duffel bag, he has three city police officer uniforms that are

205
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,280
clean and pressed.

206
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,560
I wanna use cleaning supplies in the duffel bag to start cleaning myself.

207
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,040
Yeah, I wanna do that too.

208
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,040
Yeah, I'll divvy it out.

209
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:17,280
I let Clark spray me down with some Windex.

210
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,640
And turn.

211
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,640
And turn.

212
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:26,680
And you guys see when Clark Bishop takes off his uniform and is cleaning himself off, there

213
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:31,600
it is, that gaping hole in the middle of Clark Bishop's chest.

214
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,240
But no matter how many times you look at, you can't get away from the fact that it's

215
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,120
horrible.

216
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:44,000
That's just this like skin tunnel that goes from front to back.

217
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Stop staring guys.

218
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Does it hurt?

219
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Doesn't hurt at all.

220
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Kinda hurts to look at.

221
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Yeah, it's pretty gross.

222
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,800
Do you ever put stuff in it?

223
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,840
That's where I keep my extra gun.

224
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,840
Cool.

225
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:59,120
Of course it bothers me when I look at it, but I don't know what to tell you.

226
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,880
Just put a shirt on.

227
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:05,440
Could I put my hand through there and lift you up like some kind of Clark handle?

228
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,440
Ooh, I don't, that sounds like that might hurt.

229
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:11,440
I try it.

230
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,040
I don't lift, but I get my fingers.

231
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,040
Like are you pulling up?

232
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:19,100
No, I'm just gonna poke at your hole.

233
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,200
It doesn't hurt when you just kinda touch it.

234
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,560
You've done this before, John.

235
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,360
I know you love touching my hole.

236
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:30,420
I'm just trying to Pillsbury Doughboy ya.

237
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:35,360
Looking over at Leon Simpson, he's rifling through paperwork and he eventually finds

238
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:40,520
something that he's clearly looking for and then he brings out a stamp and you notice

239
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:47,000
that it is a stamp of Bruce Robin's signature that he is putting on this paperwork and he's

240
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,240
flipping through pages and stamping the bottom right of like every third page.

241
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,640
I'm not gonna interrupt him, but I want to get around his shoulder and see if I can clean

242
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,480
anything from those documents he's stamping.

243
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:02,280
I think it'd be pretty easy to tell that he is signing over Bruce Robin's share of bar

244
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:07,280
corp to the mill on the other side of the city.

245
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:12,840
I'd like to search for like a personal checkbook or anything like that in Bruce Robin's effects.

246
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,840
Yeah, go ahead and roll.

247
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,840
Five.

248
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:19,440
You don't find a personal checkbook, but you do find a handwritten note.

249
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,440
What's it say?

250
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,440
There's some more numbers.

251
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:26,360
She broke me open and all new things have the power to escort change in the future of

252
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,200
good in order to break.

253
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,880
Hold on, I'm not reading this right.

254
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:33,680
Let me read it first to myself to get the syntax.

255
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,000
I hate paying the syntax.

256
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,920
That's why Jesus died for me.

257
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:45,360
While he's reading that eye rifle through the duffel bag, seeing if there's a belt because

258
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,720
whoever these clothes are for is much larger than me.

259
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:57,200
You can find a belt off one of the dead officers that doesn't have blood all over it so you

260
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,680
can get a second belt going.

261
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,680
Sweet.

262
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,120
That's why Keith Vigna's comfortable.

263
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,040
My pants aren't falling down anytime soon.

264
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,800
Thomas, you ready to pay the syntax?

265
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:10,600
Yeah, this person writes funny, but it's a long sentence.

266
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:14,800
She broke me open and all new things have the power to escort change in the future of

267
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,200
good in order to break the cycle and find fulfillment in an unquestioning goodness that

268
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:24,240
breaks the relentless tether holding this lie of a world withstanding itself.

269
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,440
I can smell my past.

270
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,560
I can hear the future.

271
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,560
I am joy.

272
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,560
I am destruction.

273
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,560
I am pure.

274
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,600
Harriet.

275
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:36,600
8-11-8-1-8-9-5-2-0-13-11-8-1-1-1-1-9.

276
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,160
Probably not a zero in there, but that's a 20.

277
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,160
We got that number before.

278
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,800
I don't know if we've done anything with it yet.

279
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,200
There's also another number down there.

280
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,960
Out of character, that is Harriet Marks.

281
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:48,080
That's the same number we saw in the, I guess I could say that in character.

282
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:52,600
That's the same number that was written all over the walls in Bruce Robin's house.

283
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:56,800
It starts this letter and then at the end of it, it's written five times, followed by...

284
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,840
I got an idea.

285
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,200
How can we decode this?

286
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,360
What if you substituted letters for numbers?

287
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,200
Ooh, let's do it.

288
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:09,200
Is that the Batman music?

289
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,200
Adam West?

290
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,960
I think it says Harriet Marks.

291
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:17,960
Yeah, and it's not written five times, it's written six times, just the last one's bigger.

292
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,200
And is that the same number up at the top there too?

293
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,240
It sure is.

294
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:26,320
What a great role-playing experience for providing for all the people.

295
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,960
I'm gonna pull out my phone.

296
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:32,280
Yeah, I'm gonna need Thomas and Luke to take off their headphones and plug their ears again

297
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,280
real quick.

298
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,920
While he Googles Harriet Marks.

299
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:41,940
Joe, when Clark Bishop pulls out his phone, if you pull out the burner phone, you see

300
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:45,840
a text that you've received from the same number as before.

301
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:53,880
And it says, the book your parents died for is still hidden in an undisclosed location.

302
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,600
I want to text back what book where.

303
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,720
All right, you guys are good.

304
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,720
Come on back.

305
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:05,040
I'm gonna pull out my phone and Google Harriet Marks.

306
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:15,880
There's a recent news story about a freshman at CSU, City State University.

307
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:21,200
Unfortunately she recently committed suicide in her dorm room.

308
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:27,200
She is known as an organizer and an activist working for pro-union groups.

309
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,720
Does it say if she had a major?

310
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,680
She would have been a political science major.

311
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:36,240
I'd like to go on some of the more elaborate conspiracy theory boards that John Lee Pettymore

312
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,240
follows.

313
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,240
Absolutely.

314
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,600
And see if any of them are talking about Harriet Marks.

315
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,360
Roll a cult for me.

316
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,360
Woo!

317
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:47,680
Oh, not unnatural, just a cult.

318
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,080
Oh, I was thinking unnatural also.

319
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,080
Gotcha.

320
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,080
Okay, well I failed.

321
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:58,960
So when you hop on the boards you find one person who's talking about Harriet Marks and

322
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:05,360
just saying, like, there were discrepancies within the police report about her suicide.

323
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,360
Just asking questions!

324
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:11,080
Oh yeah, did it say the cause of, like, do they do that in suicide?

325
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,880
Yeah, they wouldn't tell you in a news article how the suicide occurred.

326
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:17,360
Oh, also the death happened on December 2nd.

327
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,120
Did you know that Harriet Marks showed every sign?

328
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,160
God damn it.

329
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,200
Did you know that...

330
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:35,880
Did you know that Harriet Marks showed every sign of a controlled demolition?

331
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,880
We got there, folks.

332
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,360
It's the friends you make along the way.

333
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,840
Jokes are about the journey.

334
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,520
Oh, I do a wave hand at Leon.

335
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,520
Leon!

336
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,520
Yeah, a wave hand.

337
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,080
You ever heard of Harriet Marks?

338
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,080
Yeah.

339
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,080
Who is she to you and us?

340
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,760
Well, that's who we're going to see here pretty soon.

341
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,520
Will you finish up real quick?

342
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:01,440
We really gotta get going, but yeah, she's clearly earlier on in the thread, and then

343
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,440
he puts his headphones back on.

344
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,440
I turn to the guys.

345
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,960
I mean, I trust Leon.

346
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,960
He helped me earlier.

347
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:13,320
Okay, well I guess let's help him clean up and see where he's taking us.

348
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,320
I do that too.

349
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,320
Cleaning montage.

350
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,320
Cleaning montage finish?

351
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,320
Oh, yeah, do it.

352
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,320
Oh, wow.

353
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:27,160
Red juices are just like falling to the floor, like mixed with like suds from those like

354
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:32,960
handy wipes that come in small little packages that people keep in their purses and bags

355
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,320
and such.

356
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:41,280
And you guys finally wipe off the very last bit of blood from your hands, and the little

357
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:46,520
wet nap is just like completely covered in blood, and you throw the very last one into

358
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,520
the trash duffel bag.

359
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,840
Do we have a bloody suds fight somewhere in that montage?

360
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,840
Oh, absolutely.

361
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:56,880
It just like cuts to it, but the lights keep like flashing all crazy like during those

362
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,880
moments.

363
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:02,000
Also, at one point, Keith takes a plastic glove and puts it over his head and blows

364
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,920
it up with his nose, and he's like waving his head around.

365
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,320
Howie Mandel style.

366
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:16,180
So the montage finishes with the three of you standing wearing city police officer uniforms

367
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:23,540
freshly pressed and very clean, and Leon Simpson picks up the bags and throws in some

368
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:30,020
paperwork into one of the duffels that's not full of the disgusting blood nappies.

369
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:34,140
Along with your uniforms, you each have a service pistol.

370
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,500
Oh, shit.

371
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:41,060
And you hear sirens, and he runs over to the window looking down on the city, and from

372
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:46,540
17 floors up, you see six police cars roll up to the front.

373
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,460
All right, we got to get out of here quick.

374
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:49,460
Lead the way.

375
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,460
After you.

376
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,460
Leon leads you into the hallway.

377
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:54,260
I assume we're all wearing our uniforms, the new uniforms.

378
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,260
I would hope so, yeah.

379
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,260
I'll put them on.

380
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:59,340
And then real fast as we enter the hall, oh, did you just say enter the hallway?

381
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,100
Enter the hallway.

382
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,900
As you guys enter the hallway, there's a distinct smell.

383
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,020
What does it smell like?

384
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:07,820
It smells like dead Winifred.

385
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:10,700
Oh, no.

386
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:18,940
She has exhumed her bowels, and Leon does not pay any mind as he walks right over her

387
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:24,740
to the stairwell on the far side of the elevator and begins walking down the stairs.

388
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,740
Winifred is dead.

389
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:30,700
I don't know that song, John.

390
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:33,900
Yeah, I was just inspired.

391
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:39,420
Well, when he's dead.

392
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:41,260
That's the kind of music that John Lee Pettymore likes.

393
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:44,380
The stairs go down to floor 14.

394
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:46,900
No, sorry.

395
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:52,220
The stairs go down to the 12th floor, and when you get to the 12th floor, you have to

396
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:58,440
exit and go into the hallway, and it seems to be like an accounting floor.

397
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,700
There's no one at this point.

398
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,020
All the lights are off.

399
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:06,720
You see a cleaning person on the far side away from you, and you guys just walk over

400
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,920
to the next set of stairs on the other side and begin to head down.

401
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:14,400
I need whoever has the lowest luck to roll luck for me.

402
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,400
I have 35.

403
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,400
That's me.

404
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,400
20.

405
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,400
70.

406
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:25,320
As you guys head down the stairs, you hear the doors open at the bottom of the stairwell,

407
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:35,480
and you hear the chatter of police.

408
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,480
What is this?

409
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,800
So you guys, what do you want to do?

410
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,960
Leon looks at you, and he's like, we're going to have to dip off at some point.

411
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:48,120
Is that where the balls came from originally, the Piston Pig Farm?

412
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:55,440
I'm making the same joke as you, but like, no, okay, I'm sorry.

413
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,640
You can't just ask me big questions about the campaign as a joke, Thomas.

414
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,080
I'm not going to answer them.

415
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,040
So yeah, we were literally, we came from a pig farm.

416
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,560
You meant the cops come from a pig farm?

417
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,160
The cops come from a pig farm.

418
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:12,200
That could have been the joke of the whole campaign.

419
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:16,360
I want to use disguise to just act like a cop.

420
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:19,160
Yeah, I'd like to use being a cop to act like a cop.

421
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:23,560
All right, go ahead and roll disguise and...

422
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,560
Hell yeah.

423
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,560
15 on a 30.

424
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,560
Can I just roll law to do that?

425
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,560
Yeah, absolutely.

426
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:30,560
Yeah, I'd like to roll law.

427
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,560
Damn it.

428
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,560
54 on a 50.

429
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,560
85 on a 60.

430
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,560
Oh, fantastic.

431
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:40,320
So you guys are like halfway down, and he turns and he's like, you guys are walking

432
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,320
weird.

433
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,320
We're going to have to take an elevator.

434
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:48,120
And he dips out of the stairwell into a new hallway where it's another floor that's empty.

435
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,880
You know, the lights are off.

436
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,880
Nobody's there.

437
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,880
It's Saturday.

438
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:56,720
And also Bruce Robin gave pretty much everyone the day off and the weeks off.

439
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,000
So there's no one in the building essentially.

440
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,140
So you hit the elevator and as you get to the very bottom, you see, as soon as the elevator

441
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:11,820
door opens, the security guard and the secretary who are sitting in the foyer of this large

442
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:17,660
building and the security guard makes direct eye contact with you guys and then grabs his

443
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:21,100
radio and then takes off running in the opposite direction.

444
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:26,300
Clark, you're first act if you would like to do this in combat order.

445
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,660
Well, can I just observe what Leon's doing?

446
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:30,340
I'd like to follow his lead as much as possible.

447
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:32,500
Yeah, you can wait for him to go.

448
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:35,660
When do we sense he might go on the turn order?

449
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:36,820
You can see him.

450
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:38,500
He's already like reaching for his gun.

451
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,500
Oh, he is reaching for his gun?

452
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,980
Oh, he's reaching for his gun.

453
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:41,980
Okay.

454
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:42,980
Then I'm reaching for mine.

455
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:46,460
I'm just going to, I'm going to hold the guy who's running at gun point.

456
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:47,460
I'm not going to shoot.

457
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,460
Hey, stop.

458
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:49,460
Stop right there.

459
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:52,460
Roll off.

460
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:54,220
Pass a five on a 60.

461
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:55,220
Hell yeah.

462
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:57,100
The security guard freezes.

463
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:02,280
His radio is in one of his hands, hands that are slowly raising into the air.

464
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:05,080
You know, like you do when a cop yells at you.

465
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,000
It's now Leon's turn.

466
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,640
Oh shit.

467
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,640
Okay.

468
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:17,760
So he aims his pistol and as soon as the bullet fires, you hear a coming from the radio as

469
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,640
if it was an aerosol can that got shot with a BB gun.

470
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,160
Luke, what are you doing?

471
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,320
I hear him fire.

472
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,040
I don't see it exactly hit.

473
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,480
So I'd fire on the guy as well.

474
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,480
Go ahead and roll firearms.

475
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,960
61 on a 70.

476
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,560
Roll a d10 for damage.

477
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:37,000
It's one of the ones you are stupid.

478
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,800
How long have we been playing this game?

479
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,800
One.

480
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,800
All right, nice.

481
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:50,880
So, uh, you shoot him and you actually see one of his fingers just like fly off.

482
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:55,600
Like it was like a carnival game and you like hit the thing to knock it down, but it was

483
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,120
a finger and now it's not on his hand anymore.

484
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,120
Exactly.

485
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,120
He's like, dang.

486
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:03,040
Yeah, he yells, dang, Thomas.

487
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,000
What is John Lee Pettymore doing?

488
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,840
He's going to try to shoot this guy.

489
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:10,040
Oh fuck, 74 on a 60.

490
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:18,360
He is like running away and he turns a corner and Leon just turns back and he's like, gone

491
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,240
is just as good as dead.

492
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,120
And he dips like full blown runs to the entrance.

493
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:30,360
You actually see that there is only two police officers within sight outside on the other

494
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:35,800
side of the, what's that called the, the, the ring around the rosy fellow that gets

495
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:46,160
you into large like hotels and stuff revolving door and they are going to absolutely notice

496
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,160
you guys.

497
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:51,480
So Leon stops short about 10 feet in front of the revolving door.

498
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,280
I want to, I want to wave at them.

499
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,280
We need backup.

500
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,280
Did you hear those gunshots?

501
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,280
Get in here quick.

502
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,280
Awesome.

503
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:05,720
Go ahead and roll law or persuade 98 fails of fail.

504
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,720
Yep.

505
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:11,680
They immediately start talking to each other and then they're going to take cover behind

506
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:15,520
the police car that is right outside where you parked around side.

507
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,520
Can I find a side exit?

508
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,480
Let's see what happens here.

509
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,440
Yeah, he knows.

510
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:26,340
So he's like, yeah, there's a side exit right around here and you guys dip off to the right

511
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:33,280
and there's another stairwell on that side with an exit door head through there and into

512
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:37,040
the mid evening on December 6th in the city.

513
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,040
Yeah.

514
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,040
I'd like to get in that car.

515
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,040
Yeah.

516
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,040
I'm filing in with Leon.

517
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,040
You guys all get in the car.

518
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:47,080
Leon gets in the driver's seat and as soon as he puts the pedal to the metal, you hear

519
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:51,800
a whoop whoop and baby, we got a motherfucking car chase.

520
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:56,320
These two dudes who are outside definitely recognize that you weren't officers got into

521
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:01,200
their car and are about to chase you Leon through the city on a scale from one to a

522
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,200
hundred.

523
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,200
How good of a driver are you?

524
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,200
What'd you say?

525
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,200
I would say 70.

526
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,200
Okay.

527
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,200
The uh, me too.

528
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:12,640
So we don't need to switch positions or anything, but maybe I could spot for you like a, like

529
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,320
a, the rally driving teams do.

530
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:19,320
I could call corners and shit for you and tell you where the bad guys are.

531
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,320
Hell yeah.

532
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,320
That's dope.

533
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,320
Sweet.

534
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:28,080
So with a city police car right behind you in chase, it is going to start with Clark

535
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,080
Bishop's turn.

536
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,080
What would you like to do?

537
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,080
Hunker down.

538
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,080
I don't want to be in the window.

539
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,080
Okay.

540
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,080
Go ahead and roll stealth.

541
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:39,040
Uh, fail 43 on a 30.

542
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,040
Okay.

543
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,400
You just can not get your legs.

544
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:49,120
So like those whole backseat is just filled with like a bunch of tactical gear and all

545
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:54,540
sorts of weird like devices and machinery.

546
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,620
And there's all these things that are in the floorboards.

547
00:28:56,620 --> 00:29:01,720
So your feet can't occupy that space and it's making your head stick up in the window in

548
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,720
the back.

549
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,720
Keith, what are you doing?

550
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,260
Is there a shotgun back here?

551
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,800
There's a shotgun like in the middle.

552
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,800
Yeah.

553
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,000
I grab it, roll the window down and shoot at the driver.

554
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
All right.

555
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Roll firearms.

556
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:15,600
Fail 92 on a 70.

557
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,600
Oof.

558
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:23,280
As the, as the car takes a corner, you just like fire and miss very badly.

559
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:26,160
But thankfully there are no pedestrians around.

560
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:32,080
No bleak looking haggard fools running about and for you to accidentally shoot Thomas.

561
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,000
Can I make like a drive roll to assist him?

562
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
You absolutely can.

563
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Okay.

564
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
43 on a 70.

565
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
All right.

566
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,560
He is going to, he rolled a 67 against a 72.

567
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:47,480
Look out, school bus up ahead, 200 yards on the rack.

568
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:52,580
He slides like his back end whips almost touching the school bus.

569
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:56,880
And as you guys pass, you see just like all these kids with their nasty grubby little

570
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:02,560
fingers on the windows, just like looking down like, oh wow.

571
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,600
And like give him a wink.

572
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:08,040
It cuts into slow-mo as John Lee Pettymore winks at them out the window.

573
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:13,560
And then it immediately goes back into normal speed as the car just dips away right before

574
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:19,720
the police car behind just slams into the school bus about halfway in between the middle.

575
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,720
Oh no.

576
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,720
Oh, hell, hell yeah.

577
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,720
I manifested that guys.

578
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:31,040
I just put what I wanted out into the universe and that's the secret.

579
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:35,000
I'm going to have whoever has the highest luck roll a luck check on this one.

580
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Got a 55.

581
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
That's you.

582
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Go ahead and roll that luck baby.

583
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,720
This is to see if another police car is within the area.

584
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,720
No, that's not good.

585
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,720
That's a hundo.

586
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,720
Oh fuck.

587
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,720
I saw the zero zero and I was like.

588
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,720
At ease.

589
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,720
We're set.

590
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:51,280
Two police cars immediately are on your tail.

591
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:55,720
Good thing school's just getting out.

592
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,720
Clark Bishop.

593
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,040
We just learned a great trick.

594
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,220
It is your turn.

595
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:04,340
Can I look through the stuff that's in the back seat here for anything that I could throw

596
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:08,900
out the window that would act as, I mean, spike strip especially, but just something

597
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:11,340
that they would hit that would make their car fucked up.

598
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:12,340
Yeah.

599
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:13,340
Roll search for me.

600
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:14,340
You have a great search.

601
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:17,020
I got a 20.

602
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,380
I do not pass.

603
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:21,400
You find two pairs of flip flops.

604
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,060
Toss them out the window.

605
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:24,060
Take that.

606
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:28,660
Keith, what are you doing?

607
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:31,820
Is it really going down?

608
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:33,460
I want to aim the shotgun.

609
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:38,980
I want to shoot one of the flip flops out of the air and then shoot at the driver of

610
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,060
the closest car.

611
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:42,660
Like to intimidate them with your marksmanship?

612
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:43,660
Back off, buddy.

613
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:47,780
Yeah, he throws them out and I just go and then aim at the driver.

614
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:50,340
We're a traveling circus act.

615
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:53,980
What just demonstrates that we're accurate and we have ammunition to spare.

616
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:55,220
We are not to be fucked with.

617
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:58,620
Those are two very intimidating factors.

618
00:31:58,620 --> 00:31:59,740
Don't need to roll twice.

619
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:01,460
You would need to roll once.

620
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,340
And no shortage of footwear.

621
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:04,760
Nine.

622
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:11,000
You do exactly what you called the flip flop actually lands on the windshield with a buckshot

623
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,180
like through the middle of it.

624
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:19,860
And then another fire just eviscerates the flip flop on the windshield as the windshield

625
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:22,620
busts out and you see a spray of blood.

626
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:23,620
Oh.

627
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:24,620
Oh.

628
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:25,620
Oh.

629
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:26,620
Intimidated them to death.

630
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:28,620
Roll 2D6.

631
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:29,620
Thank you.

632
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:32,620
Shit.

633
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:33,620
Wow.

634
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:34,620
Fuck.

635
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:35,620
I'm so sorry.

636
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,620
Yeah.

637
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:37,620
I let him borrow a 2D6.

638
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:39,620
I'll take those back and burn them in shame.

639
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:40,620
Oh yeah.

640
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:41,620
So I got a one and a one.

641
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:47,180
The officer turns on the windshield wipers and you see that it wasn't blood that sprayed.

642
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:52,620
They were holding a red smoothie of some sort in front of them that happened to explode.

643
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:53,620
And a jelly doughnut.

644
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:54,620
Yeah.

645
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:55,620
Oh my god.

646
00:32:56,620 --> 00:33:01,100
And the jelly just flies about through the car and uh.

647
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:04,140
And now they're real mad.

648
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:08,020
But he's going to take a negative twenty on the next drive check so Thomas would you like

649
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:10,900
to attempt the same thing or are you going to do something different?

650
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:13,300
Uh I'll go ahead and try to support again.

651
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,300
Fuck.

652
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:16,620
Seventy one on the seventy.

653
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:17,620
Woah.

654
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,620
So some.

655
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:25,580
Oh he passed and the cop behind failed so as you are going through an intersection you

656
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:31,180
have got the red light and he punches it as a semi goes right behind him and it takes

657
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:39,060
out one of the cop cars just like rams directly into the trailer of the semi pretty much taking

658
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:43,080
off the entire top of the car.

659
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:50,000
However you see the second police car fly around the semi and it's still on your tail.

660
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Go ahead and.

661
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:56,400
Someone better compose some kick ass hillbilly jangle and chase music for this.

662
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,800
Woo hoo.

663
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:02,440
Limp contention boys are at it again.

664
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:05,040
Clark Bishop topped the line up what are we doing?

665
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:10,280
Frustrated that all of his non-lethal attempts have failed I'm going to roll down the window

666
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,720
and try to shoot out a tire.

667
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,320
Alright roll firearms.

668
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,320
Nice.

669
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,320
A pass.

670
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,440
A six on an eighty.

671
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:22,140
Alright that is going to give a negative forty to the drive check of the driver on this next

672
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:23,140
attempt.

673
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:24,140
Keith Vigno what are we doing?

674
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:27,000
I'm doing the same thing shooting at the driver again.

675
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Alrighty.

676
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Eleven.

677
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Good pass.

678
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Nice.

679
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:38,600
Actually you know what on a crit just describe how the car wrecks when you murder the driver.

680
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:45,280
Well what I do is I aim the shotgun at the passenger kill him and then just chuck the

681
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:50,800
shotgun at the driver and we're going fast enough that it just impales the driver through

682
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,720
the head.

683
00:34:54,720 --> 00:35:00,440
Then the driver falls on his steering wheel the car takes a sharp right and just starts

684
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:05,040
rolling and then yeah stops.

685
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,120
It stops.

686
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,120
And then it explodes.

687
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:12,000
God damn Keith.

688
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Hell yeah.

689
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:17,200
I blow off the smoke from my finger gun.

690
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:21,440
Those guys were definitely just corrupt cops in the pocket of Marvin Glass right?

691
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,440
Absolutely.

692
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,440
Yeah.

693
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,440
I think they implied.

694
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,440
I heard them say that.

695
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,440
Let's tell ourselves that.

696
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:31,160
I think the last time in our past lives we found out that most of the police force was

697
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,680
in Marvin's pocket you're correct.

698
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:39,240
Okay so we don't have to feel any kind of way about slaying our brothers in arms just

699
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:42,960
indiscriminately we can just do that all over the streets of the city.

700
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,840
You're right Jon you gotta be right.

701
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:48,560
And we're gonna have fun doing it.

702
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:52,480
Let's go ahead and get some sanity checks to see if that rationalization actually plays

703
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,600
out in your minds or whether you're just saying it out loud.

704
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,600
No.

705
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,480
36 on a 14.

706
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,480
I fail.

707
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,080
13 on an 8.

708
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:06,080
I'm not rolling.

709
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:12,080
Oh shit has that always been an option?

710
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:21,800
No I have a thing that Luke doesn't have to roll sanity when he doesn't feel like it.

711
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:26,960
When it would be the reason for the sanity is an emotional reason because Keith Vigna

712
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,200
has no empathy in his body.

713
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:33,440
I have no empathy and I don't care when other people die.

714
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,440
I want that.

715
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,960
Go crazy.

716
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:57,520
And with that I'm gonna have Thomas and Joe leave the room.

717
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:03,720
Luke Leon drives free and you hear the sirens fade in the distance but as your heartbeat

718
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:13,320
is calming down you notice Clark Bishop and John Lee Pettymore begun diving into themselves

719
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:30,480
mentally and they both begin murmuring and muttering 2 1 8 2 1 3 5 1 8 1 5 2 9 1 4.

720
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,480
You recognize it as the sequence.

721
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:41,400
You are all writing upstairs in the office of Bruce Robin that you have translated and

722
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:45,180
this man I believe Clark told you his name is Leon Simpson.

723
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,180
He looks at you.

724
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,180
Oh good.

725
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:48,180
You're not.

726
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:49,440
Okay so we got one of you.

727
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:55,800
What the f- Do you know about this?

728
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,960
I've heard that number before.

729
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:58,960
We've seen it.

730
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:02,600
Yeah it was all over the place upstairs when I came in.

731
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:09,760
Yeah I mean so we deciphered one that we'd seen in Bruce Robin's house that said Harriet

732
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:15,800
Marks I think let me think and I you know like jot down what I can remember of that

733
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:21,120
number and start doing the same thing and I'm it says Bruce Robin.

734
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,880
It says Bruce Robin.

735
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,800
They're just repeating Bruce Robin over and over?

736
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,800
Yeah.

737
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:32,640
Before you showed up we all the all the numbers on the wall we I don't remember doing any

738
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:38,380
of it but I just kind of snapped out of it and and you know woke up just covered in blood

739
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:42,440
and we looked like we'd written that all over the walls.

740
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:44,440
I don't know.

741
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:47,040
I mean obviously we killed Bruce.

742
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,440
I don't know why they're chanting it though.

743
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:52,640
Oh no no I guess we we got in a scuffle with him and then he killed himself.

744
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,640
He shot himself?

745
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:54,640
He shot himself.

746
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,640
Okay.

747
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:56,640
Yeah with his with his gun.

748
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:00,960
Because it made it look like a suicide before I came in and made it look like a murder suicide.

749
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,980
No he uh he killed himself.

750
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:04,760
Do you have any idea why?

751
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:07,440
He was chanting some weird shit.

752
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:12,360
I was expecting him to try to kill us and not I didn't expect him to kill himself.

753
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,680
I'm Leon by the way.

754
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,640
I'm oh shit.

755
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,440
Keith, Keith Figna.

756
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,440
How did.

757
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,320
Oh you're you're Fergie's brother?

758
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,320
Yeah.

759
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,320
That must have been a hell of a childhood.

760
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,480
It wasn't fun.

761
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,480
Yeah that guy's a dick.

762
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,520
How did you know him?

763
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,120
What do you mean how did I know him?

764
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:31,200
I'm in the circle of knowledge.

765
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,960
Was Fergie in the circle of knowledge?

766
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:36,600
Oh you really don't know anything do you?

767
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,600
No.

768
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,480
There's a lot of stuff I don't know.

769
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:42,320
Well that might work out in our favor for now.

770
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:45,880
Can you at least tell me that though was Fergie in the circle of knowledge?

771
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:46,880
Yeah.

772
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,240
Shit.

773
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,160
Did you know your brother at all?

774
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,800
Not really not since we were kids.

775
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,300
I just thought he.

776
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:54,840
What is Bar Corp?

777
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:57,200
Was Bruce Robin in the circle of knowledge?

778
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:03,560
Bruce had his own ideas of what was good to do in this world but I think he meant well

779
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:10,180
and you know Ferguson used him because he was so goddamn smart but yeah.

780
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:16,180
You know it's it's probably better that you learn this from someone else but your your

781
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:23,480
brother is a I mean he's a dick but he's a good man you know he's he's working he's trying

782
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:30,240
to keep the or he was trying to keep the world safe in a way in his own way in our

783
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:37,800
own way but more and more I'm starting to question whether or not our version of the

784
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:42,000
world is worth saving.

785
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,420
This is you said we're going to see Harriet Marks I thought she killed herself.

786
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:51,600
She did kill herself we got to find out why and what led up to that.

787
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:57,200
What's important about her though like she was just a kid and he opens up the glove box

788
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:04,780
right in front of you I just got a hold of these he hands you a file folder full of pictures

789
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:12,760
he's like I got these recently from the investigation in on Harriet Marks's apparent suicide I mean

790
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:21,940
you can see for yourself spray-painted all over her dorm room one five two two five one

791
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:29,820
eight one nine five five one eight have you just have you figured out what that means

792
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:38,640
yet well it is only through death that he may live where have I heard that before and

793
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:47,300
he looks in his rearview mirror at Clark Bishop who is mumbling these numbers to himself

794
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:53,880
over and over and over.

795
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:58,820
It's only through death that he may live that's that wasn't a something that Clark found it

796
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:05,500
was a picture of a drawing of somebody in a hood and and written scrawled in there over

797
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:09,480
and over and over again was that like what do you know that from?

798
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:17,320
Your partner Clark Bishop is not a man it's more than a man I don't know if he's always

799
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:24,400
been more than a man or if it's just his future or destiny or I don't even know if I believe

800
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:30,940
in that anymore but your your partner Clark Bishop looking at him still through the rearview

801
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:44,080
mirror he is a god he is a savior Clark and I look at him and how do you know this it's

802
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:51,040
been a prophecy within the circle of knowledge for as long as the circle of knowledge has

803
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:59,520
existed I don't know how to tell you this but Clark Bishop is the overseer and he will

804
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:11,160
eventually in the past start the circle of knowledge like he time travels or and at that

805
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:15,060
moment John Lee Pettymore and Clark Bishop snap out of it.

806
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:45,960
How am I the only one trying to pull over How can you have enough drowning out of the

807
00:43:45,960 --> 00:44:04,440
circle of knowledge How can you have enough drowning out of the circle of knowledge
