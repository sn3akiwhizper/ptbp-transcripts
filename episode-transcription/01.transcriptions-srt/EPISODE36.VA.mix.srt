1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, my babies, and hello to my babies' babies.

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,680
Heck, even hello to those babies' babies.

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:11,080
Let's just get wild, y'all.

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,760
It's your local radio DJ

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:18,580
that you actually wanna listen to, Wolf the Dog.

6
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:22,400
This week, I have a message here from my producer.

7
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,160
It says, Zach and Taylor are on vacation.

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,480
He's real torn up about it,

9
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,000
but there just wasn't enough free time this week

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,700
to release an episode that is up to snuff.

11
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,500
For this, he feels shame, regret,

12
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,320
and just a tinge of arousal.

13
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,300
He wants each and every one of you

14
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,300
to know how special you are,

15
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:46,040
but quality time with the incomparable,

16
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:49,600
and formidable love of his life is paramount.

17
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,960
Thank you deeply for understanding.

18
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,320
You know, back in the day, old Wolfie Boy

19
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,760
used to have a little old Wolfie partner

20
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,040
that he would have missed the show for.

21
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,840
I still dream of her sometimes,

22
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,880
wondering what she's up to back in contention.

23
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,160
How many dumpsters has she dove in without me?

24
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,220
What if they're with some other new dog that ain't wolf?

25
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:15,920
So go on, Zach, whoever the hell that is.

26
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,440
Enjoy your life.

27
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:21,580
Eat all the trash you can, baby.

28
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:24,800
Next week is going to be a wild ride, y'all,

29
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,760
but for now, hold on tight

30
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,640
and keep your arms and legs inside the vehicle.

31
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,320
Playing us in and immediately out

32
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,240
is Kudzu with No Backbone.

33
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:52,240
["How Am I the Only One Trying to Pull Over?" by Kudzu playing in the background.]

34
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:59,960
How am I the only one trying to pull over?

35
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:10,760
How can you have enough drowning out all the noise?

36
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:22,960
There's nobody home, no one home, no one home.

37
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:29,960
Fight to fight, street me down, takes me back to where you're from.

38
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:40,960
When you don't stop a dying love, don't push on to only one.

39
00:02:41,960 --> 00:03:00,960
There's nobody home, no one home, no one home, no one home.

40
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:26,960
["How Am I the Only One Trying to Pull Over?" by Kudzu playing in the background.]

41
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:30,960
Tell me it hurts.

42
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,960
Tell me it hurts.

43
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,460
Tell me it hurts.

44
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:42,960
Tell me it hurts.

45
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:47,560
Tell me it hurts.

46
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,960
Tell me it hurts.

47
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:53,940
Tell me it hurts.

48
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,940
Tell me it hurts.

49
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,420
Tell me it hurts.

50
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:05,920
Tell me it hurts.

51
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,920
Tell me it hurts.

52
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,920
Tell me it hurts.

53
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:31,940
Tell me it hurts.
