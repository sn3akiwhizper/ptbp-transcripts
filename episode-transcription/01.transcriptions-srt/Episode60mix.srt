1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,320
what's up my babies it's your stepdad's stepson wolf wolf the dog's dog taking over the airwaves

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:18,480
here on 694.2 PTBP due to a frankly terrifying display of holiday cheer aka wolf the dog

3
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:25,600
gargled down more steaming mollusks swapped than the rest of family combined in our semi-annual

4
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:35,840
chowder challenge oh wolf is in the dumpster and he's breathing but it's real high-pitched

5
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:45,200
now it is something to do called howling with wolf so how does the man who drives the snow plow get

6
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:57,360
to work in the morning next is a non-sequitur transition into fucking Mark Zuckerberg but for

7
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:03,120
real help my fake dad out talk about app pretending part on the internet and give them money on

8
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:10,160
patreon sometimes people write five star reviews on the apple podcast app and he gets so happy

9
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:16,080
because he feels validated and understood and that means a lot to dogs like wolf

10
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:23,680
now put down the booze and listen for clues it's time for the news last time

11
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:30,480
Leon told Clark that he would become the overseer go back in time and start the circle of knowledge

12
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:37,200
Leon split the party tried to shoot Clark with a dart gun got fucked by Joel's uncanny ability

13
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:43,440
to quit and then Leon Clark came to an understanding fulfilling their original plan

14
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:49,040
the two headed over to the administration building where they heard numbers coming from a voice

15
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:57,840
at the end of a dark hallway Keith and John went to Harriet Mox's dorm John last touched again and

16
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:04,240
focused on the Bruce Robin numbers while Keith scoured Harriet's room for clues turns out

17
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:11,120
Harriet's roommate Amelia thinks the suicide story is fishy and Harriet was on search for two

18
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:22,400
things the most corrupt corporation in the city and the overseer and now to the middle of a party

19
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:31,120
timed holiday themed storyline even when Clark is being a dick it's a track that makes my

20
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:39,200
ball drop welcome to 2020 motherfuckers it's kazoo with no back

21
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:51,280

23
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:09,440
no she's so girthy girthy so joe clark bishop is walking down this hallway i actually decided

24
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,120
to go the other way yep that makes a lot of sense so when you turn back the other way

25
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,200
you find Cthulhu ah dang it i'll go the other way okay yeah that makes sense

26
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:29,040
so as you're walking down toward the office you see these two figures in the distance and as you

27
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:38,320

73
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,200
numbers right now are you what are you talking about okay just just checking you're not thinking

74
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:44,400
of numbers at all and you guys look down and you see like leon had flipped on the lights in the

75
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:50,640
office when the lights come on you see that the walls of the hallway and the office are just

76
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:57,120
covered in numbers oh shit the entire inner workings of this building have just been like

77
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:04,560
chalk sharpie pen blood semen everything just like yeah semen and then everything

78
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:11,280
have been used to write numbers all over these walls and the floor and the ceiling

79
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:16,560
i uh look a little scared at the well-dressed guy you didn't write any of these did you i

80
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,320
didn't even know these were here until that guy flipped the lights on what are you doing here son

81
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,680
what's your name what are you doing here my name is donovan west haven oh hey donovan i'm leon nice

82
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:30,960
to meet you what are you doing here oh i'm trying to uh i'm trying to solve this riddle you can see

83
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:39,840
it up on this uh banner up here why it's the christmas i don't remember it's the christmas

84
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:46,000
i don't remember huh and then he like literally looks to the bottom right of the banner and there

85
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:56,720
is a logo for the jingle ball hosted by csu the jingle ball it's a holiday episode at pretending

86
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:03,680
to be people where the tinkling music comes in justin it's whatever i'll figure whatever our

87
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:09,360
normal logo is now has christmas lights hanging off of each letter oh that's adorable and all

88
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:16,320
the scary music is now um it all has like nice little bells and yes honestly just only sleigh

89
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,960
bells that's the only difference just got this constant jingling in the background which might

90
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:29,520
be more horrifying we're trading out carpenter for williams the jingling never stops clark looks up

91
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:36,480
at that banner that's just uh that's just the number plus them all so if it's the 10th day

92
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,600
it's 10 gifts and the day before that they would have gotten nine just add them all up i think it's

93
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:48,640
carry the one is 55 i think i think it's 55 i don't know yeah you have to do what now you're

94
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:53,920
the first day your lover gave you a partridge in a pear tree sure second day gave you two something

95
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,640
two french hens two turtle doves and a partridge in a pear tree what is this from oh does she give

96
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:04,480
you the all the gifts again and then on the third day it's three something or others and then two

97
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,480
turtle doves and a partridge in a pear tree right am i singing the song right you're singing the

98
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,360
song right i just figured that each day she was given the extra new gift she wasn't repeating the

99
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:19,440
previous day's gifts every time if that's the case the math's a lot higher i mean i it could be higher

100
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:26,320
i i don't know i'm i'm more should we go in the office yeah i just i think that's the answer to

101
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:34,480
the question on the banner yeah let's go in the office i turned to the well-dressed guy uh you

102
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,320
have a you have a pleasant pleasant day sir can you tell me what that number was again i've

103
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:44,000
forgotten already i think it's 55 but if leon's right this is leon by the way hi leon hey donovan

104
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,400
hi if leon's correct the number would be a lot higher and i don't have the time to do the math

105
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:52,480
right now on it which seems like an outrageous number of presence and i thought the first number

106
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:57,760
was an outrageous number that lady loves that guy clark you're not doing christmas right

107
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:05,600
and he walks into the office uh with the lights on you see that the everything in this office is

108
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:11,280
covered in numbers uh the desks the chairs like anything that people could possibly write on

109
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:18,240
are covered in these numbers and he walks over to a computer weirdly enough there's just one main

110
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:28,480
computer in this office space and there is a monitor and keyboard normal computer stuff

111
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,840
leon looks at it and is like all right well i guess let's boot it up and there's a passcode

112
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:42,480
to get in any ideas leon i mean and he starts rifling through the desk looking around the area

113
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:49,920
you see that there are pictures sitting at this desk of a woman she seems to be in her early

114
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:56,240
20s same as donovan what was that last name donovan west haven all right similar age of

115
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:05,520
donovan west haven and you see that the pictures are with trophies from scavenger hunt championships

116
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:11,360
with this person holding trophies up and you see the name engraved on the trophies

117
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:22,560
is amelia lock l o c k e with an e and then there's also a group photo of a lot of girls

118
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:33,840
who seem to be 18 19 years old as well as this nice and uh the frame on this picture says best

119
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:42,720
r a ever and they're all holding up a sign that says third floor gifts house which is g i f f s

120
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:48,640
space house let me let me try something here leon and i'm gonna try lock l o c k e as a password

121
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:53,520
it does not work i'm gonna try amelia it does not work i'm gonna try amelia lock

122
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:58,800
it does not work okay well we've exhausted all of our options yep we're done here

123
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:03,440
so

124
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:10,480
clark i think what we we might need to just find this amelia lock and then convince her to

125
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:15,200
unlock this computer no no no we're gonna we're just gonna sit here and guess until we get it

126
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:20,560
okay sounds good what's your next guess uh zero zero zero one okay that one didn't work zero zero

127
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:26,640
zero two i tried that one as well zero zero zero three okay i think we're on to something you're

128
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:32,240
locked out for the next uh hour ah shit should have should have thought of that oh we didn't

129
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:37,120
even try password oh we definitely should have tried password it was password

130
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:46,640
it was either password or guest admin you really fucked up admin one two three

131
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,080
go ahead and roll alertness for me

132

160
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:51,840
to yours so when you guys walking across campus it is again a ghost campus there's nobody out

161
00:17:51,840 --> 00:18:02,720
and about you hear some like

162
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:08,240
just like for you know just like normal noises from across campus just like some creepy noises

163
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,880
not to dissuade your foley work because that was wonderful thank you but was it all obviously

164
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:17,360
emitted by a human or is there some of those that are actual animal noises at least one of those was

165
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:25,840
an owl okay it wasn't the one that sounded like an owl that was a person and you guys make it over

166
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:33,040
to gifts house unobstructed and when you get in there you see there's a little secretary desk on

167
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:39,600
the right and the sitting area on the left with a baby grand piano and then ahead of you there is a

168
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:45,040
glass wall with a door there and all the lights are out by the way nobody's sitting at that

169
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:52,720
nobody is sitting at the receptionist desk the uh the lonely glow of the computer there is shining

170
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:58,480
onto an empty chair behind it clark is just going to point at the computer and i'm motioning for

171
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:04,800
leon hey leon you want to check on that and clark is going to go like to is there a staircase in

172
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:10,720
here so when you walk forward past the desk you would see there's hallways on either side of you

173
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:17,600
and there are doors with like the little stairwell markings on both sides right or left well i just

174
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:24,640
kind of clark just wants to yell down if there's nobody around hello anybody anybody here roll an

180
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:08,400
stumbling around in the darkness donovan walks over into a hallway that is an offshoot from the

181
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:14,160
bigger hallway that leads to the stairwell and the light comes on you see that the walls on either

182
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:22,880
side of you are just covered in these numbers and like there's some sigils posted up now and

183
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:30,080
it's just some sigils sigils yeah and it's all written in the same just like varying materials

184
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:35,680
as soon as the lights come on you just hear from a door in this hallway there are three

185
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:44,160
doors in this hallway and from inside one of them you hear no no no five six four five five five

186
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:52,080
six no no the door cracks open and you just hear please turn out the lights

187
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:59,200
oh my god donovan slowly shuts the lights backs away

188
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:08,720
thank you and the door shuts real quick there's silence you're you're welcome hey donovan come

189
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:13,600
back this way this let's stay away from that uh that area there real fast i think that's a good

190
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:18,240
idea donovan i i know you didn't ask for this but there's a chance that we're wrapped up in

191
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:23,760
something real bad here and those numbers might be infectious so if you hear numbers you might

192
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:28,080
close your ears or maybe don't look at them i'm not sure how it works hey leon you know how this

193
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:33,200
thing transfers he doesn't respond and when you look over at him he's actually wearing his noise

194
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:40,640
canceling headphones ah fuck i tap him on the shoulder oh he startled looks over at you and

195
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:47,840
he points at the computer screen and he's pulled up the room number for amelia lock amelia lock

196
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:57,360
she lives in 328 gifts house and her roommate is harriet marks ah it's all coming together

197
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:03,360
you notice when you turn back around the glass panel of windows looking into a separate room

198
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:09,440
uh the glint of the uh computer screen kind of shines over there enough for you to make out a

199
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:14,640
pool table in that room you assume it's some sort of entertainment or games room there's probably

200
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:21,440
nothing fucked up in there hey leon leon he takes the headphones off and he's like yeah i'm

201
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:26,000
just trying to you know protection from the numbers right yeah you got a couple extra pairs

202
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,240
of those well you seem already fucked and this one's a dumb dumb so should be fine you think

203
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,480
i'm already fucked well that's why we're here right to fix what happened to you i mean i feel

204
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,800
like we snapped out of it didn't we we're not we're i'm not saying numbers now am i you're not

205
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:42,960

206
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,400
here maybe maybe since i've already done the numbers thing and you snapped me out of it you

207
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,720
snapped all of us out of it maybe i don't have numbers in me anymore i hope that that's true

208
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,240
all right boy it seems like you don't know as much as i thought you might have known about

209

211
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:11,120
or gaps in your memory in the last few days or no no feeling pretty good actually a little hungry

212
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:17,360
peckish i look at leon i mean maybe he's the thing we're looking for he's sounds like you

213
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:22,960
might be immune to it or something i don't i'm a man not a thing joe clark joe clark

219
00:23:54,720 --> 00:24:01,360
staring at his phone like swiping through whatever social media exists in this universe completely

220

oblivious to you talking about him right next to him what's going on dude yeah i think we're gonna

years releasing for a year and we've made it all the way from december 1st to december 6th what a

237
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:11,840
week and way back in the past and then way back in the future past yeah i bet we'll make it by the

238
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:17,280
end of tonight all the way to christmas to christmas all the way to christmas spoilers hey i have to

239
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:23,840
tell you the bad news okay john lee pettimore is gaining a new mania and it is going to completely

240
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:29,680
engross him oh he didn't reach his breaking point i know he didn't but it's a part of a mechanic for

241
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:37,680
this arc that this mania will absolutely dominate every other mania that you've had before and every

242
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:42,560
role-playing decision that you make so it's going to be kind of important and i hope you roll well

243
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:48,560
so you're going to roll three d 100s and we'll look at the list and see what you got

244
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:55,520
94 okay keep rolling 89 oh that's a good one i bet sounds like it yeah it's high

245
00:26:55,520 --> 00:27:04,560
99 whoa jesus all right so 94 is theomania belief that he or she is a god

246
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:13,760
i think maybe we've got a winner right off the bat yeah if you can get me back in a room with joe

247
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:20,000
oh we've got another really good one 89 is scribbleomania an obsession with scribbling

248
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:27,520
or doodling interesting that's really really appropriate and then 99 is xenomania which is

249
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:34,720
an obsession with foreign things i'm gonna choose theo philia or thea what was it theomania you

250
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:40,240
love god i love god what was it theomania theomania belief that he or she is a god

251
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:46,720
there's two gods in this role-playing game now and that's not counting any of the elders uh

252
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:50,880
something older than me older than john lee pettymore himself

253
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:59,280
as far as we know i'm ageless i came out of a spine as a little ball i can do anything i am

254
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:05,680
planet juggernaut and i am your god hell yeah it's important in delta green to really give people a

255
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:12,640
sense of hero worship over their own character yeah let's get into it

256
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:33,200
so i know we're past christmas but we still have a lot of holiday traditions that take place around

257
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:40,000
the end of december and the beginning of january or mostly the in between therefore of the two

258
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,680
situations with which we call calendar months within a year into the next one but i was

259
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:52,800
wondering what your guys's favorite family traditions are from the holiday season no i

260
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:56,320
don't want to tell you you're gonna make it something scary i'm gonna make it something

261
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:00,000
so scary yeah i don't trust like that

262
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:08,400
justin i've always said that you should trust more yeah i just don't though and that hurts

263
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:17,920
how can zack manipulate you it's really fucking hard to gaslight you when you don't trust the

264
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:25,520
words i say justin i'm sorry zack when i was a kid we used to listen to a song uh when we were

265
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:30,800
hanging out the ornaments on the tree we'd always listen to christmas music and one of

266
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:36,320
our favorites was a muppet christmas carol soundtrack to that movie it was great but

267
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:43,120
my personal favorite growing up was a song by john denver this isn't a joke this is just true

268
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:51,520
it he has a song called merry christmas little zachary oh that's you and it made my heart warm

269
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,880
did you know he died yes yeah he's dead we made it scary for you

270
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:02,720
and now every time i hear it i can only so when i when i heard the song as a child i could always

271
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:10,960
immediately visualize john denver's face wherever he was in the world but now i just see his rotting

272
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:21,520
corpse which is cool and festive but it's not you know what i'm looking for so i had to stop

273
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:27,520
listening to that song you just think of this instead luke is just handed oh my god dude stop

274
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:34,720
it it's a it's a picture of john denver's plane crash that's not his it's just a plane crash

275
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:41,600
it's wildly inappropriate merry christmas everybody

276
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:49,760
other than the normal like christmas morning stuff that i absolutely love we have a weird

277
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:57,600
tradition in the family that christmas eve we do a frozen pizza and oyster soup that is interesting

278
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:03,040
very weird so the frozen pizzas i think comes from my mom and they've just chalked it up as

279
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:07,200
like not wanting to cook the night before christmas okay and then i think my dad maybe

280
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,440
brought the oysters no that might have been hers also but the oyster soup is like a really great

281
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,920
fancy oyster soup that my dad makes and it's great great great and it's really weird to have them

282
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:20,640
together and i love it yeah it doesn't sound good it's weird and it's i don't know if i could

283
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:26,880
recommend it but i it's a christmas memory yeah what do you guys do while you're having this like

284
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:32,640
weird dichotomous meal it's with family friends instead of family it's the it i i i do sunday

285
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,320
suppers with a bunch of people that i've done since i was a voice changer when you said that

286
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:40,880
because it's so wholesome and sweet he's a little he's a little child and it's that group i get

287
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:45,520
together with that group for that christmas eve that's fun yeah i like that justin what's your

288
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:51,360
family do on uh my family is weird because we don't do jack shit on christmas we do everything

289
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:57,600
on christmas eve and we do an all like homemade italian meal oh hell yeah this is my grandparents

290
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:02,960
who immigrated from argentina in argentina it's like a ton of italian food so they just uh

291
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,920
we just wonder why that is because there's a lot of italian stuff

292
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:15,680
luke do you need anything for christmas uh we uh christmas lunch and it's like a bunch of

293
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:22,400
appetizers like little smokies and meatballs oh nice yeah and also

294
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:32,800
so uh my family for christmas um my stepmom will always make uh fresh cinnamon rolls

295
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,880
oh and then we drink mimosas

296
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:41,440

298
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:50,960
oh god have you seen that video of trump getting pissed off with the guy who sneezes anyway we

299
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:55,600
don't need to talk about monsters on this show it's it's christmas it's time to think about

300
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:02,240
pleasant things not real horror yeah um and then uh my step sister who like uh is a chef she went

323
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:23,600
donovan for the first time and he looks like what justin's about to say donovan west haven is about

324
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:29,440
six foot one six foot two somewhere in between those two inches dark nice hair done up really

327
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:43,920
who's this clark guys this is this is donovan donovan this is the fellas that's john over there

328

329
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:53,600
donovan doesn't shake he nods at you and's like hi what's up we ran into this guy like nod and smile

330
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:58,480
over in the uh the administration building me and leon think there's a chance he's immune to these

331
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,880
numbers he's been here on campus in the middle of what you're saying john lee pettymore walks

332
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:11,760
straight into a wall like slams into it yeah john john no i'm still working up the kinks don't worry

333
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:18,240
i've got it all in my hands oh god okay keith what were you saying though sorry has he been

334
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:24,640
like this for a while i mean he was no longer than you know he was normal until we saw that body then

335
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:29,760
he started writing on the walls and now i don't know what the fuck he's doing do you do you keith

336
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:35,120
have any missing time in your no okay who's this guy his name's donovan we ran into him we think

337
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:39,520
that he might be immune to the the infection of the numbers he said he's been having people

338
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:45,760
yelling at him numbers all for the last few days a few days yeah and he seems to have no ill effects

339
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:50,960
he doesn't he doesn't affect other people i mean it affected us have any other do you know any

340
00:36:50,960 --> 00:37:00,080
other students it's been affecting oh like um all of them except me okay we actually ran into him he

341
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:04,640
had another fellow with him who was asking to be punched in the face and then he started saying

342
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:13,680
numbers so i obliged well we found a we found a body in the elevator uh dead um i didn't

343
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:20,880
investigate too much on it but uh nearly moved on to the next phase i kind of look at john and

344
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:27,520
eyebrows high john smiles benevolently at you i didn't investigate it too much but uh it could

345
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:32,800
have been self-inflicted i'm not really sure were there were there numbers on or around the body

346
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:38,080
i mean there's numbers all in this you look around the room and the room itself is also

347
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:43,040
covered in these numbers as was the hallway on the way down the floor the ceiling all over the desk

348
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:48,320
the chair all over the place in here from what i'm gathering from leon here he's not even 100 sure

349
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:53,520
the uh method of infection but he puts on headphones every now and then just to maybe

350
00:37:53,520 --> 00:38:00,240
combat the that's not not a bad idea so the only thing i've found obviously you know we're in

351
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:06,240
harriet's room uh we found out her her roommate's name is amelia amelia lock amelia lock yeah

352
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:12,320
have you seen this and i hold up the flyer for the ball yeah do you uh do you know about the

353
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:17,200
scavenger hunt yeah but i haven't really found anything out about it but uh if you look over

354
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:22,000
there and i point to amelia's desk take a look at those trophies i do you would see that they

355
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:30,160
are trophies for being an elite riddle master and a scavenger hunt champion oh yeah so we we found

356
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:36,640
i found her desk at the administration's office oh yeah and uh i saw some pictures of her holding

357
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:42,800
these trophies here um there was also a clue back at those offices i assume maybe the first

358
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:50,560
clue what was it it uh basically asked how many presents does a person get on the 10th day of

359
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:57,360
christmas and me and leon have differing opinions on that number but either way it's just a number

360
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:03,520
i don't know if it well well i would say 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 and 1 thank you thank you keith

361
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:09,920
thank you john exactly leon uh i'm just saying i just can take my answer on this is fairly

362
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:16,160
authoritative i don't understand are you really good at math amongst other things you there what

363
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:26,640
was his name donovan what was his last name west haven west fucker west mr wet fucker why do you

364
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:35,040
think mr wet fucker you there child your voice got weird mr char mr west fucker are you do you

365
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:39,120
hear yeah what's up why do you think the numbers had no effect on you i couldn't tell you honestly

366
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:45,840
i don't know tell me i'm just maybe you know it just like i know it tell me maybe i'm maybe i'm

367
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:51,360
special after all ah yes i can see it in you

368
00:39:54,000 --> 00:40:00,240
you are special you are very special more than you know child is john speaking with an accent

369
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:06,080
have you noticed i don't know i mean he wasn't acting like this before your friends are weird

370
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:11,760
and they're freaking me out so leon here thinks that every day she's repeating the

371
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:18,480
presents from the previous day i don't no i don't think that i think it'd be 110 the only the only

372
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:23,120
leg he has to stand on is that she does say on the fifth day christmas my true love

373
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:33,120
hey out of character think about who made this puzzle and then and then who do you think has the

374
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:37,440
right but i also i agree with that you get all the presents each day right you get all the presents

375
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:42,240
the true love is a real true love well if that's the case then look at this

376
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:49,280
also 330 is the room right next to us it's the room right across the hall and keith vigno holds

377
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:56,640
up a sheet and on the back of the sheet is all the math of like one plus three plus you know

378
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:04,560
essentially uh fibonacci sequence but not right for this thing and it leads to 330 which is the

379
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:09,280
room across the hall which keith vigno would then say i found this in there

380
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:21,040
and i hold up another piece of paper you guys fucking nailed it we got there i hold up a piece

381
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:29,920
of paper that has a picture like in cartoon form a picture of seven eggs a golf ball a cat a demon

382
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:36,320
and another egg yep uh yeah there was nothing in there beside it was just a normal it's like

383
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:41,280
we found out it's a like a staging dorm room that nobody lives in it's just to show prospective

384
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:46,880
students what a dorm room looks like i found this in there and there's a casio keyboard in there

385
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:51,520
too does that mean anything to you casio keyboard it doesn't mean anything no no it doesn't mean

386
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:56,480
anything to me either but i can tell you whoever made this riddle seems very cool

387
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:03,440
you a puzzle fan leon oh huge puzzle fan i'm glad you're here with us then do these look

388
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:11,440
like emojis from the movie yeah exactly are these emojis from the emoji movie i don't know if there

389
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:18,000
are yeah essentially they're this of similar ilk in style but they're not emojis i don't think so

390
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:26,080
right no i'm not there i just mean like they're not like it's not made out of emojis they're

391
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:31,360
like cartoons they're like cartoons they're uh illustrations cool like pictogram they could be

392
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:38,240
small enough to be sent in text form though does that make it an emoji no man oh okay then no

393
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:46,880
definitively no it was seven eggs a golf ball a cat i saw seven eggs a demon and an egg when you

394
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:51,040
say demon can you describe that demon is it like the demon emoji yeah it looks like the demon

395
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:59,600
like is it horns is that what it has yep okay purple with horns baby and a little toothy smile

396
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:07,040
that one's an emoji uh just a couple other things before i don't know if i mean we ought

397
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:11,760
to probably go check that room out but uh in harriet's desk she has a to-do list

398
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:17,440
number one research the most unethical corporation in the city and number two

399
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:26,800
just said who is the overseer and then uh in in uh i know amelia's desk uh she had a little note

400
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:32,160
i found and basically says she didn't think that harriet would have committed suicide and that

401
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:37,200
she's going to try to get to the bottom of it and that's what i found in here so far so previously

402
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:42,640
we were thinking that maybe it was a uh a leaping disease that went from one person to the next and

403
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:49,040
he wrote down their names and yada yada if harriet killed herself first then amelia

404
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:53,360
would have maybe gotten it or gotten it in investigating her death that could be have

405
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:57,200
we seen amelia's name written anywhere in these numbers and i do a quick look around

406
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:01,840
at the actual numbers and see if i can find her name in the numbers nice roll search

407
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:13,760
i pass an eight 20 you find a couple numbers that start with one but none of them move to

408
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:18,640
whatever m is next what about her last name just lock can't find it anywhere okay yeah i'm just

409
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:22,960
not sure if our if our theory is wrong or something else happened in the sequence of

410
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:27,760
events here but donovan what do you think i gotta get that jingle ball i need it you

411
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:33,920
mean you have to get to the jingle ball yeah whatever i just want to win whatever donovan

412
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:38,320
do they give out an actual jingle ball at the jingle ball if you make it there last maybe

413
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:47,840
that was really rude of you yeah sick burn leon yeah what what the hell he's not children children

414
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:54,880
i look at both of you like with a right smile but like paternal love i am unsettled as long

415
00:44:54,880 --> 00:45:00,400
as you're quiet young man holy shit and quiet he is

416
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:09,280
jesus you see john lee pettymore is beaming at you with fraternal pride do you think we ought

417
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:13,600
to go back into 330 see if you guys might find something i didn't so yeah i'd like to so

418
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:18,480
beautiful put my eyes on that room for sure i'll head across the hall so when you guys go across

419
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:28,320
the hall into 330 you would find this dorm room set up to be the pinnacle of what all dorm rooms

420
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:36,640
could look like here at csu come on down become one of the fighting plant things can't remember

421
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:42,080
it what's it called fly trap and well what if it was the fighting for cithias

422
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:51,520
oh i like that a lot feed me see more and there's a lot of things that we can offer you here at csu

423
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:58,480
much like this dorm room that is very well equipped with lots of blankets and pillows and

424
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:06,320
athleisure which is what the college kids wearing these days bad commercial for csu but uh you would

425
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:12,400
see that all over this room there are numbers thickly written i mean to the point where it's

426
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:18,640
hard to make out the sequences just like everywhere else however in the middle of this room there is

427
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:24,400
just a casio keyboard sitting there it's turned on and there's a music stand that is now empty

428
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:27,920
i'd like to play the keyboard cat riff oh you do it can you do it

429
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:40,320
it just kind of goes on right john does it though does the pictogram symbols do they end

430
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:46,800
with a single egg yes i picked this up off that music stand and the symbols are on a staff on a

431
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:54,720
music staff yes oh is it in the form of e g c d e it's written just across the music staff it's

432
00:46:54,960 --> 00:47:01,040
no up or down okay but we might assume one might assume a guess might be it's the guess that was

433
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:05,440
clearly being made there i want to hit those notes that are the first letters of the words

434
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:23,520
of the pictures e justin can you take that live for us wow she is majestic wait does that keyboard

435
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:28,880
that keyboard does not have an outboard audio on it but we could pause and go to the piano

436
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:32,640
real quick i'd like to hear it let's take a pause and go to the upright piano real quick

437
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:42,400
joe hammered down those notes that he got and keep in mind my dad is a professional piano player

438
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:49,680
so it only took us about 45 minutes to practice one it's four in the morning we're all dying but

439
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:58,560
assuming the first letter of egg golf ball cat demon and egg represents musical notes it might

440
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:14,800
sound a little bit something like this and as g vigna or clark bishop are all of you with your

441
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:24,400
hands all together just doing it like the cat did on the keyboard as you play the jingle bells tune

442
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:29,040
you all the camera like pans through you none of us thought to not do this

443
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:39,040
and no it's nice you look through the window and you see right out the window of 330

444
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:47,680
gifts house you see the bell tower on the csu campus lit up in all its holiday festive glory

445
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:52,480
are there wreaths dude you have no idea how many wreaths there are you can't count them are there

446
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:56,560
lights because you can only see two sides of it and there are so many lights but you don't know

447
00:48:56,560 --> 00:49:01,200
how many lights is there a minion inflatable there's a minion inflatable right on top it's

448
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:10,320
