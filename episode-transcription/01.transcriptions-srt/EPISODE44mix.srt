1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,720
What is up my dumpster dwelling hot dogs, it's your new home wolf the dog and I am here

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:13,520
to slather y'all in various sauces while giving you the pleasure to hear my soothing voice

3
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:17,980
before being digested into the endless void that is wolf's tummy.

4
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:26,420
Oh and also we are hitting your eardrums live from 694.2 PTBP.

5
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:32,120
This week's howlin with wolf comes from Mr. Sean Bailey who tagged at pretending pod on

6
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,120
twitter.

7
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,500
You should do that too my hot dogs, they write.

8
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:44,100
Greetings and salutations wolf, long time listener, first time shout out her.

9
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:50,580
I need to give props to my former ninja partner Carol R. Without her I would not have blessed

10
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:57,300
my ears with the sweet sounds of 694.2 and the boys of the contention PD.

11
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:01,700
So thanks for that, anywho keep on howlin my dog.

12
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:09,100
Well Mr. Sean I'm happy to hear you've been enjoying the show but please wolf is no person's

13
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:15,420
dog and I don't howl on command for any person who just tells me to.

14
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,700
Not unless there's a dumpster full of sweet meat in it for me baby.

15
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:24,040
Remember if you want to write up something for your wolf to howl, tag at pretending pod

16
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:29,280
on instagram or twitter, tag pretending to be people on facebook, or write a 5 star review

17
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,340
and email us at pretendingpod at gmail dot com.

18
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:39,120
Those iTunes reviews are apparently an absurdly effective way to get our nasty noises into

19
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,960
more strange ear canals.

20
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:48,700
Also the contest happening over on the subreddit ends at 11.59 PM central time on September

21
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:50,700
23rd.

22
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:55,380
All entries have a shot at winning a D&D 5th edition starter set and the winner will receive

23
00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:00,220
a hardback slip case set of delta green the role playing game.

24
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:06,260
Check out all the hideously delightful entries on the thread at the subreddit r slash pretending

25
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,260
to be people.

26
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:12,860
Speaking of the subreddit, a few people there seem to have been paying close attention to

27
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:15,040
the news.

28
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,960
Last time, Clark unexpectedly shattered the aquarium in an attempt to save John Lee Pettymore

29
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:26,040
who was trapped underwater by the unnatural forces of Marvin Glass.

30
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:30,880
The two opened the door to Glass' office, unleashing a relentless surge of water that

31
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:36,400
caught Keith up in its current before he was lifted out of the drink by Marvin Glass.

32
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,660
The two of them, Clark Bishop and Keith Vigna, stood face to face with the head of the Glass

33
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:47,300
crime family and he showed them a polaroid picture from the odd camera that depicts the

34
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:54,140
two of them with Kevin in a world where everything is made out of darkness except the ground

35
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,180
which is made of light.

36
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:58,620
This is spinning out of control, y'all.

37
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:05,620
The only thing keeping me steady is the repetition, baby, it is kudzu with no backbone.

38
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:24,660
I don't want to talk too much up top on this episode.

39
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,500
Yeah, I want to get right into it.

40
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:30,140
But Thomas isn't here so I figured I'd share something he just said when we were in the

41
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,140
kitchen.

42
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,140
Okay.

43
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:37,500
We were talking about Ed Kemper and Luke said, how tall was he?

44
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,500
Six foot nine.

45
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,500
And he had an IQ?

46
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,500
Of 145.

47
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,460
And then you said that'd make him a really...

48
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:47,860
He could have been a really good basketball player and probably taught at MIT.

49
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:53,180
Yeah, and then Thomas said instead he became the world's greatest skull fucker.

50
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:56,020
Oh, goodness.

51
00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:00,100
Which is monstrous.

52
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:04,740
And unfortunately factual.

53
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:07,860
He should have just sacked up and kill fucked his mom earlier.

54
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:08,860
Jesus Christ.

55
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:12,140
That would have saved the lives of a lot of people.

56
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:20,180
So let's dive into, dive into is an interesting word, is you're all standing on water.

57
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:28,020
Luke, I don't think I described it to you, but your feet are standing on solid ground.

58
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,640
So you're standing on water.

59
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:36,420
So that description, I thought maybe there was just like a tiny puddle or no?

60
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:41,140
No, you were standing on what you think you, what you started trying to swim through when

61
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:43,420
all that water rushed into the hallway.

62
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,420
Yeah.

63
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:51,820
You probably got dragged by Marvin Glass, like physically, like up, up, like 40 meters

64
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:58,420
up on top of the water and now you're standing there and he's just asked you what you know

65
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:02,740
about this picture.

66
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:09,260
After I would say a solid 10 to 20 seconds of just complete silence from Keith mouth

67
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,260
agape.

68
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,260
Okay.

69
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,540
Actually, hold up.

70
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,140
Some stuff happened before this.

71
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:20,300
So Clark, Marvin pulled you down like the way that you moved last time.

72
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:27,500
As soon as you made it to your final destination there, whip snapping into position, he immediately

73
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:33,340
snapped and you just went unconscious and during that time when your eyes are open,

74
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:39,140
you're just standing there, but nothing, nothing is seen from your end from behind your eyes

75
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:47,220
and Marvin and Rosemary continued to discuss this picture and he's holding it up and he's

76
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:55,740
looking at it and I just look at him.

77
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:01,140
It's not, there's something I, you got to send me over there.

78
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:09,020
You got to send me, I, I don't know how, but we got to figure out something, something

79
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:15,100
we got to, they continue having this discussion that you're not quite privy to the information

80
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:24,220
of all of a sudden Marvin perks up something in his lack of facial emotions, still twitches

81
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:30,140
and he turns and looks up into the corner of the room up to where the elevator in the

82
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:39,020
room next to his office, far above and far beyond the scale of this room, he sees the

83
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:48,220
elevator door moving and he immediately holds out his hand and there's a, there's a confused

84
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:56,740
look on his face when this creature arrives in his palm, his long fingers wrapping around

85
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:03,420
a softball sized fish head with a human body attached to it that is the size of like a

86
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,420
Barbie doll.

87
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,420
Oh my God.

88
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:07,420
And it was like, Hey, Hey there, sir.

89
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,420
Hey.

90
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,420
Oh gosh.

91
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,420
I'm just so sorry.

92
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:15,780
I don't know what happened last time that made, made you sure want to do that, but I,

93
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:20,700
you know, it was a real interesting place that you sent me to there and, uh, I, I've

94
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:25,540
never seen anything like it of this short and there was some, uh, feelings inside.

95
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:36,420
I will say that you survive in that environment this whole time.

96
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:38,180
And yes, yes, yes, of course.

97
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:43,420
Well, you know, I, I just, you know, going to go on and go on and find whatever's next,

98
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:48,220
you know, the next great adventure for old me, you know, now that I'm, uh, finally out

99
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:54,300
there, you know, you know, got friends now and I've, I've, here I am talking to like

100
00:07:54,300 --> 00:08:01,700
the, I mean, I can't even imagine, you know, it feels like to be, to be me right now.

101
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,220
It's just very nice.

102
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:11,660
And um, as this conversation is happening, you see, uh, Rosemary just staring down, bearing

103
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:22,460
down on this strange little fish fella and Harvin says, you know, I, I am looking.

104
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:28,620
And he kind of looks over at Rosemary and looks back at Peter and he says, I am in need

105
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,420
of a new number two.

106
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:35,860
And Peter's like, Oh my gosh, a number two.

107
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:40,740
Is that like, I can't even imagine doing anything of that short of nature.

108
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,300
It's absolutely incredible.

109
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,100
Thank you so much for this opportunity.

110
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:51,540
I mean, and he looks over at Rosemary, who's just arms crossed, but Marvin's face once

111
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:57,580
again takes a different shape and it's like he smells or feels some sort of sensation

112
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:07,340
and immediately his hands move and out from the water come Keith Vigna and this scientist

113
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:14,940
lady with the, uh, the white, you know, soaking wet lab coat and the, the hair maniacally

114
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:18,620
going on on top of her head and the goggles.

115
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:24,700
And as soon as she sees Peter Dieter, she's extremely, extremely happy to see him.

116
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:30,260
And Keith, you looking around this room, you're not standing on this water, like I said, and

117
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:32,460
you see these odd people.

118
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,780
I mean, the situation is very strange.

119
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,540
You've got Rosemary in this room.

120
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:40,020
You've got Marvin Glass next to her behind his desk.

121
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:46,220
You're next to Clark Bishop who is just now seeing you and opening like his eyes to the

122
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,260
world.

123
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:54,300
And you also see in like Marvin Glass's hand or maybe on the desk now is Peter Dieter sitting

124
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,300
down there.

125
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:58,380
And I said, Peter, I'm glad you're all right.

126
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:01,620
I am glad that you're all right too.

127
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:07,100
After the last time in our meeting, I thought, oh gosh, there's absolutely no way that he's

128
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,420
going to make it much more than one episode.

129
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:15,740
Like no doubt about it, what's your language?

130
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:20,540
And Marvin reaches out and shuts down Peter Dieter.

131
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:27,340
Peter Dieter just stares these wide eyes, these wide fish eyes and this tight lipped

132
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,660
human mouth.

133
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,940
And I need the both of you to roll a power check for me.

134
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:32,940
Hmm.

135
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:37,020
A fail, 60 on a 50.

136
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:42,420
I also fail a 79 on a 60.

137
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:49,100
I rolled a 42, which is a success against you and therefore when Marvin Glass asks you

138
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:57,900
a second time what you know about this picture, you have to tell him like a compulsion inside

139
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:58,900
of you.

140
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:04,940
You must tell him, okay, Joe doesn't quite remember to tell me what I would know about

141
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:05,940
it.

142
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:10,340
I mean, it's, it reminds me of the place that I was with Maggie, correct?

143
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,340
Totally.

144
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,340
Okay.

145
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,340
Other than that, I don't know.

146
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,860
It also reminds you of the other picture, right?

147
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:15,860
Right.

148
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:16,860
That's what I was going to say.

149
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:17,860
Oh sure.

150
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:18,860
That we know where these come from.

151
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:19,860
Yeah.

152
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:20,860
Gotcha.

153
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:21,860
Okay.

154
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:22,860
Yeah.

155
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:23,860
I'll tell him, Oh, they're there.

156
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:24,860
Um, it's that camera there.

157
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,700
And I point at it cause it's sitting on the desk.

158
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:30,220
You take a photo and it shows you things that aren't there.

159
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:32,580
And uh, I don't, I don't know.

160
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:34,040
I don't know anymore.

161
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:39,860
We thought they were maybe from a different dimension or from the past or something.

162
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:43,100
How many pictures did you take?

163
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:48,500
I turned to Keith, two or three.

164
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:54,680
There was one with all the people with the torches and the old timey, uh, clothing in

165
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,360
front of blackness, like a black building.

166
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:07,200
And then there was another one of, uh, like a cowboy, like with his hand up to the camera

167
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,520
and a guy with tribal tattoos kneeling in front of him or something like that.

168
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,120
Say that again.

169
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,360
A man with tribal tattoos?

170
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:17,320
I believe I recollect that.

171
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:24,480
And a man dressed as a cowboy or with a cowboy hat looking almost as if he's trying to block

172
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,600
his face from the camera.

173
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:30,360
You also said the name John Peters.

174
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,720
We saw there was one with him in stocks, wasn't there?

175
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,000
Yeah, that was, I think that was the first one, one of the first ones we took.

176
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,960
And did, did he have fool branded on his forehead?

177
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,960
I think it was in that picture.

178
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,960
Yeah.

179
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:48,200
And in all of them, that's, it's just like a black inky background.

180
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:53,440
As you guys are having this conversation there, when, when you guys say that one of them has

181
00:12:53,440 --> 00:13:02,600
tribal tattoos, Rosemary perks up and you notice, and as you're finishing this conversation,

182
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:08,080
you see she is eyeing the gun so hard.

183
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,120
The tube gun on the desk?

184
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,120
On the desk.

185
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,560
And I like handouts a lot.

186
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:19,040
I think I've given you guys a lot of handouts over, uh, over the years that we've been playing,

187
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,240
but this is an audio format and handouts don't always work.

188
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:28,880
And the way I typically use handouts is I hold them until you guys do something that

189
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,240
would unlock the handout, right?

190
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,480
In this instance, you have unlocked a cut scene.

191
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,480
Okay.

192
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,480
Whoa.

193
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,080
I don't play video games, but this is a, uh, I didn't mean to sound so assholeish when

194
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,480
I said that.

195
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,960
I don't play video games, I live them.

196
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:56,220
I don't waste time on frivolity, like desperately wish I had time for video games, but I work

197
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:59,020
and go to school and produce this podcast.

198
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:01,140
Fuck me.

199
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:04,680
One day I'll play video games, but anyway, this is an audio cut scene of what happens

200
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,680
next.

201
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,680
Ooh, nice.

202
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:16,120
Rosemary dives for the gun and as she grabs it, Marvin reaches down and flings the sphere

203
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,360
off of the desk at her.

204
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,880
Multiple shiny limbs extend from this small metal sphere and slam into the desk and the

205
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:32,440
water below, giving it the leverage it needs to fling its silver round frame at its target,

206
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,240
Rosemary.

207
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:40,320
One of its appendages slices into the soft tissue on the back of Rosemary's neck.

208
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:46,520
Mother snaps her head forward and you hear the fracture as a third metal tendril reaches

209
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:54,520
in gripping the top of Rosemary's spine where it meets her head and it rips her entire spinal

210
00:14:54,520 --> 00:15:02,560
cord out of her body in one swift motion, promptly forcing itself into the now vacant

211
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,120
spinal column of this human being.

212
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:13,540
The new Rosemary standing before you has a crazed look in her eyes as she blows her

213
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:21,560
nose into her hand, slams the mucus into the empty chamber of this weird gun, and squeezes

214
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:25,080
the trigger on the odd looking revolver.

215
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:30,440
There is an almost blinding flash of light that illuminates your entire field of vision

216
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:38,000
and then, as if she had never been, the body of Rosemary is gone.

217
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,480
I need you both to roll sanity for me.

218
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,560
What the absolute fuck, Zach?

219
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,560
I don't want to play anymore.

220
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,560
I don't want to play anymore.

221
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,560
I quit.

222
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,560
I'm going home.

223
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,560
Oh no.

224
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,560
Oh no.

225
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:55,560
I was stoked and then I wasn't.

226
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,560
I rolled a hundred.

227
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,560
Yes!

228
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,800
I rolled all the zeros.

229
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,120
I rolled an eighty-two.

230
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,120
What was this on?

231
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,120
A sanity check?

232
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,120
A sanity check.

233
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,120
I rolled over my power with an eighty-two.

234
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,240
All right.

235
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,720
This is very fun, guys.

236
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,160
This is very fun indeed.

237
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:16,000
So basically, I have this set up in scenarios that you write.

238
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Oh yeah, hit me with it.

239
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Real fast.

240
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
She shot the gun.

241
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,720
Was she aiming at anything?

242
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,720
Nope.

243
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,000
So like where was the muzzle pointed when it went off?

244
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,840
As soon as she grabbed it.

245
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,840
So it just like...

246
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,840
Just pulled the trigger.

247
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,800
Yeah, it was just like aiming at the back of the room or whatever.

248
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:37,040
So when you write a scenario for Delta Green you write in these things that can happen

249
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:43,000
and when the PCs come across them or see them you write like roll sanity and then you write

250
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,980
how many sanity you take and a lot of them are zero slash one which means if you pass

251
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:51,800
you take zero sanity damage, if you fail you take one sanity damage, right?

252
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:56,100
But then other ones are like one slash one d6 or you know whatever.

253
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:00,500
This one is one d3 slash one d3 plus four.

254
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,500
Oh my god.

255
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,500
Oh no.

256
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:10,740
So, Joe, you're gonna roll a d6 and halve it and then add four to it instead of just

257
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:11,740
a d3.

258
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,740
Do you have a d3?

259
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,740
No, you're right.

260
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:14,740
I was about to roll a d4.

261
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:15,740
Oh wait, yeah.

262
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:16,740
I was thinking a d4, yeah.

263
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:17,740
You can roll a d4 if you want.

264
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:18,740
It's like triangle, three.

265
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,540
You can roll a d4.

266
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,540
So I rolled a four.

267
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:25,340
Okay, so that's two plus four is six so you lose six sanity.

268
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,420
What am I gonna do?

269
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:31,400
You automatically take the highest amount of sanity damage so you're gonna take seven

270
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,400
sanity loss.

271
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,740
Okay, that puts me at negative one.

272
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:41,820
Okay, Joe, where's that put Clark?

273
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:44,260
That puts Clark at sanity seven.

274
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,540
He still has a breaking point at six.

275
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,540
Oh shit.

276
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:53,580
So I'm fine, I'm just crazier.

277
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,860
Oh my god.

278
00:17:55,380 --> 00:18:01,300
So, Luke, at negative one sanity, you really can't go negative, it's just zero.

279
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:05,860
So typically in Delta Green you would lose complete control of your character, however

280
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:12,360
I trust in you to be able to play a fully insane PC that I'm gonna let you hold onto

281
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:20,460
that character and do whatever you want with him as he completely loses his fucking mind.

282
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:26,040
Because we're in the endgame here, there's no point in having you bring in a new character

283
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,940
when we can just make this one fucking nuts.

284
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:31,760
Okay, I can do that.

285
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:36,660
So you're going to always be in your most negative state.

286
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:43,080
So you're gonna roll a negative 20 on everything and you are going to automatically fail sanity

287
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:49,860
checks and you are going to always- Or automatically succeed them all.

288
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:53,900
Yeah, basically, because everything is real, everything is good to you, whatever.

289
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:59,460
And you also have that thing that happens when you roll sanity over your power.

290
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:00,460
Yeah.

291
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,340
You're gonna be that all the time.

292
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,340
Okay.

293
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,340
Yeah.

294
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:05,340
So here we are in this room.

295
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:06,340
Give me one moment.

296
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,340
Sure.

297
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,340
I gotta look up what that is again.

298
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:12,980
Joe, just take off your headphones real quick and plug them ears.

299
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:16,380
So it's that you get extremely paranoid.

300
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,700
Okay, yeah.

301
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:18,700
Yeah.

302
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:24,660
Do you also want me to constantly be thinking, well, because I already think that I'm possessed

303
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:25,660
by a demon.

304
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:26,660
Oh, yeah.

305
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:27,660
You're going to constantly.

306
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:28,940
That's going to be a big part of it.

307
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:29,940
Yeah.

308
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:30,940
So that and be super paranoid?

309
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:31,940
Uh-huh.

310
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:32,940
Yeah.

311
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:33,940
Sweet.

312
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,940
Okay, Joe.

313
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,640
So here we are.

314
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:41,300
As soon as that happens, the light flashes and you-

315
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:44,040
Oh, fuck.

316
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:52,280
His Marvin Glass loses his fucking mind and then he reaches out and he holds on to everyone.

317
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:57,600
He is straining himself to do this and he is just holding you all.

318
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:05,920
You cannot move a muscle and then you feel as he kind of waggles his lack of eyebrows,

319
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:13,000
you feel your jaws begin to unclench and your tongues begin to become loose and he rolls

320
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:22,280
over his power check from earlier and says, tell me what just happened.

321
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:34,480
I saw that gun one time before and it did the flash thing.

322
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,480
I don't know.

323
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,480
I don't know.

324
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:41,720
You both failed your sanity checks and so you see the ground above the water where Rose

325
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:48,840
Mary or the body of Rose Mary just stood, all this black shiny viscous sludge that's

326
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:55,840
down there and seemingly inside all this muck is the placid body of Rose Mary.

327
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:02,680
She is lying peacefully as her limbs seem to fold into this ooze, becoming one with

328
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:11,340
the sentient mass of goop that is now sliding across the water and Marvin Glass reaches

329
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:18,660
out at one of his hands and grabs it and flings it downward into the water below and

330
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:24,120
you hear this noise that you have yet to hear.

331
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:30,460
It's basically like, you know, like there's a certain kind of kitchen top, like a stove

332
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:35,140
top kind of thing that when you turn it on, if it's like kind of broken, the noise that

333
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:37,520
it makes gets inside of your head.

334
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:41,560
You can feel it a little bit in your throat and like inside of your body.

335
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,940
Do you guys have that ever?

336
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:46,520
I've only had gas burners, so I'm not sure.

337
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:50,920
I know that I was thinking you were like that, right, right, right, right.

338
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,920
We used to have this.

339
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:58,440
We used to have this broken one in the kitchen I worked in and when it came on, it made my

340
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:01,880
throat tingle and it was just like a super high pitched noise.

341
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:05,840
It was just this frequency that would break me as a person.

342
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,360
You also do have the weird styrofoam thing.

343
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,360
Oh, fucking don't say it.

344
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:17,020
So it could be that, but I know kind of what you mean.

345
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,520
I can imagine that.

346
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:23,960
So that is the noise that you feel as he flings this into the water below.

347
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,800
I used to get that with tube TVs.

348
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,800
Is that what you're talking about?

349
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,800
Yes, absolutely.

350
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,800
Yeah, I feel you.

351
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:33,320
It's that old fucked up electronic system kind of thing.

352
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,320
You can kind of feel.

353
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,080
I can feel it in my throat right now as we're talking.

354
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,080
Makes me sick.

355
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,840
It sounds like it affected you a little more than it affected him.

356
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,880
Yeah, it makes me sick, I say.

357
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,400
So he threw her body down?

358
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,800
No, he threw the tube.

359
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:55,280
After it had already kind of become one and turned into just this massive goop, this sentient

360
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,560
mass that was no longer her, you know.

361
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,560
All right.

362
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:04,160
As that happens, he looks back up at you.

363
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
What about that?

364
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,160
Have you seen that before?

365
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:23,840
Keith, with just wide eyes, I've only seen that goo one time before at the water park

366
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:28,280
when it decimated two people.

367
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,960
I saw it once before.

368
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,520
It was seeping out of a picture one time.

369
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,000
One that came out of the camera.

370
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
One of the Polaroids.

371
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I saw it once then.

372
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,080
I saw it then as well.

373
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:47,200
But at the water park, I think I was the only one of us that was able to see it.

374
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,080
Did you see it any other times?

375
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,120
Did it take people when you saw it?

376
00:23:53,120 --> 00:24:01,320
Do you know how to contain it or is it running rampant through your city?

377
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:04,800
To answer your questions, yeah.

378
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,480
We know that it takes people.

379
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,840
I don't know that I've exactly seen it firsthand.

380
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,840
Maybe I have.

381
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:13,320
I don't remember exactly.

382
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:19,360
There was one time that me and John ran into it and there was a guy who was using a vacuum

383
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:24,120
on it and that seemed to be working until the bag of the vacuum exploded.

384
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,160
Who was this man?

385
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,160
James.

386
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:30,320
James who?

387
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,320
Just James.

388
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,880
He worked at the mill.

389
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:38,800
The orifice beneath the two slits that make up his nose kind of gapes.

390
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,200
So it's the mill.

391
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,360
What do you know about the mill?

392
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:49,040
Am I still under the influence of power?

393
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:53,440
Go ahead and roll.

394
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,360
Ooh, okay.

395
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,200
He succeeds with a 97.

396
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,080
Well, I crit succeed.

397
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,080
It's a one.

398
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,080
A zero zero.

399
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,080
Oh!

400
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,080
No!

401
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,080
Is that good?

402
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:16,080
No!

403
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:22,120
You can tell him whatever you want and he is very, very convinced that you are telling

404
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,120
him the truth.

405
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:27,000
We don't know anything about the mill.

406
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,360
We never got out there.

407
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,360
Okay.

408
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:35,000
Now tell me, what do you know about these spheres?

409
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:40,600
All I know is what I just saw and what I saw in those videotapes.

410
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,600
Go ahead and roll.

411
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,600
Oh, actually, just kidding.

412
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,600
You just tell him.

413
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,600
You're so fucked up right now.

414
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,840
Yeah, you just immediately tell him.

415
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:51,440
He says, the videotapes and what else?

416
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,440
I turn to Keith.

417
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,440
Yeah, what videotape?

418
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:01,600
With the researcher, the professor, whoever she is, I found...

419
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:08,040
Yeah, I just showed him those tapes.

420
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,840
He had never seen it.

421
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,080
There's a room.

422
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:14,280
There's a room in this building.

423
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:22,320
Anytime somebody touches one of those metal balls, it does what it just did to her and

424
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:27,240
they've got a room covered in blood and there were lots of videotapes.

425
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,080
I just saw one of them, but I assume that's what happens every time.

426
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:41,200
That's what she told me every time and I told her, I told her what we did with the silver

427
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,280
ball that we had.

428
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,880
Which is what?

429
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,820
We had a bag.

430
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:50,200
When we put it in the bag, it disappears.

431
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:54,000
What do you mean it disappeared?

432
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,160
It was gone.

433
00:26:55,160 --> 00:27:01,400
You drop it in the bag and when you reach around in the bag, there's nothing there.

434
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,400
There's nothing?

435
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,360
Just like out of nowhere?

436
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,400
It was just nothing?

437
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,200
The little fish fella says from the desk.

438
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,200
Yeah, Peter.

439
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,080
Whoa, that's amazing.

440
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,560
That's so cool.

441
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,800
You could just make anything disappear out of nowhere.

442
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,800
Well, we didn't.

443
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:21,960
I don't know if we tried it with anything else, but those metal balls disappeared.

444
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,260
Balls?

445
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:24,260
How many?

446
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:26,540
I think we just did the one.

447
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:29,320
You've seen more than one?

448
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,440
Yeah.

449
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,280
How many have you seen?

450
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:39,200
I just think, and I look over at Clark, I just think we had two of them.

451
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:48,600
One was in that woman's head, that disgusting body's head that I think maybe, I think maybe

452
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,320
John Lee had that one.

453
00:27:51,320 --> 00:28:02,080
He said earlier that they took one of them spears out of this lady's head and that one

454
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,840
of them held it in his hands.

455
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,480
And Marvin Glass looks up.

456
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,880
Is that true?

457
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:12,240
Did your fellow officer hold this spear?

458
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,240
Clark nods.

459
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,240
Yes.

460
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,240
Yes.

461
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,240
I saw it.

462
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,240
He held it.

463
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,240
Where is he now?

464
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,240
You don't know?

465
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,920
The last time I saw him.

466
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,100
Oh, that's right.

467
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,740
He died.

468
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:28,740
He was gunned down and ripped apart.

469
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,240
Did you know that?

470
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,240
Kinda.

471
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,240
No.

472
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,240
Kinda.

473
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,240
Kinda.

474
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,240
Not exactly.

475
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:41,880
Now tell me, why was Kevin in this picture with you?

476
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,920
You don't, you don't know?

477
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:57,040
John Lee Pettymore, the man who held the spear, he was in Kevin's body.

478
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,220
Marvin's eyes widen.

479
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:01,000
So does Clark's.

480
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,220
I thought, I thought you, I thought you had something to do with that.

481
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:17,300
You're saying that your coworker on the contention police force is inside of Kevin's body and

482
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:21,420
that he grabbed the metal sphere.

483
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,580
That's what you're telling me.

484
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:28,620
Clark, Clark nods again, but while he's nodding, can I look around this room and maybe down

485
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:32,540
in the water beneath us, do I see Kevin's body anywhere?

486
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:39,300
Well you do because Marvin just reaches out a hand and pulls the body of Kevin.

487
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:47,540
And all of a sudden out of nowhere, the wet dead body of Kevin is in his hand in front

488
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:48,580
of you.

489
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:58,820
And with his other hand, he grabs onto the skull of Kevin and twists it open.

490
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:03,460
In a smooth motion, like a perfect avocado.

491
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:14,020
And as he pulls the head of John Lee Kevin Moore apart, sitting inside like the pit in

492
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:22,940
a perfect avocado, you see a small metal sphere.

493
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:29,900
Holy shit, says Joe, says Joe and Clark.

494
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:32,260
Is there viscera or is it, oh yeah.

495
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,700
Is his brain in there?

496
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:34,780
His brain was in there.

497
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:36,980
It was like split in half as well.

498
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:37,980
Yeah.

499
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:38,980
And the sphere was like embedded.

500
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:39,980
Embedded in it.

501
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:40,980
Was there a spine?

502
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:46,420
Marvin Glass turns it over to one side so that he can hold the ball like steady with

503
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:54,000
half the skull and then he peels down and just rips the body in half completely dropping

504
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:00,580
the other half into the water and you see where a spinal cord should be, there is nothing

505
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:01,580
there.

506
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:02,580
What?

507
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:05,260
Zach, if you don't fucking stop, I'm quitting.

508
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:07,340
What the fuck?

509
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,340
What does that mean?

510
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:13,700
Keith is racking his brain since the cage fight.

511
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:21,300
All the interactions I'd had with Kevin, trying to think of any, I lose no sanity because

512
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:24,300
I don't have any.

513
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,420
I don't know.

514
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:27,420
Okay.

515
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:33,620
Well, with this new information, I have a plan for the future.

516
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:43,580
The two of you are on your way to give some heavy entertainment.

517
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:55,900
So if I could answer any questions you may have on your way below ground, meaning death,

518
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:59,620
you can ask them and I will answer.

519
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:00,620
What are those?

520
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:01,740
What are those balls?

521
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:02,740
What are they?

522
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:03,740
What, what are they?

523
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:13,140
Well, as you know, I've been doing research and I have come to very few conclusions, but

524
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:24,420
they are not of this realm and we are working to secure their destruction.

525
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:26,260
Where do you find these?

526
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:35,140
One was brought to me a long time ago by two men that I was seeking out that along with

527
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:43,660
one other person stole something from me, but I got them.

528
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:46,660
I got them all right.

529
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:57,180
And one of them stuck around as my loyal bodyguard for many years, but he brought me my first

530
00:32:57,180 --> 00:33:01,060
sphere.

531
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:04,980
And I have been doing research ever since.

532
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:08,660
Was that, that was Kevin.

533
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,420
That was Kevin.

534
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:14,420
And he looks at the half body in front of him.

535
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:20,220
But it seems Kevin was compromised.

536
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:21,340
Who was the other man?

537
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:23,220
I do not know.

538
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:24,940
What happened to him?

539
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:31,980
He perished in my need to gain knowledge.

540
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:40,860
You see, when you break a man, oftentimes one of the easiest ways is to break down his

541
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:44,180
ability to communicate.

542
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:53,900
And when someone murders someone that they work with, they often recede into themselves

543
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:57,700
and become malleable.

544
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:04,140
If I forced his hand, I was getting what I needed to get.

545
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:08,140
We're running out of time.

546
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:11,500
You slung that silver sphere at Rosemary when she went for the gun.

547
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,780
So you knew it did a thing.

548
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:18,060
It tends to enter the person that it touches.

549
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:19,820
But then she still shot the gun.

550
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:21,060
It didn't work.

551
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,060
Is that what you're saying?

552
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,460
It didn't do what you thought it was gonna?

553
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:33,140
Well, I maybe did not suspect that the entity inside would do anything other than try to

554
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:36,740
kill itself as it normally does.

555
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:44,180
Do you know anyone with tribal tattoos?

556
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:47,380
That is one of my sons.

557
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:51,220
That is Jermaine Glass.

558
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:53,220
Cool.

559
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:59,020
I had a feeling.

560
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:07,940
He seems to be wherever it is that this camera and perhaps this gun are connected to.

561
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:16,380
Have you any more information about this place, this other world?

562
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,420
I have a little power for me.

563
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:23,420
You son of a bitch.

564
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:25,700
I pass 34 on 50.

565
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:29,180
I pass a 45 on a 60.

566
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:37,380
I pass a 72 on a 120.

567
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:40,580
So the only way to beat Marvin is with a crit?

568
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:43,940
Yeah, or you can roll over him and still succeed.

569
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:49,780
If he rolled low enough earlier, I was like, how do you roll over 120?

570
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:52,100
So I need you to answer that question.

571
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:55,420
What do you know about the world that these take place in?

572
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:58,960
What do you know about this other place?

573
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:59,960
We don't know much.

574
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:02,380
There's two other things like those.

575
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:05,800
There's a radio and there's a helmet.

576
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:09,420
The world of those photos though, it's perplexed us as well.

577
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:14,820
The inky darkness around every figure we've seen reminded us of the goo, but we didn't

578
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:17,300
know what that meant.

579
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:21,100
We had somebody take a look at that one that had a bunch of people in front of a thing

580
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:28,460
and apparently all the clothing was kind of mismatched as far as time periods go.

581
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:29,460
We don't know.

582
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:30,460
We don't know what that meant.

583
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:39,420
You've never seen another place that has the dark sky and the ground that is made of light

584
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:41,620
like in this photo?

585
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:44,620
Uh, yeah.

586
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:47,140
The old photos, we didn't see the ground of light, did we?

587
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:49,360
I think maybe no.

588
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,360
I think maybe no.

589
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,360
Yeah.

590
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,360
I think you've just seen it once.

591
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,100
It was just in this particular picture of us.

592
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:57,180
This picture and then Clark Bishop has seen it.

593
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:59,700
Right, right, right.

594
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:02,260
I've seen that place.

595
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:03,260
I've seen where we stand.

596
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:04,260
But I didn't...

597
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,260
Go on, boy.

598
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:06,260
Talk.

599
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,760
I didn't...

600
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,180
We weren't all there and I don't even know if I was there myself.

601
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:14,180
It just was.

602
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:15,980
I saw it.

603
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:18,580
I've seen a place that looks like that before, yes.

604
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:25,440
What were you doing when you were there?

605
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,700
I saw something in it.

606
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:34,020
There was a creature in that world there and there were people who were trying to keep

607
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:40,900
it at bay and it scared me so bad that I...

608
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:41,900
That's all I know.

609
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:44,980
I don't know what that place was or what I saw.

610
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:48,540
Do you have any last questions?

611
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,540
Why do you want to destroy these?

612
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:55,140
I thought for the longest time maybe you were trying to use them.

613
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:57,500
Use, destroy.

614
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:02,700
When it's competition you can do either one.

615
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:05,620
Who's your competition?

616
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:16,740
Power is my competition and greed is the contest and I will not stop until I have attained

617
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:23,940
control over this domain.

618
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:24,940
Last one.

619
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:26,940
That's good.

620
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:28,940
What are you?

621
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:33,460
Ding, ding, ding.

622
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:40,140
Clark Bishop, I am not from here.

623
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:48,140
I am not one of you, but rather one of many.

624
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:54,420
We are in control and we run things.

625
00:38:54,420 --> 00:39:00,180
However, from the bureaucratic standpoint, I was getting bored and ready to go out on

626
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:02,020
my own.

627
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:11,340
The government has so many rules, many of which are easy to be broken, however, I do

628
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:21,740
not take orders kindly and I left them a while ago.

629
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:28,460
And I have been battling Myriad ever since.

630
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:30,900
Myriad?

631
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:38,260
Marvin Glass snaps his fingers and the two of you go unconscious.

632
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:42,620
Oh my God.

633
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:46,340
Oh my God, Zach.

634
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:48,300
Holy shit.

635
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:52,740
You guys wake up in a small, cubic room, an armory.

636
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:59,620
The metal walls on either side of you are covered in every type of weapon, armor, gadget

637
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:01,880
and contraption imaginable.

638
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:07,400
The wall in front of you has a doorway with a set of steps leading up.

639
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:15,060
The wall behind you has a square window with absolute darkness on the other side.

640
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:16,920
What?

641
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:22,680
That's all just guns, stairs, and a window to nothing.

642
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:23,680
And each other?

643
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,680
Are we both there?

644
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:25,680
And each other.

645
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,680
I check my pockets.

646
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:29,800
Do I still have my gun on me?

647
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:33,080
Well.

648
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:40,440
Here's the thing is that you are reaching for it and Clark Bishop sees this.

649
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,440
Do I?

650
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,440
I search myself.

651
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,440
You have it.

652
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,440
Okay.

653
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,760
Are you looking for this?

654
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,360
And I hold up the tiny powerful gun?

655
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:57,700
I want to knock that out of his hand and head for the closest gun on the wall next to me.

656
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:04,600
You do that and a cage appears in the square window and it's a cage that you would recognize.

657
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:12,160
It's the cage that you've been in before and inside this cage is a man so massive that

658
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:18,080
he barely fits and his muscles bulge and press against the inside of his cage and Oz

659
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:22,400
Mayhem Wolf squeezes himself out and into this room.

660
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,400
Hello.

661
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,960
I see that we are.

662
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:25,960
Oh fuck.

663
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,960
I was just in Marvin.

664
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,920
I was inside him.

665
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:30,920
Hello everyone.

666
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:31,920
Yes.

667
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:32,920
Here's where I am.

668
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:41,820
I am Oz Mayhem Wolf Oz Mayhem Wolf and I am here to I guess we are all fighting together.

669
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:47,260
He runs excitedly to go grab his stuff and he grabs a pair of boots and some shoulder

670
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:54,260
pads a football helmet and a pair of gloves and he he's all jazzed up and he's putting

671
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:58,140
on all this stuff and he heads over to the stairwell excitedly.

672
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:03,180
I call after him what what do you mean are we fighting each other or are we fighting

673
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:04,180
something else together?

674
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:05,180
I don't what's going on?

675
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:10,780
I think we are going to fight as a group but you guys better prepare because time is running

676
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:13,260
out and a timer begins counting down.

677
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:15,260
What are we what are we gonna fight though?

678
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:22,860
As the timer starts counting down water begins filling up this room from your feet up and

679
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:24,940
you need to start grabbing stuff.

680
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:26,140
I start grabbing stuff.

681
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:31,060
I want you to come up with whatever you grab in between now and our next session.

682
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:35,740
I'm going to give you a full week to decide what you're bringing with you.

683
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:36,740
Wow.

684
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:37,740
Okay.

685
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:40,700
You can have pretty much fucking anything.

686
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:45,860
You can have any sort of armor any sort of gadget any sort of weapon anything like that.

687
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:49,460
Is there any chance that Oz looks back and says what we're going to be fighting?

688
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:56,020
No of course not because that would be no fun whatsoever but I will say that a circle

689
00:42:56,020 --> 00:43:00,980
opens up in the ceiling above you at the top of the stairs as you guys all grab everything

690
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:06,540
that you brought with you and head up the stairs and a disorienting amount of light

691
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:12,620
and sound pours in and you hear violently chanted by an unseen crowd.

692
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:23,580
Play Jugga Jugga Play Jugga Jugga Play Jugga Jugga Play Jugga Jugga Play Jugga Jugga Jugga

693
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:31,540
Oh my goodness I cannot wait to be brainstorming oh my god I've been waiting a year for this

694
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:36,460
holy shit dude what the fuck I'm like so stoked wait so we

695
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:40,980
when we woke up in this room did we feel anything in what way if we lost consciousness

696
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:45,740
did we wake up like it's weird you've actually been healed up to full health for some reason

697
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:50,020
well that's not what I meant but that's fucking awesome I kind of meant that I like like did

698
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:55,540
we feel like we had been like knocked out or whatever yeah like some sort of some sort

699
00:43:55,540 --> 00:44:02,140
of immediate sleep like you just became in this other place you just came all over it

700
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:06,540
did we did we really get all the hit points back yes you're fully healed and ready to go

701
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:14,180
as Keith hears this the screams from the crowd I look at Clark and say planet juggernaut I

702
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:22,540
barely knew her not we got to pull the comedy tag off this

703
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:43,300
so we've been playing a closed game which means that we leave the room when the PC is not there

704
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:48,940
that way you can keep secrets from each other and stuff however the next episode is going to be

705
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:56,420
this is gonna be kind of apparent so I figured I'd let you guys be in the room for this scene

706
00:44:56,420 --> 00:45:09,300
with John Lee Pettymore as we lead out of this episode so John Lee Pettymore in a dark room lit

707
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:18,180
by various electronics and machines we see a massive shiny metal sphere 20 feet tall with

708
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:25,180
silvery arms extending from either side a tube connects this gargantuan ball to a machine below

709
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:32,580
the machine begins whirring and we see a small metal sphere roughly one inch in diameter begin

710
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:41,700
moving up through the tubing into the larger armed version of itself as this happens you

711
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:50,780
John Lee Pettymore feel alive again you feel your consciousness extend itself throughout your new

712
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:58,540
body this colossal monument to destruction a vast circle opens up in the ceiling above you

713
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:05,700
and it's disorienting amount of light and sound pours into this dark room revealing text painted

714
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:11,860
on the back wall that says the same thing you hear violently chanted by an unseen crowd

715
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:45,060
I give my new hands a tentative like punch together kind of dig in what the fuck sorry

716
00:46:45,060 --> 00:47:03,620
boys but looks like y'all about to get juggernaut I can't I can't wait to kill

717
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:25,180

718
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:55,260
