1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,640
Welcome one, welcome all, welcome y'all, wait a minute, did I say this all before?

2
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,880
Have I lived this moment in another time?

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:18,560
It feels like I'm having one of them damn dirty deja vu moments, where you feel like

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:24,380
you did a thing before in an alternate reality type deal maybe, but now you're doing it in

5
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:31,700
this one for the first time, but a second time, anyway.

6
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:36,500
Speaking of endless cycles of torture that I am forced to relive every week, it's time

7
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,420
for Howlin' with Wolf.

8
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:43,060
This week's Howlin' with Wolf comes from Ian, who wrote a five star review of this show

9
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:45,820
like the sweet, sweet boy he is.

10
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:50,500
Hey everybody, be more like Ian, he writes.

11
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:54,040
Dear Wolf, I hope this letter finds you well.

12
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:57,400
Needless to say, I'm a huge fan of your show.

13
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:01,920
Not only for the soothing sounds you howl through the airwaves each week, your DJing

14
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,920
prowess and your spectacularly diverse discography, but you are hands down the most reliable source

15
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:14,200
of news that the mainstream media won't report on, those otherworldly happenings in the town

16
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,900
of contention.

17
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:21,280
My neighbor's got a sister in contention, and even he doesn't know what's going on.

18
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,180
Then again, he really hasn't been himself since last week when I returned that shiny

19
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:29,540
ball bearing he dropped out in the parking lot.

20
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:34,200
Didn't even thank me, he's usually a pretty chill guy, but the other night he woke up

21
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,840
half the apartment complex screaming and carrying on at two in the morning, thrashing and banging

22
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,560
around like we're living in college dorms again or something.

23
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,640
When I knocked on his door to ask what the hell he was doing, or more importantly why

24
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:54,400
he was spattered and marinara and holding what looked like a fake spinal cord, he just

25
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:59,160
said, uh, Halloween, and shut the door in my face.

26
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:04,620
It ain't even October, now he just stares at me coldly every time I pass by on my way

27
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:08,960
to the mailbox, sorry, totally got sidetracked there.

28
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:14,240
Anyway, love the show, keep on howling the good howling snapping those pearly fangs at

29
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,480
Mark Zuckerberg's milk toast android ass.

30
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:22,080
You're the wolf now, dawg, your friend and admirer, Ian.

31
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,080
P.S.

32
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:28,080
If you could do me a huge favor and dig into the deep cuts, I'd love to hear you spin something

33
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,960
a little different from the usual setlist.

34
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:35,160
Do you have no backbone by kudzu in your collection?

35
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,160
Thanks a million.

36
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,360
No, thank you, listener.

37
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,600
All-profit news stations are designed to keep you scared and coming back so they can make

38
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,720
that sweet, sweet cash money.

39
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:53,640
I like to keep y'all scared, but I do it for free because I'm a true radio journalist DJ

40
00:02:53,640 --> 00:03:00,720
of high caliber, and, uh, it gets me off to know the power I hold, and, baby, you know

41
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,320
I'm always scrounging for them deepest of cuts when it comes to tunes.

42
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:10,000
I might have a little something special just for you this time.

43
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,760
Remember, if you want to write a message for me to read on air, tag us on Instagram or

44
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:20,480
Twitter at PretendingPod, or write a five star review on Apple Podcasts and email us

45
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,280
at pretendingpod at gmail dot com.

46
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,320
And the conglomerate of pretending to be people want me to keep shouting out that they are

47
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:34,080
taking questions for a third Q&A episode, so if you have questions for any of the mature,

48
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:40,200
most thoughtful adults who make that show, tag at PretendingPod on Twitter or Instagram.

49
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:44,560
There's also a post in the subreddit where you can comment your questions.

50
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,400
Or go all out, record audio of you asking a question and send that so they can use it

51
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,960
in the episode.

52
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:55,920
Same as the second Q&A episode, this one will be for our honorary police officers over on

53
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:01,240
Patreon who plug the holes of this sinking ship five bucks a month at a time.

54
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:06,400
The anthropomorphic corks who hold this whole thing together currently have instant access

55
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:13,240
to six exclusive bonus episodes, with more on its way, so much more.

56
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:18,080
Now if you want a question answered but you can't rationalize making room in your budget,

57
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,080
fear not.

58
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:24,680
There are already so many questions the PTBP crew won't be able to get to all of them.

59
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:29,720
For some of the questions missed on the recording, the boys will journey into the hardline mainframe

60
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,720
network and answer right there inside your phone or laptop.

61
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,520
They'll be all up inside them internet guts.

62
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,800
Speaking of crawling into other people's business, it's the news.

63
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:47,640
Clock Bishop Keith Vigna and John Lee Pettymore the fourth, in the body of John Lee Pettymore

64
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:52,140
the third, woke up in the tomb of Ari Manstein.

65
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:55,800
They had four names branded on different parts of their bodies.

66
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:01,760
On the backs Drew, on the bottom of their left foot Maggie, on the palms of their dominant

67
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:07,720
hands Tilly, and on the chests Marvin, but Marvin is crossed out.

68
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:14,120
After realizing they have the moments of the, I guess successful, raid on the glass compound,

69
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:18,980
the three former officers from contention began to understand the situation they found

70
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,200
themselves in.

71
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:25,940
Clark tried to summon another version of himself, looked a little too deep into his collective

72
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:30,800
unconsciousness and received a phone call from his former boss.

73
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,040
Taking us now to the parking lot of the city cemetery where Maggie Cook just assigned the

74
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:41,960
three dilapidated husks of humanity she once called co-workers with the task of taking

75
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,400
out Bruce Robin.

76
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:49,000
Ferguson Bean's former business partner is a personal favorite of mine and a brand new

77
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,720
single from Kudzu.

78
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,080
Y'all ain't never gonna guess what it is.

79
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,440
It's no backbone baby I fooled y'all.

80
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:25,880
I am John Lee Paddymore, doo da doo da, I am John Lee Paddymore, oh the doo da day.

81
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:29,440
We sound cool.

82
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:35,920
So you guys woke up in the tomb of Ari Manstein and then you realized like you do and you

83
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:41,460
realized that Marvin which was carved into your chest or burned into your chest rather

84
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:47,040
is crossed through with the same sort of burning all the way through which we took as a clear

85
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:52,120
indication that that was done and we have nothing to follow up on there and you didn't

86
00:06:52,120 --> 00:07:00,880
talk about it at all well and then eventually leaving the tomb you ran into the old woman

87
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:08,880
making her way out of the cemetery and she was so slow oh my god and that's when you

88
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,920
realized that you had been here before the thing that you had been debating up until

89
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:18,520
that point she had seen us run through before exactly and then you almost ruined the entire

90
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:24,960
podcast by just standing there and waiting that's not totally off the table yeah we still

91
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:30,560
might do that and I don't understand how uh pushing you to new creative heights by thinking

92
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:37,200
outside the box is ruining the podcast I say what's ruining the podcast okay okay okay

93
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:45,440
podcast strike boys our characters sit there and wait we're out and no one's allowed to

94
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:56,560
cross us Zach just hires scabs so with us this week we've got Ali Jepson playing John

95
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:02,660
Lee Pettymore he just does all the voices himself he's like finally my dream the game

96
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:08,080
will go the way I want it to go so you guys are all standing in the parking lot Maggie

97
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:14,460
Cook has joined you she has driven up into this parking lot and has given you a job to

98
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:22,720
do which is to take out or essentially murder Bruce Robin full owner of bar Corp and the

99
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:29,420
one-time business partner of Keith vigna's brother Ferguson beans she is sitting in this

100
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:36,260
car broken down crying after having a conversation with John Lee Pettymore the third who well

101
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:40,800
there's something yeah there's something I want to add to that actually that I just kind

102
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:46,540
of realized you're allowed to you know Maggie I know this is a hard time for you reckoning

103
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:52,120
with my undeath and all but I I just realized I'm doing the same thing with you what the

104
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:58,340
fuck how are you alive and as you ask that her phone starts to ring I like I put my hand

105
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:04,480
on her hand and I'm like Maggie tell me damn it she looks at the call as Clark Bishop is

106
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:10,720
walking back over to join the group after looking at his cell phone and his car there

107
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:18,120
she looks at the phone she puts it down she's like alright I John I gotta take this just

108
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:23,440
real quick and then I'll explain okay I need Joe to roll an alertness check for me real

109
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:37,400
quick I pass 18 or 70 Joe as you walk back you actually hear a second vibration so her

110
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:50,120
phone is ringing and you hear a second buzzing at a different pitch we're from from inside

111
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:57,480
her car where she's sitting in the driver's seat and then she picks up the phone Leon oh okay Lee

112
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:08,240
Leon do you trust me and do your fucking job Leon I know it's been a while but knock the dust off

113
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:15,520
your knuckles and buckle up what controls this world Leon that's right bitch it's fire and as

114
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:20,360
soon as she's done speaking she hangs up she looks at you and she's like I never died John I

115
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:31,840
had to disappear whose body was that doesn't matter she just how did you get so cool John

116
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:37,040
I've always been this cool I think you've just been too drunk to notice and then she grabs an

117
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:44,400
envelope out of her shotgun seat and she throws it to you right out the window and she looks at

118
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:52,040
you and she's like remember I'm counting on you just Maggie just because I gave you bourbon for

119
00:10:52,040 --> 00:11:04,480
Christmas doesn't mean I'm a drunk cheap shitty bourbon and then she drives off to clarify the

120
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:09,480
high-pitched buzzing that I heard she didn't acknowledge she did not got it but it sounded

121
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:14,720
just like a cell phone yes got it open that envelope so isn't that a little blur the manila

122
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:23,040
envelope has a manila folder inside labeled operation hole puncher colon bar Corp you remember the

123
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:31,960
we found that in the secret room with the Jim Cook's house in the secret room can you remind

124
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:40,000
us what we knew about it operation home I'm sorry of course we remember everything can you remind

125
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:47,920
the listeners there was a folder on the desk in that room that secret hidden room that said

126
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:53,960
operation hole puncher on the outside of it with the logo for the circle of knowledge the circle

127
00:11:53,960 --> 00:12:00,680
surrounded by six circles and inside there is a list of nonprofits charities think tanks and

128
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:09,160
universities that are quote-unquote owned by the spark or knowledge oh okay where have we heard

129
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:19,440
bar Corp before that's a Fergie and Bruce Roberts Robbins beans and Robin corporation is bar Corp one

130
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:25,160
of those that's listed under companies owned by the circle of knowledge or yes it's in that list

131
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:30,600
yes okay I found where I wrote down this in my real-life notebook and I wrote down each each

132
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:35,480
company has date slash phone that phone number next to it isn't still the case so that was a

133
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:41,600
different folder than this one this one gotcha a lot of information just about bar Corp in it

134
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:47,440
whereas the other one was just a list of companies with a name and her biome got it so inside is a

135
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:54,920
full rundown of bar Corp it's two owners Ferguson beans and Bruce Robin it's three subsidiaries

136
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:02,160
Jesus Christ ministries health and rehabilitation unlimited and the Learning Center and its annual

137
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:09,120
gross profits from the last five years which has been steadily rising last year bar Corp made just

138
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:17,680
over 850 million dollars paid zero dollars in taxes and there's an estimate that this year they

139
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:24,760
will make over two billion dollars you also see that Ferguson beans is marked as deceased his

140
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:33,400
majority share in the company was split between his wife Stacy his daughter Francis and the mill

141
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:39,000
on the other side of the city this leaves the majority in the legal document that is how it's

142
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,680
listed in the legal documents this leaves the majority ownership to Bruce Robin there are

143

Learning Center is Jesus Christ ministries in contingent Jesus Christ ministries is actually

146
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:10,000
let's see it's in the city it's the one that he showed up to at the drug deal right you could

147
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,280
tell them in character what you know about Jesus Christ ministries that's what I know right that

148
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:19,600
you'll happen a long time ago yeah for Thomas for Thomas yeah I think maybe two nights ago

149
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:36,680
yeah oh yeah I've just recently killed Jesus Christ ministries is a church camp that is outside

150
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:43,320
the city hey Jesus Christ ministries I sold some cocaine to them you so yeah you know that cocaine

151
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:49,960
we got from the yeah from from the lockers there I sold that me I sold that to a church I didn't

152
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:55,080
know it was to a church I just heard that but my associate had a good had a good connection and it

153
00:14:55,080 --> 00:15:00,760
turned out to be a very fancily dressed man well in a van that what was he wearing I remember very

154
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:07,040
very plainly the red rose pinned to his lapel Keith's face kind of drops a little bit he pulls

155
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:15,320
out his phone opens up a picture of Ferguson to him yeah that's my brother oh he was fucking

156
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:24,000
weird that makes sense so John you sold evidence cocaine to aren't we past that too I mean we've

157
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:34,920
been personally a giant ball monster like how you gonna worry about me selling a little bit of you

158
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:40,080
know contraband some good times I guess I guess we are a little past procedure but I wonder what

159
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:44,700
Fergie was doing with that did you know your brother to be a dealer I didn't really know my

160
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:49,080
brother that well towards the end anyway well he was there with a bunch of kids so maybe he was

161
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:55,840
giving it to them he had kids at the drug deal the ministry yeah he drove up in a ministry van and he

162
00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:02,800
got out with a bunch of little children's and and they they dug up the cocaine that I had buried on

163
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:11,600
my property he made the kids dig up the cocaine Keith sounds like your brother sucks he sucked

164
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:18,520
how are you doing with that you know I I made the decision what do you mean I mean I can't take it

165
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:23,600
back now I'm just trying not to think about it a lot happened in the past couple days you killed

166
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:41,480
Fergie no I can say 100% with without lying to you I didn't kill him what decision did you make

167
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:48,480
Keith I will say if it wasn't for me he'd probably still be alive but I didn't kill him if I remember

168
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,200
right Marvin Glass mentioned all this when you and I were in his office while it was flooded

169
00:16:53,520 --> 00:17:01,160
anyway I think that I know that yeah office when it flooded well yeah Keith when we were in the

170
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:06,400
office when it was all you know what we can we can talk about that later looks like we got other

171
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:11,880
stuff to focus on wait wait hold on Marvin's office flooded with you in it because the last

172
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:16,160
thing we saw was Marvin and a bunch of people bursting out of a flooded office well we had

173
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:21,760
been in the office when it was flooded and then before right after that we kind of just woke up

174
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:29,040
thrown into combat see I was a I was trying to save you and I saw your body was pressed against

175
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:34,920
a window down there and I shot it out and then all hell broke loose so what do we think happened

176
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:42,960
between then and John we were after the the room flooded I'd he Marvin grabbed a hold of me grabbed

177
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:51,320
a key showed up eventually but he he hope he opened you up he popped you open and there was

178
00:17:52,320 --> 00:18:03,240
one of those one of those little silver balls was inside of you well yeah hey boys we might all be

179
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:10,520
silver balls just so you know there could be a silver ball on you right now oh yeah I mean I'm

180
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:18,840
pretty sure I am the silver ball when my Kevin father killed my my err body my first John yeah

181
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:25,840
what happened then is that I burst out of my own spine and into his because I think I'm just a

182
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:30,600
little ball that rings that rings a bell actually because I've seen those balls rip spines out of

183
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:36,560
people before and pop themselves in the place I mean I saw that when I was looking at videos

184
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:43,920
at the glass compound I saw that happen a couple times on video so well so yeah so I'm a ball and

185
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:52,400
as you can see I have the capacity to be on the side of good are you all ball I like flex and I

186
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:59,120
show off my tight pants and I'm like hell no man have you always been ball when you were first John

187
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:05,120
was that ball did I only ever know a ball I think I was a ball you were bald in I think so why don't

188
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:09,200
you remember if you were ball you'd be a ball you know you were a ball well hey man being a ball

189
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:19,280
just feels like being you or me so you're I could be ball yeah that's what I I really don't know

190
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:25,760
who's ball and who's not but a lot of us could be ball honestly Keith vigna is just looking but in

191
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:33,680
between these two having just no almost no clue what's going well you see Keith I'm a ball I'm

192
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:39,040
just like kind of nodding my head like I think I might be ball to my ball I don't I don't know I

193
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:44,160
might be ball I don't think I'm ball I don't hold on hold on hold on hold on all right I want you

194
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,440
all just turn around and I'm gonna give you a little John Lee petty more patented neck rub and

195
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:53,800
we're gonna see if I feel anything weird in that spot of yours what if you ball me what if I don't

196
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:59,040
what if I'm not balling you ball me I promise not to follow you just let me give you a little neck

197
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:06,760
rip and then John Lee petty more gets in there and he's like god damn it's good it's firm but

198
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:14,360
sensitive it's for the first time in days your attention leaves Clark's shoulders I'm following

199
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:22,520
your muscles and your bones perfectly and it's just like fuck you feel like a dog basically a

200
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:30,440
regular John Peters the best pet of its life and after I'm done I'm like well I'm no anatomy

201
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:38,560
expert but John Lee petty more is a back rub expert and I don't see any signs of ball from

202
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:42,840
that I have no idea how that presents in the anatomy what I've seen but thank you for letting

203
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:47,400
me lay on hands it's been in the head it's been in the skull us I sinked it in you and I saw it

204
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:53,560
having a rosemary where you saw a ball and rosemary so in the office previous when things were bad

205
00:20:53,560 --> 00:21:00,960
rosemary made a move for the gun the tube gun on the desk of Marvin in his office I don't know what

206
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:06,040
her plan was but Marvin wait a minute rosemary turned against Marvin at the last minute and

207
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:11,560
Marvin flung one of those silver balls at her oh buddy I think I know why wait what happened okay

208
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:16,280
hold on what happened when he threw the silver ball crack cracked her open and took her spine

209
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:21,680
out and replaced it he threw the ball at her through the ball at her and it popped her open

210
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:27,480
like a can of soda and ripped out her spine and replaced it dang oh yeah then the ball the silver

211
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:33,000
ball now inhabiting rosemary as far as I know pulled the trigger and she disappeared did we

212
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,760
see rosemary as one of the corpses that came out of the the booth or whatever it was no no okay no

213
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:43,840
I didn't think so yeah all right so rosemary she was in love with Marvin's dog son yeah she was

214
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:49,120
trying to find his son the one who got gun by Tilly Marvin didn't really care but that's why

215
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:54,480
she wanted the gun Jermaine glass was she in one in love with the one who got evaporated to the

216
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,320
one who was turned into a fool the one who got evaporated yeah so she was trying to get that

217
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:03,840
gun to find him to get him back that's what I know about rose well I was confused at the time

218
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:08,360
and I still am about the whole business of her making a move at Marvin Marvin throwing the ball

219
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:12,440
at her like that would do like he knew it would do something but then it I don't know if it did

220
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,720
the thing he thought it was gonna do like she pulled the trigger either way based on all those

221
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:21,800
videos I saw Marvin knew what those balls would do Marvin does know what those balls would do and I

222
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:28,480
think he's creating or controlling them in some capacity when I was playing at juggernaut I mean

223
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:39,800
I became that from being a ball I rolled into into him and well what John Lee Pennymore sighs

224
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:49,760
a sweet nostalgic sigh he's back in his in a human body but he feels like he should be in a gigantic

225
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:58,080
metal sphere I was gonna call for a sanity check but it doesn't seem to fit your wistful not not

226
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:05,680
upset well guys I know that we just I know we just got tasked to kill Robin but before we do you do

227
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:10,200
you think he might know something about this oh I mean well yeah who knows we should definitely

228
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:16,520
interrogate anybody before we murder them but I so far I haven't seen any reason not to trust Maggie

229
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:20,320
not to murder again I mean I have but I she kind of she kind of addressed it well do you think we

230
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:25,720
should go to his house or to the wood to talk to bark or I'd lean toward going to his house

231
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:30,040
and just seeing what kind of personal files he's got do you have his number or maybe like that is

232
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:40,680
mom's number his mom is dead oh and don't ask me how I know that how do you know that I killed her

233
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:48,840
we'll get to that later what no I yeah I didn't kill my brother I you know what I'll just tell

234
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:54,760
you the story I convinced her to kill my brother and then I killed her so she couldn't tell on me

235
00:23:54,760 --> 00:24:01,760
hold and there you have it let's let's let's you know what we'll cop we'll get to that no way

236
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:07,960
probably never again let's just never talk about it all cops are bastards me too I don't really

237
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:14,160
identify as a cop anymore really but uh what what why did you by proxy kill your brother

238
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:25,520
for money which I never ended up seeing you know the more I think about it the more I'm glad we

239
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:31,600
aren't cops anymore fellas you've all done some pretty you want to go sleep we can still use our

240
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:39,080
investigative skills sell some drugs that I found in the course of an investigation that's to a man

241
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:45,600
with children that is routine cop work I think a lot of drug dealers have kids they don't employ

242
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:55,440
a lot of kids I think a lot of drug dealers are kids you guys want to go sneak around his

243
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:01,120
house and see what we can find yeah I think we should do his house it's insert time here

244
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:08,360
he's probably not at home it's roughly 2 p.m. on December 6th which is a Saturday I guess

245
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:12,880
fuck he could be home or he's out partying I mean if it's home that's I mean it's a little early

246
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:18,000
honestly 2 p.m. at a Saturday is exactly when he would be home that's it that's fine though I mean

247
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:25,960
let's go it's yeah yeah we also our police still kind of we have badges I never left I've always

248
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:31,160
considered myself a cop of contention well let's go whether I be drug dealer or a giant metal ball

249
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:36,240
man I've been looking out for the people back home does he live in the city or yeah you're in

250
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,800
the city now boys does he live here she lives downtown perfect we don't have jurisdiction so

251
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:48,760
we can obviously commit an extra judicial killing without any paperwork yeah well at least less

252
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:57,920
paperwork I mean for us I mean let's go see what we could find out then yeah some smug city cop

253
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:03,280
looking down on the small town fuzz you guys want to take my car the only one they're hopping I get

254
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:12,560
in you hop into Clark's silver Honda Accord Honda make your dreams drive is this the Accord sport

255
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:18,960
it's a exhale II exactly Maggie gave it to me I don't know what we're in here and you guys take

256
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:26,480
off downtown to a two-story brownstone in the city when you arrive you find parking decently nearby

257
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:31,800
actually go ahead and roll for parking no I don't give a shit so you guys show up well I crit failed

258
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:39,840
and you find the number on the door is 218 but probably more important than that is that there

259
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:47,400
is police tape over the door are there any cars in the park the driveway not a driveway no driveway

260
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:54,160
for this brownstone here is it a home like a row or a large brick row house well there's other ones

261
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:58,960
that look just like it on the other side and it's really nice it's like a very very nice street that

262
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:04,280
you're on there's a park across the street well if I learned anything as a cop it's that this do

263
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:11,120
not cross tape is not very strong and I rip it and I think if you'd learned anything it as a cop

264
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:16,920
it's that do not cross does not apply to you that's true and I jiggle the handle of the door

265
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:24,960
I kind of put the tape back so no one follows this you like tie it together yeah yeah title

266
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:35,920
not in it good as new is the door unlocked ha the door is unlocked nice I rolled an 88 for the

267
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:43,120
yeah who was there last to remember to lock the door yeah I walk on it was a real kid's a big

268
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:53,200
night surprise yourself with that role you're like of course not why would it be unlocked yeah when

269
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:58,560
you guys walk in the stench is the first thing you notice like a dead body would any of you have

270
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:04,000
been in a heroin den working in the contention PD probably not in contention probably not like

271
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,360
you do you know what it smells like I know what a meth house smells like I've been in one of those

272
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:15,400
and it's bad it's like poop and cigarettes it smells like poop and cigarettes and heroin hmm

273
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:22,280
it is a fucking wreck there's trash everywhere most of the furnishings that should be here are

274
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:28,720
gone there's like pallets made all over the place but there's actual human fecal matter just like

275
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:34,040
strewn about seems that people were like stepping in it and tracking it all around the place smells

276
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:42,040
like piss spray-painted on one of the walls Heisenberg is eight one one eight one eight nine

277
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:51,680
five two zero one three one one eight one one one nine got it did you really I started writing

278
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:57,400
about midway I'd lost it does that have any significance to us it's on the wall is that

279
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:07,560
we said spray-painted roll again for me signals intelligence I have a zero so no don't roll

280
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:13,760
signals for me so no none of you would be able to I'm gonna put anything together I'm gonna take a

281
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:24,960
picture of it so we have it for later nice so what is it eight one etc etc and go ahead in first just

282
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,920
tell me what you guys are doing when you are in here like I'm just looking around for anything

283
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:34,400
that isn't just gross anything that sticks out that's not you know drugged in ask Clark is

284
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:41,640
saying hello you hear nothing except for your partners rifling through all this shit it seems

285
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:49,280
that everything that would have been in a place this nice is long gone drawers have been pulled

286
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:56,480
out of cabinets and doors are open everywhere everything is just strewn about and everything

287
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:02,360
that was once clean is no longer or not here anymore since this is such a nice place are there

288
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:12,320
any security cameras around in the house roll luck of fail no not a crit fail just to fail okay

289
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:18,560
I'd like to run up to the next floor and see if it's as decrepit and heroin II and shitty when you

290
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:24,320
get up to the second floor the hair on the back of your neck stands up and I roll an alertness

291
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:33,800
or a search you can roll search for me 19 and as your grit fail okay as you're walking through

292
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:42,400
the hallway you see there's a few rooms up here in a bathroom and there's just this heavy presence

293
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:50,240
that you've never felt before and carved into the walls in this room that is maybe had been

294
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:56,240
an office at one point in time is the same set of numbers that you saw spray-painted downstairs

295
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:04,960
eight one one eight one eight nine five two zero one three one one eight one one one nine and it

296
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:13,080
is carved over and over and over on everything in here using a simple substitution cipher with

297
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:19,000
you know one equaling a and so on do I get any new words out of this do I take a break and give

298
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:35,640
it a go fuck no just tell me yes but just I mean it's like ha ha ha ha no okay obviously that

299
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:41,160
wouldn't so I actually I'd be down to spend a few minutes looking at it I don't know we might find

300
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:45,880
fun stuff off mic though but we can bring it back I don't know take a hot piss and let's see if we

301
00:31:45,880 --> 00:32:06,040
can figure it out off mic so did you guys figure it out yeah it's pretty obvious yeah I mean it's

302
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:10,400
it's very elementary once you get right into it so we can probably just breeze through that

303
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:19,200
listeners have it by now anything else in this room besides carvings on the wall besides the

304
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:26,640
obvious thing the painful easy cipher the really easy one that we figured out for sure no are there

305
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,480
any like closets or doors or anything did he leave a note saying where he went some of the

306
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:36,520
doors have even been taken off and the closet doors are all open and it's the same situation

307
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:43,080
and garbage yeah can I look in the bedroom and tell I don't know if it looks like it's been used

308
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:48,120
recently I'm trying to get a gauge of how long it's been like in this state it looks like what

309
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:53,080
could be like the master bedroom or at least the bedroom one of the bedrooms upstairs that's large

310
00:32:53,080 --> 00:33:01,560
and has a bathroom attached the bed is gone the bed frame is gone and there are pallets all over

311
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:05,720
the place like there have been like 20 people sleeping right here can I look in the fridge

312
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:12,800
or the kitchen see what I glean from the kitchen when you go through the fridge it is sparse there

313
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:21,160
is like some rotten food but then there's also like some takeout a lot of like fast food that's

314
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:27,320
been like half eaten and stuff I want to call the city PD not like the normal number but like the

315
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:32,360
fellow cop number sure calling an office and basically I want to say like yeah this is John

316
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:38,360
Lee Pettymore out of contention we got a case about a drifter who might have committed some

317
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:42,760
property crimes down here and we might have tracked him to a drug hideout up there in the

318
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:48,760
city y'all had some police tape up around it so we didn't go inside but I was of course wondering

319
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:54,360
whatever information you had on that if you could get it to me about who was living there how long

320
00:33:54,360 --> 00:34:00,360
it had been in that state as a drug squat whether or not the owner of the residence was participating

321
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:10,600
in in that squat oh yeah sure oh that's 501 east fake street so it's 218 is the address okay and

322
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:15,800
I said it wasn't as important as the police tape over the door that doesn't mean it's not important

323
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:25,320
oh 218 yeah that's Bruce Robin's home and uh he dipped out of there a few days ago seemingly and

324
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:32,280
we questioned some of the neighbors and they said that he was going absolutely crazy he was not

325
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:38,760
acting like himself and he was uh had just people coming in at all time of the day and night and

326
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:46,200
just inviting them all in and and then he just disappeared probably two days ago and they haven't

327
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:51,000
seen him since so the squat was was established already there were there were all kinds of

328
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:56,920
unstable characters coming around while Mr. Robin was still in residence seemingly for a short

329
00:34:56,920 --> 00:35:03,320
amount of time but I you don't want to go in there it is absolutely disgusting they did a number on

330
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:09,240
that place in such a short amount of time I mean it was truly horrific stuff did y'all have any

331
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:15,720
leads uh about where Mr. Robin went we might want to interview him about our subject honestly you

332
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:21,640
know he's a high profile member of the community and we're just kind of putting it on the back

333
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:28,440
burner I understand uh you know cops exist to protect the capitalist superstructure under which

334
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:35,800
we we uh we serve so that's you're doing your job we looked into it and his mother died recently

335
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:43,240
and uh she hey now that's the lead his business partner is also dead oh god tragic so he seems

336
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:48,360
to have been going through some stuff and if you know mental illness is a serious issue here in

337
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:54,840
the city and really all over the world and no no no I mean not in contention we just uh we just uh

338
00:35:54,840 --> 00:36:00,760
if you're not acting normal you know we either send you to a lot of church or we make you feel

339
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:07,800
alienated until you just leave or kill yourself it's the it's the small town way jesus christ

340
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:12,280
yeah his voice changes and he says jesus christ

341
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:17,800
keith can only hear one side of this conversation I'm like what the fuck

342
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:24,440
I was just like I'm just telling them about small town life well well shit but what's

343
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:29,640
our next step we came real close to doing it to you when you first came to the department I tell you

344
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:38,600
would you have sent keith vigna to church or would you have alienated him we tried to send the

345
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:44,680
boy to church we tried he didn't seem to get along too well with the pastor no one saw him show up

346
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:51,560
yeah I did like uh the all-you-can-eat buffets they had yeah I remember how you took advantage

347
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:57,400
of the lord's hospitality we got to find this guy he's obviously not here should we I mean go

348
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:01,960
to bar corp do you fellas think it's worth talking to the neighbors ourselves I was thinking about it

349
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:10,040
but if I mean since we're here I guess roll search whoever has the best search roll search for me I

350
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:19,160
ain't got it I got the baseline 20 I've got a 50 yeah yeah I have 40 so 76 all right yeah then uh

351
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:24,120
making a final pass through the home favorite uh you accidentally step in a pile of piss

352
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:32,200
you know how piss piles it's a huge stack of piss watch out for that stack of piss

353
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:41,080
hot piss no it's cold it's coagulated at this point gross it's not so uh I guess do you want

354
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:44,760
to go knock on a neighbor's door or are you Phil is thinking what I'm thinking as far as

355
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:51,480
what are you what do you think well we know about a bunch of people being destitute that's kind of

356
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:55,640
a thing we learned oh yeah we learned that Kathy was kind of running homeless people around at

357
00:37:55,640 --> 00:38:01,080
various folks yeah but they weren't so much the heroin living their own shit kind of destitute

358
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:05,160
was it well they didn't smell good I think that was one thing that Keith confirmed for I mean I

359
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:09,560
was on a bus full of four of them and but you're right they weren't necessarily it was not a good

360
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:15,160
smell they weren't necessarily drug does Keith remember the smell does Keith recognize the smell

361
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:19,800
of the bus yeah could any of them have come out of the squat or is it into smell is one of the

362
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:27,640
strongest uh you know memory senses Keith vigna give me a smell roll you've been doing a fair

363
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:35,960
amount of cocaine the past few days give me a luck roll I got a six oh no a nine but still

364
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:43,240
that's lower than what my luck is this is a different smell okay I do one last big breath

365
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:49,640
in I'm like definitely not the bus uh homeless bus smell I trust your smells hey y'all I mean

366
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:54,680
why don't we just call him call robin call robin you could be like do we have his phone number in

367
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:59,560
that envelope you would have his direct number yeah it's not a bad idea Keith could call him

368
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:03,880
just checking in about his brother yeah as far as you know you don't know anything or and wanting

369
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:10,840
to commiserate about the mother yeah he lost his mother Keith lost his brother uh yeah have you met

370
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:16,760
robin no I haven't but uh you know we're both aware of each other you know I'd give him a call

371
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:21,400
you would hope a call from a good Samaritan a time of need would you both have something to relate to

372
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:26,120
it it could play yeah I give it I'll ring him you want to put that on speakerphone for us I do

373
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:33,080
obviously after we step out of this hell hole okay so back in the car I assume sure are you

374
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:37,080
guys just standing on the street should we walk around the block before we get back in the car

375
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:43,400
get the smell off just because of the smell oh yeah I thought you meant for more investigating

376
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:48,440
which is also an idea talk to the neighbors but uh I mean let's make the call in the privacy of

377
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:53,800
the car but we don't have to leave beep boop boop as you guys are walking back to the car

378
00:39:53,800 --> 00:40:00,200
just a reminder of what the city looks like flowers everywhere oh yeah it's different than

379
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:07,640
contention uh the filter sickly green on the coloration yeah sickly green tint with heavy

380
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:13,640
grays the streets are covered in trash and spilled liquids and there's a scent in the air like

381
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:19,160
someone left out cheese and a colostomy bag on every corner the faces of the buildings are

382
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:25,960
slathered in billboards and the faces of the people bumbling about are bloated and lifeless

383
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:32,440
in a strange opposition to all this depressive scenery there are beautiful flowers in every shade

384
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:38,200
and shape growing in every otherwise empty alleyway and out of many cracks in the sidewalks

385
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:44,040
and roads I want to find the most lifeless looking person passing and I want to tap them

386
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:51,000
on the shoulder sorry why are you so pallid and corpse lack oh work's been pretty hard recently

387
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:56,200
I guess where do you work the corp uh bar corp yeah they gave us some days off though which is

388
00:40:56,200 --> 00:41:01,640
nice so I think I've got a little bit more color to my cheeks than I did recently oh they're

389
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:07,240
positively rosy they're paying us time and a half to take like two weeks off two weeks off for a

390
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:12,920
whole massive corporation like that yeah it's crazy right why I don't know something about the

391
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:20,840
new takeover uh our new CEO Bruce Robin he's uh he's doing like some cool stuff he's like trying

392
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:27,000
to renovate everything apparently he's gonna make everyone have livable wage and benefits that are

393
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:33,320
realistically priced for all workers uh I guess we're getting better hours and yeah he's renovating

394
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:38,920
all the facilities to be up to code so we're all getting paid during the time off time and a half

395
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:43,720
but we could actually get even more if we help with the renovations do you know where he's

396
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:48,600
overseeing these renovations no I think he's just at the office but that's just an assumption he

397
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:53,720

433
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:50,000
Ferguson and she is old it sounds like so she doesn't remember what Ferguson sounds like he's

434
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:59,440
my brother we sound very similar I'm whip-crack smart and you sound like an idiot now is this

435
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:10,400
some sort of prank on Bruce tell the DM what's going on I try what I really liked was when we

436
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:16,080
played with a different DM this past weekend who was not Zach and you tried and he was just like

437
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:26,520
I hang up I hang up I'm like damn I thought that would definitely work

438
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:33,400
Winifred Worth is good at her job she fucking keeps it locked down we found out where Bruce

439
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:38,280
is I mean he's there right now we could I mean once we get up to the 17th floor and bust in with

440
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:43,520
some fucking cop uniforms on you know some yeah some uh she doesn't know what I look like breakers

441
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:47,680
with some initials on the back yeah if we just go up there it's just police business I mean there's

442
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:52,600
no reason they can't stop yeah I mean I would like to see Winifred Worth try to stop us after

443
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:56,920
hearing that phone call on speaker we were just talking to that fella and it sounds like Bruce

444
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:02,440
is maybe doing some good for this city as well that's what they told the workers that's true

445
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:08,880
maybe things has changed nothing going on in this city that was good so I'll believe it when I see

446
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:13,760
it but I say we go try to confront him see what we can get out of him then his business partner

447
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:18,280
was a man who bought cocaine in a van full of children how do we think that Robin is any better

448
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:23,080
but according to this guy it's because he's now CEO he said a bunch of changes were coming and

449
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:28,760
that they were positive all I mean is that he's the kind of guy who got into business with Ferguson

450
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:34,200
in the first place and is his heart that full of gold and someone that we trust wants us to kill

451
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:40,800
him yeah you're right we gotta I say we go I say we go I mean we go talk to him if we if we find

452
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:45,240
out some better information we could change her mind but I trust her that she's telling us these

453
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:50,040
things will stop this thing so I'm gonna do these things to stop the thing I don't know yeah I don't

454
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:55,160
know if I do trust this new well it was pretty cool I'll she faked her own death that was right

455
00:47:55,160 --> 00:48:00,440
I mean I said earlier if you if you trust her I trust you not to mention the circle of knowledge

456
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:06,560
is what I've gleaned so far has been around for a while and seems to have been doing good being

457
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:12,560
keeping keeping with this awful thing was at bay let's go talk to Bruce just get some info yeah

458
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:15,680
maybe find out what other stuff the circle in the lodge has been up to

459
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:40,000
the only one trying to
