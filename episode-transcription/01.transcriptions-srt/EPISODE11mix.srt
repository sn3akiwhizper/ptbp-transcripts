24
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:06,640
me and what are the two of you guys doing oh i i had a backup gun right i i got a walkie-talkie

25
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:13,040
gun and everything back is that correct what gun did you grab because you lost your small powerful

26
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:19,120
gun i did wait i thought i just had my regular pistol gun my my that's a madman with a noisy

27
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,960
cricket well it's a small extremely powerful that's the one he stole i thought he just stole

28
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:31,440
like my i would assume that you always had that on you oh see i wasn't assuming that as well as

29
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,520
your police firearm i thought the yeah so you still look for it though like i feel like you'd

30
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:40,880
go for the surface revolver so he has both of my okay how about this not i don't i thought that

31
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:46,240
that gun was still in like lock up you can leave it in lock up and he just stole your police side

32
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:51,440
okay well so then i guess i have that gun on me because it was the only other pistol that i could

33
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:56,480
get so i have that yeah i didn't think we were fucking with our crazy shit yet more than welcome

lady uh only rolled a one on damage however so keith you look away for like

64
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:45,040
half a second and all of a sudden there's a knife sticking in your um arm just like right

65
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:51,760
just like on your forearm like a how big of a knife it's a it's a small knife about six inches

66
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:57,120
long and sticking all the like all the way through my arm or what no it actually just

67
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,680
like under the skin yeah it didn't it didn't get in very deep it kind of went in at a weird angle

68
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:08,320
uh so it didn't mess with any tendons or anything hell yeah uh but you do take one damage okay i did

69
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:13,920
already i look down at it and i look up at her in the moments between or not between but as soon as

70
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:21,360
the knife is in his arm sure i've registered as such yeah what is she doing so she immediately

71
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:28,960
is reaching back under and throws another at clark bishop okay so how are you handling

72
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:34,720
that situation there's a knife being thrown at you currently i had the gun pulled i want to just fire

73
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:40,960
okay sounds good can i can i try to uh you can't grab the knife out of the air there's no one in

74
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:49,680
this town no this is fucking america like i'm gonna get lit the fuck up are you going for a

75
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:57,760
kill shot or purpose i mean i'm not but it might happen you can try to avoid a kill shot at an at

76
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:02,800
a penalty you can aim for a specific uh you know like a called shot is that the one yeah it's a

77
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:08,720
called shot so you would take a negative 20 on your firearms check to do less damage what is

78
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,440
that's what i want to do so my firearms is normally 80 so i'm rolling at a 60 right now correct

79
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:23,120
i pass crit pass crit pass ones just a single one yeah dude these are new these are different

80
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:29,440

81
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,880

82
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:38,560
under the pillow with that's perfect literally uh as she starts to fling an object you shoot her in

83
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:47,920
the hand and the knife just drops onto the bed next to her and she is going to uh roll over

84
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:53,840
off to the left side of the bed and john it is your turn what do you do you heard a uh gunshot

85
00:09:53,840 --> 00:10:00,720
just now uh yeah i just like i slide in on my knees between keith and clark through the door

86
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,440
and i've just got my drunk gone drawn gone got my gun drawn

87
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:13,760
are you just gonna make us kill everybody like i've set up i've set up characters in specific

88
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:19,760
locations doing specific things why do they all attack cops this is america like we have to shoot

89
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:28,800
them you don't have to but you do i mean you can do it however you want however some of these

90
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:35,440
people are extremely aggressive and have things that they need to do i guess they don't think much

91
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,960
of the contention after i take my shot can i just say i winged her so that you know that i've at

92
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:46,400
least got her i mean like yeah i slide through the door and i'm like don't you move a fucking muscle

93
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:52,800
okay cool does she move a muscle she doesn't you can see the top of her head like she's on the far

94
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,040
side of the bed but you can see the top of her head peeking over hands in the air right fucking

95
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:02,400
now slowly raise your hands she slowly raises her hands in the air is there anything in them

96
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:10,320
yeah there's a lead pipe in one of her hands drop the pipe fonzie okay

97
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:17,760
she does not drop the pipe and keith it's your turn i pull the knife out of my hand or out of

98
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,840
my arm try to stab her in the arm with it to make her drop the pipe

99
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:28,880
so you've got a gun and she's got a pipe but i got a real powerful gun i don't not trying to

100
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:36,640
unleash this shit yet i'm doing it she i'm she's facing away from us right i would say based on

101
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:43,280
where you are in the room because i picture you kind of where the tv is and then she is to like

102
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:48,560
if you walked in the room the bed's on the left tv's right in front of you facing to the left

103
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:54,560
tv's right in front of you facing to the left and she's on the other side of the bed and you're

104
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:59,200
standing there so you can kind of see her at a side angle yeah i want to try to like slice at her

105
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:04,480
hand that's holding the pipe and then like pin her down on the ground okay go ahead and roll melee

106
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:16,160
i do not pass yeah she crit succeeds so as you swipe with a knife she immediately

107
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:23,520
like uses your momentum against you and holds the knife to your throat and she's got you hostage

108
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:32,960
and so it is clark's turn uh help me ma'am ma'am hey whoa hey don't do it uh hey don't do it i'll

109
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:39,600
fucking kill him uh we uh we're just here uh to ask you questions and you started slinging knives

110
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:45,440
at us i mean he pulled his gun oh i think he was thinking about pulling his gun because you

111
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:51,920
weren't talking i don't like him nobody really does uh unfortunately we're partial to him so

112
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:58,560
i need you to let him go and then can i roll a persuade on just that yeah absolutely i mean

113
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:04,320
it's gonna be very hard to get her to just let him go but okay sure roll persuade

114
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:16,000
oh what the fuck awesome i watched it happen with my eyes just rolled an ott one i rolled a one

115
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,320
again how many ones have you rolled i was about to say through this campaign i've done it a bunch

116
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:25,120
it's and i'm using different dice every time i promise have you done a bunch i have that's the

117
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:31,200
fourth at least the fourth yeah and two of them have been going back to back that's shots that's

118
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,240
that's the note right there wait what are you trying oh you're persuading i was just trying

119
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:43,760
to get her to let you go without doing anything else how about this i won't i'm sorry i won't

120
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:50,960
kill him and i'll let him go if you let me go tell the tell her that's okay tell her that's

121
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:57,520
okay come on do you know what happens when a one is rolled you're in no position to negotiate i

122
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:03,040
mean if you want to ari like i i just don't see literally any possible way that she's just going

123
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,800
to be like after hurting a police after like hurting a police officer that she's just going

124
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:13,120
to let him go and be like yeah have me well but then what does a one get you she's willing to

125
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:19,120
slice keith's throat currently so makes her stop i would why what but there's no way we're letting

126
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:24,080
her go sure that makes sense to her though i mean that's easy to do but then we're just fighting her

127
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:28,720
again but without keith being right there yeah i think this woman would have been dead from the

128
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:33,600
second she fucking threw a knife in your arm at this point she doesn't seem to have like a firearm

129
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,800
and we are at the entrance to the motel so we could just like let her go and then just i mean

130
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:44,160
what is she's not gonna escape ma'am uh we're amiable for that can we just ask you a question

131
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:51,520
or two before you go i will allow that as she motions the two of you into the corner opposite

132
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:56,240
from the door she's wanting to scoot towards the door with keith all right we got the key

133
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:02,560
to this place from a guy that we know to be charles do you know charles the tall guy yeah

134
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,320
yeah how do you know we work together

135
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,320
do you know who you're fucking with

136
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:23,600
no you should probably get more information because you are going to regret this

137
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:36,000
can you point me in a direction do the words marvin glass mean anything around these parts

138
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:46,080
now out of character you guys know marvin glass is the mob dude in the city he runs the city

139
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:53,680
of course i know marvin glass then you know

140
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:58,960
no no

141
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,080
coughs and cuts

142
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:16,080
then you know that you probably don't want to be on his bad side right now you're on the

143
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:21,760
contention pd's bad side you know what i'm fucking tired it's been a long ass day and your buddy

144
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:27,520
charles got his head blown off by me where the fuck is his radio the radio

145
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,320
sorry the radio that all sounds like you

146
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,480
she's having like a breakdown

147
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:44,960
you just want the radio oh no we actually want quite a bit more but god damn you are not being

148
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:50,640
very forthcoming we got guns on you we don't really even like vigna like well that's uh

149
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:57,120
she wants to be in the doorway with vigna and she wants you two to be over by the bathroom in this

150
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:02,640
motel room are you gonna do that i'm not i think i probably am all right so john what are you doing

151
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:09,920
she's got a knife to his throat yeah i don't know man john yeah john like john will scoot

152
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:14,320
but he's pissed that makes sense mostly mostly at vigna

153
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:22,000
first i'm like sweating bullets right now i've i am not confident that she's not gonna still

154
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:28,880
kill me i mean if all you want's the radio it's in the bathroom how does it work i don't know

155
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:34,480
you probably turn it on turn it to the station you want why did you want it i don't know charles

156
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,480
brought it back he said don't touch it it's in the bathroom i didn't know it was a big fucking deal

157
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:45,440
why did marvin send you here oh i mean marvin marvin sent us here to find out what happened

158
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:52,720
to his son who's his son well i mean germane glass him and i mean him and alfred came to collect some

159
00:17:52,720 --> 00:18:00,400
money from john peters and then you know only alfred came back and he's a blubbering idiot

160
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,880
now so what do you mean now he won't shut up about some gun

161
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:15,760
i don't know what gun some uh he i i don't know that he sounded like a lunatic but marvin sent us

162
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:21,040
out here to find it find uh find germane this is hilarious to me because now it's you who has

163
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:28,560
no idea what the fuck you're dealing with if you had any idea how long our day has been the shit

164
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:34,160
we've been through the things we've seen marvin glass you think we give a shit

165
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:41,280
about the crime lord from the city contention is in some real shit right now you're in some

166
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:46,160
real shit too because you had to be banging around with that charles guy i don't know what your man

167
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,960
got into sounds like he stumbled into what we're into but this is a lot bigger than some crime

168
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:56,240
bosses so why don't you fucking let keith go and come with us and answer some questions and we

169
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:02,800
might be able to protect you from what that's what we're trying to figure out that radio turned a man

170
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:10,160
into a cat bullshit that gun turned your buddy and alfred into an idiot that makes sense right

171
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:18,960
ma'am uh the gun can do that so can a radio he's uh he's telling you the truth we've seen some shit

172
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:26,240
today and marvin is not even ranking on the list right now do you know billy harrison no charles

173
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:31,280
had him in the trunk of his car i don't know a billy hairs i literally okay you're you want to

174
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:39,760
know the deal i'm good at killing it's what i do and i get brought along to kill if it's necessary

175
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:45,840
i like you're stopping me from watching my happy days and i just want to watch my happy days

176
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:51,840
so i i don't want to get caught up in all this i just want to go back home and

177
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,440
where's charl where's charles do you did you arrest him i shot him in the fucking head with

178
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:05,520
a shotgun was he a good killer because he fucking died pretty well oh my god okay so here's what's

179
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:15,280
gonna happen i need everyone to roll dexterity i got a 14 on a 60 i got a 7 on a 65 i got a 73 on

180
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:22,320
a 60 i failed fail and then you guys both succeeded and what were your numbers 14

181
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:30,720
seven okay she rolled a 26 so she gets to go first and then 14 and then keith vigno wait

182
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:36,400
she gets to go first correct she she rolled higher higher under how we always played i know

183
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:43,360
like that i would have known to roll higher oh i'm so sorry i told you it makes it so that if

184
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:49,040
she has a higher pool she can still be you that makes sense yeah that does make sense okay sick

185
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:55,200
so uh she's gonna take the first action she's going to do the classic hostage move where she

186
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:02,480
just pushes the person that she has and then she's gonna she's running yeah so she dips and

187
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:07,760
it is keith next wait the dexterity rolls were like initiative i was thinking that it was our

188
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:12,880
chance of getting away from her normally whoever has the highest dexterity goes first but i thought

189
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,840
since it was such a tense moment that we'd add a little roll in there on our dexterity's to uh

190
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:22,240
make it a little bit more playful uh because she has a higher higher dexterity than you guys do

191
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:31,680
so what's her dex 80 oh that's very hot so she pushes keith and then turns around and jumps over

192
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:37,680
the railing keith what do you do i run outside look over the railing and how far away is she

193
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:43,600
she hit the ground and is gonna start running i'm gonna do called shot shooter in the like leg okay

194
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:50,720
uh go ahead and roll at a negative 20 shit fail all right so keith pops off a couple rounds

195
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,880
john it is your turn uh yeah i mean i'm running to the balcony i'm shooting at her too

196
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:06,880
62 on a 60 all right and she's going to continue running clark what are you doing i'm running out

197
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:12,720
and taking a shot as well so she is across she's like halfway across the parking lot at this point

198
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:19,040
and is heading to a maroon car in the parking lot roll firearms are you just i'm just shooting

199
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:30,480
at her just shooting trying to hit her all right uh crit pass 66 on an 80. i'm good at shooting

200
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:35,120
boys yeah you're very good at shooting i'm a shooter boy go ahead and roll 2d 10 for me

201
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:44,080
eight intense 18 is zero zero and eight yeah yeah 18 that's 18 so

202
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:55,120
you fire and like i'm thinking probably three shots hit her center mass and she is i mean blood

203
00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:02,320
just splatters not only like onto the ground but also uh onto the car that she was like running

204
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:10,240
toward and she she passes her constitution check to stay conscious and she starts trying to get

205
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,880
into this car like we're right by the stairs right i mean yeah just imagine yeah i run down

206
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:19,840
the stairs and i go like try to go up to her can i do anything else or you can just get to her

207
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:24,800
yeah okay i get to her then yeah before he gets to her i'm gonna shoot her again okay

208
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:32,800
fail 82 on a 16 pop off a couple more rounds in the general direction clark what are you doing

209
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:40,480
i'm following keith okay she gets the door open um she's bleeding just like everywhere and

210
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:45,760
she's crawling up into the driver's side yeah that's all she can do this round keith what are

211
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:50,080
you doing i get to her and i start she doesn't have a weapon or anything with her does she i

212
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:58,080
mean i think she has your knife or her knife that she threw yeah yeah do i see it in her hand yeah

213
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:05,120
all right i want to try to if i like punch her in the face that's melee right if you're unarmed

214
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,600
you're it's unarmed if you had a weapon i mean she's got three bullets in the center of her

215
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:14,080
chest are we still in combat with her like what can she do with a knife fucking nothing try to

216
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:19,520
stab me well yeah i feel like you can very much just lift her the fuck up and if she tries i just

217
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:25,600
want to like if so is she sitting in the driver's seat she's crawling she's like well she's crawling

218
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:30,160
up into the driver's seat currently with the door open she's got like one hand on the door and just

219
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:34,000
one knife in her hand just like can i come up behind keith and just kick her hand with the

220
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,960
knife yeah i was gonna think yeah if you do that and then i was gonna do first aid on her to try

221
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:43,520
to keep her alive just to be able to get any more info out of her yeah i don't want to kill her yet

222
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:48,640
if we don't have to oh yeah my intent in kicking her hand knife free was for you to start cuffing

223
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:53,280
her but yeah we'll cuff her and then first aid yeah you guys can do that like no problem

224
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:57,760
cool cool so i have her cuffed and then i want to immediately start administering first aid to help

225
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:03,200
or not bleed out or at least have her stay alive longer than okay go ahead and roll first aid 47

226
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:10,880
on a 60 nice so you find um something to wrap you know or like put pressure on the wounds um all

263
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:09,680

264
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:15,040
i do want to send lauren to keep an eye on this perp at the hospital perfect is that l-a-u or

265
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:24,880
l-o-r-e yeah is it lauren lauren lauren it's lauren lauren lauren is it a boy or girl l-a-u-r-e-n

266
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,440
she identifies as a woman dope is she hot

267
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:39,760
idiot i'm sorry guys i am just i've had an off day you know an off well an off career so far

268
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:46,240
for future reference if a woman slings a knife at you you're an officer of the law you can shoot

269
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:51,280
her yeah but yeah and if then she then is just like peacefully like you know she surrendered

270
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:56,400
she was still holding a pipe though i don't know why you would close that distance well

271
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:02,320
because i am trying to get the most information i can out of these people i you know at the end

272
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:08,080
of the day it would be great to take down the mob in the city be known for that you know and

273
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:14,160
mob is like an oozy blackness spreading across decent society right we got one of

274
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:18,880
those in contention right now that's an actual oozy blackness spreading across

275
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,800
decent life forms you know what i mean like so do you want me to go

276
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:30,800
kill her is that what you're telling me to do i'm kind of confused here i mean i want to be you

277
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:35,440
guys are better cops than i am and i want to be a better cop so if you need me to just go kill her

278
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,680
that's going to make me a better cop and didn't just tell me to do it we're not saying kill her

279
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:45,360
now we're saying you probably could have killed her then but she's totally within your or at least

280
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:50,000
winged her i mean but guess what i'm alive and she's alive and we can get information i don't

281
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,600
see the downside of this right here she's barely alive let's yeah but barely alive is still

282
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:01,200
technically alive we did seem to come out ahead on this one you are correct okay so the next

283
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:09,200
perp i'll just kill him no well got it if they intend harm upon you keith go ahead and kill him

284
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:13,120
i assume that every criminal wants to intend harm upon a police officer because that's

285
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:18,720
criminals favorite crime right nothing i'm gonna have to maybe read up on this i don't

286
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:27,200
a little a little confused here did you go to the academy yeah in the city i did yeah they taught

287
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:32,000
me they taught me more up there than they taught you what year did you graduate i oh that's never

288
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:41,280
mind that sorry too too personal too personal i forgot years don't exist we don't ask those

289
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:44,880
kind of questions i'm just trying to i'm just trying to figure out that's yeah hr would be on

290
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:51,280
my ass if i knew well i try not to kill anybody but i guess i'll make it more of a make more of

291
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:57,680
an effort to kill then no it's again it's not about merely killing like so make them make them

292
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:03,600
make them suffer maybe just be a little safer okay keith we're not telling you to make people

293
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:09,920
suffer we're not telling you to kill people make them suffer but but do if i have maybe don't let

294
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:14,960
them try to kill you or make you suffer right that's what we're golden rule i'll do some more

295
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:20,240
research on how to act like a proper police officer and we'll get back to you in the meantime

296
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:25,680
keith you ever played a video game do you like video game guy particularly john peters was is

297
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:30,800
that what you're talking about that's probably what i was thinking of but you know when you've

298
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:37,440
when you got your melee class and your ranged class it's generally not advised for the range

299
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:43,920
class to try to close the distance and engage the melee class you know in their wheelhouse that's

300
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:48,080
kind of what happened with that lady in the pipe and you and the knife keith nods his head and

301
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:55,040
acts like he knows what you're talking about all right fellas uh she was talking about a gun that

302
00:32:55,040 --> 00:33:01,520
screwed up i think she said alford yeah made him made him an idiot well there was that girl back at

303
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:06,480
mildred mitchell's house who she had a gun she had a gun that she shot at me and then disafucking

304
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:11,840
peered and boy i tell you what i'd be talking about that for a while also hmm maybe we should

305
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:16,080
they said alford did come back though right alford did come yeah alford yeah maybe we should be

306
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:20,960
talking to him trying to find him but changed clark you still have that gun oh it didn't

307
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:26,400
disappear with her for some reason i thought you guys took it i would assume oh that's right yeah

308
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:30,480
i do remember that you know i know it was just the other day but it feels like weeks ago yeah

309
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:36,320
we've got the we've got a camera a radio and again the gun they all have weird tubes coming off of

310
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:41,440
them they've all got red and have we tried to turn the radio on or anything yet oh i would not we have

311
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:48,720
not to do that we're not going to because of the cat man situation true unless you want to you have

312
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:55,440
a dog right i don't want to be a dog well if you want to volunteer to turn that on while your dog

313
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:00,080
is in the room so it's the one that gets well what if it switches with any but anything but if

314
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:05,840
i could switch with you that would be pretty cool for me not for you so much but you know keith i

315
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:13,040
mean in spite of all that we said here you you know i'm a good cop you're not that but you do

316
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:17,440
have an attractive bod i would i would freak you friday with you let's talk about that later

317
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:24,640
going back through my sweet little cop notebook uh there's one more item from that uh shop that

318
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:29,040
is unaccounted for which one uh it was a helmet that was purchased by the first church of

319
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:34,800
contention we haven't been to the church yet have we how about we do that tomorrow yeah yeah we get

320
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:39,920
a good night's rest oh we do that oh dang there's that guy on the there's a guy remember that guy

321
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:45,680
that overpowered you and took your uniform and just vaguely your service firearm and let's go

322
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:50,400
hunt him down what can we what can we do because we don't know what he was driving we don't know

323
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:54,720
if he's on foot we just know what he was wearing he's kind of what he looks like he's got my radio

324
00:34:54,720 --> 00:35:00,720
i was thinking we should set up a trap yeah that radio trap we can mention something and just show

325
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:04,480
up there and if it doesn't work then we can go to sleep and try it again tomorrow what do you think

326
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:08,800
could trap him maybe he got on the bad side of charles and he was also snooping around john

327
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,960
peters because he's looking into these artifacts as well so if we put it across the radio that we've

328
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:18,080
got the radio and john peters or any of those yeah or that we've got a lead on where the radio is and

329
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:23,040
we're headed there yeah right and then he shows up yeah but then we're there already so what do we

330
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:27,360
say we have a lead on the john peters and the radio because he's he seemed like he was trying

331
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:33,280
to find john not i mean perhaps we don't know that john peters is alive so if he's dead yeah but i

332
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:37,680
don't think that this guy knows whether john is dead or not i think he was looking for him and

333
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,960
couldn't find him we don't know what he was looking for at john peters house lots of people

334
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,800
been poking around there lots of crazy devices turning people into catmen turning up around

335
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:49,840
there if they think john peters is going to be there it'd be extra incentive well how about we

336
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:55,200
give the description of a man who resembles john peters okay yeah let's do that i like that john

337
00:35:55,200 --> 00:36:01,920
peters is a short balding man with large eyes and a tiny nose so that's where do we want to set up

338
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,960
this sting operation should we set it up like down the street from the police station let's

339
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:11,520
make it convenient on ourselves at uh what it's on that street well there's the donut hole they

340
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:17,360
could say he's there yeah is that a 24-hour donut hole where is the donut hole that's just something

341
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:22,960
i made up that might be near the police station i was thinking if we for sure yeah oh cops like

342
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:29,680
donuts yeah that's right so yeah that makes sense uh i just mean like if we could set up a place

343
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:34,000
that we have like a van like a security man no i just meant like if there was buildings around

344
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,800
wherever we're going that we could get on the rooftop camouflage right next door yeah like get

345
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:43,360
up on the roof he's got some hunting blinds displayed in the parking lot yeah so i'm thinking

346
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:48,480
like the downtown area where the police station is he has like roof access that we could like put

347
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:55,040
one on the roof put somebody in a car or like in a in in like a personal vehicle why don't we just

348
00:36:55,040 --> 00:37:00,880
set up a dummy yeah in john peter's clothes in the middle of the parking lot and it looks like

349
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:06,480
he's fiddling with the radio yeah and then we just fucking elmer futhish you know we wait for

350
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:12,080
the bunny to show up not a terrible idea i don't think oh i do but i don't think we should have

351
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:18,880
the radio out there what could go wrong um what do we just like have them go to the be like yeah

352
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:22,960
they're in the donut hole and then just one of us could be sitting in there with like a hood on or

353
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:27,440
something be like describe john peter's wearing a hoodie we have the hoodie on and then one of you

354
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:32,400
guys like across the way on the top of the building and one of you guys or one of us in a

355
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:38,560
car i like it so who wants to be the guy inside you have that sniper rifle do you want to be on

356
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:42,720
the roof sure and then between me he already knows so this really does seem like a situation this guy

357
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:47,600
already knows what i look like that's true being neutralizing instead of killing yeah i think you

358
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:53,200
should be inside but he's he's already assaulted a cop he has his clothes yeah let's play it out

359
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:58,640
though so he comes in let's say do i take him down from inside or do we wait till he gets outside i

360
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:03,520
don't know if anybody should be sniping yeah i think we all just need to get this guy two of us

361
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:08,480
like one of us be in the bathroom or something one guy be sitting there facing away from the window

362
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:12,880
with a hoodie on and then one guy outside and then we all kind of like rush him once he like gets to

363
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,000
where you are okay do you want to be in the bathroom or do you want to be in the bathroom

364
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,040
do you want to be outside or in the bathroom i kind of got to go to the bathroom okay john in

365
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:23,440
the bathroom i'll be waiting outside in a car and then once he goes inside i'll be closing closing

366
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:27,840
in closing that closing that exit and then i'll just be inside be invading probably just take him

367
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:32,640
down as soon as you see i probably have civvies at the station right oh yeah i'll swing by the

368
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:37,840
station and put on my regular boy clothes yeah i'll put my regular clothes on too that way he

369
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:42,720
doesn't like see a uniformed cop sitting in a car be in the bathroom so i'll just wear my clothes

370
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:47,520
as soon as i see him i'll radio you i guess or maybe just shout you'll hear me shouting for

371
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:54,240
him to freeze let's arrange some kind of signal you have your radio off and then i'll be outside

372
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:59,760
once he goes inside i'll radio you there you go we'll close in on him i like it okay and break

373
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:04,400
what's the plan uh i'm gonna be waiting i'm gonna swing by the station and put on my regular

374
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:10,160
civilian clothes and sit in the donut hole i put on civilian clothes as well i sit in my car

375
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:17,600
across the street from the donut hole and i radio in i've got a description a short balding man

376
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:23,920
big eyes and a kind of small nose matching the description of a wanted person we have reason

377
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:29,200
to believe that he might be dangerous and he's got he's got that that radio that we've been told

378
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:34,320
about that we've been looking for so if we could get uh if we could get somebody down to the donut

379
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:41,120
hole uh yeah it's gonna take me an hour probably to get down there yeah i'm i'm not anywhere close

380
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:49,280
right now uh what about you john i am in the bathroom somewhere else it's gonna be a minute

381
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:56,880
okay well uh if we can have maybe lauren or or drew get down there but uh it's gonna take all

382
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:02,640
three of us a while to get there it seems like so i'm in route either way okay sick so you guys

383
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:07,680
wait i've ordered a coffee and a single glazed donut and i'm maybe reading the paper from

384
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:12,640
yesterday because it's like one in the morning yeah yeah real quick if you guys could all lose

385
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:21,760

00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:44,640
white shirt black tie black sunglasses and an ill-fitting windbreaker that says fbi in big

00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:52,000
letters across the back clark as you sip on your coffee you hear the door behind you swing open

390
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:57,760
the door chimes jingle and jangle and you hear footsteps out of the corner of your eye you see
