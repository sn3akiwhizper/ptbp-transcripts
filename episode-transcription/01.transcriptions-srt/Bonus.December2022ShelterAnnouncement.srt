1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
My life is great, and it's all my fault

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Cause my life is great, and it's all mine

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Cause my life is great, and it's all mine

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Hey, I'm Zach and this is an announcement.

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,560
During this month of December, in the year of our Wolf 2022, so far, the Patreon for Pretending to

6
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:59,840
Be People is up $44.98. Pretty rad. Now, if the month were to end right now, we'd take that $44.98

7
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:08,080
and we would match it. So now we're talking $89.96. We would take that $89.96 and we would donate it

8
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,760
to a crisis cold weather shelter here in Springfield. But it's not the end of the

9
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:19,440
month yet, and we're going to match new and upgrading Patreon subscriptions through the entire

10
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:26,480
month of December. So we'll double whatever we're up for December and send it on over to a cold

11
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:31,840
weather shelter here in our community that takes in all genders, which unfortunately isn't common

12
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:38,320
in our area yet. The shelter is open on any night when the forecast in this here part of Missouri

13
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:44,720
is below 32 degrees, and it's hosted at Asbury UMC with three other churches joining in to help

14
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:50,160
this need that's not currently being met by anyone else. So let's raise some money to help people

15
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:56,720
doing good. Last year the Patreon shot up by like 400 bucks. We matched that 400, donated $800

16
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:01,760
to the crisis cold weather shelter. I'd very much like to beat that figure this year, so

17
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:10,080
I don't know if we can get a raffle into the mix. Our Splashylvania Fastpass starts at $5 a month,

18
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:17,680
and other tiers take place at multiples of five. So for every $5 you spend subscribing or upping

19
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:23,120
your subscription this month on Patreon, you'll get an entry into the raffle. There will be three

20
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:30,240
raffle winners. Two raffle winners will receive a PTBP shirt of their choosing, including the

21
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:36,160
designs from the website, the merch store, the Patreon exclusive designs from season one,

22
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:42,640
the new Patreon exclusive designs for season two, which will be announced later this month

23
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:50,240
and available on Patreon in January. But the third raffle winner, however, they can,

24
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:57,920
if they want to, play in a one-shot that I've written alongside the cast of PTBP as their

25
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:04,080
fellow players on a little video call. If that's not something you want, we can also just send you

26
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,800
a t-shirt, no worries. Now we did a raffle a couple years ago to support the bail fund,

27
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:15,840
and we put up a match cap, which was wise because y'all raised over $5,000 that time,

28
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,680
and matching that would have bankrupted me. So we'll go ahead and throw a $2,000 match cap on

29
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:27,440
this sucker with our hopes high that y'all go off, because we'll gladly match it to help keep folks

30
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:32,960
in our community warm during this cold season. And for additional sweetener in this wildly

31
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:39,200
saccharine pot of sugar and syrup, we just dropped our contention PD Halloween special.

32
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:44,800
It's the Butterfinger Bandit Keith Beans on our Patreon. The audio episode of that is now up,

33
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:50,160
fully edited, ready for your ear holes. The boys were playing their season one characters,

34
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:57,520
but like peanuts-aged kids, and they solved a mysterious theft that they witnessed at

35
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:03,600
Klinker's daycare during the Halloween party. We had a blast, and we were back in contention.

36
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:08,960
It was so much fun, and we're gonna do it again. So moving forward in the Patreon,

37
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:15,920
starting this Monday night at 7 37 p.m. Central Time in the Den of Sin, we're gonna be kicking

38
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:24,400
off our new Patreon campaign, and Thomas will be premiering his handler skills with a homebrew

39
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:31,840
that he's calling The Lost Treasure of John Lee Pettymore. So Joe, Luke, and I will all be playing

40
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:38,800
members of the Pettymore family in the wake of the events of season one, and we're so fucking

41
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:46,160
stoked for this. Oops, all Pettymore's adventure. The audio episode of that will be out this month,

42
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:52,480
and episode 18 of season two will be out next Friday, December 9th. So let's help folks in

43
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:59,600
our community stay warm. You'll get fun bonus content, and you'll feel good. And that is a sick

44
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:14,800
combination.
