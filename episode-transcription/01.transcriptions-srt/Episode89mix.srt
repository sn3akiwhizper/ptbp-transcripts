1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
Did y'all know that real human people eat mushrooms?

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,100
Those weird little fuckers

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:08,460
that grow out of the poop or something.

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,560
Damn, and y'all thought I was nasty.

5
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:14,700
And here you are just eating dirt fungus

6
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,840
like it's going out of style.

7
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,860
I'll take a pot of day old warm cream

8
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:23,340
any day over mud fucking mushrooms.

9
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,900
Speaking of fucking, y'all are listening

10
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,800
to the radio show that fucks the most.

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,360
694.2 PTBP.

12
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:37,360
And I am your most fuckingest host, Wolf the Dog.

13
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,140
I'm excited to announce a new project

14
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,840
for our citizens of contention.

15
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,000
We want to write a Delta Green scenario as a community.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,800
Over the next few months,

17
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,320
we'll be having prompted writing contests

18
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,820
to find the best meaty chunks y'all can muster.

19
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:59,000
We'll use each round's winner to inform the next prompt

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,280
until we have enough juicy morsels

21
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,920
to make ourselves a narrative feast.

22
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,060
To get in on this tub of greasy love,

23
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:12,060
head on down to reddit.com r slash pretending to be people.

24
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:16,100
Show us what you've got and vote for your favorites

25
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,580
to help us choose the winners.

26
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:21,700
Is 89 episodes a long time?

27
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,340
Are we friends now?

28
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:26,420
Would a friend throw a wolf a fucking bone

29
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:31,260
and slap those follow buttons on Twitter and the Instagrams?

30
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,440
Would a friend take it a step further

31
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,420
and spend a minute typing up a five-star review

32
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,340
on Apple podcasts?

33
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,060
If you do, I might read it on air

34
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:43,160
like I'm about to read this review

35
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:48,160
from Hello Under Dash Cerise entitled Best Wolf Ever.

36
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,420
They right.

37
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,480
Listen, y'all.

38
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,320
This here actual play role-playing podcast

39
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,520
is really creative and might just spoil you for any others.

40
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,000
If you don't know what Delta Green is,

41
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,120
you're in for a treat.

42
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,960
Imagine X-Files meets Lovecraft meets Night Vale,

43
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,240
except the agents are pretty terrible at their jobs.

44
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:14,160
But actually, really, the best part is Wolf the dog

45
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,360
as the intro DJ.

46
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,160
In the very many large, numerous amounts

47
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,800
of new music tracks he plays every week.

48
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,560
Hell yeah, baby.

49
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,520
Finally, some recognition for all the damn hard work I do,

50
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:32,080
especially when it comes to seeking new music out.

51
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,160
I don't know what all those things you listed are,

52
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,600
but I assume that they meant that you think

53
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,940
that this weird podcast is good?

54
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,560
I wouldn't fucking know.

55
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,480
Never listened to a second of it personally.

56
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:50,160
This was one of 234 tasty reviews.

57
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,920
And when we hit 311 on Apple Podcasts, I'll tell you what.

58
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,800
Every person who has typed up a sweet treat of a review

59
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,920
will be entered in a drawing

60
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,840
to win a pretended to be people t-shirt.

61
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,400
That's right, folks.

62
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,320
The merch is real.

63
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,100
It's just that you have to win a drawing

64
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,680
to get your mitts on these shits.

65
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,200
Until my producer figures out how the fuck

66
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,560
the internet works, same, honestly,

67
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,400
then it'll be for sale.

68
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:24,400
And remember, most of those 234 reviews weren't written.

69
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,840
They just hit the fifth star,

70
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,480
which still makes Wolfie smile.

71
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:33,480
But you must write a review to be entered into the contest.

72
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,100
Also, that makes each of your chances

73
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:39,620
of winning one of these sick teas that much greater.

74
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:43,020
So get in on it while the getting's good.

75
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:46,800
Do y'all remember my dog, Wolf, the dog?

76
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,780
Today, I found him sitting at a little desk

77
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:52,660
with a microphone and sunglasses on.

78
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:56,920
It looked like he had some kind of broadcasting kit.

79
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,620
What the fuck?

80
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,860
Where the fuck did he get sunglasses from?

81
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,980
Time for the most stable part of this here reality.

82
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,220
It is the news.

83
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:10,820
Last time, John Lee Kevin Moore the Thirth

84
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:14,020
let slip to Anne Love that he is not, in fact,

85
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,580
her former partner from K-Cell,

86
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:20,100
but rather he is, in fact, one of the vectors

87
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,860
K-Cell was tasked with destroying.

88
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:27,180
Anne then put an impossibly clean blade into John's head

89
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,900
and with a chant continued to move it deeper

90
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:33,860
into this cranium down into his throat

91
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:36,700
before eventually ending his life.

92
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:39,380
For a sweet, sweet moment.

93
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:43,860
In the muddy, ankle-deep, fish-infested overflow

94
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,780
of Bean's pond.

95
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:48,700
Clark did what he could, but it just seems like

96
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,600
this Anne Love is one resilient fucker.

97
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,060
Round and round and round she goes.

98
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,420
Will she stop?

99
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,140
Nobody knows.

100
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,980
There's only one thing I do know

101
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:02,420
and that's that I put my trust in kudzu with no backbone.

102
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:34,700
Quick behind the GM screen here at the top of episode 89.

103
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:38,940
Thomas, you might find this interesting.

104
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:42,380
Clark, he, oh, no, your name is Joe.

105
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:47,380
And, fuck, we're deep in it now.

106
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:52,700
We're so deep in it, my notes here for the last episode say

107
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:57,940
if Anne finds out that John is ball

108
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:01,100
she will make an excuse to walk away

109
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,900
to chant over her blade,

110
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,220
make them roll alertness to hear that

111
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,960
before attacking John.

112
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,500
Yeah, see, we're totally railroaded.

113
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:18,180
I think something in my mind was just like,

114
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,740
you know what, he's probably just gonna fucking tell her.

115
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,580
And then instead of having to make an excuse to go away

116
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,740
you guys are like, hey, can we have a minute?

117
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,100
Yeah.

118
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,220
Will you walk away and chant over your blade real fast?

119
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,100
We gotta talk.

120
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,660
Take all the time you need.

121
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,300
That was a really good Anne Love impression.

122
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:47,260
I gotta admit, both Clark and Joe were surprised

123
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:50,260
that Kevin did tell her about ball.

124
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,800
That popped out of nowhere.

125
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,580
Well, yeah, it did.

126
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,460
That's because I completely forgot

127
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:01,300
that we weren't telling her who I was.

128
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:04,260
That you were John, right, right, right.

129
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,300
Too many secrets and lies, man.

130
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:12,020
Oh, actually that's what, season two, no secrets, no lies.

131
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,260
No repercussions, no secrets, no lies.

132
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,460
We'll still fuck it up, don't worry.

133
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,300
Yeah.

134
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,020
I mean, if you guys were just truthful with everyone

135
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:30,300
right off the bat, you wouldn't have to keep track

136
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,860
of all your lies.

137
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,500
It's more or less what I was attempting there.

138
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:38,860
Radical honesty.

139
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:44,000
I gotta get this off my chest.

140
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,660
Well, she sure knew a lot about ball.

141
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,840
You know that thing, me and my, you and my dad

142
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:56,840
were sent to contention to take care of, I'm one of them.

143
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,840
Let's see, the note in the green box said they got

144
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:04,320
nine of 12, so I guess that's 10 of 12 now.

145
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,240
What the fuck, what the fuck?

146
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,740
I don't remember the note, I got a final note.

147
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:11,280
That was like episode five or six, I mean.

148
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:18,480
Holy shit, yeah, it was like over a year and a half ago.

149
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:22,880
And that's just in release time, not when we actually played.

150
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:26,240
It's funny, here, this is a page from back

151
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,120
when we first started of what my notes looked like.

152
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,040
Very detailed, so detailed, so many words on the page.

153
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:38,040
This was last session, and that was the entire session

154
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:45,100
was this bottom quarter of a page and then two sentences

155
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,640
at the top of the next.

156
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:53,760
That's fair, as you've lost sanity, you've also lost

157
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,040
all motivation to keep track of the events of this game.

158
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:01,760
Here was a good day, at some point I just wrote

159
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,600
like four notes on a page and then went to the next page

160
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,680
for the next session.

161
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:14,040
Here's me getting theomania, belief you are a god.

162
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,480
Yep, is that the last note you took?

163
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,240
Oh, nope, oh my god.

164
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,720
Oh yes, that is righteous.

165
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,960
That was my god phase.

166
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,560
Then it's back to normal notes.

167
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:33,240
My notes for last episode have a ton of stuff.

168
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,880
We didn't do any of it, except for that one,

169
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,760
the chant over her blade before attacking Jon.

170
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:45,640
I found what we'd written down, what I wrote down

171
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:49,520
for what was found in the storage lockers.

172
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:54,280
And I wrote like bricks of cocaine, a burlap sack,

173
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:57,480
lots of cash, and then it just says lots of great shit.

174
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:04,040
And then it skips down, it says three notes on a table.

175
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,040
I don't describe those notes.

176
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,280
Three notes on a table?

177
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:11,320
If you would ask me if there were three notes on a table

178
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,760
in that fucking green box, I'd be like, no,

179
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,320
there weren't just three notes sitting on a table

180
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,640
that we didn't like.

181
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,920
Do you want me to tell you what they were?

182
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,000
I wrote three notes on a table,

183
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,160
including newspaper clipping about Cole's orphanage,

184
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,160
which has recently been brought up,

185
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,760
which is kind of cool that I just read that.

186
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,000
Well, it keeps getting, yeah, I mean,

187
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,200
they did a shitty job of erasing it from history

188
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,400
because everybody's fucking talking about it.

189
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:40,200
Let's see, one is a note that says the cabin

190
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,720
is in the woods, stark west from the end of the trail,

191
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:47,920
about 2.5 miles, signed K.

192
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,880
Okay, so we investigated that.

193
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:53,560
But then it also says, we took care of nine of them

194
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,080
as well as the leader.

195
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,720
That's the one I didn't remember just now.

196
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,360
I remember it phrased like that,

197
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,400
didn't think they were talking about ball babies.

198
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,400
Yeah, there's another one that says

199
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,840
the work is difficult in particular,

200
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,360
but I've had 12 successes.

201
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,680
Life isn't as complex as they believe.

202
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,980
They are quite simple.

203
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:17,680
It will be their downfall.

204
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,140
And then finally, the newspaper ad from 25 years ago

205
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:25,720
for Kohl's Orphanage, new school under modern etiquette.

206
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,400
Which we did end up asking somebody about

207
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,080
and they did tell us about it a little bit.

208
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:33,800
We've talked about Kohl's a number of times with people.

209
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,440
Kohl's Orphanage is the orphanage

210
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,160
that John Lee Pettymore came from.

211
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,960
It also was, I believe you asked Drew

212
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,440
to look up information on it

213
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,960
and he couldn't find any information.

214
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,800
Right.

215
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:50,640
However, Randy Angst, the first time you talked to him,

216
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,600
had a distinct memory of an orphanage

217
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,480
existing under that name.

218
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,000
And then did we learn,

219
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,140
we learned more about it in the woods arc, right?

220
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,920
Certainly out of character.

221
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:05,680
That was a big part of the Ken Krenkelhoff story.

222
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,960
Yup, yup, yup.

223
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,800
Yup, yup.

224
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,820
Ken might be chilling in a door somewhere, even to this day.

225
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,600
I believe that door, along with the rest

226
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,120
of the cabin was set on fire.

227
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,160
Oh, that's right.

228
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,600
Yup, nevermind. Poor door boy.

229
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,440
Poor door boy.

230
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,200
Krenkelhoff door boy.

231
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,200
Well, do you guys want to get into this?

232
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,080
Yeah, let's hit it.

233
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,640
John Lee Pettymore the first body is like,

234
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,520
oh, okay, that seems about right.

235
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,360
Sorry.

236
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,260
I think Thomas might be calling me.

237
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,440
I'm on Do Not Disturb right now.

238
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,560
So I'll have to look at my phone

239
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,000
to see if he's actually calling me.

240
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,120
No, he's calling Luke.

241
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,740
For sure he's calling Luke.

242
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,640
Luke didn't pick up because he's too busy playing.

243
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,440
Do you have your phone set on Do Not Disturb?

244
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,540
Oh no, I don't.

245
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,460
It should be ringable.

246
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,880
No, it's ringing.

247
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,720
Hello?

248
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,760
Hey, follow me.

249
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,680
Off mic.

250
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,720
Oh, they're just walking away from their microphones.

251
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,800
They could just turn off their microphones,

252
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,080
but they've decided to take their headphones off

253
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,880
and walk away from their cameras.

254
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,760
Oh, I can hear them actually.

255
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,560
Oh, I can absolutely hear what they're talking about.

256
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,220
Thomas is so fucking loud, it's crazy.

257
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,760
He just asked Joe.

258
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,800
He just told Joe that he has 15 luck

259
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,560
and that he can spend 10 to have a vision.

260
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,680
And he asked Joe what would be the most

261
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,620
prudent information to learn.

262
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:36,800
Go lie down right there now.

263
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,840
Now they're back.

264
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,760
Oh.

265
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:44,200
I was narrating the phone call for our listeners

266
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,240
because you left your microphones on.

267
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,980
And Thomas is really loud,

268
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:54,280
so I could hear his side of the conversation.

269
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,040
Oh yeah, look, it's really plain and audacity.

270
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,240
Shit, it's like, yeah, it's totally all there.

271
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:12,480
Fuck, all right.

272
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,480
Well, now I'm actually gonna leave the room for a second

273
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,440
so you guys can just talk to each other on mic

274
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,400
if you wanna do that. Nice try.

275
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,200
He made a big show of pulling out his earphones,

276
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,120
but we know he's been on speaker this whole time.

277
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,040
The earphones aren't what's plugged in, it's his earbuds.

278
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,520
Those are just decoy earphones.

279
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,000
Did you guys have a good conversation?

280
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,960
Yeah.

281
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,480
Yeah, yeah.

282
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,520
Wouldn't you like to know?

283
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:41,040
Why don't you just check the track and find out?

284
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,880
We should have said like, fuck you, Zach, or some shit.

285
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,480
That would actually be really funny.

286
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,360
I like listening to the conversations you guys have

287
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,240
when I've left,

288
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,920
because typically in the middle of the episode,

289
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,600
you forget that I'm gonna listen back to him.

290
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,360
So when you guys just keep talking about

291
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:00,120
how much you love me and appreciate that I'm doing this,

292
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,040
it's like, joke's on you.

293
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,840
We're just trying to get you

294
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,280
to treat our characters well.

295
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:08,880
We know you're listening.

296
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,720
Well, speaking of which.

297
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,160
We're just trying to earn a favor.

298
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,040
John Lee Pettymore, the thirst body

299
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:17,080
is in a fucking waterbed grave,

300
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:20,760
and Clark is standing behind it,

301
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:24,280
and you can see the hilt of this blade

302
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:28,240
sticking up out of the water above the head.

303
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,720
And right ahead of that is Anne Love,

304
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:35,400
whose wry smile is just sitting

305
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:40,120
as it always seems to be underneath a single eye.

306
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,680
You've seen the other eye in action

307
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,960
when her hair gets tousled about.

308
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,120
Like, she has two eyes.

309
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,200
We're not worried about that, but.

310
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,800
I wasn't until now.

311
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,760
Yeah, why do you?

312
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,600
You're being really suspicious.

313
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,440
We're not worried about that.

314
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:05,320
About how many eyes this person has.

315
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,760
She's a cyclops.

316
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,960
Is it more or less than two?

317
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,160
Ooh, there's the question for anyone with bangs, honestly.

318
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:21,160
Spider Anne has as many eyes as a spider does.

319
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,280
It literally would have rhymed.

320
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,880
How many eyes do spiders have?

321
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,240
Luke, look that up.

322
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,200
All right, so.

323
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,520
He's having his own fun.

324
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,800
Yeah, but I miss him.

325
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,840
Oh, me too.

326
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,480
I mean, I get to spend time with him,

327
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:50,480
but I still miss him and his terrible, terrible internet.

328
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,880
Are you dating him?

329
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,000
Are you dating Luke?

330
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,480
Are you dating Luke, dude?

331
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,080
Don't tell my ex-girlfriend.

332
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:57,920
Are you dating?

333
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,960
That's not our joke.

334
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,640
Oh, fuck, I always forget that that's like

335
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:08,040
the stapled, good joke, Scott Ockerman.

336
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:08,880
All right, so.

337
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,000
Okay, nice deflection.

338
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,040
But for real, dude, are you dating Luke?

339
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,400
We're not supposed to tell anyone about it.

340
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,280
I fucking knew that something like this

341
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,920
would tear the podcast apart.

342
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,120
You get the five of us together

343
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,240
and eventually somebody's not gonna be able

344
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,000
to keep it in their pants.

345
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,920
And I'm surprised, I'm surprised at you, Zach.

346
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,760
Luke, I expected.

347
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,480
Joe, sure, Justin, of course, but you?

348
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,720
Taylor said she'll only let me keep doing it

349
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,680
if she takes Luke's spot

350
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,000
and plays Keith Vigna the rest of the time.

351
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,840
Okay, cool.

352
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,760
I don't know, a chick?

353
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,260
You don't know any?

354
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,280
I'd like to spend 10 luck to have a vision.

355
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,320
Oh, okay, cool.

356
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,320
What, that's crazy.

357
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,160
Thomas, you can spend 10 luck to get a vision?

358
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,000
That's nuts.

359
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,840
Fuck yeah, dude.

360
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,360
How much luck do you have?

361
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:12,360
Well, I have 15 because I spent 10 of my 25

362
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,560
to avoid major damage.

363
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,400
Hell yeah.

364
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,200
And I'm still hanging on with one hit point here.

365
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:23,200
You see one weak finger rise up from the pavement

366
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,480
from a shattered body.

367
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,640
It's all he can muster,

368
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,520
but you see life in John Lee Pettymore

369
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,880
as he urges you to wait a minute as he has this vision.

370
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,440
Okay, yeah, that seems perfect.

371
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,320
Joe, take off your headphones, I suppose,

372
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,800
unless you already know what the question

373
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,800
he's gonna ask is.

374
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,640
I don't 100%, I'll play it like that.

375
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,000
Take them off.

376
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,920
Yeah, yeah.

377
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,000
All right, Thomas.

378
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,560
Where's the book?

379
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,880
Your entire face is underwater

380
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,920
and typically your eyes would roll back

381
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,360
into your head during one of these,

382
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:07,360
but as you lift a finger and begin finding yourself in ball,

383
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,280
you seem to have the ability to reach out

384
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:16,440
into the collective unconsciousness of the entire universe

385
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:20,560
to pick out certain memories that exist

386
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:23,880
from people throughout different times.

387
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:28,880
And you see Gary Daley ushering Eunice and Jerry Bishop

388
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,680
into the back of the Daley Fuh,

389
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:38,680
and you see him passing this book to the bishops.

390
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:43,360
The book is covered in uncured leather

391
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,080
with some hairs, maybe some acne.

392
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:53,800
There's some stretch marks on the binding of this book

393
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,680
and he hands it to him and then reality begins

394
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:00,920
to kind of fade up and blink and turn

395
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:04,040
like you're turning channels on a television.

396
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:08,560
And then you're inside the bishop home.

397
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,240
And you see Eunice and Jerry,

398
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,240
they're talking about this book that they have

399
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:16,320
just sitting on their kitchen table

400
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,560
and they're sitting on either side

401
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:22,360
discussing options, seemingly.

402
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:26,880
And a young Clark Bishop walks into the room

403
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:32,200
and quickly, Jerry gets up and is like, oh, no, no, no,

404
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,120
and sits him in front of the TV

405
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,200
where Wheel of Fortune is on.

406
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,720
Memories kind of fade, reality blinks out again,

407
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:46,080
and you see Eunice and Jerry at the television.

408
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,520
It's in this entertainment center.

409
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,560
They move the television out of the way

410
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:56,080
and there's a false bottom of this entertainment center

411
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:01,080
and there's a safe with an alphabetical keypad entry.

412
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,760
And you're just watching them open it up.

413
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,160
What code did they punch in?

414
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,720
I'm not gonna give you the code.

415
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,040
You asked where the book is, not how to get it.

416
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,960
I'll fight you for it.

417
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,200
All right, come over here.

418
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,000
I could use some human touch.

419
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,720
That's not Luke's, I mean my wife's.

420
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,040
You're Luke's.

421
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:29,240
And you see them punching a code,

422
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,560
but the camera is just on their faces

423
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,840
as they're typing it in.

424
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,800
Oh, great.

425
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,440
Listen, Zach, I've seen enough below deck

426
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,800
to know how this is gonna go with Luke.

427
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:43,400
So you just need to end it now to keep things professional.

428
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:47,000
Otherwise we're gonna tear this whole organization apart

429
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,240
with sex and recriminations.

430
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,760
This thing was doomed the second you put two feisty,

431
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:56,680
hot 20 somethings in it like me and Luke, baby.

432
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,520
Yeah.

433
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,120
You know when we started,

434
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:04,240
Joe, Justin and I were hot 20 somethings as well.

435
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,000
Of course this was years ago.

436
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,480
In the before times.

437
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,080
And they placed the book in this safe

438
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:18,200
in the false bottom of this entertainment center

439
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,360
and they close the door and click lock

440
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,280
and you see them look at each other and they embrace.

441
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:29,080
And then you're back under this muddy, murky water

442
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,080
right outside of Bean's Pond.

443
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:34,160
And the year is whatever year it is.

444
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,000
2000.

445
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,400
I'm gonna bring Joe back.

446
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,320
Hi, I'm back.

447
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,200
Hey, Joe.

448
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,360
Hello.

449
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:49,320
Clark and Anne are just staring at each other

450
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:52,040
waiting for John to be done with his vision.

451
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,720
John is still weakly holding up his finger

452
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,400
and he starts to writhe in the water and

453
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,560
Don't you touch him, man, don't you touch him.

454
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,320
And Anne is looking down at him with massive eyes,

455
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,720
just so confused.

456
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,440
And he rolls over on his side.

457
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:12,960
John, John.

458
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:20,320
I know where your book is, Anne.

459
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,880
That's a nice try.

460
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,600
That's a nice try.

461
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,080
Okay, I guess we'll persuade.

462
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:28,920
10.

463
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,000
How?

464
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,200
Well, I'm something of a savior

465
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,920
and I have the second sight as part of that whole package.

466
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,400
He's not lying about that, Anne.

467
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,400
I've seen him see things before.

468
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,880
I can see into moments into the past

469
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:47,680
or rather moments into the not now.

470
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:52,680
And well, I saw a whole little saga of the book,

471
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,200
but

472
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,040
Tell me now.

473
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:58,960
Well, it is at Clark's parents' house,

474
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,720
but you'll never find it without me.

475
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,800
What do you want?

476
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,520
Well, when we find the book,

477
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,360
I want you to teach us the spell

478
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,960
to help us get through that door.

479
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,120
Okay, neither one of you are gonna be armed

480
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,640
and I'm gonna walk behind you with two guns.

481
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,000
No. One on each of you.

482
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,480
No, no, no, no, no.

483
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,880
Other way around maybe.

484
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,560
Well, why would I trust you?

485
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,120
After all this, you think I'm gonna trust you?

486
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,400
You're the one who's trading the book for your life

487
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,760
essentially right now.

488
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:31,120
I'm the one with a gun pointed at your head.

489
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,480
I reload my gun.

490
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,160
Just so you know, in this mud,

491
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,000
you've kind of turned over.

492
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,640
You're on your back now.

493
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:42,480
You've got a massive knife going all the way down

494
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,760
through your skull, touching your uvula,

495
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:48,080
and she has a gun pointed at you.

496
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,880
And you reach for your gun?

497
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,240
Yes.

498
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,080
Good call.

499
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,920
Okay, no guns.

500
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,960
We all leave them here.

501
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,080
Wow, what if we just all had guns?

502
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:04,280
This is gonna end in a bloodbath if you don't...

503
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,120
Can we not?

504
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,600
This town is full of fanatics and freaks,

505
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,320
and you know, you've got your magic,

506
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,400
but I'd rather have my gun.

507
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,120
You know, a lot of people are trying to find us.

508
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,680
I mean, you do have a knife.

509
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,040
We're not joking about that yet.

510
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,800
Okay.

511
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,680
It's cool that you can talk normally though.

512
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,880
All right, so everyone has their guns

513
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,920
and we'll just all be good

514
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,840
because we both need each other to get this done,

515
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,680
hopefully by the end of the episode.

516
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,000
Can you get your knife out of my head?

517
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,400
I don't know if that's a great idea.

518
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,800
For bleeding's sake,

519
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:45,000
I mean, I'd rather have my knife back, you know,

520
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,400
but it doesn't seem like you'll survive

521
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,720
and I now need you, unfortunately.

522
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,320
You're magic, but something tells me

523
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,200
you probably don't know any healing.

524
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,080
Oh, that's a good point.

525
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,080
No, I could do that.

526
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,440
Could you throw a little bit of that my way

527
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,240
and then you could maybe have your knife back?

528
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,200
It's really hard.

529
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,720
This is a very big knife

530
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,760
and it's hard to hold my head up with it.

531
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,680
She kind of crouches down on the ground.

532
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,600
There's just enough of the knife sticking out.

533
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,480
There's just enough of the blade sticking out at the top

534
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,880
to where she can wiggle her fingers in

535
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:25,160
and she begins cutting right in between two of her fingers,

536
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,840
just enough to get blood to start coming out.

537
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,800
And then she starts chanting,

538
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:35,920
Dem artai rat, dem artai rat, dem artai rat.

539
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,760
On the last one,

540
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:41,760
she pulls the knife all the way up out of your head.

541
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:47,320
And with a chant, the blood that comes out of her hand

542
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:51,480
forms like a jackhammer tube of coagulation

543
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,800
straight down into your throat

544
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,160
and you can taste Anne loves blood.

545
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,320
Both of you roll sanity.

546
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,160
Oh no.

547
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,320
Oh ho ho ho ho.

548
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,640
Fail, 48.

549
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,000
Fail, 78 on an eight.

550
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,240
What's your power there?

551
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,080
My power?

552
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,920
Oh, fuck me, dude.

553
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,280
It's a 60.

554
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,840
So I rolled over my power.

555
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,760
We were all gonna be...

556
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,440
This may work in our advantage.

557
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,080
Yeah, show her Clark's a wild card.

558
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:37,560
Fucking maybe, but this episode was gonna be fine.

559
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,640
It was about to happen.

560
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,960
It was about to happen.

561
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,480
Okay, you're both gonna lose a D4.

562
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,320
Oh, for real?

563
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,440
For blood magic.

564
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,280
One.

565
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:51,360
That puts a column of blood through the entire head.

566
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,360
I'm at 15.

567
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,200
Two.

568
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,440
I lose two and that puts me at my breaking point.

569
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,240
All right.

570
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,560
That means you break, right?

571
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,520
That means it's time for a new mania.

572
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,040
What a time for it.

573
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,640
What a time for it.

574
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,440
What a time to be a fan of this podcast.

575
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,360
Ha ha ha ha ha.

576
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,280
Listeners, I'm glad you're here with us right now.

577
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,800
This is...

578
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,280
We were so close.

579
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,880
Everything was gonna be all right.

580
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,880
What the...

581
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,280
So, it's time to roll, baby.

582
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,720
Oh, fuck me.

583
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,120
It's still time to roll, baby.

584
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,040
Oh boy.

585
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:45,040
Sample mania's table from Call of Cthulhu, 7th edition.

586
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,760
D100, three times.

587
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,840
94?

588
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:52,040
94 is theomania.

589
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:52,920
God damn it.

590
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:55,200
The belief that he or she is a god.

591
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,600
Hey, you get a second chance.

592
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,280
So, we meet again.

593
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,600
Ha ha ha ha ha.

594
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,240
A 62?

595
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:08,200
62 is gonna be legiro mania,

596
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:13,200
an uncontrollable compulsion to make loud or shrill noises.

597
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,680
No, thank you.

598
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,520
We don't need to roll.

599
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,360
I'll take that one.

600
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,200
Ha ha ha ha ha.

601
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,640
Fuck you.

602
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,640
And the last one.

603
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,480
51.

604
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,360
51 is gonna be gymnomania.

605
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,960
Is that nudity?

606
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,520
Yes, it is indeed.

607
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,640
It is a compulsion with nudity.

608
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,560
Oh boy.

609
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,840
Oh, I didn't wanna take the belief in God thing

610
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:43,520
because I was so fucking bad at it before,

611
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,440
but I also don't wanna be taking my clothes off all the time.

612
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,320
Ha ha ha ha ha.

613
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,600
Joe, what an opportunity you've been given

614
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,640
here at this stage.

615
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,480
Yeah.

616
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,240
I mean, yeah, no, 100%.

617
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:00,040
I know that right now would be a really good time

618
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,480
for Clark to think that he's a god

619
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:05,240
because we are in overseer territory.

620
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:08,720
I just worry that it's hard for me to play it sometimes

621
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,400
because how does a god decide,

622
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,600
how does a god go somewhere else

623
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,080
when people wanna go somewhere else?

624
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,680
You know what I mean?

625
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,000
It's hard sometimes.

626
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,480
I'll try it, I'll try it.

627
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,600
That's all that anyone's asking.

628
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,040
No one listens to this fucking show anyway.

629
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:33,200
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

630
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,320
Yeah, I'm gonna do it.

631
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,760
I once again believe that I am a god.

632
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,720
Yes, you do.

633
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,360
How hard do you believe it?

634
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,600
Also, remember that each one of these manias,

635
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,560
it strips away Clark Bishop's being.

636
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:51,200
Clark is no longer who he was when he started.

637
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:55,200
He's been taken over, especially with this one.

638
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,800
So much of Clark's self was dictated

639
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:02,120
by his almost nonchalance.

640
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:08,560
However, I mean, you got that big overseer dick energy, dude.

641
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,760
Spread it around, slap it on the table.

642
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,840
Bring it out betwixt the robes opening.

643
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,480
Yeah, I got it, you got it.

644
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,360
But also that would be a compulsion of nudity,

645
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,200
so whatever.

646
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,280
I pick both, I pick both, I pick both.

647
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,560
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

648
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,960
Hey, how much did Anne Love fail me for?

649
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,520
Oh, let me roll.

650
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,160
Oh, you get a D6.

651
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,240
Five.

652
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,840
Fuck yeah.

653
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,200
So I'm at six.

654
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,040
So the thing that sent me over the edge

655
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:54,160
was seeing her cut her finger with the blade in his head.

656
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:57,320
So I'm gonna lash out at her and try and,

657
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:00,160
I want to wrestle the knife away from her.

658
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,720
And I'm yelling, what the fuck is that?

659
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,840
Fucking knife, blood magic, fucking shit.

660
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,120
Like rushing her now.

661
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,880
Okie dokie, that'll be unarmed combat.

662
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:16,360
I pass a 41 on a 70.

663
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,760
She passed with a 36.

664
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,840
Yes.

665
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:24,280
She pulls the large knife up out of John Lee Pettymore's

666
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:27,040
head as she finishes this incantation.

667
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,760
And before she knows it, you're just on her.

668
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,360
And you grab the knife out of her hand,

669
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,760
screaming about blood magic.

670
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,720
And she just jumps back and she's like,

671
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,320
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

672
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,680
It's literally healing.

673
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,720
It's my blood.

674
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,240
It's healing him.

675
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,880
What the fuck is your problem?

676
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,360
It's not, it's not, it's not right.

677
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,760
That's not, that's not something a person

678
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,800
should be able to do.

679
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,680
Too fucking bad.

680
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:52,200
Clark, I will say that personally at this moment,

681
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,840
I have no objections.

682
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,960
Are you, are you, are you you?

683
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:55,800
Are you all right?

684
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,640
Are you you?

685
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,360
It was her blood that went inside of you.

686
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,600
Yeah, I know.

687
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:04,320
She gave me a well, a well, a much needed transfusion.

688
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,480
I feel better.

689
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,440
I feel better, Clark.

690
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,360
I don't, I don't, I don't like, I don't like any of this.

691
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,800
This is, this is, this is,

692
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,040
this isn't the way it's supposed to be.

693
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,600
This isn't the way it's supposed to happen.

694
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,560
Clark, man.

695
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:23,280
None of this is the way it was supposed to happen.

696
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,640
No, I'm pretty sure this is exactly

697
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,000
the way it was supposed to happen.

698
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,120
Now we talked about guns, but I really,

699
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,840
I would appreciate the knife back,

700
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,880
but you seem to have a whole look in your eyes

701
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,760
right now.

702
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:43,360
So just by the time we get to your parents' house,

703
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,840
can we call it that still?

704
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,760
Then I would like to have that knife back

705
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,280
if that's possible.

706
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:51,200
I'll think about it, but I'm holding onto it for now.

707
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,560
That was, that was freaky.

708
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,520
That was freaky shit.

709
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,520
Does Clark have a gun?

710
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,640
I don't technically.

711
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,480
Can I fish another water?

712
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,320
Oh, you dropped it?

713
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,160
Yeah.

714
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,120
Yeah, and as you pick it up out of the water,

715
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,520
it's water-locked, so you're just kinda like.

716
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:05,520
All right, and Clark's gonna hold onto the knife

717
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:08,280
and you're gonna drop your gun here in the pond with ours.

718
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,280
Oh, so we are going no guns?

719
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,000
I thought we were going all guns.

720
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,920
I've, your mouth is kinda like a gun.

721
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:16,760
What?

722
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,920
She says spells and stuff to make people get hurt.

723
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:19,760
All right.

724
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,440
She's kinda got a built-in gun.

725
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,960
Well, it helped too.

726
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,200
I need pills.

727
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:29,280
I need, I need strong pills.

728
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,640
Do you have any of those at your house, Clark?

729
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:34,360
I mean, there's a chance I got something there,

730
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:37,440
but I could just top you up right now, right here.

731
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,920
Here, just come here, just come here.

732
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:39,760
What?

733
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,400
What?

734
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:44,280
He crawls, he crawls a little bit towards you.

735
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:48,040
I put my hand on his head on the wound

736
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,920
and I try to heal him.

737
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:52,160
Clark tries to heal him.

738
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,480
Okay.

739
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,240
John Lee Pettymore starts praying.

740
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,080
Yeah.

741
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,880
It's like, no, I get it, I get it.

742
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,200
Through crest, all things are possible.

743
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,480
Is there a roll that I could make to-

744
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,000
Go ahead and roll unnatural.

745
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,080
I passed.

746
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,960
It's a 31 on a 49.

747
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,480
Whoa, I forgot we had good unnatural scores.

748
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:26,680
This game is broken wide open.

749
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,400
Joe?

750
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,240
Yeah.

751
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:34,640
Some words pop into your mind

752
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:39,120
and you know that if you can spill some blood

753
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:42,840
and say these words, that you can make it happen.

754
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,840
I've got the knife in my hand still.

755
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:48,600
So I take a page out of the book that I just saw

756
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,240
and love demonstrate for me.

757
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:54,240
And I do a little cut on the side of my thumb.

758
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,200
So it's kind of dripping a little bit.

759
00:35:56,200 --> 00:36:00,240
And I say, damn all to year it.

760
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,040
Damn all to year it.

761
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,920
Damn all to year it.

762
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,800
And as you finish saying the last one,

763
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:09,720
the blood just like flows out of your thumb

764
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,320
and goes up into the nostrils

765
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,480
and the mouth of John Lee Pettymore.

766
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:22,160
And you see the ooze pouring from his eyes

767
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,320
and his ears and his mouth

768
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:27,280
and the blood flowing on top of the ooze

769
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,520
into all of his orifices.

770
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,600
Go ahead and roll a D six.

771
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,400
It's a one.

772
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,960
Joe, every little bit helps.

773
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,400
And I just want to say you started this

774
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,240
by losing your goddamn mind over and love

775
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,440
cutting yourself on that knife to heal me.

776
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:53,960
And you ended it by fucking getting the courage

777
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:54,840
to do that yourself.

778
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,440
So I'm really proud of you, man.

779
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:04,520
Joe Clark and just Clark needs to roll sanity on this one

780
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:10,160
due to your change of pace and mindset

781
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:15,880
and your shocking ability to be able to do this yourself.

782
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,800
That's a fail.

783
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,440
And that's going to be another D four.

784
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,280
Fuck me, dude.

785
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,440
It's a 79.

786
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,640
It's over my power.

787
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:29,560
Fuck, and I rolled a four.

788
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,120
Fuck me, dude.

789
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,800
How much do you have left?

790
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,480
I got two, baby.

791
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,600
Oh my God.

792
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,080
Oh, okay.

793
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:43,640
Upon seeing that it fucking worked,

794
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:48,240
Clark's mind like starts to fracture

795
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:52,280
and he pulls the knife away and yells, it worked.

796
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:57,280
It's what I was always meant to be.

797
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,720
It's what I was always meant to be.

798
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,120
We don't need you anymore, Anne.

799
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,680
We don't need you anymore.

800
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,600
And I go right after her with the knife.

801
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,440
Yes!

802
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,000
Yes!

803
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:16,880
Hey, Joe.

804
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:17,720
Yeah.

805
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:18,800
How much luck do you have?

806
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,640
A lot.

807
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,120
Do you need to know an exact number?

808
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:25,640
No, I don't, but this just seems like a good opportunity

809
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:29,280
if you wanted to literally spend all of your luck points

810
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,120
to determine the outcome of this fight.

811
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:37,160
You can also just spend luck points to change a roll.

812
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,320
You could also do that.

813
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,760
Don't let him, don't let him.

814
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,680
This is, you're talking to the devil right now.

815
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,520
And he's like, hey, Joe, give me all your luck.

816
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,600
You don't have to do that.

817
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,440
I'm just saying.

818
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,280
There's a lot of things you can do

819
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,280
in this fight with that luck.

820
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,440
Instead of having to roll against me,

821
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:53,200
who crits constantly during combat,

822
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,480
you could just spend all of your luck

823
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:00,520
and decide exactly how you finish off

824
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,600
and love in this moment.

825
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,640
You do only have two sanity, so.

826
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:06,480
Yeah.

827
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,760
Yeah.

828
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,120
And I do want to, I do kind of want to finish her off.

829
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:10,960
Yeah.

830
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:11,880
You know where the book is.

831
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,880
You told us you know where the book is, right?

832
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,320
Yeah, I'm going to try and finish her off.

833
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:20,320
I'm going to spend my hefty bank of 65 luck.

834
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,320
Holy shit.

835
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:26,720
And I'm going to call this like it is,

836
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,280
Clark rushes her with unnatural strength.

837
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,080
Oh yes, he does.

838
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:35,320
In a flash is on her and he just wants to shove,

839
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:38,880
he wants to do to her what she did to John.

840
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,400
He wants to bring the knife down through her head.

841
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,600
And that's exactly what happens.

842
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:48,040
Clark rushes her with eyes akimbo,

843
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:51,080
knowing what he has always been

844
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,800
and was always meant to be

845
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:58,600
and jumps up in the air with a dagger in both hands

846
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:01,600
and comes down on top of Anne Love's head,

847
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:06,600
whose eyes are so wide because she's never seen anyone

848
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:12,000
pick up any sort of unnatural ability A at all,

849
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:17,080
B that quickly or C without any sort of training whatsoever.

850
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:22,680
And you come down and pierce the top of her skull.

851
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:27,040
And as you shove the knife into the top of her head,

852
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:30,880
you see one of her eyes directly starts looking

853
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:35,000
into your eyes and the other one just fills completely

854
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:40,000
with blood and the blood begins pouring down her face.

855
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:45,600
She stops breathing and you stand back

856
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:51,040
and she wobbles forward, backward, forward.

857
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,880
And the knife still in her skull,

858
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:58,880
she just falls back into the overfilled beans pond.

859
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:06,600
And begins floating out into the middle

860
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,400
of the mushroom shaped pond.

861
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,760
Holy shit, Clark, that was awesome.

862
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,880
We should go and get that book.

863
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,680
Yeah, you haven't changed furniture, have you?

864
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:24,080
As a matter of fact, no, why do you ask?

865
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:28,520
Woo, okay, it'll make more sense when we get there.

866
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,660
I'm not gonna tell you in case you decide to and love me.

867
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,160
Yeah, let's go.

868
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,760
As Clark Bishop and John Lee Pettymore the third

869
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:45,920
trudge north through the town of contention,

870
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,760
heading up through the warehouse district,

871
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:51,960
pass subtropolous and all of downtown

872
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:54,400
on the west side of A plus storage

873
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:59,400
where you found the storage units G10, G11, and G12

874
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:03,320
filled with, what was the quote, cool stuff.

875
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,160
Lots of cool shit.

876
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,000
Awesome things.

877
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,320
Lots of cool shit.

878
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,640
Lots of cool shit.

879
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:11,360
Past Julie Maxwell's apartment building.

880
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:14,240
I've got a really, really dumb story.

881
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,400
There was a local trucking company

882
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:20,760
that had this like billboard on I-44

883
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:23,920
and it had like a picture of an electric guitar

884
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:28,840
and like a motorcycle and like a baseball bat

885
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:32,440
and in really big letters, it said cool stuff.

886
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:36,520
And in really small letters, it said trucks bring it.

887
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:39,840
But it was really hard to see the trucks bring it part.

888
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:43,600
So it just looked like a dope billboard for cool stuff.

889
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:44,880
I remember that billboard.

890
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,040
I totally remember it.

891
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,080
That's like an intimidating thing

892
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:55,360
for like a sports team called the trucks.

893
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:57,040
Trucks bring it.

894
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,040
Trucks bring it.

895
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,120
Oh, the trucks is such a good name

896
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,960
for an American sports team.

897
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,200
The trucks would be so good.

898
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,760
Holy shit.

899
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,920
Oh my God, your mascot could be like a dude

900
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,240
inside a blow up semi.

901
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:13,800
It could literally just be a dude fucking

902
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:18,800
like tearing up your field in a tricked out like F-150.

903
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:24,560
They could bring out like a fake field to put on top.

904
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,520
That's how fields work, right?

905
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:27,960
Yeah, for sure, fake field.

906
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:30,360
When it rains, they pull out the fake field

907
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:32,640
at baseball games.

908
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:36,160
I was 17 years old and I was playing Ultimate Frisbee

909
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,180
at the park that's across the street

910
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:41,080
from our double A stadium here in Springfield

911
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:43,620
where the Springfield Cardinals play.

912
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:48,620
And it was raining and a few of us thought

913
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:51,740
to ourselves, there's a game tonight, isn't there?

914
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:54,320
So the tarps probably on the field.

915
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:57,560
And so we ran and we jumped the fence

916
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:01,720
and we ran down the third base side

917
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:04,520
and we hopped onto the field.

918
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:08,280
And I slip and slid from third base

919
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:11,200
over the mound towards first.

920
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:17,360
And then took off running and security yards chased me

921
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:22,360
for like a block, but I was more agile back when I was 17.

922
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:28,600
And it's still one of my greatest memories.

923
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:30,400
It's honestly very cool.

924
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,720
Yeah, Zach, that's a lot cooler

925
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:35,640
than my story about a billboard.

926
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:43,320
But also I saw that billboard and I was like,

927
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:44,480
oh, that's so cool.

928
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:52,960
And as you pass Julie Maxwell's apartment,

929
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:56,160
you look up and see a billboard that has an electric guitar

930
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:58,960
and a baseball bat.

931
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:01,720
And what else was it?

932
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:07,400
It was like a convertible and like a basketball.

933
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:09,440
I remember the basketball and the electric guitar.

934
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,680
I could see both of those pictured perfectly.

935
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:14,800
And for some reason, all this billboard says is

936
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,080
trucks bring it.

937
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:22,360
Well, yeah, we haven't talked about the local

938
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:27,040
rookie league baseball team outside of town, the trucks.

939
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,240
The trucks, the contention trucks.

940
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,320
John weakly says, trucks bring it.

941
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:40,000
He's got season tickets.

942
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:43,520
And as you're trudging through contention,

943
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:47,880
you hear screams coming from the East

944
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:51,880
and you can echo locate well enough here in contention

945
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:55,280
to know that these screams are coming from

946
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:58,680
the first church of contention as you're heading North

947
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:01,560
up towards Clark Bishop's home.

948
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:03,600
Does it sound like a lot of screams?

949
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:08,200
It sounds like a lot of screens, tens of screens.

950
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:11,840
Is it loud enough that we would stop in our tracks for it?

951
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,200
It's not something we're just catching a whiff of

952
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:15,240
on the air.

953
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:19,960
Off in the distance about when you hit A plus storage,

954
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:22,480
you start hearing it and it's just.

955
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,760
Just shit like that.

956
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,400
I don't want you to go there.

957
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:36,360
I just want us to feel bad about not going there.

958
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:37,320
Just enough.

959
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:38,160
Yeah.

960
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,840
John, I think if we stay the course,

961
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:43,320
the whole point of our mission here is that overseer

962
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:48,280
will come back and I'll save everyone.

963
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:50,360
I don't think there's anything that's going to help us

964
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:51,440
by helping them now.

965
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:55,480
If they just are released into a world full of this goo,

966
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,520
we need, we need me and myself.

967
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:58,360
Yeah.

968
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:00,840
I mean, I'm still pretty knife brained buddy.

969
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:04,680
So I'm in no position to run off

970
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:07,480
and save a bunch of people at this church.

971
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:09,320
I think we need all the help we can get.

972
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:10,160
All right.

973
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:12,440
And those pills, did you say you had pills?

974
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:14,000
You didn't have pills.

975
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,240
What was the deal with that?

976
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:18,600
I gave you, I gave you, I gave you health.

977
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:19,600
I healed you.

978
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:20,880
The one, okay.

979
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:25,480
If I took an aspirin or something.

980
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:27,480
I genuinely forgot it was just for one.

981
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:29,760
No, I healed you.

982
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:30,600
I healed you.

983
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:31,440
I healed you.

984
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:32,840
Good job, buddy.

985
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:34,160
Thank you.

986
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:36,440
Let's go, let's go, let's go get that book.

987
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:37,640
Let's go get that book.

988
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,360
Yeah, we just keep going.

989
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:41,800
Clark, your home.

990
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:42,640
How's it look?

991
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:43,480
Well, as you're approaching,

992
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:45,320
you do notice that the creek

993
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:50,320
that runs kind of behind your house, dry, completely dry.

994
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:52,600
But the home itself looks the exact same

995
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:54,880
as you left it yesterday.

996
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:58,560
Yeah, I opened the door.

997
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:03,560
That familiar smell just wafts right up through your nose.

998
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:06,360
And it's almost unseemly

999
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:11,320
because you're not the man you were who lived here.

1000
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:14,360
John, welcome to my parents' house.

1001
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:19,360
I guess it's mine, but is this what you need?

1002
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,480
Is this where the book could be?

1003
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:22,880
Yeah, I think so.

1004
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:26,160
No drugs is what we decided.

1005
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,320
There's no drugs here.

1006
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:28,760
Joe, go ahead and roll luck.

1007
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:30,600
Fuck you.

1008
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:39,480
That's my favorite joke that I've done on this podcast.

1009
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:46,720
That one's just for the GM.

1010
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:53,480
Some of them gotta be.

1011
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:57,120
Clark, not even like wine or anything?

1012
00:48:58,920 --> 00:48:59,760
Definitely not.

1013
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:03,000
There might be a beer or two in the fridge.

1014
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:06,400
Please bring me two, one, two drink

1015
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,960
and one, two press to my head.

1016
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:11,600
I do, I go to the fridge and grab a couple beers.

1017
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:16,200
Okay, you need to move the TV.

1018
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:18,800
Just take it off the stand.

1019
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:21,040
Oh, okay.

1020
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:22,120
And I go and do that.

1021
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:26,120
I just, I guess, pluck it up and put it down on the ground.

1022
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:28,200
Is that it, John?

1023
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:30,120
You don't see a door?

1024
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:31,880
Nope, the TV's on the ground now.

1025
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:32,760
What do we do?

1026
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:34,640
God damn it, ow.

1027
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:39,720
Okay, I don't know, really try poking around in there.

1028
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:42,480
Is it just a flat top where this TV's staying?

1029
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,600
I just kinda start smacking on it.

1030
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:46,200
When you start smacking on it,

1031
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:48,880
it kinda like wobbles a little bit.

1032
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:52,320
Two corners stay put and the other two corners kinda wobble.

1033
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:54,800
Oh, I got something here, it's moving.

1034
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:58,080
And you can remove the entire flat wood piece

1035
00:49:58,080 --> 00:49:59,880
from underneath the television.

1036
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:00,700
I do so.

1037
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:04,540
And underneath, there's the door of a safe

1038
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:08,820
that has an alphanumerical keypad.

1039
00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:12,020
I think maybe the Wheel of Fortune letters

1040
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:13,980
or maybe your name or some other bullshit

1041
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:15,620
that meant something to your parents, I don't know.

1042
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:19,980
Clark is gonna remember that his mother always told him

1043
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:24,460
that I was born with the best letters.

1044
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:27,940
Clark always remembers.

1045
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:31,540
Yeah.

1046
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:37,140
It's only three in the morning.

1047
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:39,180
It's shocking you can't remember this.

1048
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:44,180
Yeah, he's gonna put in R-S-T-L-N-E.

1049
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:48,380
And the door unlocks.

1050
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:49,220
Yeah.

1051
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:54,900
And when it opens, you see a book inside

1052
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:58,060
that is made out of uncured leather

1053
00:50:58,060 --> 00:51:00,540
and it's got like hair on it.

1054
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:02,660
Some pimples, maybe a rash.

1055
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:05,020
There's stretch marks on the spine.

1056
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:06,300
I found my book, Jon.

1057
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:07,860
I grab it and hold it up.

1058
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:10,900
And as soon as you grab it.

1059
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:13,060
Yeah, I was worried about that.

1060
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:16,620
All right, you guys can stop recording.

1061
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:20,080
Oh, you son of a bitch.

1062
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:23,700
Do I really stop recording right there?

1063
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:24,540
No.

1064
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:25,540
Oh shit, okay.

1065
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:28,780
Your eyes go blank and suddenly you're standing

1066
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:31,700
in the abandoned water park, Splashylvania.

1067
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:33,900
You're looking up at the two-fanged plunge.

1068
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:35,740
Julie Maxwell fires a bullet

1069
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:38,420
that tears through the body of Leo Piston.

1070
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:41,780
You raise your firearm and immediately put lead

1071
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:44,740
in the crazed Julie Maxwell's forehead.

1072
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:48,820
The two bodies begin slumping down the twin slides,

1073
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:51,180
leaving a trail of blood behind.

1074
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:52,060
You blink.

1075
00:51:52,060 --> 00:51:55,500
You're standing in the suburbs in the middle of the street

1076
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:57,380
in front of Dr. Marie Jacobs' house.

1077
00:51:57,380 --> 00:52:00,700
You see James the mill worker floating off the ground,

1078
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:04,180
Aiden and Alice Little are bravely holding a vacuum

1079
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:06,160
to this hovering man's feet.

1080
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:10,620
But from out of the vacuum bag erupts an oily black ooze

1081
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:14,180
that immediately encompasses the twin children.

1082
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:17,900
And you can see them fighting violently

1083
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:20,820
inside the muck that envelops them.

1084
00:52:20,820 --> 00:52:22,900
When you look over at Jon,

1085
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:26,580
you see the same viscous sludge is dripping

1086
00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:28,940
from every hole in his face.

1087
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:29,860
You blink.

1088
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:32,300
You're staring at a gaunt young boy.

1089
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:34,220
The two of you are hanging in a cage

1090
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:37,100
above a deprived and debaucherous crowd.

1091
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:39,780
The cage is shocking you, burning your skin

1092
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:44,660
as the ceiling of this juice box lowers slowly.

1093
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:46,660
You don't wanna do it.

1094
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:48,220
You don't wanna push him back in,

1095
00:52:48,220 --> 00:52:51,780
but either one of you dies or you both die.

1096
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:55,220
You push the boy's body back into the plexiglass room

1097
00:52:55,220 --> 00:52:58,220
just in time for the roof to come down,

1098
00:52:58,220 --> 00:53:02,500
squeezing the boy pulp onto the ravenous audience below.

1099
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:03,820
You blink.

1100
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:06,660
You're all over the CSU campus.

1101
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:08,740
This one's a rapid fire montage,

1102
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:10,540
murder after murder after murder,

1103
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:12,300
finishing off with your own,

1104
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:16,060
your own yourself ending screwdriver plunge.

1105
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:17,240
You blink.

1106
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:19,900
You're standing outside of Bean's pond,

1107
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:22,300
an ankle deep muddy overflow,

1108
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:24,500
and you know what you are capable of.

1109
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:27,940
You know what you are and you scream

1110
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:31,060
as you jump and bury the knife in your hands

1111
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:34,020
down through the skull of Anne Love,

1112
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:36,580
the woman who murdered your parents.

1113
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:38,020
You blink.

1114
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:43,020
You're back standing in your parents' living room.

1115
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:47,700
You look down and your hands are covered in blood

1116
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:50,180
and the blood begins moving,

1117
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:53,940
collecting between the covers of this book

1118
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:56,300
made from human skin,

1119
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:59,540
and the blood begins forming pages,

1120
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:04,100
each page a result of your actions.

1121
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:05,860
Roll Sanity.

1122
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:08,500
It's going to be a one slash one D six plus one.

1123
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:11,580
Don't pass.

1124
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:12,760
31 on a two.

1125
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:17,340
Roll a D six.

1126
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:20,920
Real quick, Joe,

1127
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:23,580
did you hear how Zach just like rattled off

1128
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:25,540
all the Bishop murders?

1129
00:54:25,540 --> 00:54:28,120
Total like basic true crime bitch.

1130
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:32,020
I forgot I forgot.

1131
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:34,620
I forgot to tell Thomas to take his headphones off.

1132
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:36,920
Yeah, it was like,

1133
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:38,380
it seems like I shouldn't be hearing this,

1134
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:39,860
but I'm glad I did.

1135
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:44,140
It was a trip down memory lane.

1136
00:54:44,140 --> 00:54:45,060
I rolled a one.

1137
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:48,260
I swear it's a oneer.

1138
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:51,780
So I cling, isn't there like a thing though?

1139
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:53,020
Isn't it if you were at one,

1140
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:54,340
it's still not good.

1141
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:56,300
Well, no, it's just that the San loss for that

1142
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:57,780
was a D six plus one.

1143
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:01,460
Okay.

1144
00:55:01,460 --> 00:55:04,260
Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.

1145
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:05,840
Yeah, so Clark is a,

1146
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:07,220
Clark is,

1147
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:10,060
he's not there.

1148
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:11,240
His sanity is gone.

1149
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:14,020
One of the pages flits open

1150
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:16,540
and these pages that have been created

1151
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:21,540
by the blood rushing from your hands form letters.

1152
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:25,820
And you see these two words just repeated

1153
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:28,140
over and over and over.

1154
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:32,900
And in the middle is this picture of this hooded figure

1155
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:37,580
with this light that is just beaming from its face.

1156
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:39,300
However, in this one,

1157
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:43,580
you can very clearly see your own face,

1158
00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:46,720
the face of a young Clark Bishop,

1159
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:50,940
and you feel compelled to begin chanting,

1160
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:54,540
knuckles almond, knuckles almond, knuckles almond,

1161
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:56,740
knuckles almond, knuckles almond.

1162
00:55:56,740 --> 00:56:00,020
John Lee Pettymore, you see a flash of light

1163
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:02,340
and Clark Bishop is no longer standing

1164
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:04,300
in front of his entertainment center

1165
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:07,300
in his living room of his parents' home.

1166
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:08,700
Holy shit.

1167
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:18,540
Hey Thomas.

1168
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:19,540
Hey Zach.

1169
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:21,260
What does John Lee Pettymore want to do?

1170
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:22,340
What does he see?

1171
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:24,880
Clark is just gone?

1172
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:25,720
Yep.

1173
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:26,680
Is the book gone too?

1174
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:27,520
Yep.

1175
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:28,520
Does the TV turn on?

1176
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:29,360
Yep.

1177
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:32,220
John presses play on the VCR,

1178
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:34,540
lies down on the couch,

1179
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:38,480
and lets himself watch Wheel of Fortune for 20 minutes.

1180
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:43,480
Clark, you're standing in a dark alleyway.

1181
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:52,600
Yeah, yeah.

1182
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,840
And walking toward you.

1183
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:56,720
Is it Jim Cook?

1184
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:58,340
It's Jim Cook.

1185
00:56:58,340 --> 00:57:00,060
Do I have any agency over this?

1186
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:03,080
Do you want agency?

1187
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:05,300
I mean, I know what happens.

1188
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:06,580
Clark remembers.

1189
00:57:06,580 --> 00:57:09,460
And immediately, in the shadows,

1190
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:11,260
you just pounce on him,

1191
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:13,420
throw him to the ground.

1192
00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:17,340
And with both of your hands wrapped around his neck,

1193
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:19,940
he begins struggling.

1194
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:21,240
They didn't have to die.

1195
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:22,820
They didn't have to die.

1196
00:57:22,820 --> 00:57:23,820
You couldn't find it.

1197
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:24,940
They didn't have to die.

1198
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:29,940
In your grasp, in the grip of both of your hands,

1199
00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:33,940
wrapped around Jim Cook's throat,

1200
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:36,160
you feel his life extinguish.

1201
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:38,260
Holy shit.

1202
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:41,100
Oh no.

1203
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:45,140
Oh my God.

1204
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:11,580
What's up, what's up everybody?

1205
00:58:15,140 --> 00:58:17,380
It's Zach, I'm Zach.

1206
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:19,180
I'm just gonna slide in here real quick

1207
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:22,940
at the end of this episode to drop some pretty big news.

1208
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:27,940
So Taylor and I are moving to South Korea on Thursday.

1209
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:31,420
It's been our dream for years to teach English in Korea.

1210
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:33,600
We're so absolutely stoked.

1211
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:37,720
This long time plan is finally coming to fruition.

1212
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:40,640
I know, I know you're super excited for us

1213
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:43,880
and not at all wondering what is happening with the show.

1214
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:46,660
Well, that's just super supportive of you.

1215
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:48,740
Thank you so much.

1216
00:58:48,740 --> 00:58:52,240
But if you are wondering, I have some answers for you.

1217
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:56,320
So first off, we've already recorded the next full arc

1218
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:57,320
of season one,

1219
00:58:57,320 --> 00:59:01,120
and we've started recording the final arc that follows.

1220
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:04,240
This campaign has enveloped my life

1221
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:07,160
like a squamous viscous ooze,

1222
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:10,560
and I'm not going to compromise its quality

1223
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:13,560
just because I'm moving halfway around the world.

1224
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:16,080
We've had a fair amount of practice recording over Zoom

1225
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:17,980
at this point, so I'm not worried about anything

1226
00:59:17,980 --> 00:59:21,280
except that I'll have to wake up early to record now.

1227
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:26,080
All MPC voices will soon become much deeper.

1228
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:28,900
Next week, we'll be releasing a bonus episode

1229
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:32,420
from our Patreon vault to try to coax some of you

1230
00:59:32,420 --> 00:59:36,220
into giving us money during a full-blown economic crisis

1231
00:59:36,220 --> 00:59:38,640
because we're fucking ruthless.

1232
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:42,820
And the Friday after that, on August 14th,

1233
00:59:42,820 --> 00:59:45,940
the penultimate arc of season one

1234
00:59:45,940 --> 00:59:48,860
of pretending to be people begins.

1235
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:52,740
I'm so gosh darn jazzed for y'all to hear it,

1236
00:59:52,740 --> 00:59:56,040
and I'm so pumped to play through the end of this campaign.

1237
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:57,680
Ha!

1238
00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:59,480
Last thing, fear not.

1239
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:02,240
The end of season one will not be the end

1240
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:03,960
of pretending to be people.

1241
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:08,960
I have delicious, insidious plans for the future.

1242
01:00:09,620 --> 01:00:13,280
Seriously, thank you all so much for listening.

1243
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:16,180
We have such a blast making this show,

1244
01:00:16,180 --> 01:00:18,680
and we're so stoked y'all enjoy it.
