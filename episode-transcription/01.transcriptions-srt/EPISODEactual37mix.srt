1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
Hello, one. Hello, all. Hello, y'all.

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,600
It's your best friend with a trash-eating problem, Wolf the Dog.

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:14,600
We are hitting you live from 694.2 PTBP.

4
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:20,600
It is December the 6th, and the time is noon o'clock, my babies.

5
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:25,900
Mmm, sounds like it's about garbage bin o'clock for y'all, Wolfy boy.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,800
Speaking of trash, earlier I took my dog, Wolf the Dog,

7
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,300
to go find him something to fill his little belly up with.

8
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:40,900
But upon venturing outside the sky, I suddenly darkened all around us for a little bit.

9
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:43,100
Y'all ever seen an eclipse?

10
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,600
It was like that, but a little different.

11
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:51,400
It was real spooky, y'all. Wolf nearly shit his little old britches.

12
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:55,500
Which wolf did that? I'll let y'all figure that one out.

13
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:01,600
When I came back down to the studio, I found a note attached with a thumbtack to the inside of my door.

14
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,100
It is emblazoned with a solid green triangle and says,

15
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:10,100
For a wolf at the top, I guess it's this week's Howlin' with Wolf.

16
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:14,200
It comes from user Chucklin' Boy over on the subreddit.

17
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:19,100
He's an Android user, but logged into iTunes on his computer to leave a review.

18
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:22,500
This boy sure knows how to make ol' Wolfy blush.

19
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,400
Chucklin' Boy writes,

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,700
Something fitting, isn't that?

21
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,300
And remember, the mission is over when the world ends.

22
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:46,800
For all of you out there listening, be sure to stop by the subreddit.

23
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,800
We are starting to see more discussion around the Greater Delta Green Cannon,

24
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,400
as well as game running tips and general show stuff.

25
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,100
See y'all there!

26
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,500
Wolf bless you, Chucklin' Boy.

27
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,900
You are my fire, my one desire.

28
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:06,800
Believe when I say, if you want to write a message for Wolf to read on air,

29
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:11,000
tag us on Instagram or Twitter, at PretendingPod,

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:18,000
or write a five-star review on Apple Podcasts and email us at pretendingpod at gmail dot com.

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,900
Fuck Mark Zuckerberg, it's time for the news.

32
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:29,200
A tall, gaunt, humanoid figure with translucent skin and comically long arms asked Clark for the book.

33
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,900
Keith shot it until it dissipated.

34
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:37,400
A couple of city cops showed up to check on the shots fired at the city cemetery.

35
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:44,500
John mentioned Marvin Glass and the city cops apologized and left to mind their own damn business.

36
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:50,000
These heroes of ours then went to lay their fallen former co-workers to rest.

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:57,600
Inside the tomb was a cloaked figure, an older Clark Bishop chanting from a piece of ancient parchment.

38
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:05,000
The words on the paper turned to little sparks that danced around, bathing the boys in a warm light.

39
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Clark charged at himself, only to grab two fistfuls of cloak and bonk his head

40
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:17,000
smack into the wall of Ari Manstein's mausoleum, where an older version of himself just stood.

41
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,500
Y'all, none of that made a damn lick of sense to me, but that doesn't mean I'm not hungry.

42
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:28,500
Filling me up always is kudzu with no backbone.

43
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I could come close, but I'd probably forget Kansas, Illinois, Arkansas, Oklahoma, uh, uh,

44
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Iowa, Tennessee, Kentucky, Kentucky.

45
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,500
One more Nebraska corner hit us up toward the top.

46
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,000
Nebraska. Nice. Nice. Got it.

47
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:09,500
I didn't know we hit the corner in Nebraska. I'm pretty proud of myself because I am traditionally terrible at geography.

48
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:13,500
Hey, can you describe to me in great detail the state seal?

49
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,000
It's two bears.

50
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Describe, yeah, I'm just kidding.

51
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,500
Two bears.

52
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,500
Two bears. Okay.

53
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,500
It's just two bears.

54
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:25,500
I'm gonna hit this vape one more time and then, uh, I'll hit my vape.

55
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,500
Well, cause yours has too much, but mine kind of dissipates real quick.

56
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,500
Get out.

57
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,000
If I can find it in my pocket.

58
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,500
Get out.

59
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,500
I'm not gonna do it.

60
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,000
Get out.

61
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,500
I'm sitting down.

62
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,500
I'm making brown.

63
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,500
Just fight your nicotine habit.

64
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,500
I can't do it. I refuse to do it.

65
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,500
What if I stabbed you with a mechanical pencil every time you hit your jewel?

66
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,500
I would hire Phillip Morris to pursue you.

67
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,500
What if you lost a sanity point every time you hit your jewel?

68
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,500
That's dope.

69
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,500
Okay, I'm good.

70
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,500
Next campaign. The no vape campaign.

71
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:03,500
I rolled an 87. I got that out of the way.

72
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:08,500
Alright, Luke hit his jewel 365 times between the last sessions.

73
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,500
He is insane.

74
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,500
Certifiable.

75
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,500
He's come back around.

76
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,500
He's got four new characters to show off and go crazy.

77
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,500
And go crazy and immediately die from.

78
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,500
Okay, let's see.

79
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:25,500
Dude, I was, okay, so I made a resolve not to drink as much last night

80
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:31,500
cause I was listening to this episode and we were dumb.

81
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,500
This last one?

82
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,500
Kinda.

83
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:40,500
The man in black is like, you're here with the book.

84
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,500
And then we instantly start talking about a second you.

85
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,500
And then we don't put it together.

86
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,500
I was like, god damn it.

87
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,500
Anyway.

88
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,500
Hindsight.

89
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,500
But I also forgot everything that happened in that episode.

90
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,500
Good to listen back to.

91
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,500
Good to be embarrassed by yourself.

92
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,500
It's important.

93
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:04,500
Did you see his list of pros and cons?

94
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,500
Oh yes, incredible.

95
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,500
Pros, the keeper's voices.

96
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,500
Cons, the keeper's voices.

97
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,500
Wait, what was that poster?

98
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,500
I like that a lot.

99
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,500
He just posted on our RPG.

100
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:21,500
That one made me a chuckling boy.

101
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,500
Welcome to the chuckle hut.

102
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,500
Are you guys ready?

103
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,500
Yeah, I'm ready.

104
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,500
We'll find out.

105
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,500
The three of you wake up.

106
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,500
You just feel this immense pain.

107
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:35,500
It's almost like a shock has just covered your entire body.

108
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,500
Your stomach hurts.

109
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,500
You just feel it all up in your throat.

110
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,500
Your ears are ringing and pulsating.

111
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,500
It's dark.

112
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,500
It's cold here.

113
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,500
It smells.

114
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,500
What is that smell?

115
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,500
It's like savory?

116
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:55,500
There's a sweetness to it and your eyes begin to adjust.

117
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,500
There's a pool of blood on the floor.

118
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,500
The corpse of Ari Manstein is kind of in it.

119
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,500
Her coffin is flipped over on the cold dirt.

120
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,500
You look at each other.

121
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,500
Blood splatter has speckled each of you.

122
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:12,500
John, Kevin, Lee Pettymore all in black tactical gear.

123
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:17,500
Keith Vigna in his brightly colored polo and boat shoes.

124
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:24,500
Clark Bishop in an old contention PD uniform currently holding a thick black cloak.

125
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,500
The shock begins to wear off.

126
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:36,500
You feel a searing pain on your chest, on your back, on the bottom of your left foot and inside your dominant palm.

127
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,500
Is everybody left handed?

128
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,500
What was wounded again?

129
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,500
Our chest, our back?

130
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,500
Pussy and our crack?

131
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,500
Yes, all four.

132
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,500
It is the chest, the back, the left foot and inside your dominant palm.

133
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:54,500
I would assume you're all right handed unless you've specified otherwise.

134
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,500
John Lee Pettymore kind of seems like he would be left handed.

135
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,500
Did it change when you went into Kevin?

136
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,500
You're ambidextrous I think.

137
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:08,500
It's the brain not the body so your brain wouldn't switch handedness I don't think.

138
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:13,500
So Kevin was left handed so now you've got a really weak right hand.

139
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,500
Right, he hasn't built up the fucking muscles.

140
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,500
Damn dude, I know how to solve that.

141
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:23,500
It's a lot easier to be right handed like everyone in the world.

142
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:27,500
Literally every person except for liars.

143
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:32,500
If you had trouble learning to write growing up it's because you're a liar.

144
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:39,500
My mom is left handed like a liar and she always put the pencil in my left hand when I was growing up.

145
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,500
To try to make you left handed?

146
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,500
Be like me son.

147
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:48,500
My dad's left handed and he went to Catholic school and part of their thing was trying to make kids right handed who were left handed.

148
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:53,500
He also broke his arm when he was a really young kid and he still remained left handed.

149
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,500
He said that is how strongly it took to him.

150
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,500
The Catholics, they can instill some stuff.

151
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,500
But not handedness apparently.

152
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,500
No.

153
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,500
Okay sorry.

154
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,500
Chest, back, left foot, dominant hand?

155
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,500
Yes sir.

156
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,500
You said the palm.

157
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,500
Yes inside the palm.

158
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,500
Can I look at my palm?

159
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:14,500
When you look in your palm there are letters burned into your hand.

160
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:19,500
It says T-I-L-D-E.

161
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,500
Tilde.

162
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,500
That's in Keith's hand?

163
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,500
That's in all three of your hands.

164
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,500
Okay. Do you boys have Tilde written in your hands?

165
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,500
I do.

166
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,500
Does it look burned in? Is that what you said?

167
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,500
Burned.

168
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,500
Yeah.

169
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:38,500
I think I would want to check what our backs say but I mean I'm looking at my hand and

170
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,500
then I'm looking in front of me and do I still see old Clark?

171
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,500
He's holding the robe.

172
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,500
I shake out the robe.

173
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,500
Nice.

174
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,500
Does anything come out?

175
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,500
His depends.

176
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,500
Yeah.

177
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:54,500
God.

178
00:09:54,500 --> 00:10:01,500
He's a great sorcerer but he's fully incontinent.

179
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,500
Smells like real estate agent.

180
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,500
That we made shit his pants.

181
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,500
Okay so yeah.

182
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,500
This takes me back.

183
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,500
Yeah.

184
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,500
Boys my back is burning.

185
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,500
Is there something written?

186
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,500
Mine too.

187
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,500
My foot.

188
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,500
Here.

189
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,500
I'll check your back while I take my shoe off and you check my foot.

190
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,500
And we play Twister.

191
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,500
Keith struggles to rip his way too tight polo off.

192
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:30,500
It hurts really badly as you pull off your way too tight polo as the polos texture moves

193
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:34,500
across the burned skin on your chest and on your back.

194
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,500
Ow.

195
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:46,500
And you all see that on each of your chests burned in are the letters M-A-R-V-I-N.

196
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:52,500
On your back it says D-R-E-W.

197
00:10:52,500 --> 00:11:02,500
And on the bottom of each of your left feet it says M-A-G-G-I-E.

198
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:08,500
Clark the bottom of your left foot when you look at it, it also has this very distinct

199
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,500
lack of skin, a discoloration.

200
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,500
What do you mean?

201
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,500
Like it's translucent?

202
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,500
No like this skin has been eaten away.

203
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,500
Okay.

204
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,500
Is it black?

205
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,500
Yeah.

206
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,500
And what's it in the shape of?

207
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,500
A circle with six smaller circles.

208
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,500
Okay.

209
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,500
Surrounding it.

210
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,500
That's only on Clark's foot?

211
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,500
Yes it is.

212
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,500
Gotcha.

213
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,500
Do these burns look like the behold a fool brand?

214
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,500
They do not.

215
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,500
Okay.

216
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,500
These look much cleaner.

217
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,500
Okay.

218
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:41,500
I need everyone to roll a sanity check for me.

219
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,500
23 but I still failed.

220
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,500
Oh shit.

221
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,500
I crit fail with an 88.

222
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,500
Wonderful.

223
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,500
Thomas?

224
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,500
84.

225
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,500
All three of you lose one sanity.

226
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,500
Let's see where that puts you each.

227
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,500
That puts me at 19.

228
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,500
That puts me at 18 which is also my breaking point.

229
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,500
I'm at 11.

230
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,500
My breaking point is 8.

231
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,500
All right.

232
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:08,500
So what we have here is a new breaking point for Clark Bishop, a new breaking point that

233
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:13,660
is going into effect now for John Lee Pettymore that he broke into on the last episode or

234
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,900
two episodes ago.

235
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:20,740
And then fittingly John Lee Pettymore as well as Clark Bishop both rolled over their power

236
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,020
so we'll see what that does moving forward.

237
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:29,340
What we're going to do for this third and final breaking point for each of you, you're

238
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:35,060
going to roll a D100 on the Call of Cthulhu 7th edition manias table.

239
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:38,120
We're going to roll it three times and then choose.

240
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,920
You can choose which mania you want to take.

241
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:41,920
Okay.

242
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:47,960
Thomas, go ahead and roll up some numbers for me.

243
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:53,760
61, 62, and 51.

244
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,760
All right.

245
00:12:54,760 --> 00:13:00,120
61, Kleptomania, the irrational compulsion for stealing.

246
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:09,960
62, oh boy, Ligeromania, L-I-G-Y-R-O, mania, uncontrollable compulsion to make loud or

247
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,200
shrill noises.

248
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,200
I really don't.

249
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,200
Please don't do that one.

250
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,960
I really suggest.

251
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,000
That one's called The Listener's Delight.

252
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,320
I really suggest you don't choose that one.

253
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:26,460
He somehow went down to zero Patreon subscribers.

254
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:31,380
Another podcast was chugging along just fine and then all of a sudden it tanked.

255
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:36,340
That asshole Thomas tried to go all Michael Winslow.

256
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,580
And did you roll 51 or 52?

257
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:39,580
51.

258
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:47,780
51 is Gymnomania, G-Y-M-N-O mania, which is a compulsion with nudity.

259
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:48,780
A compulsion with nudity?

260
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,100
Like it has to be nude?

261
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,100
It says with nudity.

262
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,100
With nudity.

263
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,100
Yeah.

264
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,140
I'm going to just take the stealing one.

265
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,140
Yeah.

266
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,820
That's like the most useful in an RPG.

267
00:13:58,820 --> 00:13:59,820
That absolutely makes sense.

268
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:03,820
John Lee Pettymore, John Kevin Lee Pettymore, now a kleptomaniac.

269
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:07,820
Joe, do you want to roll three times for me on this table here?

270
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:08,820
Sure.

271
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:09,820
Let's see what you got.

272
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:10,820
A 30.

273
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:11,820
Okay.

274
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:12,820
A 94.

275
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:13,820
Okay.

276
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:14,820
A 92.

277
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:21,820
I'm not using these dice for the rest of the night.

278
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:27,500
Or you get hot it all out.

279
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:34,500
A 30 is Colromania, C-O-U-L-R-O mania, it's an obsession with clowns.

280
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,500
Okay.

281
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,500
Interesting.

282
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,500
A 92, you said?

283
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,500
No, what was it?

284
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,500
94?

285
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,500
Uh-huh.

286
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:47,020
94, Theomania, belief that he or she is a god.

287
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:52,020
Might actually make some sense here.

288
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,020
Interesting.

289
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:55,020
And what was the third number?

290
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,020
94?

291
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:59,020
The 94 was the belief in god.

292
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,020
Belief in god.

293
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,020
Oh, 30.

294
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,020
Nope.

295
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,020
We did that one already.

296
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,020
Okay, the 92.

297
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:08,020
92, Technomania, an obsession with new technology.

298
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:10,020
I think I got to take the god one.

299
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:11,020
I think so.

300
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:13,020
That's the dopest one.

301
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:15,020
That seems obvious.

302
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,020
Read the phrasing on it one more time.

303
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:19,020
Belief that he is a god.

304
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,020
That's what I thought.

305
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:22,020
Yep, pretty straightforward.

306
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:30,020
Those are going to dictate your actions, dictate not so much, but help push you with new objectives

307
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,020
and persuasions.

308
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:33,020
Oh, shit.

309
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:42,020
The three of you are in this still black crypt, pure darkness, and there is the corpse of

310
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:47,020
Ari Manstein, there is the coffin flipped over, and then you know that outside of this

311
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:52,020
tomb are still the three android men, their corpses are out there.

312
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,020
What would you like to do?

313
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:57,020
Clark rushes Kevin and I'm trying to tackle Kevin.

314
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,020
Alright.

315
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:02,020
If the two of you could roll unarmed combat against each other to see who gets the upper

316
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,020
hand.

317
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:07,020
Can I roll firearms to see if I can shoot him first?

318
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,020
Yeah.

319
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:11,020
Is he rolling against my unarmed for that?

320
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:16,020
I got a 41 on a 70.

321
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:21,020
I got a 56 on a 60.

322
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:24,020
Alrighty, Thomas rolled a d10 for damage.

323
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,020
Six.

324
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:32,020
As Clark Bishop starts getting up, cloak in hand, he runs toward John Lee Pettymore.

325
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:34,020
I'm screaming as I'm running toward him.

326
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:38,020
I mean, I'm just guttural yelling as I charge you.

327
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:42,020
Can I hear what that's like to put me in?

328
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:48,020
Okay, that spooks me, so I draw my pistol and fire and shoot him in the thigh.

329
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:51,020
God damn it, Kevin, you told me about that.

330
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,020
It was old me.

331
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,020
I saw old me.

332
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,020
Who are you?

333
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,020
Why couldn't you warn me about that?

334
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,020
Who are you?

335
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:58,020
Why are you trying to attack me?

336
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:00,020
God damn it.

337
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:04,020
And I start to feel the blood pooling from the side of my hip.

338
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:09,020
I see shots fired and it's this dimly lit place, but I see the big loud flashing of

339
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,020
the muzzle of the gun.

340
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:13,020
All three of you can't hear anything anymore.

341
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:15,020
Your ears are ringing.

342
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:18,020
Tinnitus is on the verge of happening.

343
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:25,020
I rush over to Clark and try to apply first aid to his.

344
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:28,020
Roll first aid for me.

345
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:30,020
That's a 37 on a 60.

346
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:33,020
Roll a d4 and tell me what you're doing.

347
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:36,020
Applying pressure with a one.

348
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,020
A one.

349
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:42,020
You apply a one hit point amount of pressure to the wound, stopping the bleeding.

350
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,020
Cool.

351
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,020
That's what's important here.

352
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:46,020
I am at 13 hit points.

353
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:49,020
As I'm holding Clark's leg, I look at both of them.

354
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:51,020
I'm like, why are you fighting?

355
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:53,020
What is happening?

356
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:56,020
I look at Kevin, or Kevin John.

357
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:58,020
I don't, I'm sorry.

358
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:02,020
I just, it just freaked me out.

359
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:04,020
I just, I'm sorry.

360
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:10,020
I look up at Kevin John and I just have a look in my, on my face of like, what the fuck?

361
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:13,020
Like John is just looking down at his body in confusion.

362
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:17,020
Guys, what the, what the fuck did we just see?

363
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:19,020
I mean, we're all burnt up.

364
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:22,020
We got Tildy, Maggie, Marvin.

365
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,020
Tildy.

366
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,020
Oh shit.

367
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,020
Oh, hey Clark.

368
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,020
Oh fuck.

369
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,020
I'm sorry, brother.

370
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,020
I remember now.

371
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:32,020
It seems like I failed a sanity check or something, but I'm sorry.

372
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:34,020
I'm awful sorry for shooting you in the leg.

373
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:36,020
We ought to solve this Tildy thing.

374
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,020
I shouldn't, I shouldn't have startled you.

375
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,020
I'm sorry, John.

376
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:41,020
Well, you know how I am when I get startled.

377
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:44,020
I just, I deserve to be shot real hard in the hip there.

378
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:49,020
That, that made sense.

379
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:54,020
The most forgiving role-playing character that has ever existed.

380
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:57,020
Remember you think you're a God now.

381
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:01,020
Keith stands up and opens the door to the mausoleum to let some light in here and to

382
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,020
get some fresh air.

383
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:09,020
Fresh air pours in, specifically shining a nice light on the corpse of your fallen coworker.

384
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:15,020
I go over to Ari's body and kind of look at both my fellow officers and start trying to

385
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:18,020
get her back into the coffin.

386
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:23,020
That way we can just leave here without feeling guilty and go fucking figure some shit out.

387
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:27,020
As you grab the lifter, the burn on your dominant hand just hurts.

388
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:29,020
So like an open wound.

389
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:32,020
So extremely painful when you go to grab her.

390
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:35,020
Try kicking her with the foot that weren't burned.

391
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:41,020
I just power through the pain of it and lift her up into the coffin, shut the coffin.

392
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:44,020
And I think where it's laying right here, it's good enough.

393
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:46,020
Nobody else needs to come into this mausoleum anyway.

394
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:50,020
So Clark is going to limp over back to the cloak and I'm going to pick it up and wrap it

395
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:53,020
around my waist as a giant makeshift bandage.

396
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,020
Absolutely.

397
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:58,020
Was there a book that old Clark was reading out of?

398
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:01,020
He had a piece of parchment that he was reading off of.

399
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:03,020
Is that anywhere around here?

400
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:07,020
You kind of saw it as he was chanting.

401
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:13,020
You saw the page kind of burn up and then turn into these lights that danced around you.

402
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:16,020
Any of you guys see, I guess, what the words were?

403
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:18,020
What the hell did he do?

404
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:22,020
I think maybe the words are on us now.

405
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:27,020
What does Tildy, Marvin, Drew and Maggie, what do they have in common?

406
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:29,020
Other than we all know them.

407
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:33,020
This is what old Clark is trying to emphasize to us.

408
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:37,020
These might be the four keys to what's going on here, these people.

409
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:40,020
Do you think their locations on our bodies mean anything?

410
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:43,020
If they do, I don't know what it is right now.

411
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,020
We can try to figure that out.

412
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:47,020
Drew is a pain in my back.

413
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:53,020
Well...

414
00:20:53,020 --> 00:21:00,020
We thought Maggie was six feet under.

415
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:04,020
Keith, you saw Maggie, her body missing a foot, right?

416
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,020
That's true, yeah.

417
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:08,020
That makes sense.

418
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:16,020
I don't know what the others would mean, but we have gotten so distracted in the past 40 minutes.

419
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:19,020
Do you guys still want to go with this plan for Marvin Glass?

420
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:23,020
I mean, yeah, I think we should still try to call those guys.

421
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:26,020
I've got this handy wound here that makes it look like you guys shot me.

422
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:28,020
That's true.

423
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,020
Does it look like you guys shot me?

424
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,020
You're an even better Chewbacca.

425
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,020
I mean, it doesn't make it look like we shot you.

426
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:37,020
It literally is because he did.

427
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:42,020
What if we need to make these people eat these parts of themselves?

428
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:44,020
Let's focus less on that right now.

429
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:46,020
Do you have a better theory?

430
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:50,020
I don't have a better theory, but I think we ought to stick to the plan.

431
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:54,020
You don't think we need to make Tilde eat her palm and Marvin eat his chest and Drew eat his back and Maggie eat her other foot?

432
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:56,020
Well, I don't know where Tilde is, so...

433
00:21:56,020 --> 00:22:04,020
Unless you have better suggestions, I say we get back to the police car as we were going to before we ran into the cops,

434
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:08,020
ran into this crazy fucking long-arm beast.

435
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:10,020
Let's get in the car.

436
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,020
Beast, you beast!

437
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:21,020
Give these FBI or not people a call and drive over to Marvin's and try to get some shit figured out before we fucking kill each other.

438
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:24,020
You can do whatever you want to once we get there.

439
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:27,020
Well, no, you can't. We do this teamwork.

440
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:31,020
We can talk about it on the car ride, but we do need a game plan.

441
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:34,020
Say it all goes off without a hitch and we're in, then what?

442
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:39,020
How about we get to the car first, get out of this fucking cemetery. How about that? Let's do that.

443
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:42,020
And I just turn heel and I walk out of the mausoleum.

444
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:44,020
I start limping out behind him.

445
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:51,020
You all limp out as the bottom of your left foot hurts so fucking bad with every step that you take,

446
00:22:51,020 --> 00:23:00,020
and you limp past these three dead android dudes and you keep moving through these crypts, these above-ground tombs,

447
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:08,020
these mausoleums of the city cemetery, and you make your way to the parking lot where there are only two cars present.

448
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:17,020
Keith Vigna's contention police department cruiser and Clark Bishop's silver Honda Accord provided by the Circle of Knowledge.

449
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:21,020
Do you have anything in your car you need to get out before we head on out?

450
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:26,020
Let me check. Anything in that car? I'll open up the glove box.

451
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:31,020
Yeah, as long as you brought your guns and your couple phones with you, then you're good to go.

452
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:33,020
It's all on my person.

453
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:38,020
Let me make a stop by the city free clinic real quick and see if we can't get patched up by Sawbones.

454
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:40,020
They might ask us why we all have...

455
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:43,020
That's why we go to the free clinic, not the emergency room.

456
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:49,020
Well, you do have the best drive, so I assume you're going to be driving and you can take a pit stop if you want.

457
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:52,020
And then he looks at me and he's like, what the fuck does that mean?

458
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:54,020
You're the best driver, is what I meant to say.

459
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:58,020
I'm hurt pretty bad, fellas. It wouldn't bother me at all.

460
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,020
Okay, let's do that then.

461
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:06,020
Hey, watch out!

462
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:25,020
Welcome to the city free clinic where all your troubles are hurts.

463
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:30,020
Want to take another pass at that?

464
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:37,020
Welcome to the free clinic in the city where all your free troubles are taken care of by the pain that stops.

465
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:41,020
Seems like something's been lost in translation.

466
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:47,020
I go up to the front counter and I'm like, hey, my buddy's hurt and I got a burn on my foot. Can you help me?

467
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:49,020
Yeah, of course, we can help you.

468
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:53,020
And I'm about five points shy of normal myself, if you know what I mean, so...

469
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:58,020
Yeah, sure, go ahead and fill out these forms and wait in the waiting room until we call your names.

470
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:02,020
I put down Rex Thrasher for my name.

471
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,020
Very cool name.

472
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:05,020
I put in Peter Deeter for my name.

473
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:10,020
Clark writes down Clark Bishop and then looks at your guys' sheets and then just crosses it out.

474
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:15,020
And he writes down...

475
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:17,020
Clark Chisup.

476
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:24,020
He writes down Chaz Fauntleroy.

477
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:27,020
Chaz Fauntleroy.

478
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:29,020
Lil Chaz Fauntleroy.

479
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:35,020
Okay, let's roll a bureaucracy check.

480
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,020
Oh!

481
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,020
Hell yeah.

482
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:38,020
I happen to have some of that.

483
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,020
I have some of that too.

484
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,020
I have 50 bureaucracy.

485
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,020
I got 30.

486
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:50,020
Okay, so here's what I'm going to do. Whoever has the highest is going to roll, but the other two can roll to assist in this since you're all together.

487
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:55,020
For each success, I'll give a plus 10% bump to whoever's got the highest.

488
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,020
I've got a 40.

489
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:57,020
I have 50.

490
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:58,020
30.

491
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,020
I rolled a 16.

492
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:00,020
Hell yeah.

493
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,020
So we don't need it, right?

494
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,020
Oh yeah, you don't need it.

495
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:04,020
Yeah, you just take care of business.

496
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:11,020
And sir, what is the format on which the payment will go through on the forms?

497
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:14,020
If you bill it to the First Church of Contention.

498
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:16,020
Oh yeah, absolutely. They have an account with us.

499
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:18,020
Thank you so much for coming in.

500
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:23,020
Everyone roll a D4 and gain that many hit points back.

501
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,020
Where's that one I handed?

502
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:25,020
Oh, there it goes back to you.

503
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,020
Four!

504
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,020
Woo!

505
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:28,020
Three!

506
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,020
Woo!

507
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,020
Three, but I only need one to get back up to max.

508
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:32,020
Give one to Joe.

509
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:33,020
Two.

510
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:35,020
That puts me at a 16.

511
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,020
I'm at 19.

512
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,020
I'm at 25.

513
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:40,020
You guys roll out back to the parking lot feeling much better.

514
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:43,020
It's 2 p.m. The sun is high in the sky on December 6th.

515
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:46,020
It's still a pretty cold day here in the city.

516
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,020
Which cars did you bring both of them?

517
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:49,020
I think we all hopped into the PD car.

518
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:51,020
Oh, that's right. I was there.

519
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:53,020
So, what would you like to do?

520
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,020
Okay.

521
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:55,020
It's time to Chewbacca it.

522
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,020
We're gonna go.

523
00:26:56,020 --> 00:27:00,020
You guys were gonna call while you went to Jim Cook's house to go look at the book?

524
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:03,020
Oh, that's right. We're gonna go to the book and then go to Marvin's. That's right.

525
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:10,020
So, we call the FBI in quotation marks.

526
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:14,020
I was just waiting for Taylor to finish ringing.

527
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:20,020
You hear the click and then you hear an automated voice say,

528
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:27,020
Thank you for calling. For prompt service, please identify yourself and any associates.

529
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:32,020
Keith Vigna, Clark Bishop, John Lee Pettymore III.

530
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:35,020
Thank you. Has the incursion been stopped?

531
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,020
No.

532
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:39,020
Thank you. Has the incident been covered up?

533
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:41,020
Yes.

534
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:43,020
Thank you. Is that all?

535
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:47,020
No, but I would like to talk to someone about it.

536
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:49,020
Thank you. Is that all?

537
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:57,020
I have nothing else to say to a robot. I would like to talk to the officers that I talked to a couple of days ago.

538
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:59,020
Thank you. Is that all?

539
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:01,020
Yes.

540
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,020
Thank you.

541
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:04,020
And the line goes dead.

542
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:07,020
Yeah, that robot wasn't really in a negotiating mood.

543
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,020
Not really.

544
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:11,020
We learned precisely jack shit from that.

545
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,020
Fuck.

546
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:14,020
Can I go pee real quick?

547
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:19,020
Just piss your pants, Luke. I mean, they are yellow.

548
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:23,020
You can see a picture of Luke's pants on the Instagram page at PretendingPod.

549
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:25,020
I peed my pants.

550
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:28,020
You can see an after picture after he peed his pants.

551
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:29,020
Only on Instagram.

552
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:30,020
Only on Instagram.

553
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,020
And they got more yellow.

554
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,020
I'll put it on Twitter too.

555
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:36,020
So real fast on my breaking point that I just hit, does that take effect now?

556
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:39,020
We'll go ahead and just say like it'll take effect now.

557
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:41,020
I know that you like role playing wise, like.

558
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:45,020
Because we usually, it was when we went to bed, so I wasn't playing it too hard just now.

559
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,020
Sure, yeah.

560
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:50,020
You can just evolve into your character from here as you move forward.

561
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,020
Okay.

562
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:57,020
And then actually I said earlier that that was your final breaking point, but what was your sanity at when you hit that?

563
00:28:57,020 --> 00:29:01,020
So I'm now at 18, so that makes me go down, so my next breaking point will be at 6.

564
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:06,020
At 6, so you'll gain another disorder at 6 sanity points.

565
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:09,020
As well as Thomas, when you hit your breaking point, what were you at?

566
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:10,020
I'm at 18 right now.

567
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,020
Gotcha.

568
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,020
And what's your power?

569
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,020
Power is 12.

570
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:16,020
Right, so then you'll also have another breaking point at 6.

571
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,020
Right, yeah.

572
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:18,020
Well now mine's at.

573
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,020
Oh, from earlier.

574
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,020
From earlier, yeah.

575
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,020
Sure.

576
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,020
I think it's 7.

577
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,020
Okay, cool.

578
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:27,020
So your next breaking point will be at 7, and then Luke just has one breaking point left.

579
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:30,020
Yeah, my next one is at 8, so after that I'll be bing bong.

580
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:32,020
I'll be a bing bong boy.

581
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,020
You'll go insane forever.

582
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:36,020
To join the ranks of all my other characters.

583
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:38,020
Have we ever talked about regaining sanity?

584
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:39,020
Can you do that in this game?

585
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:43,020
You know, there is a mechanic in Delta Green for regaining sanity.

586
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:45,020
Oh, it's going to the therapist, right?

587
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,020
It is, yeah.

588
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,020
So there's a couple ways that you can do it.

589
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:48,020
Oh, yeah.

590
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,020
Because we did that in one of the wonderful campaigns.

591
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:53,020
Yeah, when we had a campaign where we were doing shorter scenarios.

592
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:58,020
Shorter scenarios with home scenes in between is how you traditionally play Delta Green,

593
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:02,020
but I have given you guys no downtime in this campaign whatsoever.

594
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:07,020
And downtime is normally when you would bump stats, train new stats.

595
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:12,020
You might reconnect with your family, go to the therapist, any of those things.

596
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,020
We haven't done any of that.

597
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:17,020
We'll maybe try it on the next campaign to add that back in,

598
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:19,020
but for this one we're not going to worry about it.

599
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:24,020
And then as far as gaining sanity besides going to the therapist,

600
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:30,020
in a lot of Delta Green scenarios, at the end there will be bonuses for sanity.

601
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:35,020
If you take out a threat or whatever, then you can gain sanity back.

602
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:40,020
I'm all for that, but you guys have only done things that would lose sanity.

603
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,020
Right.

604
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:48,020
This campaign's not really meant to make you guys feel better in any way.

605
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,020
All right, cool.

606
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:51,020
So what is the plan?

607
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:53,020
You guys called and you were on your way.

608
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:56,020
We just got ourselves fixed up at the free clinic.

609
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,020
Yeah, we called.

610
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,020
Didn't get to talk to anybody.

611
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,020
Yep.

612
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:02,020
Although you told them that we wanted to talk to them and they said okay.

613
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:03,020
Right.

614
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:07,020
So I suppose that we will wait for a callback from them.

615
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:09,020
They'll probably call any minute.

616
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:11,020
I'm sure they will.

617
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:15,020
So John, I think you're going to be driving us to Jim's house.

618
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:16,020
All right.

619
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:22,020
While we're there, I want to tell you that we in the real world got these little notebooks from Joe,

620
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:25,020
which have fun Missouri facts on the back of them,

621
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:30,020
and they list one of our five primary crops as forage, and none of us knew what that was,

622
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:36,020
so I looked it up, and forage are crops grown specifically to be grazed by livestock or consumed as hay.

623
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,020
That was my guess.

624
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,020
Oh, that makes sense.

625
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,020
Makes sense.

626
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:42,020
It doesn't have to go on air, but I just looked it up and I wanted to tell you guys now.

627
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:45,020
To keep that methane pumping, baby.

628
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:49,020
We're an edutainment podcast now, technically speaking.

629
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:57,020
This is actually, there's going to be a pretty heavy shift towards Missouri agriculture facts in the coming weeks.

630
00:31:57,020 --> 00:32:01,020
Which might prove controversial to some listeners, but...

631
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:07,020
If you didn't know, Kansas City is the largest city in Missouri, followed by St. Louis, followed by Springfield.

632
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,020
What?

633
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:13,020
But 66% of Missouri is covered in farmland, so we're lucky to not be farmers.

634
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,020
That's a pretty cool number.

635
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:16,020
Your family are farmers.

636
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:19,020
Dumb hillbilly farmers.

637
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:23,020
Rich, dumb hillbilly farmers.

638
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:26,020
You can pipe in the Missouri facts theme that we wrote here if you want.

639
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:28,020
Yes, that we recorded earlier.

640
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:32,020
Well, it's Missouri facts and we're going downtown.

641
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:38,020
You can post the back of this on the Instagram so all our followers can get their Missouri facts.

642
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:40,020
It's between our listeners.

643
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:44,020
If you want to know what the state animal or insect is, check out our Instagram.

644
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:46,020
Don't Google it.

645
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:55,020
But for more of this campaign, keep listening right now as we stop talking about Missouri.

646
00:32:56,020 --> 00:33:01,020
Yeah, so the last time we decided was to go to Jim's.

647
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:05,020
Yeah, we're going to Jim's, looking for that book and anything else that might be of interest over there.

648
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:10,020
Clark directs you to the neighborhood that he was in earlier today, actually.

649
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:17,020
And as you guys are pulling in, you see that there are flyers put up on every poll.

650
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:21,020
And on each of these flyers is Clark Bishop's face.

651
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:29,020
Underneath it says, Clark Bishop, call cops if seen. Say, quote, violent EDP.

652
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:33,020
As cops, we know what EDP is and it means...

653
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:36,020
As cops, you know that violent EDP...

654
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:38,020
Oh, I don't have internet right now.

655
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:40,020
Why is the wifi down?

656
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:41,020
Oh, look it up.

657
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:47,020
In the meantime, did you know that the state fossil is the crinoid?

658
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:49,020
Emotionally disturbed person.

659
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:57,020
And that's a fun one because there's a lot of road cuts in the highways and stuff out through the limestone of the Ozark Mountains.

660
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:59,020
And you can go up there and just collect fossils.

661
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:01,020
Crinoids, trilobites.

662
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,020
Nice.

663
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,020
Dinosaur bones.

664
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:06,020
Thanks for that fun Missouri fact.

665
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:09,020
EDP is emotionally disturbed person.

666
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,020
That is right.

667
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,020
And you're a violent one apparently.

668
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:14,020
All of that is probably correct.

669
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:23,020
You drive through and you see all these suburban homes look the exact same, but Clark does point out one that says Jim Cook on the mailbox outside.

670
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:27,020
There it is.

671
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:33,020
As we pull in, I see one of these and I'm like, Clark, what did you do?

672
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:34,020
What are you talking about?

673
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:38,020
And I point to one of the flyers on a light pole.

674
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:40,020
Oh, shit.

675
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:50,020
I mean, I woke up on the driveway here and there was a jogger walking around.

676
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:59,020
He asked what I was doing here and I just told him I didn't know and I must have come off hanky to him or something.

677
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:00,020
I don't know.

678
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:03,020
But he left in a hurry after I talked to him.

679
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:04,020
Did you tell him your name or?

680
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:06,020
Yeah.

681
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:09,020
I told him I was an officer from contention.

682
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:10,020
Next time you should kill him.

683
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:15,020
Keith looks down at his feet, doesn't believe what Clark just told him, but shrugs it off.

684
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:18,020
I'll human what Clark just told me.

685
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:21,020
Would that be against something of mine or is it just if he passes or not?

686
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:31,020
You know, now that we've been rolling against each other for unarmed combat and now shooting each other, I think we could get to a point in time where you can human against each other.

687
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:34,020
So, Clark, you would roll human.

688
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:39,020
Or if he, like a liar, if he has a higher skill in persuade maybe, could he roll that versus my human?

689
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:40,020
Oh, I like that. Yeah.

690
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:41,020
Yeah.

691
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:43,020
So, whatever is higher, I think.

692
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:46,020
I got a 41 out of a 50 human.

693
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:51,020
I'm rolling on my persuade, which is a 40, and I fail.

694
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:57,020
I'm not telling you the whole truth, but I'm definitely telling you essentially what happened, but I am withholding something.

695
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:59,020
You know, Vigna, trust ish him.

696
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:01,020
I'm fine with that for now.

697
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:03,020
Let's just get in here, get this book and-

698
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:06,020
Before we go in, there's a few rules, all right?

699
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:13,020
You don't step on Superman's cake, you don't spit in the wind, and god damn it, you don't mess around with Jim.

700
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:14,020
Those are the rules.

701
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:16,020
Do you- you must-

702
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:18,020
Did you know Jim very well, Jon?

703
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:20,020
It's just a song, boys. Let's go.

704
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:23,020
Okay.

705
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:29,020
I look at both of them, kind of roll my eyes, and then walk into Jim's house.

706
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,020
The door is locked.

707
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:33,020
I use my lock picking skill to open the door.

708
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:34,020
Ooh, dope.

709
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:37,020
An 11 on a 50.

710
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:38,020
A crit.

711
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:41,020
A crit success. Do you want to describe how quick and smooth you are?

712
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:45,020
I flick the doorknob with my finger, and it just pops open.

713
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:51,020
Got the Fonzie touch.

714
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:59,020
It kind of hurt my fingernail, but I kind of wave it off and look back at the boys, open it up, and walk in.

715
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:05,020
As you guys walk in, the house smells kind of old, but in a nice, calming, familiar way.

716
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:07,020
There's an upright piano in the entry.

717
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:15,020
The living room has papers and binders strewn all over the coffee table, couch, chairs, the floor, really just everywhere all over this house.

718
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:22,020
The sun is shining in through the window, illuminating a fair amount of dust that is moving slowly upward.

719
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:25,020
Hey Clark, do you remember where this particular book is?

720
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:29,020
Clark starts walking toward where he last saw the book.

721
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:38,020
Clark, as you walk toward where you last saw the book, you walk through the kitchen, you see that the picture that you saw in the fridge is still there,

722
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:44,020
and sitting out on the kitchen counter are the other items that you saw when you came through here last time.

723
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:51,020
And then sitting out in the living room with all the papers and binders and stuff all over the place, you see this big book.

724
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:56,020
It's leather and thick, and it has a symbol on the front that you obviously have come to recognize.

725
00:37:56,020 --> 00:38:01,020
It's the big circle. It's the Circle of Knowledge logo surrounded by six smaller circles.

726
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:10,020
And the thick leather book has a girthy wooden bookmark, and it is stuck toward the back of the book.

727
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:15,020
I pick up the book, and I just kind of lift it. This is the one I was talking about.

728
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:19,020
So is that bookmark, is that the only page you can open it up to?

729
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:22,020
Last time, for sure. Let me see if that's still the case.

730
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:23,020
It is.

731
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:24,020
Let's us try to open it.

732
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:28,020
Well, can you try to take the bookmark out and put it in a different page?

733
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:29,020
I'll give it a shot.

734
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:37,020
As you try to do that, the bookmark won't go into any other pages, and it is as if earlier said, as a magnet is almost keeping it away.

735
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:40,020
What happens when Keith and John try?

736
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:50,020
The three of you are all now hands and feet all in trying to pry this book open.

737
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:54,020
Keith is on the floor with his feet in the air, you know, kind of tugging on it.

738
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:56,020
Trying to get the boat shoe grip on there.

739
00:38:57,020 --> 00:39:00,020
We should see if John has any WD-40.

740
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:02,020
Jim.

741
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:05,020
I should see if I have any WD-40.

742
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:08,020
Well, let's just take this with us.

743
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:15,020
It seems, I don't really know, I mean, why are we even coming to get this in the first place? Maybe as an offering or something?

744
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:19,020
Will you describe to them what they see on that page that it only opens up to?

745
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:26,020
Yeah, absolutely. So this book does open up to this one specific page, and it is written all over.

746
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:30,020
And over and over and over on this ancient parchment is the phrase,

747
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:34,020
It is only through death that he may rise again.

748
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:38,020
It, death, and he are all capitalized.

749
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:49,020
And drawn over this obsessive scrawl is a picture of a hooded figure that you just saw with a brilliant light shining from its maw.

750
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:55,020
So Maggie told me that this is some kind of sacred text to their circle.

751
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:59,020
She called it her dad's book even, like it was maybe his personal copy or something.

752
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:03,020
Well, hell, Clark, it almost sounds like they're talking about you.

753
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:15,020
Well, now that I've seen the picture and I've seen me, the old me, I'm starting to wonder that maybe I'm more important to their plans than I realized.

754
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:17,020
What did it say again?

755
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:18,020
Only through, oh.

756
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:21,020
It is only through death that he may rise again.

757
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:22,020
Hey, fellas, I died.

758
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:24,020
That's what I'm saying, man.

759
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:25,020
Oh.

760
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:28,020
And you rose again, and there's this picture in here.

761
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:32,020
Just for a record, Joe didn't put that together until just now, and I got chills.

762
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:36,020
It's some kind of, it's almost, it's prophetic.

763
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:40,020
You could be some kind of messiah, some kind of a child of prophecy.

764
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:43,020
I've been starting to believe that more and more lately.

765
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:47,020
There's a manic glint in your eye when you say that.

766
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:56,020
And I kind of, I look, the way that Clark said it and what I saw in his eye, I kind of start to believe it too.

767
00:40:56,020 --> 00:41:04,020
You also, when you're going through this, you do feel on your person you have an envelope with a letter in it that you found right here that you still have with you.

768
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:07,020
What are you touching yourself for?

769
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:12,020
Oh, I forgot about this, and I pull it out.

770
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:20,020
Fellas, this is a, when I was trying to pry the book open to another page, this kind of flitted out of the book, and I hand it to him.

771
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:33,020
It is a letter written by Jim Cook that in detail refutes, quote, the revelation of the overseer, end quote, calling it the scratches of a broken man.

772
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:42,020
The letter then goes on to outline new guidelines, including the immediate reassignment of all members of the disposal unit.

773
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:48,020
And at the top of the page, it says, faith through knowledge is just called knowledge.

774
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:53,020
That faith through knowledge bit there, that's a, that's the motto of the circle.

775
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:55,020
Oh, okay.

776
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:57,020
As you guys are standing around.

777
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:04,020
You escaped me the first time.

778
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:11,020
Clark, do you feel like you did a pretty thorough and successful search of these papers the first time you were here?

779
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:14,020
It was so thorough that there was no chance of missing anything.

780
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:16,020
Excellent.

781
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:17,020
Incredible.

782
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:21,020
That's why you are, no, were the best cop on the force.

783
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:23,020
Now it's Drew.

784
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:25,020
I don't know, I think Drew might be.

785
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:31,020
If we're, if we're sharing now, I laid out a couple other interesting items on the counter in the kitchen there you can take a look at.

786
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:33,020
We go take a look at those.

787
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:43,020
As you guys go and take a look at those, Clark Bishop, you feel a drop hit your nose, just a little wet drop hit your nose.

788
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:54,020
And as it runs down to the tip of your nose, you inhale, you kind of, oh, and you snort in and it is, um, it's, it's vodka.

789
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:56,020
I look up, you know, like recognize it.

790
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:58,020
Oh yeah, there's a stain on the ceiling.

791
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:00,020
It's pooling.

792
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:08,020
You can see that the drywall is wet and hits you again, hits you again.

793
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:14,020
The two of you, as you go into the kitchen, you see that there are three items sitting out on the kitchen counter.

794
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:25,020
There's a Ziploc bag containing two small items, a single tarot card, the devil with several bullet holes in it, as well as a taxidermied baby squirrel.

795
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:29,020
There's also a leather holster for a firearm.

796
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:34,020
There isn't a gun in it, but there is a small bit of text tooled into the leather.

797
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:41,020
It says scientia morse est underneath it. It says dash K uppercase K.

798
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:47,020
And then there's also a ring. It's got some small little curly hairs on it.

799
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:55,020
It is smooth and silver with a little plateau on top. It is completely smooth with no markings.

800
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:59,020
What are the items in the, oh wait, are these all in the bag?

801
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:04,020
No, it's just a taxidermied baby squirrel and the tarot card with bullet holes in it.

802
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:08,020
Yes. The other two things, the leather holster and the ring are just sitting out.

803
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:12,020
I walk in to join the fellows. There's vodka dripping from the ceiling.

804
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:14,020
Is this a two story house?

805
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:16,020
Nope. I think it was.

806
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:18,020
Oh, it was.

807
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:20,020
Yeah. I went upstairs to get pants. I'm pretty sure.

808
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:22,020
Oh yeah. It's a two story house.

809
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:24,020
Is this a two story house?

810
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:28,020
Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely it is.

811
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:31,020
There's vodka dripping from the ceiling?

812
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:36,020
Yeah. Let's go check it out.

813
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:41,020
Before we go, I feel like there's a 30 percent chance that this holster belonged to Kevin. 33 percent.

814
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:44,020
So I just take that and put it on my belt and get my gun.

815
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:49,020
Did you find these and put them all here just cause you, what did you think?

816
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:53,020
I don't really know. I kind of wondered if that squirrel was the work of Julie Maxwell.

817
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:56,020
She was into taxidermy, but there's no way for me to know.

818
00:44:56,020 --> 00:45:03,020
As soon as I heard, as soon as I saw that it was a taxidermy squirrel, I thought of Julie Maxwell and of that hat that I put on.

819
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:05,020
Well, hat.

820
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:07,020
Did you try the ring on?

821
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:09,020
I don't think I did.

822
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:11,020
Is it big enough to fit on any of my fingers?

823
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:22,020
Yeah. When you slip it on, there's a small glow on top of it on the flat part and the glow shows a small logo as you slip it on.

824
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:28,020
And the logo is an M created out of four double helices.

825
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:30,020
Wish I would have put that on.

826
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:34,020
Do I feel any different having it on or just that happens?

827
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:37,020
Nope. But now the Ringwraiths know where you are.

828
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:39,020
I look around.

829
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:45,020
Keith, you recognize that symbol? That was on the robot man we fought back at James's house.

830
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:49,020
Pretty sure that probably has something to do with Marvin Glass, I would assume.

831
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:53,020
Oh, yeah. That could be. Or Maggie.

832
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:55,020
What if Maggie's making robots?

833
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:58,020
What's the double helix then? Does that ring any bells?

834
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:04,020
I mean, other than what we saw stamped where the penis of the robot should have been.

835
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:07,020
But I mean, is that significant to Marvin or Maggie in any way?

836
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:09,020
Is it M?

837
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:13,020
Oh, no, no. I don't know. I'm just, I got Marvin on my mind.

838
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:15,020
Just the shape of DNA. I don't know.

839
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:17,020
Marvin!

840
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:18,020
I had a...

841
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:20,020
Marvin!

842
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:23,020
Sorry, I had Marvin on my mind.

843
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:25,020
God.

844
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:32,020
I had previously taken one of my shoelaces off to tie around my pants to keep it up.

845
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:38,020
I take the other shoelace off, slip it into the ring, and I'm wearing it around my neck now.

846
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:40,020
Dope. Love it.

847
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:42,020
Keith, I found that in a pile of pubes.

848
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:49,020
It could... I'm going to assume that it was just squirrel hair.

849
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:52,020
No, it was pubes. You might just want to wash it.

850
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:54,020
Midsummer spoilers.

851
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:57,020
Well, I just kind of... I kind of shake...

852
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:02,020
While it's around my neck, I shake it off and hope most of the pubes come off.

853
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:05,020
But at this point, there's some nice sunlight coming in through the kitchen window,

854
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:09,020
and you can see the pubes kind of swirl around in a nice...

855
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:11,020
And the American Beauty song starts playing.

856
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:18,020
At the end of the day here, one of the least concerns I have is touching pubes at this point.

857
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:21,020
When was that ever a concern for you?

858
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:25,020
That vodka was dripping from the ceiling in there.

859
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:28,020
I don't know much about construction of houses,

860
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:32,020
but that would have to be a lot of vodka upstairs to make it drip through the ceiling, right?

861
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:34,020
Let's go check that out.

862
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:36,020
I'll head on up there.

863
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:38,020
I follow behind him.

864
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:46,020
As you're walking through, there's a couple hallways, some rooms, couple rooms, a bathroom, a closet.

865
00:47:47,020 --> 00:47:52,020
But you start to realize as you're walking in these doors that the vodka is spilling from a place

866
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:58,020
where there isn't a room that could actually put you in that spot in the living room.

867
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:03,020
Can I just put my ear to a wall that I think would lead to where that vodka would be coming from?

868
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:08,020
Yeah, as you put your ear to the wall where you think the vodka would be dripping from,

869
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:13,020
you actually do hear a slight static noise.

870
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:18,020
But if there was a room there, it seems like it's been maybe walled off or something.

871
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:20,020
Let's search for a door.

872
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:25,020
Well, we either search for a door or it's not there anymore. We need to bust in through it.

873
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:27,020
After we don't find a door, we can bust through it.

874
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:30,020
Would tapping on the wall reveal a door if there was one?

875
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:32,020
Or, you know, just a simple search rule.

876
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:35,020
That's kind of what I was envisioning.

877
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:40,020
With the three of you working together, let's have the two assist the one with the best search,

878
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:43,020
as we did earlier with the health that was unnecessary.

879
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:45,020
I've got a 40. I've got a 50.

880
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:47,020
I've just got the basic 20.

881
00:48:48,020 --> 00:48:51,020
98. We're not going to find this door.

882
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:53,020
It doesn't even, it can't get me down to 50.

883
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:55,020
I could have found it with my search rule.

884
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:57,020
I rolled a 13.

885
00:48:58,020 --> 00:49:00,020
I mean, we could have both helped him, but it's still the 78.

886
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:06,020
You know full well that there is an open room on the other side of this wall, but you cannot find a door to get there.

887
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:12,020
I want to use my athletics to just falcon kick this wall where there's not a stud.

888
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:14,020
Roll athletics.

889
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:16,020
43 on a 50.

890
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:19,020
Nice. Keith's foot is stuck in the wall.

891
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:22,020
I helped to pull him out.

892
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:24,020
No, no, no. Push him through.

893
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:48,020
How am I the only one trying to pull over?

894
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:57,020
How can you have enough drowning out of the noise?

895
00:49:57,020 --> 00:50:03,020
There's no time to go.

896
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:12,020
There's no time to go.
