1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,300
Welcome to the Bone Zone, my babies!

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,500
It's your sexual guru, Walt the Dog,

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:14,300
and I'm here to make sweet love to the radio airwaves live from 694.2 PTBP,

4
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:21,200
Contentions' naughtiest radio station for hot Christian singles in your area.

5
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,700
I'm starting to have those weird dreams again, y'all.

6
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,200
The newest batch was wild.

7
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,700
I went to the coffee shop in my dreamland

8
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:35,100
and proceeded to ask for the oldest and stankiest grounds,

9
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,800
as is my custom.

10
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,500
The coffee attendant denied me my rightful treasures,

11
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,200
so I started shaking them violently.

12
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,600
The head fell off,

13
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:49,300
and 42 snakes erupted from the hole where the head once was.

14
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:54,500
The snakes all started chanting in unison and calling me The Reginald.

15
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,100
I cried, but instead of tears,

16
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:01,200
little tiny baby wolf started pouring out my damn eyes.

17
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,000
All the baby wolf started doing a dance

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,800
and raised me up to the damn heavens,

19
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,300
where I proceeded to become a god.

20
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,300
And then my teeth fell out and I had sex with my dad.

21
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,000
Wait, who is my dad?

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,800
W-was I even birthed?

23
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,300
If you can interpret anything from these,

24
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,900
please reach out and be my Joseph.

25
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,600
You know your Wolfie loves a coat of many colors.

26
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,700
Seriously, what do these dreams mean?

27
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:32,600
Tell me at PretendingPod on Twitter and Instagram,

28
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,300
or tag PretendingToBePeople on Facebook, why don't you?

29
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:40,100
Or how about you write us a five-star review on Apple Podcasts

30
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,200
with your analysis of my fancies.

31
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,400
And maybe I'll read it on the show,

32
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:50,200
like I'm now about to read this five-star review from Ram Oden.

33
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,300
They write,

34
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,700
Flat Earthers believe that we live on a cosmic Frisbee

35
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,200
that God threw at the beginning of time.

36
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,700
I assume Wolf the dog will be there to catch us at the end.

37
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:03,200
Much love, y'all are delightful.

38
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,400
Thank you so much for putting this out.

39
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,800
I listen to dozens of podcasts and this is one of two

40
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,100
that puts the numbers in me on a weekly basis.

41
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,200
I don't get to play as much as I'd like,

42
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,100
responsibilities and all,

43
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:19,100
but I'll be handling for the first time this weekend

44
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,700
and you've inspired me to move ahead with it.

45
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:25,700
Also, we'll be introducing the luck mechanic mashup

46
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:29,600
into standard Delta Green for a bit more pulp.

47
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,100
I will say again,

48
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:34,200
I do not know what the fucking internet is

49
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,700
or what the fuck a podcast is,

50
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:41,000
but I definitely know when someone's being a sweetie to me.

51
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,700
Thank you, Ram Oden.

52
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:46,100
I hope whatever it is you're doing is fun as hell.

53
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,400
Speaking of fun as hell stuff

54
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,600
and things that are on the internet,

55
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,300

77
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,200
You thought the Denison at Glasses Compound was gross.

78
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,800
Come watch our dumb faces while we play

79
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,600
the filthiest scenario Delta Green has to offer.

80
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,900
Something, something, something.

81
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,400
It's time for the news.

82
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,600
Turns out Drew wasn't Drew.

83
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,700
Some of y'all were paying attention.

84
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,300
Councilwoman Carrie pages in the body

85
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,300
of Drew Andrews was handcuffed, ankle cuffed

86
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:24,100
and tossed in the trunk of the red Mitsubishi

87
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,000
where she still resides.

88
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,300
But the car is hidden off the side

89
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:31,800
of the highway on the outskirts of contention.

90
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,600
These dumb ass ex cops were keen enough eyesight wise

91
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,900
to spot some sort of entry checkpoint

92
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,900
at contention's only exit.

93
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:43,800
Keith Vigna snuck past a growing grazing gazer

94
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,200
sitting in a dunk tank in the parking lot

95
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,200
of Hotel Motel just watching for something.

96
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,500
But he completely missed Keith Vigna making his way

97
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,200
back to the gang with his treasured McGuffin,

98
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,800
his father's watch.

99
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,400
The whole rest of the episode was these goobers

100
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,900
taking turns wearing this cursed object

101
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,700
and seeing visions.

102
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:08,400
Well, gear up for more of that.

103
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,100
Then strap down and throw your hands in the air

104
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:16,500
because it's time for Kudzu with No Backbone.

105
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,500
["No Backbone, No Backbone, No Backbone"]

106
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,900
Hello, all you wolf pups out there,

107
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:52,700
listeners of this show here on 694.2 PTBP.

108
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,900
Welcome to Pretending to Be People.

109
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:58,700
I am your handler, your keeper, your GM, your narrator,

110
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,500
your idiot god, Zach.

111
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,500
Thankfully, I am joined today by three of my dearest friends

112
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,900
and three of your dearest player characters.

113
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,200
That's right.

114
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,000
I've got the contention police officers here.

115
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,900
What up?

116
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:12,700
Yeah, yeah.

117
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,000
That's it.

118
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,500
Thanks for hanging out.

119
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,500
It's been Pretending to Be People.

120
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,200
See you next episode.

121
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,000
Like and subscribe.

122
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,700
It's just like not a lot's going on right now, so.

123
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,000
Yeah, sign up for the Patreon.

124
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
No, I mean, what people like about this podcast

125
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,100
is that you get to read between the lines

126
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,000
and kind of draw your own picture.

127
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,400
So this was really a fan service episode.

128
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,500
Giving the people what they want.

129
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,700
It was a little, you know, it's a little over the top,

130
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:48,800
a little cheesy, but I think the true PTBP fans

131
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,300
are going to love what they just heard.

132
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:51,800
Yeah.

133
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,300
We're out.

134
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,300
That was episode 79 or 8, whichever one.

135
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,000
Thanks, guys.

136
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Thanks for listening.

137
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,500
79.

138
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,700
We are in 79 now.

139
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,200
Hey.

140
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,300
That's more than I thought we were going to do by like 50.

141
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,600
Yeah.

142
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,200
Yeah.

143
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,100
I'm still having fun, though.

144
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,100
I've been looking forward to it all day.

145
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:13,700
Ditto.

146
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,300
All day.

147
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,800
If looking forward to it means nervous and scared

148
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,500
the whole time, then yes, I have been

149
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,200
looking forward to it all day.

150
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,600
We'll be fine.

151
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,200
I think everything's going to work out great.

152
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,000
If you want, we could just take it from here.

153
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,500
Oh, yeah.

154
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,900
If you could, I'd love to see that happen.

155
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:31,400
Yeah.

156
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:31,900
Cool.

157
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:36,500
So guys, you're standing in front of the Goo God.

158
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,000
Sure.

159
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,500
OK.

160
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,600
It's actually pronounced Gew God.

161
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,300
Yeah, we're not trying to get fancy here.

162
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,100
Also, this isn't your job anymore.

163
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:44,600
Oh, shit.

164
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,400
Sorry.

165
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,000
Kick him out.

166
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
So what you've deduced is that you just have

167
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,700
to hurt its feelings, and you win.

168
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:54,500
So if you can say something really hurtful about this Goo.

169
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,300
You're just dang old jiggly is all you are.

170
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:01,700
Oh, the monster screams in pain.

171
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:04,700
Hey, Goo, people think that you and I would get along really

172
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,200
well.

173
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:09,200
Whoa, no.

174
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,800
No.

175
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,500
I'm a loner.

176
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,300
It's working.

177
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,100
It's working, guys.

178
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,600
It looks like what else do you have?

179
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:21,700
Hey, Goo, this new fella I met over here

180
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,200
says that we look like brothers.

181
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:30,100
Oh, that's not bad.

182
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,400
He has a crush on you.

183
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:36,000
Yeah, the Goo apparently thinks Drew is not bad looking, so.

184
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,400
OK, let's actually start.

185
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:42,000
You guys are really close to winning.

186
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,700
I shoot it.

187
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:45,200
So we ended the last episode with all three of you

188
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:50,100
taking turns, putting on this watch, and seeing a vision,

189
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,300
and then the watch slipping off, and then putting it

190
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,300
right on somebody else.

191
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:57,100
I believe John Lee, Kevin Moore III just slapped it

192
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,400
right on Clark Bishop.

193
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,900
And then they were questioning John Lee.

194
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:05,200
Pettymore was like, if I put it on again, will it be the same?

195
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,300
But he asked it to the sky or something.

196
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:10,500
And then Keith Wigner was like, well, I'll just do it.

197
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,900
And so Keith Wigner slapped on the watch.

198
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:16,600
His eyes come back to reality as the watch slips off

199
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,800
into his other hand.

200
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,100
He won't give up that easy.

201
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:25,500
It took me so long to catch what you said.

202
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,200
I had to match the rhythm of his belly with my head.

203
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,300
That's a DC Talk lyric.

204
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:32,700
So just a lot of rap, this one, just a lot of rap

205
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,000
lyrics on this one for sure.

206
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,100
So Keith Wigner's got the watch, the throne,

207
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:42,300
and I need everyone to roll sanity with your dice.

208
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,600
Even me?

209
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,100
All of yas.

210
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:50,500
It's a 0 slash 1 sanity check.

211
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,100
2.

212
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:56,900
I got a 30, which means I don't pass.

213
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:57,700
I rolled a 2.

214
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,100
30 on a 15.

215
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,700
I failed a 68 on a 16.

216
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,600
And 68, what's that look like on your power there?

217
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,500
Yeah, it's above my power.

218
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,500
Well, let's see what happens literally right now

219
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,200
as you lose one sanity, as does Keith Wigner.

220
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,600
Keith Wigner, when this watch pops off,

221
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,400
you just let out a little scream, which

222
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:23,900
you realize in this moment is the only noise

223
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,700
that you can hear because contention

224
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:29,700
is wildly quiet compared to the last time you were here.

225
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:33,100
If you'll remember, last time you heard lots of animals

226
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,700
in the creek and in the ponds and such,

227
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,800
and you can't hear that right now.

228
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,900
All you're hearing is just this, ah, from Keith Wigner

229
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,400
that is echoing.

230
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,200
And then you think it might even bounce off

231
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,600
of that big floating moat and bounce back at you.

232
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,000
It's echoing through contention.

233
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,200
And Clark Bishop.

234
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,100
He sees Keith put that watch on and then take it off, right?

235
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,400
That's where we're standing right now.

236
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:04,800
I'm going to try and tackle Keith, and I'm yelling,

237
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,200
why would you put it on again?

238
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,100
Why would you put it on again?

239
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,500
Keith, are you trying to put up a little resistance there?

240
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,400
Yeah, I'm going to try to just get out of his way.

241
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:13,900
OK.

242
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:16,200
I'm going to, yeah, and I'm going to try to help Keith.

243
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,400
All right, so you can roll to assist,

244
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,500
and it'll give Keith a plus 20 on his roll.

245
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,500
What should I roll on?

246
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,900
Dexterity or unarmed combat or athletics,

247
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:30,300
whichever one's highest.

248
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,500
Doesn't fail them all, 76.

249
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,800
So what am I rolling?

250
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,500
You're going to roll dodge to get out

251
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:40,400
of the way against Clark Bishop's unarmed combat.

252
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,900
60 on a 30.

253
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:47,000
I rolled a 61 on a 70.

254
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I beat you by one, right?

255
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,100
I still failed.

256
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,000
Oh, I got you.

257
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Clark, you can do whatever you want,

258
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,200
but John Lee Pettymore tries to grab on to Keith Vigna

259
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:02,600
to pull him out of the way and just literally just grab shirt.

260
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,300
You're still wearing the massive polo, I believe?

261
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:08,100
No, way too big cargo shorts.

262
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:08,800
Oh, super tight.

263
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,100
The polo's a little too small.

264
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:13,500
Yeah, and so as you grab his shirt,

265
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,300
it's so tight on his skin, you can't quite.

266
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,300
And Clark Bishop.

267
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,800
I tackle you, and I'm kind of like trying

268
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,900
to pin you maybe to the ground, and I'm

269
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,700
trying to get the watch out of your hand and get it away.

270
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:29,200
And I'm just like maybe bashing your whole back into the ground.

271
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,700
Why did you put it on again?

272
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,500
Why did you put it on again?

273
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,600
So as Clark Bishop is screaming this and he's on top of you,

274
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,100
I'm going to have you roll an unarmed combat or a strength

275
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:43,300
to avoid taking some sort of damage here.

276
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,600
Let's see.

277
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,500
OK.

278
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,300
17 on a 65.

279
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:53,400
So that'll be enough to allow you to cover

280
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,700
the back of your neck and the back of your skull

281
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,400
as he's just hitting you in the ground.

282
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,200
But he does get a hold of the watch,

283
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:02,100
and he throws it into the grass nearby.

284
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,500
What the fuck is wrong with you?

285
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,700
What are you doing?

286
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,200
I just.

287
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,600
I scramble to get it done.

288
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,600
Knowing that the watch is away and I've pummeled you

289
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:12,500
into the ground a few times, my eyes kind of relax,

290
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,900
and I stop maybe doing it quite as hard,

291
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:18,300
but I'm still kind of jostling you.

292
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,200
And then my hands are moving to your chest,

293
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:24,700
and it's a little more like, I am, I am, I.

294
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,500
And he gets to his feet and goes and kind of walks

295
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,600
away embarrassed, but doesn't say much.

296
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,300
Clark is walking away embarrassed

297
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,200
as Keith is on the ground.

298
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,000
John is standing right next to you all with the watch in hand.

299
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Yeah, he has his back turned to that

300
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,500
after he sees that Clark is settling down

301
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,400
and he puts the watch on.

302
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:55,800
I knew this episode was just going to be this.

303
00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:00,800
Oh, the watch tent you crave.

304
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,100
Oh, Lottie, Lottie.

305
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,800
Goodbye, my boys.

306
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,900
Hello, Thomas.

307
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,400
Hi, Zach.

308
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:20,600
Well, the familiar reality channel changing

309
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:24,700
has still unsettling, but you know what you're getting into,

310
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:27,200
and you're standing over a man's body,

311
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,200
and he's face down in the dry crack dirt

312
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,500
you've seen him before.

313
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,300
The smell of piss.

314
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:31,900
Same man.

315
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,300
Yep, same man.

316
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:37,800
The smell of piss and shit wafts through the humid summer air,

317
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,800
and looking down the road to your perceived destination,

318
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,300
you recognize your hometown of contention.

319
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,100
Back to the body on the ground,

320
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:49,700
your hands are trembling as you roll him over,

321
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:54,900
a dead man in his mid-20s, stiff as a glass of moonshine,

322
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:59,200
dressed in the fashion of the day, which is the late 1800s,

323
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,500
and a trifolded piece of parchment

324
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,600
falls out of this deceased man's jacket pocket.

325
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,900
It's a job advertisement for the contention mining company,

326
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:13,900
and it reads, we is hiring able bodies,

327
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,000
readying untapped sight.

328
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,600
Plenty of work.

329
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,600
Hesitate not.

330
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,600
That's crazy.

331
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,600
If I hadn't accidentally heard the end of the episode

332
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,800
with Luke hearing that, it would have been a big reveal.

333
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,900
John Lee Pettymore III slips this watch off,

334
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,900
and you see Keith Vigna.

335
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,300
What are you doing on the ground?

336
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,400
I had the wind knocked out of me,

337
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,100
so I'm just trying to catch my breath

338
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,500
and slowly get back up.

339
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,500
When Keith is back on his feet, I'll turn him back around.

340
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:56,400
Keith, I'm sorry.

341
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,400
That watch is freaky.

342
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:01,000
I don't know why you would willingly just put it back on.

343
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,800
I just needed to get more info, and I got what I needed,

344
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,300
and I look over at John.

345
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,000
You see the watch slipping off his hand,

346
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,300
and he turns around with kind of a wide expression.

347
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,300
Did you see the same thing?

348
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,700
No.

349
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,400
I mean, you remember the dead man and the vision?

350
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,300
Yeah.

351
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,500
This time, a note slipped out of his pocket.

352
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,900
I saw the same thing.

353
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:30,100
Written in the same crazy grammar as the initial...

354
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,300
Yeah.

355
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:34,200
We used striking torches.

356
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,300
Hesitate not, that one?

357
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,300
Yes.

358
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,400
Yeah, it had the same sort of thing.

359
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:42,800
It had we is and hesitate not.

360
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,800
If I wanted to recite that to you,

361
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,700
it would sound like this.

362
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:50,100
We is striking when the land gets darkness.

363
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,700
Readying torches, hesitate not.

364
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,000
I meant the one I just heard.

365
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
We is hiring able bodies.

366
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,400
Readying untapped sight.

367
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,900
Plenty of work.

368
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,900
Hesitate not.

369
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:03,900
Cool.

370
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,700
And you found it on the old-timey guy, too?

371
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,300
Yeah, I'm afraid I did.

372
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,800
Yeah, I saw that same thing the second time I put it on.

373
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,900
Joe, what do you see?

374
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:12,900
Clark, what do you see?

375
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,600
And I slapped a watch on his hands.

376
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,300
Oh, OK.

377
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,300
Are you willing to let that happen?

378
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,500
I mean, I think Clark is in a state

379
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,400
that he wouldn't be ready for it.

380
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,900
He was already apologizing and embarrassed

381
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,100
and talking to Keith.

382
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,100
Sucker watch.

383
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:39,800
Reality begins to blink and flicker in a now familiar

384
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,100
but still unsettling way.

385
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:45,100
And you're standing over a man's body face down

386
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,700
in the dry cracked dirt.

387
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:51,100
The smell of piss and shit wafts through the humid summer air.

388
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:55,200
And looking down the road to your perceived destination,

389
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,000
you recognize your hometown of contention.

390
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,300
Back to the body on the ground, your hands

391
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:04,100
are trembling as you roll him over a dead man

392
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:07,600
in his mid-20s, stiff as a glass of moonshine,

393
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:11,900
dressed in the fashion of the day, which is the late 1800s.

394
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,900
And a trifolded piece of parchment

395
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:17,300
falls out of the deceased man's jacket pocket.

396
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:21,700
It's a job advertisement for the contention mining company.

397
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:26,900
And it reads, we is hiring able bodies, readying untapped sight,

398
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:29,600
plenty of work, hesitate not.

399
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,600
All righty.

400
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:38,700
And the watch comes off of Clark Bishop's wrist.

401
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,100
I want to catch it and put it on again.

402
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:51,100
All right.

403
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,500
Let's see how many of these fucking things Zach prepared.

404
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,300
Luke and Joe, take your headphones off.

405
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,700
He goes to catch it, and it slips onto his wrist

406
00:18:58,700 --> 00:18:59,400
accidentally.

407
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,400
All of a sudden, you're looking at Bean's pond.

408
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,800
You see Tilde B. Mitchell walking slowly backwards

409
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,400
away from you toward the water.

410
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,900
She does not stop as she backs into the small neighborhood

411
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:25,500
pond, and she continues in steadily

412
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,500
until the water rises above her head.

413
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,400
And when she is gone, the channel of your reality

414
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,900
changes, and you are sitting at the bar in a tavern.

415
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:41,600
Behind the bar is a mirror, and you see your reflection.

416
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,900
Your eyes are wild.

417
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:47,600
You recognize your thick hand-stitched clothing

418
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,800
from the dead body you found on the way into town.

419
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,300
The barmaid refills your glass.

420
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:57,600
So you're the new miner in town who wrote ahead

421
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,300
looking for a room?

422
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,200
You look in the mirror again.

423
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,900
You see your reflection.

424
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:07,900
Still, you give a nod to the alewife.

425
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:11,800
Well, welcome to contention, Silas Cole.

426
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,300
Oh, shit.

427
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,200
I got chills, baby.

428
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,900
You guys have to put this watch on again.

429
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,900
This episode sucks.

430
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:38,200
And you guys see?

431
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,700
And you guys see?

432
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:43,400
Oh, no.

433
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,100
And you guys see the watch slip off of a John Lee Betty

434
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,000
more than their sand?

435
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,300
And he instantly slaps it on Clark's hand?

436
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,300
God damn it!

437
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,000
OK, bye.

438
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,400
Take your headphones off, Luke.

439
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,700
We're playing a closed game.

440
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:11,800
Joe.

441
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,700
I love it.

442
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,200
Yeah.

443
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,000
Ugh.

444
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,400
I got to put the same amount of, like, gravitas into each one,

445
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,100
right?

446
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,700
So we can see your faces with this new method.

447
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:26,300
And Thomas's faces with whatever you were describing was great.

448
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:29,000
You're looking at Bean's pond.

449
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,300
You see Tildy B. Mitchell walking slowly

450
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:36,500
backwards away from you toward the water.

451
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,700
She does not stop as she backs into the small neighborhood

452
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,700
pond.

453
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:43,300
And as she continues in steadily,

454
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:46,100
the water rises above her head.

455
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:49,500
And when she's gone, the channel of your reality changes,

456
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,600
and you're sitting at the bar in a tavern.

457
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:56,600
Behind the bar is a mirror, and you see your reflection.

458
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,100
Your eyes are wild.

459
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,900
You recognize your thick hand-stitched clothing

460
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:06,400
from the dead body you found on the way into town.

461
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,200
The barmaid refills your glass.

462
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,600
So you're the new miner in town who

463
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,600
rode ahead looking for a room?

464
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,500
You look in the mirror again.

465
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,100
You see your reflection.

466
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:20,700
Still, you give a nod to the alewife.

467
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:24,300
Well, welcome to contention, Silas Cole.

468
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:30,700
Oh, holy shit.

469
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:42,300
And you guys see the watch slip off of Clark Bishop's wrist.

470
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,300
I look at John.

471
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:47,300
He's just wide-eyed, and he's nodding at you, like, right?

472
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,300
Right?

473
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,300
What did you guys see?

474
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:50,900
Throw it on him.

475
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:53,100
I slapped it on Keith.

476
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:53,600
God damn it.

477
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,200
OK.

478
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,100
We should make pretending to be people slap bracelets.

479
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,100
We will now, yeah.

480
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,700
The watch slap bracelets.

481
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,700
Also, we should experiment after this one

482
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,100
if, like, if we all hold hands, we can experience

483
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,500
these visions at the same time.

484
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,300
You know what?

485
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,700
I don't have that written anywhere,

486
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:12,900
but it sure would help.

487
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,100
All right, Lukey.

488
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,900
OK, let's hear it.

489
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,900
You're looking at Bean's Pond.

490
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:30,900
You see Tildi B. Mitchell walking slowly backwards away

491
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:33,200
from you toward the water.

492
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,100
She does not stop as she backs into the small neighborhood

493
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:36,900
pond.

494
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:39,400
And as she continues in steadily,

495
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,200
the water rises above her head.

496
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,300
When she's gone, the channel of your reality changes,

497
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,600
and you're sitting at the bar in a tavern.

498
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:52,200
Behind the bar is a mirror, and you see your reflection.

499
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,700
Your eyes, though, are wild.

500
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,800
You recognize your thick, hand-stitched clothing

501
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:01,500
from the dead body you found on the way into town.

502
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:04,100
The barmaid refills your glass.

503
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:07,200
So you're the new miner in town who rode ahead

504
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,600
looking for a room?

505
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,400
You look in the mirror again.

506
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,200
You see your reflection.

507
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,600
Still, you give a nod to the alewife.

508
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,700
Well, welcome to contention, Silas Cole.

509
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,200
Ooh.

510
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,200
I take the watch and put it in my pocket.

511
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,200
We were binging that watch.

512
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,200
Did you guys...

513
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,200
Did you guys...

514
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,200
Were you guys Silas Cole, too?

515
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,200
Yeah.

516
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,200
Yeah.

517
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,200
That's fucking crazy, right?

518
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,200
You want to try it one more time?

519
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,200
Kinda.

520
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,200
If we all hold hands,

521
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,700
do you think we might experience the vision together?

522
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,200
I mean, it can't hurt.

523
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,700
And I hand the watch over to you

524
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:01,700
and grab your hand and Clark's hand.

525
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,700
I grab... I complete the triangle.

526
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,700
All right, I'm holding both your hands.

527
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,700
Somebody has to put this watch on for me.

528
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,700
I put it on his wrist.

529
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,700
Just clasp it.

530
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:12,700
Thank you.

531
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,700
And then grab his hand.

532
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:14,700
Okay.

533
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,700
At the same time,

534
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:26,700
At the same time, all of your realities begin to sort of fade away and warp,

535
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,700
and it's dark.

536
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:32,700
You can barely make out the silhouette of a hooded figure

537
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:37,200
lurking in the shadows of this confined space.

538
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:43,200
But light floods in, illuminating a decrepit and haggard Clark Bishop,

539
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,700
clutching a book made of some sort of uncured leather,

540
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:49,200
blood dripping from its spine.

541
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,200
The visibility is due to the opening of this empty tomb.

542
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,200
In walks a tall, gaunt creature with translucent skin

543
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,700
and stretched out limbs wearing a black suit.

544
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:06,700
Hello, subject 1-5-2-2-5-1-8-1-9-5-5-1-8.

545
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,700
Please give me the book.

546
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:12,200
After a beat, both figures sprint towards each other,

547
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,700
only ten feet apart to start,

548
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:18,200
and a blinding light cleanses the interior of this mausoleum

549
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:23,700
before you see Keith Vigna, Clark Bishop, and John Lee Pettymore the Thirth

550
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:27,700
carry in the casket of Ari Manstein,

551
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:33,700
set it down gently, exit, and close the door of the tomb behind them.

552
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:42,200
And the three of you step back away from each other.

553
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:46,700
Ah, I mean, I preferred the episodes in the main timeline.

554
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,200
That was fine.

555
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,200
What the hell does this even mean?

556
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,200
I think everybody roll Sanity on that one.

557
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,200
Oh, fuck.

558
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,200
Seven, hell yeah.

559
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,200
Oh my god.

560
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,200
What'd you get?

561
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,700
An eighty-seven.

562
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,700
That's so for my power.

563
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,200
I got a one.

564
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,200
No way!

565
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:08,700
Yahweh.

566
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,700
Hell yeah.

567
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,700
Yahweh, our lord.

568
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,200
Luke and Thomas, take off your headphones.

569
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,700
Oh no.

570
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:23,700
First, lose one Sanity.

571
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:24,700
Did that.

572
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,200
I'm at fourteen now.

573
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,200
Congrats.

574
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,200
Thanks.

575
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:34,700
Clark Bishop, as you back away, you notice that there is ooze that is dripping out of

576
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:40,000
the nose, eyes, and ears, and a little bit out of the mouth of John Lee Pettymore the

577
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:48,500
Thirth and you see that it has somehow wrapped itself around like coming down his arm and

578
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:53,500
it seems to be dripping from both of his hands and looking down you kind of see that it's

579
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:59,500
on your hands too and it's on Keith's hands and you seem to have just been connected just

580
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:08,500
now by this black oily viscous ooze and as you back away it drips off your hands and

581
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:14,500
onto the ground and some of the stuff that's a part of John Lee Pettymore just drips from

582
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:21,000
his face he doesn't seem to notice that it's on him or in him and as it collects on the

583
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:28,500
ground you look down and it begins moving toward you and then you blink and you can't

584
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,500
see it anymore.

585
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,500
Oh shit.

586
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:35,500
While they're away, can I ask you, can that be part of my reaction to the over the power

587
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,500
thing?

588
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,500
Yes.

589
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:40,500
But the deal though is that I have to inflict harm on someone so I can't just run away from

590
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,500
it, right?

591
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,500
Nope.

592
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:46,500
Does it have to be one of them or can I lash out like at the thing that I think is the

593
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,500
goo that is no longer there?

594
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,500
You can lash out at the thing that's there.

595
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,500
Okay.

596
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,500
Absolutely.

597
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,500
Okay, cool.

598
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,500
Yeah.

599
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,500
Cool.

600
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:59,500
Uh, yeah, I'm going to rip a piss too.

601
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,500
Cool.

602
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:04,500
I'll tell Luke he can come back so we can hang out.

603
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:10,000
They both went to go take a pee, but I didn't want to be alone.

604
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,500
I'm going to go pee too then.

605
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,500
Fuck.

606
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,500
All by myself.

607
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,500
Don't want to be all by myself.

608
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,500
Hey, here's Thomas.

609
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,500
Don't want to be.

610
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:33,000
Hey, Joe, while Zach's not here, tell us what you saw.

611
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,960
He just described a real pornographic scene that he had seen earlier today.

612
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,500
It wasn't even story related.

613
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,500
Wow.

614
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,500
Was it good?

615
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,500
It was all right.

616
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,500
He liked it for sure.

617
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,500
The way he described it.

618
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,500
Yeah.

619
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,500
What brand was it?

620
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:46,500
Genre.

621
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:49,000
I don't know what the...

622
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Gucci.

623
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
It used a lot of inanimate objects.

624
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,160
It was, it was odd, but tasteful.

625
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,920
The three of you step away from each other and Clark Bishop's eyes widen.

626
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:03,680
Clark is wide eyed, wild, and starts backing away and he starts slapping your guys' hands

627
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,480
and then stomping on the ground really hard.

628
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,480
It's here.

629
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,480
It's here.

630
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,480
It's here.

631
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,480
It's here.

632
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:12,060
And he's kind of running away and he's pointing at the ground and stomping at the ground and...

633
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,060
What is it?

634
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:14,060
What's here?

635
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:15,060
What's here?

636
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:16,060
It's the goo.

637
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,060
It's the goo.

638
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:18,060
It's the goo.

639
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:19,060
It's the goo.

640
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,060
And he's like stomping around.

641
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:21,060
I can't see it anymore.

642
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:22,060
I can't see it anymore, but it was here.

643
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:23,060
It was on you guys.

644
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:24,060
Wipe yourselves off.

645
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:25,060
Wipe yourselves off.

646
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,060
I start spitting on my hands.

647
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:28,240
I see that and I think that's a good idea, so I start doing that.

648
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,560
Are we near any water?

649
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,560
Let's look.

650
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,880
No.

651
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:38,640
So you guys are just east of Hotel Motel on the map of contention here.

652
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:43,780
I see them spitting on themselves or whatever, but I'm like, Clark, you're just freaking

653
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:44,780
out.

654
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:45,780
It's not here.

655
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:46,780
We can't see it.

656
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:47,780
You can't see it anymore.

657
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:48,780
It's fine.

658
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:49,780
We're fine.

659
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:50,780
You guys.

660
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:51,780
You were covered in it.

661
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:52,780
You were covered in it.

662
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:53,780
It was on the ground.

663
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:54,780
It started moving toward me.

664
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:55,780
It started moving toward me.

665
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:03,840
Clark, in life, you're going to be covered in all kinds of goos, just at different times.

666
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:12,220
So I mean, just take a deep breath, wipe yourself off, you know, crack a cold one.

667
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:13,920
That's what we do in convention.

668
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,920
Do you have a cold one?

669
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:15,920
Do you have a cold one?

670
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:16,920
We can pour it on ourselves.

671
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,920
We can pour it on ourselves.

672
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,920
Do you have one?

673
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,240
I slip the watch back into my pocket.

674
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,240
Thank God.

675
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:25,480
I thought you were going to slip it back on.

676
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:31,380
I mean, we'll keep this for later because it could tell us something, but man, I think

677
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:33,580
we ought to get to the pond.

678
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:35,980
I kind of want to do it one more time.

679
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:37,940
I'm staring at their, like, demeanors.

680
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:41,460
Are they okay now?

681
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:42,940
Yeah.

682
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:43,940
I feel fine.

683
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:44,940
Oh.

684
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:45,940
We were not okay when you saw.

685
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:46,940
Okay.

686
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:47,940
Gotcha.

687
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,780
How much sanity do you guys all have, Carious?

688
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:50,780
Fourteen.

689
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:51,780
Twenty-five.

690
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:54,780
Fourteen, twenty-five, and fourteen?

691
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,080
I'm at fourteen, yeah.

692
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,080
Haha.

693
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:01,400
In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king.

694
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:08,320
So yeah, you're a Cyclops for sure because twenty-five sanity, you're the kind of person

695
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:17,360
that people walk on eggshells around, but fourteen sanity is more like people are noticing

696
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:22,760
because you're more almost, I mean, you're on your way to being, like, primordial back

697
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:32,660
to a time where beings like us didn't worry about morality.

698
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:37,620
I think we, let's get back to the, do you think we should walk there, get back to the

699
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:42,140
car, or, what do you think?

700
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,420
Where is the pond?

701
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:45,860
Oh, right by Maggie Cook's house?

702
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:48,300
Yeah, it's way further south from us.

703
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,740
We're pretty far away from it.

704
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:53,760
Well, we parked the car where we parked it because we were gonna come across a big checkpoint,

705
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,760
right?

706
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:55,760
Right.

707
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,760
Yeah.

708
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,600
Is there a way to come into town from, like, the south part?

709
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,600
The south part?

710
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,600
No.

711
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:03,680
I mean, there's roads that lead south, but, okay.

712
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:06,240
Can we loop around somehow, like backroads and stuff?

713
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:10,760
You could easily loop around and go around backroads, however, at this exact moment,

714
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:16,040
you hear a voice that is coming from just south of you guys.

715
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:18,040
There's a small neighborhood.

716
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:22,660
Did you just see it, Luke?

717
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:32,300
Sorry, I just tagged Luke in an Instagram story, which you should all watch.

718
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,780
Oh, that's so stupid.

719
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:50,720
That's great.

720
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:56,960
You were doing it for so long, and I caught you when you started to get normal again.

721
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:09,820
You can go to our Instagram, at pretending pod, or our Twitter, at pretending pod, or

722
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:16,180
our Facebook, pretending to be people, to see that short video of Luke just really getting

723
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:17,180
in there.

724
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,180
Behind the scenes during the recording session.

725
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:21,360
You can tell how much I'm just focused in.

726
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,360
How clued in.

727
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,360
Locked in.

728
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,360
Okay.

729
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:32,260
I mentioned before how quiet it was in contention, but you don't even realize, like, when you

730
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:38,880
hear a truck that is close, literally a block away from you guys, it is the loudest thing

731
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:45,580
in your ears currently, is this truck in the distance, and then you hear it, like, pull

732
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:49,000
to a stop, and when it's idling, it's so much louder.

733
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,420
This person is not taking care of their truck.

734
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:55,900
When you hear a holler, all right, come on out of there, Randy.

735
00:34:55,900 --> 00:35:00,560
We can do this the easy way, or you can disappear.

736
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,900
How much worse can it possibly get?

737
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,320
You don't want to give daddy a shot?

738
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,360
He can go back and fix everything back to normal.

739
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,160
We need more bodies, Randy.

740
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,160
Oh, shit.

741
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,000
It sounds like they got Randy Anx told up in there.

742
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:18,580
They're about to be in a world of shit.

743
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:21,060
Can we recognize the voice?

744
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:26,240
What would be a social, let's have a, is there charisma in this game?

745
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,000
How long have we been playing Delta Green?

746
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Three years?

747
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
There is, uh, Persuade and Humant.

748
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
There is indeed charisma.

749
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,800
Oh, charisma is one of the, is that one of the top ones?

750
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,800
Yeah.

751
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,800
The base stats, yeah.

752
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,800
Yeah.

753
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,800
Who's got the best charisma?

754
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,800
I've got six feet.

755
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,800
I have 75.

756
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,800
Nice.

757
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,800
That'd be Luke.

758
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,800
Wait, what the fuck?

759
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,800
Keith Wigner.

760
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,800
That's how I talk about it.

761
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,800
Yeah, you've been roleplaying that really well.

762
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:55,800
I think Keith Wigner is so charismatic personally.

763
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,800
Go ahead and roll on that 75.

764
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,800
He's no Ron Stampler.

765
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,800
Uh, shit.

766
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,800
I got a 99.

767
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,800
Oh no.

768
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,800
What?

769
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:15,800
Yeah, I had to make sure that it didn't say like 80 or zero.

770
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,800
It says 99.

771
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,800
Okay, well then here's the deal.

772
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:25,800
Luke, uh, Keith Wigner knows exactly who that voice is and it's Terrence Liquor.

773
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,800
And you know that Terrence Liquor-

774
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,800
From Liquors Liquors?

775
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,800
He owns the liquor store, which-

776
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,800
Liquors Liquors.

777
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:37,800
It mails envelopes for you.

778
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,800
That's Liquors Liquors Liquors.

779
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,800
Liquors Liquors Liquors.

780
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,800
There's Liquors Kickers, which is the shoe store.

781
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:47,800
At the gas station you can buy a Liquors Snickers.

782
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:53,800
Which is just Snickers from a regular Snickers truck that the Liquors family has like held

783
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,800
up and they're selling for 50 cents more.

784
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,800
Do they like tape something on to the label to make it different?

785
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,800
Uh huh.

786
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,800
His stand up is Liquors Bickers.

787
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,800
One L over the S N.

788
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,800
Okay, what's Terry Liquor doing?

789
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,800
Terrence Liquor.

790
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,800
What's his middle name?

791
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,800
Terrence.

792
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,800
Terrence Elizabeth.

793
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,800
Yeah.

794
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,800
Terrence Elizabeth Liquor.

795
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:24,800
Average height, dirty overalls, boots, trucker hat, long oily hair.

796
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,800
Always has a lip packed with chew and the scent of booze on his breath.

797
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,800
Oil stained hands and a ripped flannel shirt.

798
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,800
Thinks he's smarter than he really is.

799
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,800
Prone to flattery, short temper, questionable morals if it'll benefit him.

800
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:43,800
These are the things that Keith Wigner knows because Terrence Liquor and Keith Wigner do not get along.

801
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,800
Shout out to B. Crever on our Patreon.

802
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:52,800
This is the first use of an NPC from our patrons at the $10 level.

803
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,800
So thank you B. Crever.

804
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,800
Super cool.

805
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:59,800
For providing Terrence Liquor to me to murder.

806
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:08,800
So, uh, Luke, Keith Wigner had a run in with Terrence Liquor who's the owner of the Liquors Liquors.

807
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,800
I believe it was Liquors.

808
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:15,800
What is this, uh, what is this issue that you guys had?

809
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:25,800
He owes me three $1 bills.

810
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,800
They were your lucky dollars.

811
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,800
No, he asked him to make change at the register and he...

812
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,800
Yeah, he, I gave him a five. He gave me, he gave me two and he...

813
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:39,800
He wanted to give you 12 quarters, but you're like, fuck that, give me a $3 bill.

814
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:49,800
So I gave him a five, he gave me two bucks, shook up my Bud Light, handed it over and said...

815
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,800
Fuck you Beans.

816
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:58,800
Beans, Beans, Keith Beans, his only friends are figurines.

817
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:08,800
I was there not as a patron, but to check his liquor license and I wanted a beer at the time so I gave him a five, he gave me two, shook up my beer and...

818
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,800
I got beef.

819
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:15,800
Well, it sounds like we just need to apprehend him and we have grounds to do it.

820
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:23,800
When I, when I hear him yelling at Randy Angst, I just put my hand up to the guys and like, listen for a second.

821
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:30,800
I'm like, that's fucking tea liquor. Let's go get his ass.

822
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:35,800
Remember that $3 bill incident? That's him.

823
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:39,800
That guy that shook up your beer? Kevin burst out laughing.

824
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:43,800
John Lee Kevin Moore, just like laughs.

825
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:53,800
I know you're, uh, I know you're sore at this feller, but, uh, should we maybe scout the situation out first, wreck an order, see if we can't go in from behind and help Randy out?

826
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:57,800
If you want to, and I pull my gun out and start walking towards the disturbance.

827
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:01,800
Stay behind the tree line, Keith. Don't lose the element of surprise.

828
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:06,800
Yes. My face is like red and I'm stomping towards the noise.

829
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,800
I reach into his pocket, grab the watch and throw it on him.

830
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:15,800
He doesn't.

831
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:19,800
He doesn't.

832
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:24,800
Well, if you're reaching in Keith's pocket, you'll have to go, uh, you'll have to go dexterity.

833
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:32,800
Also, you got to find out which pocket it is in my cargo shorts and they're huge. So pick a pocket, any pocket.

834
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:41,800
You can go criminology. Keith, you're rolling against him with alertness or dexterity or athletics.

835
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:45,800
Okay. I'm going to roll criminology because now that I'm a robot, I'm less dextrous.

836
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:51,800
I got a nine on a 60. I got a 50 on a 50.

837
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:57,800
Well, tell us what happens. You can get the wall. You can get the watch out of his big ass pockets in my imagining.

838
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:03,800
He's so mad at, uh, at tea liquor that he's not really paying attention. I like kind of pay attention to him.

839
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:08,800
I see it happening. And before I can react, his hand is out of my pocket again.

840
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:15,800
And I point up to this guy and I say, look over there. And then I slap it on his hands.

841
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:19,800
Can I try to fight it slapping on my wrist? Yeah.

842
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:24,800
Yeah. It'll be another, uh, either dexterity or athletics.

843
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:31,800
50 on a 50 dexterity. Yep. That seems legit.

844
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:40,800
It is. Look. I don't know if you can even see that. Yeah. Oh wow. That is 50.

845
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:50,800
I can see there's literally no way Luke could have like found exactly on those dice that fast.

846
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:57,800
And Thomas, I assume that you can't beat that. No, I rolled a 24 on a 50. So I guess so I'm, I'm stomping away.

847
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:03,800
Well, that was a, that was a contest for you not to, to somehow make him not put the watch on you. So you get it right.

848
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:11,800
Already too far away. He grabbed it out of my pockets and I'm already, yeah, he's gone.

849
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:16,800
He's, he's walking. You, you're holding the watch. You tried to slap it on his wrist real quick, but he's walking away.

850
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:21,800
I turn around, like really exasperated and give Clark a side, but then I try to sneak it on his wrist.

851
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:29,800
On to my, on to Clark's wrist. Yeah.

852
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:35,800
Yeah. I mean, I would like to contest that at that point. I'm looking at him as it happens.

853
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:42,800
Yep. Dexterity or athletics against each other.

854
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:46,800
No, I rolled a 97.

855
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:53,800
I rolled a 48 on a 60. I'm good. I just, I just, I just slap your hand away.

856
00:42:53,800 --> 00:43:00,800
John, John misses again and very like exasperated. Like he just lets out a huge sigh and then slaps it on himself.

857
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:05,800
Yep. All right. Take your headphones off.

858
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:14,800
Well, Thomas, you got me.

859
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,800
Did we reach the limits of your preparation?

860
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:25,800
Well, I didn't have like a million things written down for what happens when you put the watch on over and over and over and over again.

861
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:32,800
It's like a whole episode of watchness. So here's what I will tell you.

862
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:40,800
You just want to make it easy on yourself and say the visions start looping. Like you're back to the door.

863
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,800
That's not fun. Here's what I'm going to do.

864
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,800
I'm going to tell you what happens and then I'm going to go in and rerecord a cool version of it later.

865
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:50,800
Sure, sure, sure. I'll react to what you're saying. Like it's the cool version.

866
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:54,800
Okay, perfect.

867
00:43:54,800 --> 00:44:02,800
What a bright flash of light almost makes your eyes feel warm and then you see an abandoned warehouse.

868
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:11,800
Puddles have collected from rain and in them you can see the reflection of the moonlight pouring in through the crack and hole filled roof.

869
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:20,800
Three figures are standing near the wall and the shadows and their silhouette looks like a race podium or dug trio.

870
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:27,800
But the tallest figure looks massive like a human that has been stretched out.

871
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:39,800
Closer you see this lemmy suit clad translucent skinned creature hands a small manila envelope to the two actual humans standing before it.

872
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:47,800
A man and a woman. They open the envelope and inside there's only a small piece of paper with a hand drawn symbol.

873
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:57,800
It is a filled in circle encircled by six circles. Another bright flash of light engulfs your vision and you see James the mill worker.

874
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:04,800
Just James dragging two bodies. This man and woman you just saw across the floor of his house.

875
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:12,800
And then we see these two individuals from above. They're sitting lifeless at the bottom of a small man-made pit.

876
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:17,800
And you see a sort of time lapse of the bodies bloat and change color.

877
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:22,800
And then Clark Bishop falls into this pit and your vision is again consumed by light.

878
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:33,800
As it fades you see Chief Maggie Cook giving orders to a looming overweight man wearing an all black combat uniform.

879
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:38,800
And he has a large scar over his right eye.

880
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:42,800
Okay.

881
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:48,800
Can I just keep putting this watch on and seeing the background of all the mysteries?

882
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:49,800
Yes.

883
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:55,800
I mean I'm going to pitch that to the guys and break your little podcast wide open.

884
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:58,800
Good. We need to answer some questions.

885
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:02,800
But not too many and that's on you.

886
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,800
Hello.

887
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:14,800
Zach your shirt is very Star Trek The Next Generation.

888
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:15,800
Thank you.

889
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:18,800
That's Joe's least favorite Star Trek.

890
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,800
That was a deadly insult.

891
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:23,800
Would it be better if I had like all the way?

892
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:29,800
The buttons that were laying on your chest made it look like pips from Star Trek. That's what helped the illusion.

893
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:30,800
Oh. Whoops.

894
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,800
You forgot about your pips. You forgot about your pips.

895
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,800
Lattice.

896
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:46,800
Okay. So. Keith Vigna is just ahead of you guys making his way toward the Confrontation House.

897
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,800
Confrontation House. A new reality.

898
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,800
Keith House.

899
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:58,800
And Clark Bishop just ripped his hand away from John Lee Pettymore the Third who slapped on the bracelet onto himself.

900
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:03,800
I look wide eyed at you. Did you see something else?

901
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:06,800
Guys. Yeah. I mean. Keith! Keith!

902
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:12,800
We really need to be putting on this like this watch cause we're getting some good shit here.

903
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:17,800
I turn around and look at him and I'm like slowly walking backwards but I'm listening.

904
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:25,800
Well hey like remember when that robot feller attacked us in James the Mill worker's house.

905
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,800
You know the first time we met Randy.

906
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:28,800
Yeah.

907
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:32,800
Well so you wanna know why? Cause that's what I just saw.

908
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:33,800
Alright. Get this.

909
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:35,800
Why the robot attacked us?

910
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:38,800
Well why he was there in the first place. Alright check it out.

911
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:44,800
So. Myriad had sent two people out to like intercept James the Mill worker or something.

912
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:51,800
That part wasn't super clear but James dispatched them or came into possession of their bodies somehow.

913
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:56,800
But you know the two dead fellas we found at the bottom of that pit in James's house.

914
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,800
Yeah I remember them very well.

915
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:07,800
That was them and Myriad sent them and the next thing I saw was Maggie telling that robot fella to head to James the Mill worker's house.

916
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:17,800
And the impression I got was that it was you know going after those bodies. It might have been to go after us but that might have been a right place wrong time situation.

917
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:19,800
I've stopped in my tracks.

918
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:26,800
Anyway I just like it seemed yeah Maggie she sent the robot fella after us or after James.

919
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:32,800
And yeah it just seems like we get a lot of information every time we put this thing on so.

920
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:37,800
I'm pretty much team watch right now. Formerly team PETA.

921
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:40,800
I mean that's good to know but does it help us right now?

922
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:52,800
Well I mean I don't know if it helps us rescue Randy or beat up that fella that you don't like who made a fool of you with your with your beer.

923
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:56,800
But I remember why I was mad and I start stomping away again.

924
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:04,800
I touch him on the shoulder I'm like hold up hold up there's time for that there's time for that.

925
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:10,800
I don't know I think maybe we should go figure out this situation that that lies ahead of us right now.

926
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:16,800
But it just seems like we could really blow this whole mystery open by just repeatedly putting this watch on.

927
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:20,800
I don't know if you know God ever thought of that when he created such.

928
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:25,800
You mentioned that Maggie was she sent the robot to kill us?

929
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:30,800
She sent the she sent the robot to James the Mill worker's house. I think we just got there at the same time.

930
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:37,800
Oh gotcha gotcha not okay but those two fellas that were in James's pit they was dead myriad fellas.

931
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:43,800
And that robot had the myriad logo on it right? That's where we first found out about myriad.

932
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:47,800
You fell into that pit you didn't find anything on him did you?

933
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:50,800
Did I? Zach is nodding yes I don't remember what I found.

934
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:55,800
Me neither. I just remembered that it stunk down there because they were decomposing.

935
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:59,800
Which seems realistic.

936
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:05,800
You know two days ago when you fell into that pit of bodies did you notice anything strange or were you just horrified?

937
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:10,800
Overwhelmed by the stench of death.

938
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:19,800
One is a man one was a woman they had a piece of paper that had the symbol for the circle of knowledge on it.

939
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:20,800
Huh the cock.

940
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,800
Did you find anything on their bodies?

941
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:25,800
Yeah they were circle of knowledge members.

942
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:27,800
Two cocks.

943
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:29,800
That's right I remember.

944
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:37,800
There's one piece of paper with a hand drawn symbol and it was a filled in circle encircled by six circles.

945
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:39,800
Is there a chance I didn't know what it was at the time?

946
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:42,800
Yeah didn't we record that like four years ago?

947
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:55,800
You did so a little backstory refresher here you found that I believe you knew what the logo was.

948
00:50:55,800 --> 00:51:11,800
The statue's bow tie flips the coffee table over so when you like touch the statue's bow tie it flipped the coffee table over showing an enormous stash of weapons body armor and a long black plastic tube the size of a baseball bat.

949
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:23,800
And then written in blood where one of the guns should be it said stop her and inside that big tube was a map of calm comfy campground.

950
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:39,800
And then if you'll also remember Gary Daley told you that he saw Maggie and James and a third person going into Chief Maggie Cook's house the night that the home exploded.

951
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:40,800
Yeah.

952
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:47,800
The guy that was with them had a big scar over his eye and he was wearing big black tactical gear.

953
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:48,800
Yep yep yep.

954
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:49,800
Cool.

955
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,800
So there's some dots.

956
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:54,800
Y'all like the ice cream of the future?

957
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:55,800
They're fine.

958
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:57,800
I've been dipping into them.

959
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:01,800
I get it I'd rather have ice cream every single time but.

960
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,800
Sometimes I'd prefer dipping dots.

961
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:05,800
It's fucking wrong.

962
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:06,800
They stick to your tongue weird.

963
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:09,800
Yeah because they're below zero.

964
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:11,800
I like it.

965
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:13,800
I like how weird it is.

966
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:15,800
Well you know what Keith's doing.

967
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:23,800
Uh okay.

968
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:28,800
That uh I don't think.

969
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:30,800
I don't think you have time.

970
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:39,800
So as you guys are watching Keith Vigna walk off into the distance after John Lee Pettymore the third explains this to you.

971
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:45,800
John and Clark. Clark is at a loss for words. He's trying to put the dots together.

972
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:46,800
Well all I'm saying is.

973
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,800
You guys moving or are you letting Keith go by himself?

974
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:55,800
I guess we gotta keep after Keith but uh yeah this watch just does seem like a real handy plot device.

975
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:58,800
Mystery device sorry case device.

976
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:04,800
However you personally wanted to find the situation we've all found ourselves caught up in.

977
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:10,800
John Lee Pettymore kind of has an ongoing narrative of his whole life just running his head at all times.

978
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:18,800
I'm at a loss because Clark would be kind of into the idea that John's proposing that we're hearing we're getting more information every time we put on the watch.

979
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:23,800
Clark would be very intrigued by that prospect but I think he's kind of scared of it too.

980
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:33,800
John I'm actually I'm kind of on board with this idea of exploring the uses of the watch but it I'm telling you I saw last time we put it on.

981
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:34,800
Sure.

982
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:40,800
The ooze it came out of you guys. It came out of you guys. I don't think it's all good. I don't think it's all good.

983
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:45,800
It may even it may even just be showing us something that who knows what it means.

984
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:54,800
None of it's we don't we don't know. And Keith's walking away. I feel like maybe we should take care of what's going on now.

985
00:53:54,800 --> 00:54:02,800
Get to a safe spot and then maybe I don't know experiment with it or something. I don't I don't know. I just I think there's a chance it's unsafe.

986
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:16,800
Clark I think I think that's a damn smart point of view. And I was perhaps tempted by this this wrist siren and it and it caused me to lose focus on on what's in front of us.

987
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:24,800
And I think what we got to do now is keep Keith from getting his his damn self killed and we got to go help our friend Randy Angst.

988
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:29,800
For sure. And if you heard a siren I didn't hear that. But yeah we should we should get in there.

989
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:39,800
No I'm saying the watch is a siren. Yeah no I didn't I didn't hear a siren in mind either but we can go on.

990
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:49,800
Keith hold up we're coming. There it is. I look back behind him and I I look ahead of me and I just yell yeah we're coming motherfucker.

991
00:54:50,800 --> 00:55:05,800
Okay there it is. So you guys are now coming up around the back of this house and walking up to a chain link fence that is the end of the property of this home.

992
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:14,800
And so coming from the backyard you hear the truck is in the driveway of this home that you're approaching from behind the backyard.

993
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:22,800
And looking through the windows in the back what's the highest alertness in the group? We got a 70. 60. Nice. Yeah.

994
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:30,800
But we're up pretty good. Like we planned on being cop characters. Yeah but what's your law though? 50. I rolled a 90.

995
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:42,800
You guys are looking in the back windows and you know it's got curtains and you can't really see in there's not much movement detected but the lights are on so you can't really tell what's going on.

996
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:54,800
But you hear this truck just idling in the front and you're not sure if tea liquor has made his way into the house yet or if he's still out front. Which approach do you guys want to take?

997
00:55:54,800 --> 00:56:00,800
So I'm gonna go around the side of the house and peek then look at his truck and see if he's in there.

998
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:09,800
When I see Keith peeking I'm a little encouraged by his stealthiness. Keith what do you see? Yeah roll stealth Keith.

999
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:25,800
Oh good. What do you have? He has like a 10 right? Shit I got a 14 on a 10. Oh no! You're right there. That's so brutal.

1000
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:34,800
You guys haven't passed this stealth check since you've been back to contention. Just a quick reminder that everyone knows. Does anybody have more than 10 stealth? Yes.

1001
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:39,800
I got a 30.

1002
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:59,800
So I am like trying to peek around the corner but. And you don't notice that there's this concrete drain that moves the water away from the house and you trip over it and you fall onto the driveway like the front corner of the driveway right by the garage.

1003
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:12,800
And you look up and you're staring straight at this truck. In the back of the truck you see that there's a tarp slumped over the sides and there's water kind of splashing off.

1004
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:34,800
And you see fish kind of like jumping up through it and in the back sitting in the water in this puddle that has been teemed you see an older man who has like super long hair and hippy dippy and you recognize him as manager of Subtropolis Jimmy Sanders.

1005
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:46,800
How familiar are we with Jimmy? Yeah how did he feel about us before all this went down? Well it's your cousin isn't it? Yeah. He was the one who called in the oil spill. And he was older than me right? Yes.

1006
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:59,800
So he's probably going to recognize John Lee Pettymore the third. Oh fuck I didn't even think about that. He would have been alive before. I'm picturing since we didn't break away I'm just picturing Clark and John have like moved up into position around the side of the house.

1007
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:09,800
Oh no no I know that but I mean if he were to suddenly see John. Absolutely no I'm glad because he would have turned around and was like it's Jimmy Sanders it's your cousin exactly.

1008
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:24,800
Wait to clarify real fast and I don't know if this puts you on the spot or not but is Jimmy Sanders your dad's brother's kid or sister's I guess? Or sister's or yeah or anywhere in there I feel like no matter by marriage or blood everybody would have been to the same barbecues.

1009
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:38,800
And also Pettymores just call each other cousins at a certain point and like non Pettymores who are still blood related like they're all just cousins. Oh right he's got a different last name so he would have to be his sister's kid.

1010
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:49,800
That's what I was trying to decipher that makes sense. So he would be John the third's nephew. So does he see me? It's not necessarily that he sees you as much as he sees everything.

1011
00:58:49,800 --> 00:59:13,800
So you're looking at this dude and his eyes are wide and wild and he's just like sniffing around he's like number four with the no tomato no tomato no tomato extra cream cheese and he's just like looking around all over the place and you think he might have seen you but he didn't like he couldn't tell.

1012
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:28,800
As soon as I get up I turn around to John I'm like it's your cousin and then I go and I want to get the keys out of the truck. Yeah so I'll go to cover you while you do that. I'll go to get Jimmy's attention while you're slipping around to grab the keys.

1013
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:45,800
I think Clark is still trying to peek into the windows at the corner here trying to get a better look through. So as Keith sneaks out John wants to just like really visibly pop out and he goes Jimmy hey there kiddo do you remember me?

1014
00:59:45,800 --> 01:00:08,800
Hey number four lettuce no extra cucumber but I can't cut it in half right now. And he's like miming actually making a sandwich. Running with that he's like oh yeah give me that number four why don't you go ahead and start making that for me and I don't it doesn't have to be cut in half you just get to it and I want to see what he does.

1015
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:28,800
And then he looks up at you and as he makes direct eye contact with you his eyes enlarge to the size of saucers and he just lets out a little and then dives directly into the water Keith just walks up opens the car door what are you doing?

1016
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:40,800
The keys are in the ignition the car is running truck is running. Oh are you talking to me? No I was talking to Keith Vigna is he available? Sorry. Well from my screen it looked like you were looking at Joe but anyway.

1017
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:56,800
You guys were at 45 and not 90? Yeah you should be looking up to talk to me. You weren't effectively Brady bunching those calls.

1018
01:00:57,800 --> 01:01:05,800
Yeah I just open the door I get the keys turn the truck off and stick them in one of my pockets and I zip the pocket up.

1019
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:28,800
Clark Bishop you are looking inside this house Terence liquor is standing oil stained hands ripped flannel shirt long oily hair underneath a trucker cap he's got some dirty overalls and boots and he's standing in like the living room of this house where you see Randy Angst.

1020
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:44,800
He is wearing a fancy blue three-piece suit you can't tell it's a three-piece suit though because he is being shoved face into the carpet by Terence or not. Not Terence. Oh shit.

1021
01:01:44,800 --> 01:02:07,800
This dude is burly as fuck he is five foot four so he looks super wide it's in his mid-30s and he's got short cropped black hair blue eyes and impeccably white teeth and he's wearing a gray sweatsuit a black beanie and chucks so exactly the rocky uniform like when he's running up the where is that?

1022
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:20,800
Washington D.C. Philadelphia. When he's running up to Kiss. He's climbing up the Washington Monument. To make the Liberty Bell whole again and that's what he's wearing that's what he looks like.

1023
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:45,800
There's this burly thick short dude who has his knee on the back of Randy Angst's neck and he is shoving Randy's face into the carpet and then you hear the truck stop running they hear the truck stop running and they look up well seems like we've got some company.

1024
01:02:50,800 --> 01:03:16,800
What's up everybody I'm Zach and I just wanted to pop in at the end here and holler a few things at y'all first sorry this episode was so so so late I absolutely love making this show but it takes an absurd amount of time and I've been running low on steam.
