1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,160
Long time no see, my pack of pups, it's friend of all canines, Wolf the dog, howling at y'all

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:13,720
from 694.2 PTBP, voted contention's number one radio show that you leave on so your dogs

3
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,920
won't feel lonely while you're at work.

4
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,200
Now y'all know we got some words from our listeners who have taken the time to shout

5
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,560
us out on social media.

6
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:26,960
It's time for Howlin' with Wolf.

7
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:33,160
Wolf, I'd like to shout out to the lovely police force that we have here in contention.

8
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:37,920
I appreciate the stellar job they doin' in keeping us, the citizens, safe.

9
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,600
Why, if they weren't such good officers we might have things like busloads of transients

10
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:49,440
or people dying of blunt force trauma, hell yeah, or even dangerous men on the streets

11
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,520
disguised as police.

12
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,280
I sure am glad that we don't have to worry about anything like that here in contention

13
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,720
because of the work those fine officers put in.

14
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,480
From Kennedy.

15
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:08,160
Thanks Kennedy for believin' in our local police heroes without even the slightest awareness

16
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,920
of your own surroundings.

17
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:16,440
Now quick, turn the radio off now before you learn a thing or two, it's time for the news.

18
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:22,600
The officers implemented an actually decent plan for a sting operation but the FBI was

19
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,800
watching and steppin' in on the whole thing.

20
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:32,080
Agents Kennedy and McKinley are in town lookin' for a black Nike bag with nothin' in it.

21
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:36,880
The federal agents have agreed to meet the contention squad tomorrow mornin' December

22
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,120
4th at the police department.

23
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:44,920
When the party met up at the station to figure out what to do with their illegal seizures,

24
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:50,360
Drew was uncommonly not at his desk, replaced instead by a note telling them that he went

25
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,440
to the chief's house.

26
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:57,400
Officers Bishop and Bettymore hauled off the undocumented loot to their individual

27
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:03,080
residences while Keith went to the chief's house to check on ol' Drew.

28
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:08,240
Officers Bishop and Bettymore were soon called to the chief's house after it had exploded

29
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:14,720
leaving the unconscious officer Vigna and Drew Andrews in the cold yard.

30
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:20,520
That explosion also left behind the burnt bodies of Harold Dorsey, Chief Maggie Cook

31
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:27,720
and an unkempt man with a bullet hole in his head and his face in a pile of foot meat.

32
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:32,920
Foot meat, good feet, could eat, would eat.

33
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:39,560
Sorry my dearest, I just done broke but puttin' me back together is kudzu with no backbone.

34
00:02:50,520 --> 00:03:17,440
I get my hot cocoa and I walk over to my fellow officers, okay guys, can we walk away from

35
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,440
Drew?

36
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,440
Yeah I think we should.

37
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:24,080
I wanted to talk to like one of the firefighters, was anybody in there, did anybody in there

38
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,080
make it?

39
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,080
No!

40
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,080
That's what I figured.

41
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,440
Keith who was in there besides the chief?

42
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:32,840
So I knocked on the door and the door just kinda opened up by itself and it wasn't on

43
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,840
fire at this point?

44
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,320
No but I walked in and it smelled like gasoline and the gas from like a stove.

45
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:44,920
So I walked in and I immediately saw Drew and some guy, whatever that, whoever's ID

46
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,520
I showed you, they were just laying on the ground.

47
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,280
That fake newsman from the city.

48
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,640
And then I looked over and I walked in a little more and I saw Maggie just, her face was all

49
00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:00,880
slashed up and her left foot was missing and I walked in because I could smell the gas

50
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,840
so I walked into the kitchen to turn the burners off before there was an explosion or anything

51
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:09,360
but as soon as I turned the corner I saw another guy slumped over on the kitchen table with

52
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:15,040
a fork in his hand and his left foot was missing too and all four burners were on the stove

53
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,800
and there were two feet in a skillet and all the meat had been picked off of them and as

54
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:24,960
soon as I went off, went over to turn them off I just felt dizzy and I threw up and I

55
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,440
kind of, I like had to fall down and I hit something with my hand and as soon as I hit

56
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:35,440
something with my hand, something ticked at the front of the house and a flame just started

57
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,480
coming from the line of gasoline and I grabbed the fire extinguisher and I tried to put it

58
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,160
out as best I could but I slipped and fell in my own vomit.

59
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,120
I'm sorry to laugh, it's a difficult time.

60
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:55,440
I fell in my own vomit and I got up and I was spraying the fire extinguisher and I kind

61
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,680
of had to jump over the bodies to keep spraying the fire and I realized that I didn't know

62
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,600
how much of use that was so I turned around and I knew I couldn't get both the guys so

63
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:11,120
I grabbed Drew and I just hauled out of there and I think as soon as we got out of the front

64
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,280
the door had exploded and just threw us back and then I was unconscious after that.

65
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,200
When you said you heard a click and then there was fire?

66
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:24,280
Yeah, when I fell down I hit something with my hand like a wire or a trap or something

67
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,480
to start the fire.

68
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,200
Well, Clock, we know we didn't start the fire.

69
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,200
It was there before us.

70
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,200
It was always burning.

71
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,200
What the fuck?

72
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,200
Well this is horrific.

73
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:36,160
Eating their feet you said, eating their feet you said.

74
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,200
I didn't see anybody eat the feet but they were cooked and the meat was picked off of

75
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,200
the feet.

76
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,860
Alright, we're going to have to monitor and you don't know what they say.

77
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:48,680
I think we need to, someone, maybe you should pick through Drew's poop for the next two

78
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,000
days and make sure they don't find their toenails.

79
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
It did smell like poop when I walked in there and I don't know if anybody asked Drew if

80
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,720
he pooped himself.

81
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,080
I figured it could have been from that or it could have been, I don't know.

82
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,820
The guy at the table slumped over with the fork.

83
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,000
I didn't get a good look at him.

84
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Nothing about him?

85
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,720
My first instinct was to turn the gas off and turn the fire off before I got exploded.

86
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,720
Luckily I didn't.

87
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,920
Yeah, just in time.

88
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:21,200
Keith Vigna, roll an intelligence check for me to see if you remember some information.

89
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,200
I don't.

90
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,140
You don't remember some information.

91
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:27,480
But he does remember other information.

92
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,920
But there's some that I don't.

93
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,920
Damn.

94
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,600
Is the house currently on fire?

95
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,060
No, it's more like embers.

96
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:40,300
Was this for something that you told me or was this for something that I would have known

97
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,300
if I got...

98
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:46,460
That was for something that you would have remembered, but not something that I told

99
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:47,460
you during this.

100
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,460
Cause I was going to be like, maybe I shouldn't have.

101
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,460
Just tell me.

102
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:51,460
Yeah, no.

103
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:55,100
I'd like to go talk to the, the chief firefighter here.

104
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,100
Yeah.

105
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,100
Am I speaking to him now?

106
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,100
Yeah, that's me.

107
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,100
Hey, uh, John.

108
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,100
John Peters.

109
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,100
God dammit.

110
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,740
John Lee Pettymore, uh, Contention PD.

111
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,740
Hey John.

112
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:05,740
Hey.

113
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,780
I've met many times working in a small town.

114
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:08,780
Of course.

115
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:09,780
I'm fireman chief.

116
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:10,780
Yeah.

117
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,380
We, you're fireman chief.

118
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:17,500
We all respect the hell out of you and the game that, you know, you boys bring, uh, every

119
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:22,180
year to the, uh, fireman policemen volleyball tournament.

120
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:25,500
It's always a fierce game of volleyball, but that's why we love it.

121
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,500
Yeah.

122
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,500
So, hey, you got any leads?

123
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,540
Uh, you got any idea where this fire started or how it started?

124
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:35,660
Well, it looks like there was a lot of gasoline in the house and I think a natural gas was

125
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,800
the thing that really started the fire.

126
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:43,620
The gasoline definitely helped keep the fire going and made it very difficult for us to

127
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:44,620
do our jobs.

128
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:48,740
It's interesting you say both those things because I was unclear while others were telling

129
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:52,740
the story whether they meant, at first it seemed like they were smelling gasoline and

130
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,380
then they, the burners were on.

131
00:07:54,380 --> 00:08:00,500
So the burners were probably all on as well as many cans of actual gasoline poured over

132
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,860
the entire place and also just sitting around.

133
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:04,860
Hey man.

134
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:05,860
Did you get that?

135
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,900
I mean, I know you've been going out for them VO auditions.

136
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:09,900
I didn't get it.

137
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:10,900
Yeah.

138
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,820
Oh, they said that I need to be deeper.

139
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:13,820
Yeah.

140
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:14,820
You just keep working on that man.

141
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:18,340
I can try, but I can only go so deep.

142
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,340
Go down.

143
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,340
Meet me down here.

144
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,340
Down.

145
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,340
Meet me down here.

146
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:23,340
Down.

147
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,340
Meet me down here.

148
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,340
Down.

149
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:30,160
I walk up and I'm like, what are you guys singing?

150
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,340
I was wondering if we're trying to sing a tune of justice.

151
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:35,620
I don't know who that other guy in there was.

152
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:38,300
How badly are, is the bones burnt?

153
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,920
Oh, they're very burnt.

154
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:43,480
But there's a way to get some DNA out of those bones, huh?

155
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,680
That's more our, just that's our department.

156
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,680
I look at the bones.

157
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,940
I say, we can get some DNA out of those bones.

158
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,580
Do we have three bodies in there?

159
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:51,580
Yes.

160
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:52,580
Three bodies in the house.

161
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,580
Oh, okay.

162
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,580
I was thinking the other guy got out or something.

163
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,580
I didn't think.

164
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,580
No, there was, there was the reporter.

165
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:03,860
Drew, Maggie, and the guy with the fork with the missing foot and Maggie and the guy that

166
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:06,460
I don't know were the only two with their feet cut off.

167
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:09,380
One foot cut off.

168
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,580
Dorsey was just unconscious.

169
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:15,800
I assume that Maggie and her foot cut off and the guy that she was with foot cut off

170
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:20,940
were there when they walked in, but that guy did have a fork so he could have been eating

171
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:24,140
his own foot and Maggie's foot.

172
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,140
Gross.

173
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,700
We should be able to match their dental records.

174
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,700
Awesome.

175
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:31,860
Really led the fire department's forensics.

176
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:36,140
You guys should be able to match their dental records.

177
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,580
Someone should be able to match their dental records.

178
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:42,500
Hey, can't, hey man, you know, I know it's your dream and everything.

179
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,620
Can you talk to us like a person?

180
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:45,940
We lost our chief tonight.

181
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,420
There's two more dead.

182
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,580
Can you be real with me, Carl?

183
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:53,860
Fucking just talk to me like, like Carl we all went to high school with.

184
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,980
I am sorry for your loss.

185
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:57,980
Oh, God damn it.

186
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:01,580
Who's the best dentist in contention?

187
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:05,140
Who's the only dentist in contention?

188
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,140
You mean for the dental records?

189
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,140
Dr. Teeth?

190
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,140
Yeah, for the dental records.

191
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,140
Is that how that works?

192
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,140
I don't think it is.

193
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,140
No.

194
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,140
Well, actually, probably.

195
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,140
Yeah, it probably is.

196
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,140
You have to get him from a dentist.

197
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,140
He's lying.

198
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,140
You've got to find him at the dentist.

199
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:19,140
Yeah, I mean, but for real though, how else would we do it in a small town like this?

200
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,140
We're good cops.

201
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,140
I'm a cop.

202
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:23,020
Who is the dentist in contention?

203
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,820
It would be, what's a good dentist name?

204
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:25,820
Dr. Millare.

205
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:26,820
Yeah, that's it.

206
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:27,820
Dr. Millare.

207
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:28,820
Yeah, Dr. Millare.

208
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:33,820
When we came by here yesterday, I don't remember.

209
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:34,820
Chief's Cruiser wasn't here.

210
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,300
That's what I was going to get at.

211
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,660
Was the Chief's Cruiser even here?

212
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:38,660
No, no, no.

213
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:39,660
She wasn't.

214
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,660
Can I go through her cruiser?

215
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:41,660
Good call.

216
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:44,980
And I'm going to go through Drew's car, even though he's standing right over there.

217
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:48,300
Yeah, give me just a second.

218
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,300
I have to go pee.

219
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,300
Cool.

220
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:57,860
Okay, so there was a bullet hole in his head.

221
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,180
Yeah, I missed that part.

222
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:01,140
He was slumped over a plate of meat.

223
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,140
Foot meat?

224
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:06,660
Looking back now on it, I assume foot meat and both feet were in the skillet with meat

225
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,660
picked off of them.

226
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:11,260
Do you remember seeing a bunch of blood in like the kitchen or anything?

227
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:13,260
Like were the floors covered in blood?

228
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:18,660
From like the stab wounds, all over Maggie's face was blood and then from leaking out of

229
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:19,660
their feet.

230
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:23,900
Because if you had cooking feet and then also a foot miss and I just wondered if he was

231
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,220
going back and forth or not.

232
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:29,580
Yeah, well from what I could see, like what I slipped on was my own vomit and a bunch

233
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:30,660
of puke.

234
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,940
I mean a bunch of blood.

235
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:33,940
And a bunch of puke.

236
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:34,940
And your own puke.

237
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:35,940
And my own puke.

238
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:36,940
Oh god.

239
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:39,460
There's a lot of bodily fluids in this scene.

240
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:41,220
Hey Zach, congratulations.

241
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:46,220
This is the first time since we've been roleplaying where I'm actually like legitimately grossed

242
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,220
out and horrified.

243
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,220
Yay!

244
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:53,140
Right when we walked up and you said it was eating their feet, I was like, oh fuck no.

245
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,140
Yeah.

246
00:11:54,140 --> 00:12:00,300
Dude, also this scene reminds me of that John Mulaney joke where he talks about, ew, gross,

247
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,300
clean it up.

248
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,540
There's hair, blood, and semen everywhere.

249
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:06,540
Gross.

250
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,540
Clean it up.

251
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:11,420
Do you guys want to just jerk each other off for the next 20 minutes?

252
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,740
Yeah, let's do that.

253
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:13,740
We could play too.

254
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:14,740
That'd be fine.

255
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:15,740
Same difference.

256
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:16,740
I can do one thing.

257
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,620
Do we go clockwise or counterclockwise?

258
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:19,620
What if we alternate?

259
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,140
Like a couple pumps here.

260
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,140
Dude.

261
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,140
That doesn't work.

262
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,140
Yeah, he gets.

263
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,140
Let's pair off.

264
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,140
I call Luke.

265
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,140
No, no, no.

266
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,140
I'm sitting by Luke.

267
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,140
Guys.

268
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,140
Okay.

269
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:32,340
We were talking about the firefighter and then what?

270
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,580
Oh, the dental records.

271
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,780
Yeah, we were talking about how.

272
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:39,900
You guys need to go to a vintage, you guys realize you need to go talk to the dentist

273
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:40,900
maybe.

274
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:41,900
Dr. Millar.

275
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:42,900
Dr. Millar.

276
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:43,900
Dr. Millar.

277
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:44,900
Dr. Millar.

278
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:45,900
Dr. Millar.

279
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,060
Real talk though.

280
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,060
We got to go to bed.

281
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,060
Like it's.

282
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,060
Yeah.

283
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,060
Yeah.

284
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,060
I was, I was trying to.

285
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,060
Yeah.

286
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,060
Also the doctor is not going to be, he's going to be asleep right now.

287
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,060
I don't know about you guys, but I'm fine.

288
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,060
Yeah.

289
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:59,620
So we should probably go to sleep and then we can talk to Dr. Millar after we deal with

290
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:00,620
the FBI.

291
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:05,740
I really wanted to role play a guy in cocaine, but the situation was simply too somber.

292
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:09,380
I didn't even think about that.

293
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:14,100
But like also like it instantly, like just hearing about it made me so bummed like sober

294
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,900
you up in real life.

295
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,140
I've been treated.

296
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:20,780
I'm not really, I didn't take any damage or anything that I got out of there.

297
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,420
I was just kind of in shock for a minute.

298
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:26,040
So yeah, maybe the like, uh, your eyebrows smell weird.

299
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:30,260
Maybe I don't have eyebrows anymore.

300
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:32,460
I don't have eyebrows anymore.

301
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:33,460
False eyebrows.

302
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,180
Strong character choice.

303
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:39,980
As Keith Vigna, I would love to go to my bed and fall asleep.

304
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:40,980
Yeah.

305
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:41,980
It seems good.

306
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:42,980
Same.

307
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:43,980
I'm going to go home.

308
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:48,340
Do a search on the charred remains of the chief's house.

309
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:50,740
And also were you, you tried to get into her car.

310
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:51,740
You couldn't.

311
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:52,740
Oh, that's where we left off.

312
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:53,740
Yep.

313
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,740
Good one.

314
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:55,740
Good.

315
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:56,740
Boom.

316
00:13:56,740 --> 00:14:00,500
Clark, you go and check the chief's cruiser and it is clean.

317
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,420
There is nothing inside of it.

318
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:04,460
Not even a steering wheel or seats.

319
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,820
Not even a steering wheel or seats.

320
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,420
No, there are those things.

321
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:14,020
There is however, no detritus or any other information.

322
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,440
Can I look in the glove box?

323
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,000
You look in the glove box.

324
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
It is empty.

325
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Weirdly enough.

326
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,500
Does she have a dash cam?

327
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:24,780
She has a dash cam on the cruiser and it has been unhooked.

328
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:28,940
I want to open up the computer that all cop cars have.

329
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,740
Yes, you do that.

330
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:36,820
Can I get any information from that voice comes over the computer.

331
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:37,820
Hello computer.

332
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:39,820
State your query.

333
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,860
Where was this car earlier today?

334
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,740
Examining records.

335
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:46,820
It was at the mill on the other side of the city.

336
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:49,580
This car was at the mill on the other side of the city.

337
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,260
How long was it there cop computer?

338
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:53,420
Since the evening of December 1st.

339
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:56,180
Three days since the evening of December 1st.

340
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,180
Is that right?

341
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,180
Three days.

342
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,180
That's right.

343
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,820
I mean, it's like the evening of December.

344
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:06,020
It's like two, two and a bit, two days and a couple hours.

345
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:08,860
You know, like two and a few.

346
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:11,020
Is what the computer says back to you.

347
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:12,020
Excellent.

348
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,020
Thank you cop computer.

349
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,020
Cop net.

350
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,020
Cop net.

351
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,020
Thank you cop net.

352
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:19,020
You're welcome officer Bishop.

353
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:24,260
Okay.

354
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,260
What is love?

355
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,260
Officer Bishop.

356
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:29,260
I close it.

357
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:33,060
Clark doesn't know.

358
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:36,340
Clark starts to weep.

359
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:37,340
I go back to you guys.

360
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,540
I'm going home to go to sleep.

361
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:53,060
I just, I just talked to the cop net and, uh, what, what is cop net?

362
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:55,820
You know, the, uh, the computer we talked to in our cars.

363
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,020
Clark, what are you talking?

364
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:59,740
Wait, we have a computer in our cars, buddy.

365
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:00,740
I think you need some rest.

366
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,620
I'm just so sleepy.

367
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,180
You know, cop net.

368
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,180
No, I don't.

369
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:07,700
He said he sounds like this cop, cop net.

370
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:11,460
Turns out that Maggie's car has been up at the mill for the last couple of days.

371
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:16,100
In fact, I think it's where she went after she left the station after I gave her her

372
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,100
present.

373
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,100
Yeah.

374
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,100
This was all your fault.

375
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,100
Hmm.

376
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,100
Forget about that.

377
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,100
What's at the mill.

378
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,100
I don't know.

379
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,100
I think that's something we need to investigate tomorrow.

380
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,100
Tomorrow.

381
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,100
Some grist.

382
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:29,820
I opened my computer up, look at it and I'm like, wow, I guess I do have computer in here.

383
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:32,020
I shut it and I drive home.

384
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,020
I'm driving home too.

385
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,020
Okay.

386
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,020
If you guys could both leave.

387
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,020
Oh, glad I got that one out of the way.

388
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,020
99.

389
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,020
95.

390
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,020
Woo.

391
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,020
That's a bad roll.

392
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,020
It's a bad roll.

393
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,020
Hey, I'd like to search that house.

394
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,020
Cool.

395
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:56,060
And you are super hopped up currently.

396
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:05,540
So you decide to grab, I see John going to the back of his car and pulling out a bunch

397
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:13,700
of evidence bags and then carrying them toward the burning embers of this house to collect

398
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,540
evidence in these bags.

399
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,260
Do you?

400
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:19,260
That's what I'm picturing currently.

401
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,260
Okay.

402
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,260
What do you picture?

403
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:25,700
I'm always picturing more just a stroll through the house, you know, through the wreckage

404
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:28,380
to try to find anything of significance.

405
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:33,820
This was a brick home and the exterior walls are still in place.

406
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:34,820
Sure.

407
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:35,820
Mostly.

408
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:42,100
The explosion took out a lot of the brick from the back of the house where the explosion

409
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:49,860
seems to have come from and the roof has been blown off and the insides are completely melted

410
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:54,820
and charred, but the structure itself still slightly stands.

411
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:58,480
The structure itself still slightly stands.

412
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,480
One thing for sure.

413
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,480
This was a house.

414
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,480
Nailed it.

415
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,380
You can never know if this house was a home.

416
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:07,340
What kind of evidence are you wanting to acquire?

417
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:10,400
I was mostly just hoping to do a search roll.

418
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,980
Go ahead and roll that search roll for me.

419
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:13,980
Eight.

420
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:14,980
Zero eight?

421
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:15,980
Yep.

422
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:16,980
All right.

423
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:17,980
Awesome.

424
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:18,980
All right.

425
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:19,980
Awesome.

426
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:26,460
So as you go through, you can collect the burnt remains of three bodies.

427
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:29,700
I bet we'd have some coroners for that.

428
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:33,020
Seems like a medical examiner.

429
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:36,740
I don't know if they'd just let me, even as a cop, if they'd just let me be here on my

430
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,660
own poking around like bagging up bodies.

431
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:44,720
The county coroner is walking with you as you go through it all.

432
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,060
What is their name?

433
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,060
Her name is Sheila.

434
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,140
Is she Australian?

435
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:49,140
Yeah.

436
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,060
I mean, she hates this.

437
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,060
She's not happy.

438
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:54,260
She got called at like two in the morning.

439
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:58,420
Hey, come to contention, this town that you have to drive like 45 minutes to.

440
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,420
Oh, she's from the city?

441
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,420
Yeah.

442
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,420
Yeah.

443
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,420
That makes sense.

444
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:04,980
She booked her way over here and she's dreary.

445
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:12,460
She's weary eyed and upset and helping you collect the evidence of these three charred

446
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,020
remains of bodies.

447
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,500
Sheila, in your...

448
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,500
Sorry.

449
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:20,020
In your medical opinion, how would you say these folks died?

450
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,020
Burned.

451
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:26,340
I don't want to be inappropriate like with you, but the Australian accent is truly beautiful.

452
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,780
Your husband must be a lucky man.

453
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:28,780
He is.

454
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:29,780
All right.

455
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:30,780
You want to help me pick up these bones?

456
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:33,140
Yes.

457
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,860
She begins collecting bones.

458
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:35,860
Okay.

459
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:36,860
All right.

460
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:37,860
Simply breathtaking.

461
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:38,860
Help.

462
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:39,860
There's more over here.

463
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:40,860
Okay.

464
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:43,700
I think you got that then there Sheila.

465
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:47,180
I don't think you're really Australian.

466
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:54,220
You can actually find the pistol that was in the hand of the man in the kitchen.

467
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,220
Okay.

468
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,220
I bagged that up.

469
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:59,980
And you can find the knife that was in the hand of Chief Maggie Cook.

470
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,380
The knife was in her hand.

471
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:04,780
She had a large chef's knife in her left hand.

472
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:05,780
Okay.

473
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:10,660
Well, basically I want to see if that matches the stab wounds on her face.

474
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:11,660
Okay.

475
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:20,100
And you can also find lots of gas cans, metal gas cans are strewn.

476
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,700
There are probably seven of them.

477
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,700
Okay.

478
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:25,900
The knife, well, roll forensics for me.

479
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:29,460
I mean, I would like to, I guess, send that off, but I can, I'll do it.

480
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,460
For now.

481
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:31,460
I'll just hold it up to the-

482
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,460
Yep.

483
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:33,460
That's hold it up to the holes.

484
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:36,260
To the holes in the skull.

485
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,580
That's a, wow.

486
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,580
That's a crit fail.

487
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:39,580
All right.

488
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:42,100
What does a crit fail on a forensics test look like?

489
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:50,540
You slip and you shove the knife into the burnt skull of Chief Maggie Cook and you accidentally

490
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:56,780
rifle around and a lot of her face and skull disintegrate onto itself.

491
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:57,780
Oh shit.

492
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:03,700
So you might not be able to get super accurate results back from that.

493
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:08,700
And Sheila says, what are you doing over there?

494
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:12,180
I didn't want to do that.

495
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:20,740
Now you know how Keith fucks up all the rolls, I just have you one on one.

496
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:21,740
I can make whatever-

497
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:25,420
The other thing though is that I did not want to wiggle the knife around in her skull, can

498
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,420
we?

499
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:30,660
Like, that's not what I'm trying to do here.

500
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:32,740
That was funny, but can we wreck on that?

501
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:36,980
I'll take every crit failure as strongly as I possibly can.

502
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:45,140
I know that, but it just seems disrespectful to destroy the Chief's face.

503
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:47,780
That's not what I was about.

504
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:48,980
Go ahead and roll sanity for me.

505
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:51,740
Is this a knife?

506
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:56,100
While poking through all this stuff and then severely fucking up the corpse of your former

507
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,100
boss.

508
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:01,980
Oh, God damn it, that's a 99.

509
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:02,980
That's a crit fail.

510
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:03,980
Okay, awesome.

511
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:09,620
Go ahead and lose three sanity automatically, which puts you at 40.

512
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:10,620
Yes.

513
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:13,340
Is there anything else that you wanted to do?

514
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:15,220
No, I think I've done enough here.

515
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,220
Couldn't agree more.

516
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:19,020
So go ahead and roll alertness for me real quick.

517
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,020
95.

518
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,620
On a 100.

519
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:22,620
So congratulations.

520
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:24,340
No, it's on a 16.

521
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:28,540
Okay, you don't notice the thing that you would have noticed?

522
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:31,860
Your search check was for inside the house, which you succeeded on, so you got everything

523
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:37,380
inside the house, but the alertness check was for something that's totally fair.

524
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,380
Very different.

525
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:39,380
Okay.

526
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:42,500
Wish I hadn't destroyed the Chief's face.

527
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,940
I bet it'll be fine.

528
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,620
That image is going to stay with me.

529
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:50,780
Just digging around in there as it completely falls apart.

530
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:53,060
Okay, so I don't know.

531
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:56,100
I mean, yeah, I'll go home and put that stuff away.

532
00:22:56,340 --> 00:23:02,500
Okay, so you finish putting everything into the house and get the trailer that you used

533
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,900
ready to take back in the morning.

534
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,820
And then you go inside and...

535
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:12,220
Yeah, I'm going to jack off and, I don't know, maybe throw on some ancient aliens.

536
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:14,940
That should help get you to sleep.

537
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:17,420
So you're not going to be able to fall asleep for too long tonight.

538
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:22,960
In fact, I'm going to have you roll power in order to get even a decent night's rest.

539
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,860
So roll against your POW.

540
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,420
Crit success.

541
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:27,420
Nice.

542
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:32,100
Then you're going to be able to force your cocaine-addled mind right to sleep.

543
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,420
The Pennymores are famously clear of mind.

544
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,460
You're laying in bed.

545
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,100
Your eyes close.

546
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,100
Zach, I'm right here.

547
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,100
Zach, no, no, no.

548
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,100
I'm right here.

549
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,100
Wake up, buddy.

550
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,100
I'm right here.

551
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:54,860
Not for the podcast, that's for us.

552
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:55,860
That was a dumb joke.

553
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,860
You're trying to do something serious instead of mood.

554
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:59,740
And I was just like, so anyway.

555
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:00,740
You come to...

556
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,740
Edit point.

557
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:10,020
You come to and the sky is dark, but the ground begins to give light to the world.

558
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:16,900
You see a man in the distance with his head and hands in stocks that sit on an inky black

559
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,520
stage.

560
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:23,340
As you walk toward this man, the ground becomes wider and wider like a screen's brightness

561
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:26,620
level being gradually turned up.

562
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:32,080
You hear a holler from behind you and when you turn around, you see your mother.

563
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:37,040
She looks like she did when she was about your age and she is crying.

564
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:45,320
She looks past you and a door appears in between you, but you can hear her say, I'm so sorry.

565
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,760
He's just so beautiful.

566
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,140
You don't have to do this.

567
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:49,260
We can leave.

568
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,860
We can run.

569
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:56,700
The door floats up into the sky and sitting behind it is that trunk.

570
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:01,300
You locked up in the police department with the woman's split head atop the black putrid

571
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,980
hacked up anatomy.

572
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:08,700
You turn around and you are face to face with the man in the stocks, John Peters, his forehead

573
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:13,400
burned and peeling with the word fool desperate.

574
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:19,760
His eyes widen and he whispers, please, it's coming.

575
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,920
They cannot stop it.

576
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,620
They are playing the roles of greater men.

577
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,800
You have to save everyone.

578
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,640
It is coming.

579
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,600
What's coming, John, what's coming?

580
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:36,000
You hear a rumble in the distance as you wake up in bed.

581
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,880
Oh, another good night's sleep.

582
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,340
You know, I never, I never remember my dreams.

583
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:44,540
You actually get a D four back on willpower.

584
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:48,460
That's a two hello world.

585
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:53,620
And uh, you're heading to the station to meet up with, um, your partners as well as the

586
00:25:53,620 --> 00:26:02,940
FBI.

587
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:10,520
Joe Clark makes it back to his home where he is almost finished unloading all the stuff

588
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:15,540
into his house and upon finishing it, I assume you're going to skip the wheel of fortune

589
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:17,280
tonight and go straight to bed.

590
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,160
Probably no, no dinner even.

591
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:27,120
So as you fall asleep in bed, you're walking through a parking lot and you look down and

592
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:33,220
you see you are carrying a piece of old parchment that is rolled up with a neat little string

593
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:35,160
tied tightly around it.

594
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:40,060
Looking up, you hand it to the cashier of your local grocery store.

595
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,220
You like this guy.

596
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:44,380
He's trying to scan the role, but it's not beeping.

597
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:48,900
He looks at you as he chuckles up, this is going to cost you greatly.

598
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:53,180
As you walk out of the grocery store, you step into the sanctuary of a church during

599
00:26:53,180 --> 00:27:01,020
a funeral, a young boy with an enormous forehead and the darkest eyes you've seen is walking

600
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:07,740
up to you and tears are streaming down his face as he stares into your eyes.

601
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:16,140
You hear a small voice inside you that says, please, sir, as the crying boy holds out his

602
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,140
hands.

603
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,140
Do I still have the parchment?

604
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,140
Yeah.

605
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,140
Can I unroll the parchment?

606
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,140
Yeah.

607
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:26,180
As you unroll it, the young boy looks up and he reaches for it and you begin to hear cries

608
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:31,200
throughout the sanctuary you are standing in and as you look around, the congregation

609
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,980
is trying to run away, but they are melting into the floor.

610
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:39,780
You look down and you too are melting into the floor.

611
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:45,300
When you look up, the boy has been replaced by Tildy B. Mitchell, who looks down at you

612
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:48,420
with her finger pointed at you like a gun.

613
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:56,260
She disappears and reappears over and over again as you slowly sink into the floor.

614
00:27:56,260 --> 00:28:04,080
As your eyes look to the ceiling of the chapel, you hear a voice inside you say, let go.

615
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,320
As you wake up in bed.

616
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:10,840
In the dream, I never got a good look at the parchment as I was unrolling it.

617
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,840
Okay.

618
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,840
Okay.

619
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:25,620
So John, when you wake up, I'm going to have you normally on each day.

620
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:33,080
This is when we would do our dealings with the disorder that you have picked up.

621
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:40,520
So each day, basically we're going to look back at the past day and say, Thomas, did

622
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:46,880
John Lee Pettymore actively choose to avoid any threats or chances to save people?

623
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,880
And you didn't.

624
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,320
So you don't take any willpower damage.

625
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:56,200
Each day that you do avoid one of those things, the next day you'll take a D6 hit to your

626
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,080
willpower when you wake up.

627
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:02,600
And for each day that you continually do that, it doubles or sorry, it doesn't double.

628
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,880
It just adds a D6 every time.

629
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:12,140
So as long as you continue to not avoid threats or chances to save people, you'll be fine.

630
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:19,080
When John wakes up, however, he has a text from Drew.

631
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,700
What does that say?

632
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:23,440
Text from Drew.

633
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,900
Clark came by last night when no one is at the station.

634
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:28,040
He warned me not to go to the chief's house.

635
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,240
He was limping, but he wasn't limping later.

636
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,360
What is going on?

637
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,800
And where is all the cake?

638
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,640
I text him back.

639
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,720
I ask him where he is right now.

640
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,780
Did he go to the hospital after?

641
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,480
Was he injured at chief's house?

642
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,480
No.

643
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,480
Okay.

644
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,840
I ask him where he is now and I tell him that the cake is safe.

645
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,840
All right.

646
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,840
Sounds good.

647
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:52,740
He'll send you a text back as you're getting ready and say, I'm already at the station.

648
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:58,840
If we were really organizing like a multimillion dollar drug deal, like Drew is the sweet,

649
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:03,320
like what a sweet way to address that at the end of a text, like, Hey, by the way,

650
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,160
where's all the drugs?

651
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:09,400
No, Hey, don't, I, you know, I know you got a lot on your plate.

652
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,400
Don't worry about it.

653
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,600
But by the way, uh, where's all the cake?

654
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,600
He's super nice.

655
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,600
He is.

656
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,600
Yeah.

657
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,600
I guess.

658
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,600
I don't know.

659
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,600
He has Coke contacts.

660
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,600
He can't.

661
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,600
Maybe.

662
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,840
Maybe.

663
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:22,840
So I text him.

664
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:23,840
Yeah.

665
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,680
That, that the cake is safe and where is he?

666
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,680
Okay.

667
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,680
Yeah.

668
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:31,440
He'll, he'll respond and tell you that he's already at the station.

669
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,440
What time is it?

670
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,440
Eight.

671
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,440
Sure.

672
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,440
Seven.

673
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,440
Doesn't matter.

674
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,440
Six.

675
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,440
Nope.

676
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,440
It's eight.

677
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,440
Yeah.

678
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,440
Okay.

679
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,440
Seven 30.

680
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,440
It's eight o'clock.

681
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,440
Okay.

682
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,440
Doesn't matter.

683
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,440
You ready?

684
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,440
It's just a, it's really essential for me to get into that head space.

685
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,440
You know, like what time is it?

686
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,440
Is it seven 45?

687
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,440
Is it eight, eight 15?

688
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,440
How stressed should I be?

689
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,440
I got to think about the light, how it's acting up.

690
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,480
A lot goes into my role play decisions.

691
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,480
I appreciate that.

692
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,280
Oh, absolutely.

693
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:07,880
It's definitely a lot of planning and uh, I like to inhabit a character, you know, not

694
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:12,480
just fly by the cuff of my like a cuff of my seat, the seat of my, okay.

695
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,480
The seat of your tight pants.

696
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,480
Yeah.

697
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:18,480
Let's not include any of this.

698
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,480
All right, Luke.

699
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:37,080
So your disorder is that you have to actively lie about things to make you sound better.

700
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,080
Yes.

701
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,080
You didn't do that yesterday.

702
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,080
I haven't been doing that.

703
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:46,580
Uh, so you're going to start off today with one D six willpower damage and for each day

704
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:51,280
that you continue to not lie to make yourself sound better, it's going to be an extra D

705
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,280
six daily.

706
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,280
Okay.

707
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,280
Do I have to lie?

708
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,280
Yeah.

709
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,280
Okay.

710
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,080
That's five.

711
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,080
Five willpower.

712
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,080
Okay.

713
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,080
So that brings me down.

714
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,080
Starting at two.

715
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,080
Yeah.

716
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,080
What happens if I go to zero?

717
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,080
I die.

718
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,880
I lose the will to live.

719
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:15,480
So at one or two willpower, we're going to learn now you are having an emotional breakdown

720
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:20,680
and that is going to cause a negative 20% to all of your roles for the day.

721
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,680
Yeah.

722
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,980
Oh, that's just what Keith needs.

723
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:28,780
When you hit zero, uh, no tests can succeed.

724
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:33,180
Uh, and I take control whenever I want of your character.

725
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:34,180
Okay.

726
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:36,580
How can I gain willpower back other than sleeping?

727
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:40,080
You can do stimulants to focus.

728
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:46,580
And for each upper that you take, it will negate the negative 20% to your roles for

729
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:48,320
one D six hours.

730
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,980
And what's the negative consequences of that?

731
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:58,580
Well, if you use stimulants too often, they become addictive and your body will be at

732
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:00,980
a negative 20% without their use.

733
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:03,580
Is there a way to get over that addiction?

734
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:04,580
Yeah.

735
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:05,580
Rehab.

736
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:09,280
How long in game is that?

737
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:12,180
We will get there if we get there.

738
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,180
Okay.

739
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:14,180
Sounds good.

740
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,180
Shit.

741
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:18,740
Looks like I'm going to break into the stash today.

742
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:23,940
So do you want to, uh, I mean, do you want to try to find anything to make yourself feel,

743
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:25,740
but you've wake up feeling like shit.

744
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:26,740
Yeah.

745
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:28,740
I mean, would coffee count?

746
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:29,740
No.

747
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:31,740
I didn't think so.

748
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:36,040
Um, yeah, I probably am going to have to, I'm going to do the only stimulant that I

749
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:41,740
know is easily available to Keith, which is the cocaine, the mounds of cocaine that we

750
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:42,740
have.

751
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:43,740
Yes.

752
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,540
And it is all out at, uh, John's house.

753
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:47,960
It is all out at John's house.

754
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,560
He might have some on him.

755
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,560
Who knows?

756
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:54,000
So I wake up, I guess I'm going to give John a ring.

757
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
What time is it right now?

758
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,560
Oh, it's like eight in the morning.

759
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,560
Okay.

760
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,560
Yeah.

761
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:04,560
I want to give John a ring or a text or whatever and say, Hey, can you bring some stimulants

762
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,560
with you?

763
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,560
Okay.

764
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,560
Okay.

765
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,560
Sounds good.

766
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:17,560
Cool.

767
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:23,160
So yesterday you did actively hurt a few people.

768
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:24,160
Yeah.

769
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:28,760
I believe you shot the woman in the, in the hand at least once and then in her chest multiple

770
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,760
times.

771
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,760
A lot.

772
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:34,200
Um, the woman at the hotel motel.

773
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:38,960
And that means that you, when you wake up this morning, don't have to take any willpower

774
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:44,760
damage to begin the day because your disorder is in control of you.

775
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:49,160
So you only actively lose willpower when you wake up.

776
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:53,240
If you are refraining from giving into the power of your disorder.

777
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,240
Yep.

778
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,240
Right.

779
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,240
Okay.

780
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:01,360
So when you wake up, you, uh, I think you are actually at 10 out of 12 willpower points.

781
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,240
So you're feeling pretty all right.

782
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,240
I indeed slept.

783
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,240
All right.

784
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:08,960
So, uh, when you get up, didn't sleep all right.

785
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,760
Yeah.

786
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:45,760
