1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
This is weird. Can y'all hear me? Because all I'm doin' right now is thinkin' real hard towards y'all soft gooey brains.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Ha ha ha ha. My powers are weird and ever-changin'.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I am telepathin' live from 694.2 PTBP straight into your mind cavity.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It's your Espa that's the besta. Wolf the dog. I wanna give a resoundin'

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
awwwwwwwwwww

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:45,000
to all of you who donated to the bail project. Y'all raised $6,654.

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
And I got one final winner to announce.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The fifth person to receive an official PTBP t-shirt is Roxy from Hamburg, Germany.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Congratulations, Roxy. Damn, I wish I coulda won one of them shirts.

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I kept mailin' that Zach idiot all kinds of dumpster treasure that was worth at least $5.

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Anywho, yesterday I was dippin' into a bucket of applesauce and it was somethin' special.

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
You probably wanna know how ol' Wolfie makes his special sauce.

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Applesauce is when I let all the apples I steal from dumpsters around town

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,000
sit in a bucket until they change from a solid to a sort of delicious slurry of a sauce.

15
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You can dip all kinds of shit in it. Other less liquid apples, baby carrots,

16
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:52,000
tortilla chips, or like your whole body before goin' out on the town to find a new honey to love on.

17
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
But I digress so that I may digest the news.

18
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Last time, our three mentally exhausted anti-heroes?

19
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Not quite heroes, though. Not yet fully villains, though either, I suppose.

20
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Our broken protagonists raced through the tunnels under the town of contention.

21
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
When they popped out at Bean's Pond, they saw a different reality than the real one.

22
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Asher and Avery Little gave it the best shot, but they were unable to grasp retribution for the missing children.

23
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And with that, these boys erased the final two pieces in the Little family puzzle from this plane of existence.

24
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
The veil was lifted. Bishop, Pettymore, and Vigna saw the truth of their situation.

25
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Casey Kristoff is holding Carrie Page's body at gunpoint.

26
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Pastor Adam Kane is on the four-wheeler gunnin' it down into the former pond toward Keith with the helmet on.

27
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
And a hell-bent black cat on the back atop the radio with its green light lit.

28
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:12,000
And I have been given the green light to drop this brand new track on y'all's here in contention.

29
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Get ready to add this smash of a banger to your apocalypse playlist.

30
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It's kudzu with no backbone.

31
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Hello, everyone. Welcome to Pretending to be People.

32
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
My name is Zach, and I am your handler, or your gum, as some might say.

33
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Who says gum? Nobody.

34
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Guys, why don't you do the intro we do?

35
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I've always called you my handsome-ler, so I don't know what your gum thing is about.

36
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
That's very sweet, but why aren't you guys doing the intro?

37
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
This is the 85th episode. We've done the same intro every time.

38
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:17,000
No, no, no. The intro of this show is that Chris the cat introduces a cool new song every once in a while when he feels like it.

39
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Not every time.

40
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Is it Chris? Is it Chris the cat?

41
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Frank the parrot.

42
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
That doesn't sound right.

43
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I think it's Pete the parrot.

44
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Craig the cow.

45
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Craig the cow, that's right. That's it.

46
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I can't believe we all forgot that.

47
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Hey, guys, why didn't you think anything about Casey Kristoff?

48
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:43,000
We just improved a lot of work for Justin.

49
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I tried to think about Casey Kristoff, but we kept talking to other people in the room, and then we had to leave.

50
00:04:52,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I heard Craig's snarky little comment about how we just ignored him, but personally, I never noticed him in the first place.

51
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I internalized that he was not paying attention to the book he was reading, so I knew he was overhearing us as we spoke.

52
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I just thought that it was going to turn out that he had a bunch more information to give us, and then we never got to talk to him about it.

53
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I'm so mad at the people playing real playing games when I'm listening to their podcasts all in a row.

54
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'm sorry, the dog. Cut this whole part out. The dog. Anyway, Craig the cow.

55
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Do you know what the best song of 2018 was? It's Again and Again by the Dave Matthews Band.

56
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
What's your source on that?

57
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Ultimateclassicrock.com.

58
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Shouldn't they not keep us updated on current music?

59
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Guys, I was at the grocery store today, and I saw this dude in his mid-40s rocking a Dave Matthews Band O2 tour shirt.

60
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I've just never been more proud of somebody for being themselves.

61
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I got a minor in possession charge outside of a Dave Matthews Band show when I was 18 years old.

62
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Who hasn't?

63
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:24,000
All of us except for Zach. This is the dog corner I was talking about. I'm sorry.

64
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Our audio is still far better than many other quarantine podcasts, so it should be fine.

65
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Throw your dick down, babe. Go!

66
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I put in work to make sure that that's true, motherfucker.

67
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Hell yeah.

68
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Luke, any issue with Casey Kristoff before you dive into another song from another list on the internet?

69
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:52,000
What do you mean, any issue? Fuck that guy. I have all issues with him. What do you mean, though?

70
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Nobody did anything about what was clearly a character who was eavesdropping.

71
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I think if you go back two episodes, maybe, I said something like,

72
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I want to talk to Kristoff, but if we're still talking to this girl, let's finish that up.

73
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I think those exact words came out of my mouth.

74
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I don't think we were going to just completely dismiss him, but, you know, things happen.

75
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,000
People explode a little bit and beat up an old lady. It happens.

76
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Something fell out of Mildred Mitchell's pocket. A piece of paper fell out of Mildred Mitchell's pocket.

77
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Did I pick it up? And it had some writing on it. You just looked at it. You didn't pick it up.

78
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Did I read it? You did. What did it say again?

79
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It says, Iyinaha fersat sayiya.

80
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Oh yeah, because I wanted to make the joke of the time that I wanted to punch you saying that,

81
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
and then I remembered that it was just your DM voice saying it. It wasn't a character saying it out loud.

82
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I punch. I punch. I immediately punch. Throat punch.

83
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
And thankfully we're not in the same room, so. You would have had a smack coming.

84
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Punch me through the phone. How about best lists of all time?

85
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Top dryers, go. Okay. I like a Kenmore, I like a Whirlpool.

86
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Air. Most used dryer of all time.

87
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Best dryers of all time. Let's see.

88
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Well, if we go under the assumption that they get better every year, then the best dryer of all time.

89
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
There's literally no way that appliances get better every year.

90
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Yeah, I was about to say that's kind of the antithesis of appliances these days.

91
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
But let's just go under the assumption that that is true.

92
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:43,000
And the answer is the GE GTD84ECPNDG.

93
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
What does that stand for? General Electric.

94
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Go to do 84 entire clothings pending not dry goods.

95
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
They put that at number two?

96
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I'm personally fond of the LGDLE7300WE.

97
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I mean, if you like new ones, it's fine. It's all electric.

98
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I like my gas powered dryer.

99
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Dude, speaking of lists, that made me think...

100
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
No, no, no. Let's hang out on this dryer humid for a while.

101
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
The dog break is longer than I thought it was going to be.

102
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Yeah.

103
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Should we stop recording this particular segment?

104
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Well, I mean, I don't even think I'll have to edit anything we've done so far.

105
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It's so fucking funny.

106
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Yeah, sure.

107
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Hi.

108
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Hey.

109
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Okay, I'm going to go pee real quick.

110
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
So Murphy has a diarrhea or something. I'm really sorry.

111
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Bummer.

112
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Oh, I straight up thought that was a joke.

113
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I do too.

114
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
The diarrhea?

115
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
No, the Luke leaving to go pee like right when you came back.

116
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Oh boy.

117
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
We're doing it, man. 730.

118
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
On the dot.

119
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I'm going to go pee.

120
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
You burned it.

121
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I'm about to take a quiz. Which Queer Eye cast member are you?

122
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
While driving late one night, you hit a deer with your car.

123
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
By the way, it is lying broken and bloody on the pavement.

124
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
You can tell it is not going to live for long.

125
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
The dying deer looks you in the eyes and yells,

126
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I'm you. How would you kill the deer?

127
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I would get back in my car and run it over to finish the job.

128
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I would snap the deer's neck.

129
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I would tape the deer to the hood of my car,

130
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
drag it into my house and put its head in my microwave.

131
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I would make a sign that says I deserve this because I shoplifted

132
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
and I would hang it around the deer's neck.

133
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Then I would drive away and leave the deer to die in agony.

134
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Do the microwave one so you get Anthony.

135
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Okay.

136
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Did I tell you guys I got addicted for a day or two

137
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
watching YouTube videos of flight towers talking inexperienced pilots

138
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
how to land a plane in emergencies?

139
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
That sounds awesome.

140
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
That sounds so good.

141
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It was wildly fascinating.

142
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Oh no.

143
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Oh, I actually am still recording.

144
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Good.

145
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Everybody who role plays knows that sometimes you get everybody together

146
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
and then you don't role play.

147
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Okay, should we just keep recording on this and start?

148
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Yeah.

149
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Okay.

150
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I'm keeping all the below deck shit.

151
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Good. Arguably the thing I know the most about right now.

152
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Mine is Crusader Kings, Below Deck, and The Sopranos.

153
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I'm rewatching Lost.

154
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I never started it.

155
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I mean, Lost famously sucks at the end.

156
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Yeah, but I'm not there yet.

157
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
It's not Michael Bay, is it?

158
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Is it J.J. Abrams that did that?

159
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
No, it's Michael Bay.

160
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
What did Michael Bay do? Is he Transformers?

161
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
No, he did Super 8.

162
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
So last time, Clark Bishop, Keith Vigna, and John Lee Pettymore,

163
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
you guys won your power contest

164
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
and you felt like the external forces grip on your perception was loosening.

165
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
And the scene as you knew it in a single blink changed completely.

166
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Immediately, Bean's Pond was surrounded by this floating moat

167
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
that you saw the first time when you arrived in contention

168
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
and it was completely encircling the church.

169
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
The church? Yes, the campus there.

170
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
However, now it is surrounding you.

171
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
And John and Clark, you guys are right next to it.

172
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
It's like right behind you.

173
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,000
And Keith, I believe you have been shot in the ribs and shot in the hip.

174
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Correct.

175
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
And you are trying to make your way down the basin,

176
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
this muddy, muddy basin where there used to be a pond.

177
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Still no water in it.

178
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
That wasn't a gag on your mind space.

179
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Am I not in it already?

180
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I think I made it down already.

181
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Oh, you made your way down.

182
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
You've yet to roll a dexterity check to not fall on your way down there.

183
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Okay.

184
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I think we'll start off with that.

185
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Okay, I was going down to check and see if it actually said about me, about Bean.

186
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
That's right.

187
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
So hold on to that roll for me as you roll it

188
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
and I will continue to explain that you saw...

189
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Fuck!

190
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
What was it?

191
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
77.

192
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Oh, no!

193
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I should have lied, but...

194
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Oh, I'm super glad you didn't.

195
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Don't ever lie.

196
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
There's no point.

197
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
The game lives and dies on us being truthful.

198
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
77 on a 60.

199
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Holy shit.

200
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Okay, beautiful.

201
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:52,000
So Keith is sliding face first down the side of the mud basin.

202
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,000
You guys look up and you see Casey Kristoff, Van Halen t-shirt,

203
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
cut off jeans, mullet, pencil-thin mustache.

204
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,000
He's holding a pistol to the back of Kerry Page's head.

205
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
The body thereof.

206
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
The body thereof.

207
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
And then right next to them, we've got Pastor Adam Kane,

208
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Daddy Kane, wearing the strange-looking motorcycle helmet with all the tubes.

209
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
The red light is lit and he's driving a four-wheeler.

210
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Yeah.

211
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
That's the part that hurt the most.

212
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
That's the fucking part that hurt the most.

213
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
When you last episode were like, THE four-wheeler.

214
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
THE four-wheeler.

215
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Damn it.

216
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:41,000
And strapped to the back of this four-wheeler, you see the radio.

217
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Its green light is lit and holding on for dear life on top of this radio

218
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,000
is an extremely determined black cat that you recognize.

219
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Yes.

220
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
It's the agent.

221
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Agent Trent Chad is in that cat's body.

222
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
That's the guy who showed up to the Contention PD with Red Bulls piled in his car

223
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
and sunglasses on the back of his head.

224
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
And I think he was just coming down to investigate how we had fucked up so bad.

225
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Yeah.

226
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
So what was the timeline of the cat?

227
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
The cat was a cat.

228
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Then the cat and Doug Jacobs switched.

229
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:21,000
And then Doug Jacobs and the cat's body got switched with Agent Trent Chad.

230
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Yeah, I believe that was your guys' doing in the police station inventory room.

231
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Well, Agent Trent Chad shouldn't have showed up with such mysterious motives and purposes.

232
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Yeah.

233
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
He deserved it.

234
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
If he had told us what the fuck they were doing there.

235
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Well, also Clark had just come back from a little visit out of town with some darts.

236
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I was able to make him do what I wanted and that was my goal.

237
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Oh, no.

238
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I know that.

239
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I just mean we might have done it to somebody else if he hadn't gotten all in our business

240
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
for no goddamn good reason.

241
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Yeah.

242
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Yeah.

243
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
No reason whatsoever.

244
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
You mentioned something about ice crystals forming on the water wall.

245
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Can you elaborate on that?

246
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Yeah.

247
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
It's really fucking cold outside.

248
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
But they're not like impenetrable or anything like that.

249
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
It's just frosty out.

250
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
No, no.

251
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
That is just some flavor.

252
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Gotcha.

253
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Just a reminder that it's December 6th.

254
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Is the wall moving or is it just stationary water?

255
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
The wall is not like encroaching or growing away from you.

256
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
However, the water is flowing.

257
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
That's kind of what I meant.

258
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Yeah.

259
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
So is it like spinning around the circle?

260
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Yes, it is.

261
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Gotcha.

262
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
And there are fish in it?

263
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
There are shitloads of fish in it.

264
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
And it smells vile.

265
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,000
You remember the smell when John stuck his head in the back of the truck?

266
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I remember that this thing smells.

267
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I just want to...

268
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I'm looking, Zach, what does this smell like?

269
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Oh, okay.

270
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Yeah.

271
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:54,000
So when I was in seventh grade...

272
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
My brother shed on my face and gave me pink eye.

273
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
How did you...

274
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
No.

275
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Tell this story every podcast.

276
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
And then I edit it out because you guys don't laugh hard enough.

277
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I should just edit the laughter in.

278
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Ooh.

279
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
That's a good idea.

280
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I'll use that.

281
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
That was genuine.

282
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Yeah.

283
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
We're going to get a good take.

284
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Good cats.

285
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
So my brother got fish food.

286
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Do you know like the wet fish food?

287
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:40,000
And he put it in the air ventilating system of our youth minister's truck.

288
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
That wasn't very Christ-like of him.

289
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Jesus made a bunch of fish, so it's kind of...

290
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Must have been a shitty youth minister.

291
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
What does the wall smell like?

292
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Oh, yeah.

293
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:07,000
So when I was in seventh grade, it was a hot summer day, but bright and early in the morning

294
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:14,000
before the sun was out, my brother took that wet fish food and he put it in the air ventilation

295
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
system of our youth minister's truck.

296
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,000
And then the truck just sat outside and baked in the heat all day.

297
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Yeah.

298
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
And I was running an errand with him later in the day and we got in there and he turned

299
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,000
the air conditioning all the way up and we both just like...

300
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:46,000
So it smells like if someone had put a rotting fish in your wheel well and you couldn't find

301
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
it for like four months.

302
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
So stinky.

303
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Yeah.

304
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Just a little smelly.

305
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Now what?

306
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I mean, that's the golden question.

307
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
We're in a pickle.

308
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Is it like, are we still doing turns or...

309
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Oh, yeah.

310
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Are we in turn order still?

311
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Yeah, we are.

312
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
So we're going to start with Casey Kristoff pulling the trigger.

313
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
No, so...

314
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Because fuck you guys.

315
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
We'll start with Clark as per usual and Keith's first turn will be his 77 roll.

316
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
So Clark Bishop, it's on you.

317
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Oh, fuck.

318
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,000
You took that talent and immediately I was like, oh, you want to act first every time?

319
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
You want to lead off every single...

320
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
You want to set the tone for every interaction?

321
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
How fast is Adam Kane going and which direction is he going?

322
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Is he aiming for like a person or is he aiming for the door?

323
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
He was literally aiming his gun at Keith, but was he driving in a particular direction?

324
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
So he actually doesn't have a gun out.

325
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
He's got both hands on the wheel.

326
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
He's aiming the four wheeler at Keith.

327
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Oh, gotcha.

328
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Who is actually right across the door from him.

329
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Or as we said last time, the impossible metal plate.

330
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
And is he on top of the ponder inside of it?

331
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
He is about to drop in like a skateboarder might.

332
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Yeah, very cool. Begrudgingly.

333
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Are there any famous four wheeler people?

334
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Travis Pastrana probably.

335
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Anything with wheels, that guy can do cool stuff on.

336
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
It's pronounced pastrami.

337
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Pastrami.

338
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Yeah.

339
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Oh, I didn't know that this entire time.

340
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Yeah, his dad was a deli.

341
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
So fucking stupid.

342
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Never mind, I'll find...

343
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Is that meatloaf?

344
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
It's a deli.

345
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Oh my God.

346
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Is that meatloaf?

347
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Oh no.

348
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Fuck.

349
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Clark is going to...

350
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Clark, I want to point my gun at Adam Kane and yell stop the vehicle while I'm aiming

351
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
at him.

352
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
And I want to use my turn to use the aim action.

353
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Oh yeah, absolutely.

354
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
That gives me a bonus to my next round's shot.

355
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Correct?

356
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
It does indeed.

357
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Plus 20 on your next shot.

358
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Which will put your firearms at what?

359
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Like 100.

360
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Oh, it is 100, yeah.

361
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Can't miss, baby.

362
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Triple zeroes is a fail though.

363
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Yeah, 100 will still be a crit fail.

364
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I want to use that mechanic to impress upon in the world that Adam Kane knows that I'm

365
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
aiming for him.

366
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Oh, hell yeah.

367
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Okay, sick.

368
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
And he knows I'm not going to miss.

369
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,000
So as you're just following him, you see down the...

370
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Do pistols have an aimer?

371
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Iron sights?

372
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Do pistols have an aimer?

373
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Hey, you got your episode title.

374
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Yeah, buddy.

375
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
That's you.

376
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
You did it, bud.

377
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
You're the pistols aimer.

378
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
It's you.

379
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
It's been inside you the whole time.

380
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Yeah.

381
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Isn't that wonderful?

382
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Hey there, buddy.

383
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Why don't you just, you know, just point the gun and then you'll pull the trigger.

384
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
So it's one drawn gun.

385
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
No, that actually plays here.

386
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:17,000
You are looking down and right back over the top of your sights, you see the bridge

387
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:24,000
of Adam Kane's nose and both of his eyes are staring straight back at you and they are

388
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
massive.

389
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
He looks scared.

390
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,000
He looks scared or he has massive eyes like that fucking John Peters video.

391
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:38,000
He does have very, very pitch black eyes and a weird balloon shaped head.

392
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Did he always have those things?

393
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
He did.

394
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Yeah.

395
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Yeah.

396
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Those are the two descriptors of Pastor Adam Kane currently known as Daddy.

397
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Oh yeah.

398
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
John Lee Pettymore, it's your turn.

399
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I would also like to, uh, I'd like to aim at Adam and I'm going to say you're going

400
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
to have to stop right there, buddy.

401
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Cause there's only one daddy in this town.

402
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I like wink over it at Clark.

403
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I'm like, it's him.

404
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Okay.

405
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Luke, do you tell me what happens?

406
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Oh, okay.

407
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Oh no, don't do that.

408
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I mean, I rolled a crit fail on my getting down.

409
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Oh, I forgot about that.

410
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Gotcha.

411
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Your left side is just rocked by a couple bullets that hit some pretty brutal spots,

412
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
your hip and your ribs.

413
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:35,000
And as your left foot lands on the mud, it hits a rock and you just feel your whole leg

414
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
stiffens.

415
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,000
It does that thing where you kind of hyper extend your knee on it, but that just shoots

416
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
your, your thigh bone directly up into this hip.

417
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:51,000
That's just been shattered and you feel a crack as you just immediately crumble forward.

418
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:58,000
But seeing as how you're on a pretty steep incline, it makes a belly flop noise as your

419
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:04,000
face just hits the mud and you start slowly sliding down this hill.

420
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Yuck.

421
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I'm going to do drugs probably on my next turn.

422
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
That'll do.

423
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
It's a three and a seven.

424
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Oh, pastor Adam Kane just leans forward.

425
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:26,000
He's got just horror in his eyes as he makes direct eye contact with Clark Bishop, knowing

426
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:36,000
full well that his shot will ring true and he just noses down in and guns the four wheeler

427
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:42,000
directly into this muddy base and whipping up just wet mud behind him as he just back

428
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
and forth, back and forth, his back end sliding around.

429
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:52,000
And he goes right over the impassable metal plate over the top and then whips his back

430
00:24:52,000 --> 00:25:02,000
end, just spraying Keith Vigna's back with mud like a bad guy from an eighties ski movie.

431
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:13,000
And this black cat turns on the radio, hops off and starts running away, leaving the radio

432
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:20,000
directly in between pastor Adam Kane on this four wheeler and Keith Vigna face down in

433
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
the mud.

434
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:29,000
The radio is on and Casey Kristoff hollers with his pistol pointed into the back of

435
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Carrie Page's body's head.

436
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,000
She's blindfolded and she's on her knees with her hands behind her back.

437
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
All right now, everybody, everybody come on down.

438
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Just so you know, Mr. Bishop, Mr. Pettymore, if either one of you fire those weapons, your

439
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
friend Drew Andrews here is dead.

440
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
And if I fire my weapon, Adam's dead.

441
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Does he have any reaction to that?

442
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
He cocks the pistol.

443
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I cock mine.

444
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Carrie pages blindfolded on her knees, hands behind her back, starts hollering.

445
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Bubble gum tree.

446
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Bubble gum tree.

447
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Bubble gum tree.

448
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Bubble gum tree.

449
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
It's him.

450
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:21,000
A giant smile goes across the face of Carrie pages.

451
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Yay, it's Drewby.

452
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Drew, babe.

453
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
John's going to move his gun to Casey.

454
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Any, any he'll say, he won't say anything.

455
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,000
John moves his gun to Casey and lets that do the talking for him.

456
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Keith Vigna, what do you do?

457
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:42,000
As you're laying there, you hear this radio flip on and the noise starts kicking up.

458
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:52,000
That was a disturbingly good radio sound.

459
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Uh, I'm going to take another big bump from my finger.

460
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Yep.

461
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Lose 10 luck for me there.

462
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Yeah.

463
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
And then I'm, how close is the pastor to me?

464
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Uh, Oh, he's, he's right on the other side.

465
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:12,000
So basically you could reach out with your hand and, and touch the back of the four wheeler

466
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:20,000
and then the radio is strapped on right there.

467
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
And then pastor Adam Kane is right on the other side of the radio.

468
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
The radio is in the, on the back of the four wheeler.

469
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Yeah.

470
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
And he's whipped his tail in toward you.

471
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
So he is facing.

472
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
He has a tail.

473
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Yeah, man.

474
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
People are animals in this game.

475
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Thomas fucking get over it.

476
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Okay.

477
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
I want to try to get to the radio.

478
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Oh yeah.

479
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:46,000
You would be prone normally, but with losing that 10 luck, taking a quick, what do you

480
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
do?

481
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
How do you do it?

482
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Tell me how your body moves.

483
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:59,000
I, then I get on my hands and knees and look at the radio and pounce from that position.

484
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Okay.

485
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,000
What's the goal here to grab the radio and either smash it or turn it off.

486
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Uh, do you want to hold it over your head?

487
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Like John Cusack.

488
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
It starts raining.

489
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Once I get to it, I'll decide what I do.

490
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,000
I'm allowing you to do your action on this turn because you've taken the luck damage.

491
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
So what's your luck at now?

492
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Uh, down to 35.

493
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Cause I was, I was at 45 then 35 then I gained luck back and now I'm down again.

494
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:30,000
So, uh, this radio has been ratcheted to the back of this four wheeler as to not fall off.

495
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
What do you do?

496
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
I want to take the butt of my gun and smash a tube on it.

497
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Fuck yeah dude.

498
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:49,080
As soon as you do that, this noise just, oh shit.

499
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:56,560
And pastor Adam Kane reaches in the side bag of this four wheeler, grabs a fish out and

500
00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:03,900
squeezes it so hard that it completely busts into two separate halfs above his head.

501
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:10,500
Tail end falls on one side, head falls on the other, and you see just guts and sin like

502
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,700
all this like what's inside a fish guys?

503
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:13,700
Guts.

504
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:14,700
Oh bones.

505
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:15,700
Tiny little bones.

506
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:16,700
Yeah.

507
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:20,260
Guts and tiny little fish bones kind of fall onto the helmet and immediately the light

508
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:23,060
on his helmet turns green.

509
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,060
Everybody roll power.

510
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:27,060
Oh yes little bitch.

511
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:34,100
20 on 50.

512
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,100
Six.

513
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:38,100
I pass a 35 on a 60.

514
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:41,100
I rolled a 57, which is a success.

515
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,100
Oh shit.

516
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:45,100
Oh god damn it.

517
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:47,100
I hate contested rules.

518
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:51,100
Damn it.

519
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:56,860
Your perceptions begin to change, but this time you can literally watch it happen.

520
00:29:57,060 --> 00:30:09,860
Let's see, everybody take off your headphones except for Joe.

521
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:13,740
What is the moment that Clark most regrets?

522
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:15,400
Oh fuck dude.

523
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:19,700
I've got three that I can think of.

524
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:22,420
And that's just off the top of my head, I bet there's a lot.

525
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:28,660
I mean recently it's for sure the revelation of how I fucked up getting the Cain family

526
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,860
out of the van.

527
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:34,140
That would 100% be the one that he latches onto.

528
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,140
Okay.

529
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:39,500
Yeah that's a recent one that has been newly opened in his mind, like he didn't regret

530
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,840
that until recently.

531
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,460
Now it's a big, big deal.

532
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:49,560
Clark your gun is aimed at this four wheeler and immediately the four wheeler is a minivan

533
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:54,080
and it's turned over and it's on fire and it's still in this mud basin.

534
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,740
It's still right there.

535
00:30:55,740 --> 00:31:00,900
But then you hear these screams and you remember hearing these screams.

536
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:06,600
The van explodes and you are rushing toward it and you're back on the concrete, you're

537
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:10,800
on the main drag heading north out of contention.

538
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:16,320
But there's nothing you can do to stop it and then you're watching this child being

539
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:20,400
taken off on a stretcher into the back of an ambulance.

540
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,400
Roll sanity.

541
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:30,640
Oh my god, I fail 97 way the fuck over my power.

542
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,640
Oh yeah, 100%.

543
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,640
Oh no!

544
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,640
Oh boy.

545
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:52,680
So Thomas, what is the moment so far that John Lee Pettymore regrets most?

546
00:31:52,680 --> 00:32:02,400
Multiple images flash before him, but because of the recent slayings of the ashers, he pictures

547
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,360
the vacuuming of their children.

548
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:12,160
Yes, and literally floating above this four wheeler, two children holding on to each other

549
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,640
and it's the exact scene that you remember.

550
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:22,240
They're holding on to this man, unkempt hair, wearing these rubber waders.

551
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:27,260
You know him as James the mill worker and they're trying to hold on to him and you're

552
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:34,100
trying to hold on to them but they're floating away above Bean's Pond and they're just floating

553
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:43,220
up and then all at once you see behind them the sky envelopes out and opens this massive

554
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:50,340
hole and coming out of it is just like an oil spray of this ooze but it's coming at

555
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:57,460
you horizontally and it grabs onto them and in this weird whirlwind slowly, slowly pulls

556
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:01,860
them like they're in a balloon almost.

557
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:07,340
Like if a person was in a balloon trying desperately to get out, you see their hands and their

558
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:15,340
feet kicking, kicking and trying to get out and then they just out of existence.

559
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:16,340
Roll sanity.

560
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:18,900
Can I also roll deception?

561
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:22,860
Well, it's not a skill but...

562
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,140
Persuade.

563
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:26,820
That's not John's biggest regret.

564
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:29,140
What's John's biggest regret?

565
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:31,140
It's fucking up his racing career.

566
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:36,340
He doesn't give a shit about any of this.

567
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:38,480
Like deeply.

568
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,820
This is kind of just happening to him right now?

569
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:42,820
Roll sanity motherfucker.

570
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,820
We'll see what happens.

571
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:45,820
Hold on.

572
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:50,020
Oh, why do I even need... no, 56 doesn't pass.

573
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:51,820
Of course not.

574
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:57,840
And so as this blinks out, you kind of shake it off and then the four wheeler down below

575
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:03,820
turns into your sprint car that you wrecked and you see across the way where there once

576
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:13,400
was Casey Kristoff holding a gun to the back of Kerry Page's head, you see little Elvis

577
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:21,480
Duncan's Jr. and his face is split wide open, there's blood running down it.

578
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:24,480
Oh no.

579
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:30,480
Oh fuck.

580
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,480
And you know...

581
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:34,280
Oh god.

582
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:41,600
You know 100% that if your defective safety harness hadn't taken his eye from him, blood

583
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:47,560
begins to kind of like continue to pour down, you see that where his eye should be, there's

584
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:55,560
just a skin grave.

585
00:34:55,560 --> 00:35:01,440
Like if a melon baller was made of skin, you'd be looking into its scoop.

586
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:07,880
A skin grave.

587
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:10,600
You had me, but then you went too far.

588
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:16,600
That's what I'm here for.

589
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:26,600
Y'all were having a bunch of laughs for your worst regret.

590
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:36,160
Luke, what's Keith Vigna's biggest regret?

591
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:44,400
Keith Vigna's biggest regret is changing his name and moving towns and becoming a cop instead

592
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:49,440
of just facing the embarrassment of being beans and going to work for his brother.

593
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:57,280
So you're standing over this now defunct radio and you're looking at Pastor Adam Kane who

594
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:02,160
has just smeared fish all over this old motorcycle helmet.

595
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:08,320
The four wheeler is surrounded by children who are all wearing party hats and they're

596
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:14,800
all chanting, beans, beans, Keith, beans his only friends are figurines, beans, beans,

597
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:19,040
Keith, beans will blow your friends to smithereens.

598
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:29,440
And you turn back and you see Ferguson standing where Clark and John just were and he's wearing

599
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:35,920
his beautiful suit, it's got a rose on his lapel and you look back at these birthday

600
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:44,560
party clad children and instead you see a life, a life at Bar Corp.

601
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,200
What would that look like for Keith?

602
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:54,920
It'd be upper management, failed up to upper management, nepotism, nice house with a dog

603
00:36:54,920 --> 00:37:03,280
that he sees and takes care of, a wife probably and spends the weekends barbecuing at Ferguson's

604
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,880
house and our children play together.

605
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:12,800
And you think about all that and then you just see the inside of a room at Hotel Motel

606
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:17,200
and you're just sitting at the edge of the bed by yourself.

607
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,200
Roll sanity.

608
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:28,680
35 on a 8.

609
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,280
Everybody roll a D4.

610
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,680
Oh no.

611
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,680
2.

612
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:33,680
1.

613
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,680
1.

614
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:38,040
Alright, John loses 2, Clark and Keith both lose 1 sanity.

615
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:42,360
I probably shouldn't bring this up but are we still doing the D4 plus 1?

616
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:49,240
Alright, no, cause that was a 1 slash 1 D4 so if you would have, no fuck that was, yeah

617
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:51,720
no that would make sense for that to be the thing.

618
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:52,720
No.

619
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,400
Just keep it in mind for the future.

620
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:59,440
We didn't talk about that on the normal show.

621
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:03,400
It was if you had passed sanity and you were supposed to take damage no matter what.

622
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,480
This one would have been that.

623
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:08,400
I just wasn't paying attention so you got off.

624
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,400
Cool.

625
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,240
Well but we all failed though, right?

626
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,240
Yes.

627
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:17,200
So we have it written down as 1 slash 1 D4 is the sanity damage.

628
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:22,840
Which would mean 1 if you pass slash 1 D4 if you fail because that's 1 up to 4.

629
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:27,480
So it should have been according to the Patreon rule that I made 1 D4 plus 1.

630
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:30,360
Which thank you Luke and I will remember moving forward.

631
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,360
It's very kind of you.

632
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:39,920
So, I am about to roll a D4, pretty important D4, cause it's how many rounds this lasted.

633
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:40,920
Oh wow.

634
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:41,920
Roll a 1.

635
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,080
Yeah roll a 1.

636
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,440
Oh he just rolled it.

637
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,640
It's a 1.

638
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,560
It's our word against his.

639
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:53,940
If everybody else says it right now that it's all him, it's my dudes.

640
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:57,320
He's moved his camera into a perfect position.

641
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,320
What is it?

642
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,320
It's a 2.

643
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,320
It's a 2.

644
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,320
Could be worse.

645
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,320
I'll take it.

646
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,240
Even though we also saw him roll that 1.

647
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:08,280
He rolled a 1 and then said no no no and then he cut that audio out.

648
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:14,600
He's gonna have to do a lot of that this episode.

649
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,400
I'm real sorry buddy.

650
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,800
I hope you know how much I love you.

651
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:21,080
I've been taking Prozac for 3 years.

652
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,800
Does that make you love people?

653
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:24,800
No Prozac.

654
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,800
Guys he's pro me.

655
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:26,800
Oh look at him.

656
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,800
He really liked it.

657
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,800
I really liked it too.

658
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,800
It's so dumb.

659
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,800
It was good.

660
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:36,040
And I should have thought of it like years ago but I just thought of it when I was in

661
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,720
the kitchen like 10 minutes ago.

662
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:38,800
That was really good.

663
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:42,680
It obviously took me a second but thumbs up.

664
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:49,960
I wanted to wait until I could see you in person but I couldn't.

665
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,600
None of my medications have any fun jokes.

666
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:58,480
I have my friends names in them.

667
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,480
Celexa.

668
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,760
I don't know anyone named Alexa.

669
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,240
Celexa wasn't good for me.

670
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,960
It's working for me.

671
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:06,960
Vitamin B.

672
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,200
Your friend Tim.

673
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,200
What?

674
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,200
I know.

675
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:15,200
It's not in there but it sounds like it could be.

676
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,200
Vitatim.

677
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,200
Vitimin.

678
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,200
Wow.

679
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:28,520
I'm a big fan of John Boyega's character from Star Wars because I be pro Finn.

680
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,520
Wow.

681
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,480
That's basically mine.

682
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:35,480
I thought that's what we were doing.

683
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Doxycycline.

684
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:42,000
I want none more for anything.

685
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Doxycycline.

686
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
I just rolled not one.

687
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Uh oh.

688
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
I'm frozen.

689
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Can you hear me?

690
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
It's a contested roll.

691
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Let's all roll higher than that.

692
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Can you guys hear me?

693
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Oh no.

694
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
No way.

695
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Oh shit.

696
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
I can hear you guys still.

697
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
You're back.

698
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
You're back.

699
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Okay.

700
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
I could hear you the whole time.

701
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
It was just frozen.

702
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,520
Okay.

703
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:05,520
Yay.

704
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,520
That was scary.

705
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,520
That was scary.

706
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,520
Yeah.

707
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,520
Thank goodness.

708
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,520
Knock on wood.

709
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,520
My internet hasn't been out in three days.

710
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,520
So.

711
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:13,520
Shit.

712
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,520
I knock on that floor for you.

713
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,520
Okay.

714
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,520
I forgot what we're waiting on.

715
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,520
Oh, two rounds.

716
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,520
He rolled a one for something.

717
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,520
Oh guys.

718
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,520
That not one really changed this entire situation.

719
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,520
As your realities begin flooding back and your senses match your actual surroundings,

720
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,520
you can hear Carrie Andrews.

721
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,520
Carrie Andrews.

722
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,520
Carrie Andrews.

723
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,520
Carrie Andrews.

724
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,520
Carrie Andrews.

725
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,520
Carrie Andrews.

726
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,520
Carrie Andrews.

727
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,520
Carrie Andrews.

728
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,520
Carrie Andrews.

729
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:36,720
You can hear Carrie Andrews still hollering across the muddy divide.

730
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,400
Don't you give them shit, boys.

731
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,460
You hear me?

732
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:43,400
Don't you give them anything but the cold graves they deserve.

733
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:49,240
Clark, you see Casey Kristoff is still in the same position, pistol to the back of the

734
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:52,760
head of blindfolded inside out Drew Carey.

735
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:58,560
John, you immediately realize you are no longer holding your gun.

736
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:04,280
Looking down, you see agent Trent Catt has not only knocked your weapon from your hand,

737
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:10,160
but also ejected the magazine and is trying to grab the ammo with his mouth.

738
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:17,820
Keith, you are being held under your arms, behind your neck, feet dragging in the mud

739
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:25,560
in front of you as pastor Adam Cain hauls you toward the impassable metal plate.

740
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:32,640
And as these two men approach the partially buried door, you all see that it begins sliding

741
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,640
open.

742
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:39,920
Oh, in trouble.

743
00:42:55,560 --> 00:43:03,560
How am I the only one trying to pull over?

744
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:14,560
How can you have enough drowning out of the noise?

745
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:18,560
There's no time to go.

746
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:26,560
No time to go.

747
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:29,560
Time to fly, time to stream.
