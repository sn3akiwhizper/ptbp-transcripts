1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800
Welcome, y'all,

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:06,440
to the raddest, baddest radio show in the city.

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,480
The time is sometime.

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,460
The day is July 6, 2022,

5
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:16,620
a day that may or may not be important.

6
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:18,760
Who even knows anymore?

7
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,300
And the host is I, Wolf the Dog.

8
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:27,280
Oooooooowwwwwwww!

9
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,020
I hallett, y'all,

10
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:31,540
so y'all will hallett me.

11
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:34,140
This hallettin' with Wolf is from Wren,

12
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:39,020
AKA Trash Bandicoot, in Manchester, UK.

13
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:41,340
They tweeted about the show and tagged

14
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,180
at Pretending Pod, a thing you should do too.

15
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,740
Be like the Trash Bandicoot.

16
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:50,220
You know you have it within.

17
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:51,680
Wren writes,

18
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,000
Hey, Wolfie.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,480
I've been writing this email since 25 slash 09

20
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,120
slash 2002 too.

21
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,380
That's the 25th of September for you contentioners.

22
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:09,160
Time's a fuckin' lie, and ADHD is a wild ride.

23
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,240
I just wanna reiterate whatever Mads wrote

24
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,800
in season two, episode 10.

25
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,600
How dare they beat me to thanking Cameron

26
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,240
for introducing the Neo Scum Discord to PTBP

27
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:27,240
and introducing me to Mayday Roleplay and Penumbra Pod.

28
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,820
You've improved my life,

29
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:31,400
and I can't wait for you to ruin it.

30
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:36,080
Neo Scum good, love hugs and kisses, Wren.

31
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:39,440
Well, damn, thanks to Wren for writing a thing

32
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,780
for me to read.

33
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:43,240
I don't know what all these random words are

34
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,620
that you made me say, but I'm happy

35
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:48,900
they seem to make you happy, I think.

36
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,780
If you wanna write up something for your wolf to how,

37
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,500
tag at PretendingPod on Twitter,

38
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,340

39
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:00,420
and tag PretendingToBePeople on Facebook,

40
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,660
or write up a five-star review on the podcast app

41
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,580
of your choice and get it in front

42
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:08,900
of these here hairy wolf eyeballs.

43
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:13,000
And while we're at it, can I get a quick fuck Elon Musk

44
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,560
from the people in a car or bus or other wheeled vehicle?

45
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,360
And can I get a fuck Mark Zuckerberg from people at work

46
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,280
or from people just sitting in a coffee shop

47
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,800
waiting for their coffee?

48
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,880
And if you're not in a car or bus or other wheeled vehicle

49
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:34,880
or at work or a quiet coffee shop, congratulations.

50
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,320
Y'all just won the opportunity

51
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,840
to support this show financially

52
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,840
over at patreon.com slash pretending pod.

53
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,720
There you'll find bonus content,

54
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,720
the chance to name a PTBP NPC or location,

55
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:57,120
BTS live streams, exclusive merch, and more.

56
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,160
And guess where the links are?

57
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,000
Do it.

58
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,840
Guess.

59
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,460
No, like out loud, come on, don't be shy now.

60
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,240
Say it with me, y'all.

61
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,840
The links are in the show notes.

62
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,480
Where even are the show notes?

63
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,280
Have you ever seen them?

64
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,760
Are they even real?

65
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,920
Have the show notes been reported on?

66
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:25,680
Because it ain't real if it ain't on the news.

67
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,680
Last time, after a quick flashback to fill in a time gap,

68
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,680
Julius Summers went a tad off the map

69
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,720
and revealed that he's strapped when he pop, pop,

70
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,480
popped a couple of gops

71
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,960
and the brother of the wife of his pops.

72
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:45,880
And SG, Stevie Godel, revealed the plan

73
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:49,320
to blackmail their dad with the footage they were acquiring

74
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,880
from officers Richard Riley and Wilson Wiley,

75
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:56,400
who are new on the Godel payroll and easily swayed

76
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,480
by the daughter of the great Fred Godel himself.

77
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,720
The main issue, seemingly,

78
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,640
is that Julius just thinks he's a bit wet

79
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,560
instead of covered in blood and viscera.

80
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,280
Taking us now to a pearl of a scene

81
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,880
that would make a weaker wolf hurl

82
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,920
and scream for a bowl of curdled cream,

83
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,560
it's altar girl with my life is great

84
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,560
and it's all my fault.

85
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:27,560
And it's all my fault

86
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:32,560
Cause my life is great

87
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,560
And it's all my

88
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Cause my life is great

89
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
And it's all my fault

90
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
And it's all my fault

91
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:03,040
All right, so Thomas and Joe, you both got luck then.

92
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,880
Yeah.

93
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,720
Yeah.

94
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,320
You can see it from my shiny luck token here.

95
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,600
Look at there.

96
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,880
Why don't you flick that in the air for me?

97
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,200
Oh, that's nice.

98
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,160
Joe, how about you?

99
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,000
No, no, no, wait, wait.

100
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,440
Whoa, wow, that was good.

101
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,520
I liked it.

102
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,480
Let's go.

103
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,400
You guys wanna go?

104
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,240
You were just, okay.

105
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,280
You were just taking the temperature

106
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,320
as far as the luck is.

107
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,160
Sorry.

108
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,520
Luca.

109
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,600
It's impossible to explain that joke.

110
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,080
Luca reached over the entire table.

111
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,040
It was very funny.

112
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:49,400
Oh, it was the, it's four 20 everybody.

113
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,240
Wow.

114
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,480
This is the energy we're bringing to the four 20.

115
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,320
It's the day where you smoke weed and don't ask for help.

116
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
That might be an issue for the gang tonight.

117
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,400
Can you guys, can you let me in?

118
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,080
Let's set the scene real quick.

119
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,040
You guys are on the Northeast corner

120
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:14,840
in a downtown intersection of the city.

121
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,360
You're just Northeast of the Natcher Hole.

122
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,480
You're in a parking lot.

123
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,560
You are sitting in Cal Colorado's white Mercedes C-Class.

124
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,280
Nice car.

125
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,760
Thanks, you're the one who told us it was nice.

126
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:39,200
And Julius Summers just pulled up.

127
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:43,400
Cal Colorado, Beck Wilder and Stevie

128
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,000
were in the Cadillac there

129
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,320
and in the Mercedes C-Class there.

130
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,160
Come on.

131
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,640
Who would ever say that?

132
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,480
What is this?

133
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,840
Ants.

134
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,760
A car that you all don't recognize pulls up.

135
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,800
It's a car driven by Jeremy, the intern who-

136
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,720
Classic character.

137
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,360
Everyone loves him.

138
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,080
He's very, very rattled at all times.

139
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,240
What's he sound like?

140
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:09,240
His eyes are super wide, that's for sure.

141
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,760
And Julius, oh, you're getting out of the car.

142
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,440
Okay, oh, thank God, oh, thank God.

143
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:18,160
And we're just sitting in Jeremy's car for a second

144
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:22,080
after Julius has left and he breathes

145
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,240
for seemingly the first time in a while.

146
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,080
And this is where we leave you

147
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,840
as Jeremy slowly starts pulling out

148
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,880
of the parking spot next to you.

149
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:37,440
I wave my hands in the air and get behind his car

150
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,840
or not like where I could be hit,

151
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,640
but I'm like, Jeremy, Jeremy, Jeremy, hold up, hold up.

152
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,800
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

153
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,520
Yeah, Julius sees Cal waving

154
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,360
and he like slaps Jeremy's car to get his attention.

155
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,120
It pulls back into the spot.

156
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,440
I go up to the front window

157
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,720
and I like motion for him to roll it down.

158
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,240
Do you think they can hear us?

159
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,600
You mean the other two?

160
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,800
Julius is like standing right there like watching this.

161
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,880
Julius, could you go help Beck

162
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:07,880
with a weird fungal problem that he has on his body?

163
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,760
No.

164
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:15,020
Well, he needs someone to vent about to it

165
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,160
and I'm tired of hearing it.

166
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,480
Could you just go be a friend

167
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,320
and listen to him for a minute, over there?

168
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,760
Well, can you unlock your car and I'll hop in?

169
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,680
It's really important that you talk to Beck

170
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,160
about his embarrassing skin problem.

171
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,200
Where are you at?

172
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,800
Am I in the car still?

173
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,480
I don't remember if I got out or not.

174
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,320
I think we ended with-

175
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,520
I think plausibly you could be like standing

176
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,720
outside the passenger seat watching this go on.

177
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,720
Episodes start in different places all the time.

178
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,640
Yeah, that's true.

179
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,360
The reason I clarify though is because

180
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,960
Stevie was doing weird shit.

181
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,840
I don't know if I want to-

182
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,280
Stevie is still in the car, yes.

183
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,880
So you can just roll down the window and talk to him.

184
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,720
That's what I'll do.

185
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,120
Roll down my passenger window.

186
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,360
I'll stick my head in Cal's car.

187
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,240
And I'm kind of grossed out by that, right?

188
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,560
He's covered from head to toe.

189
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,400
Oh, absolutely.

190
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,260
Cal shouts, hey Beck Beck,

191
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:07,160
don't let him stick his head in the car.

192
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:12,160
Yeah, Julius, yeah, covered in blood and brain matter.

193
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,540
His nose is bleeding and you can see a shoulder,

194
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,580
like a gunshot in his shoulder.

195
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,720
Jesus, is it healed?

196
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,400
Like, has it been attended to medically?

197
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:27,040
It happened less than an hour ago.

198
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,800
It happened so fast.

199
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,680
It happened, how long did it take me to get from can to-

200
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,680
Very little time.

201
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,200
Jeremy drove very quickly.

202
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,640
So speaking to Jeremy, Cal's like, okay,

203
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,160
I don't think Julius is in much position to relay-

204
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,000
Headphones, boys.

205
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,320
What's going on here?

206
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,580
So as quickly as possible,

207
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,580
can you tell me what the fuck happened?

208
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,040
Yeah, get the fuck out.

209
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,340
I love you.

210
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,180
Bye.

211
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:55,000
Wait, but, oh, nevermind.

212
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,400
Okay.

213
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:00,280
Okay, so we hear gunshots, multiple gunshots

214
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,000
and nobody went in, obviously, but we called the cops

215
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
and Julius came out of Type's office with blood all over me.

216
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
And over and over and over and over, beep, beep, beep, beep.

217
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,680
And then he just came out and then everyone was taking

218
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:23,680
videos and photos and it was so sad and it was just like,

219
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:31,600
he's just like, he's got a gun on him and he's dangerous.

220
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,040
He killed the high-freaking.

221
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:41,320
If he looks up, he would see that Cal has been filming

222
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,560
this all on his phone.

223
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:49,000
Yeah, no, he's in no state to try to roll there.

224
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,760
I don't know what to do.

225
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,960
He told me to drive him to you guys

226
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,720
and he knew where you were.

227
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,400
And so I drove him because, you know, gun and murder

228
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,000
and he's covered in blood and he thinks he's just wet.

229
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,640
Wow, yes.

230
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,720
Who kills their uncle?

231
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,120
Who shoots anyone?

232
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:12,960
Wait, what?

233
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:16,160
It's too early to speculate, but Type may not have been

234
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,200
the man you thought he was, if what you thought he was

235
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,120
was a good man.

236
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,840
Cal, that is not the reaction that I was expecting from you.

237
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,920
Well, Jeremy, unfortunately.

238
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,120
You're saying that the victim was a bad guy?

239
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,920
Well, yes, I think objectively.

240
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,840
He was a bad man who did not care about the news.

241
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,600
He was ill-suited for his position.

242
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,760
I'm not happy he died, but Jeremy,

243
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,320
big things are going on today, strange things.

244
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,680
We have reason to believe Type was involved

245
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,240
with corrupt police officers.

246
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,360
That doesn't mean, that doesn't, oh.

247
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:51,040
Working for the Godel Corporation,

248
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,640
they stole our footage of the most insane news story

249
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,520
that I have ever personally covered.

250
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,360
Type was a part of them, Julius is now too.

251
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,440
I guess we already were, but we need your help.

252
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,800
No, no, I'm not fucking, wait.

253
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,920
Roll persuade. Yeah, I was like,

254
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,400
I'm so sorry, I meant to persuade you

255
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,560
that we need your help.

256
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,000
He's gonna pass with a 16.

257
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,960
This is contested?

258
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,800
Yeah.

259
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,000
I pass with a 67.

260
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,320
Oh, you done got him.

261
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,080
No, absolutely not.

262
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,840
My duty is to the news,

263
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,520
cause I'm an intern and I don't work for money,

264
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,600
I work for truth.

265
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,640
Yes, that's right.

266
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,560
Cal is like, tears are in his eyes

267
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,120
and he's swelling with pride.

268
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,840
And he says, God damn it, Jeremy.

269
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,720
Yeah.

270
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,360
That's what I'm fucking talking about.

271
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,640
That's what I'm talking about.

272
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,720
That's what I'm talking about.

273
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,240
That's what I'm talking about.

274
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,920
Beck, you might wanna get away from Julius.

275
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,840
All right, let's get him back.

276
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,040
That was fun.

277
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,880
Thomas, if you could walk out real quick.

278
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,720
Yeah.

279
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,360
The TV looks at Julius's blood-covered head

280
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:08,880
that is through the window and without missing a beat,

281
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,480
Julius, what the fuck happened?

282
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,560
And I need you back to roll a grip check

283
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:19,560
for this face being so close to you.

284
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:26,120
This man being so uninterested in his own...

285
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,240
I failed.

286
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,480
Bodily health.

287
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,680
That's a 91.

288
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:34,880
I need my other character sheet.

289
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,880
That's hilarious.

290
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,080
Hey, while you're doing that, Beck.

291
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:47,920
Yeah.

292
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,960
Joe, if you could roll a grip check for me and fail.

293
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,760
And now if you could roll a...

294
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,200
Did you fail?

295
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:58,720
If you could roll a nothing, you just lose one.

296
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,960
Lose one grip as this face is just inching near you.

297
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,840
You were like...

298
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,760
Utterly grossed out just because it's blood and viscera.

299
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,280
But then I see that there's maybe a bullet wound

300
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,600
in the shoulder and I'm like,

301
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,960
oh fuck, this could be a mortal wound.

302
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,160
He could be dying in front of me.

303
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,480
Holy shit.

304
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,160
Julius, my dude, I think you're bleeding out, dude.

305
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,800
Julius looks down at it.

306
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,600
I mean, I told you, I just got wet.

307
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,960
I mean, I'll dry off, it's fine.

308
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,280
I mean, I think you will dry off eventually

309
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,480
because of death.

310
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,440
There's no more to be coming out, yeah.

311
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,320
Julius is literally looking like,

312
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,320
what the fuck are you talking about?

313
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,800
Luke, how many hit points do you have?

314
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,640
Two.

315
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,920
I sneeze and headbutt.

316
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:43,760
Oh shit.

317
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,120
Julius dies.

318
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,400
I'm gonna put my hand past his head and pound on the roof

319
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,840
and Carol, we gotta get him to a hospital.

320
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,840
At that exact moment,

321
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:01,480
he is yelling something equally loud at you.

322
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,360
Which was what?

323
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,880
I believe he said, Beck.

324
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,600
Yeah.

325
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,600
Oh, Thomas.

326
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,440
Tommy.

327
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,600
Tommy Pickles.

328
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,920
Tommy Pickles was the first Tommy

329
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,040
that popped into my head too.

330
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,440
Really?

331
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,920
For sure though.

332
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,640
Beck, Beck, get away from him.

333
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,880
And at that exact moment, Beck is yelling back at you.

334
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,320
We gotta get him to a hospital.

335
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,640
Cal, come on, get in the car.

336
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,480
Put him in this car, it's already ruined

337
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,120
and Jeremy is on our side.

338
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,200
Beck, I love you like a son,

339
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,240
but if you let him in my car, I'll be disappointed.

340
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,200
I don't know.

341
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,800
Is our cherry removable?

342
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,560
The thing that we've been running around, the siren light?

343
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,920
Yeah, it literally just is like suction cups on top.

344
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,960
I pull it out of like the dashboard or out of the glove box

345
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,640
and I toss it over the car to Cal.

346
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,920
All right, we'll get him in that car.

347
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,240
We just gotta go, we just gotta go.

348
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,360
Cal catches it pretty nimbly.

349
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,200
Oh yeah?

350
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,320
I gotta imagine he was like.

351
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,160
Let's get some athletics checks.

352
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,200
See how smoothly this very intense,

353
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,360
very serious situation goes.

354
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,760
I guess it has been a while since high school baseball

355
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:20,360
and Cal fumbles, I do not pass either.

356
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:23,920
So it's already like a wild throw.

357
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,760
It's a wild pitch off to the side and you reach out

358
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,920
way for it and it touches your fingers though.

359
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,280
So you know deep down you could have caught it.

360
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,140
Just like the story if it gets away from us.

361
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,000
Julius, man, we gotta get into that car

362
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,960
that you just got out of.

363
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,320
We gotta get you back into that one

364
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,800
and we gotta get you to the hospital, dude.

365
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,160
You're gonna die.

366
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,000
What?

367
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,480
Beck wants to, he feels like he needs to snap Julius

368
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,600
into it and he wants to poke the wound

369
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,400
to see if that elicits a response.

370
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,600
Holy fucking shit.

371
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,400
When he reaches out for you, do you counter?

372
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,040
No.

373
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:04,880
Poke.

374
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,960
Lose one hit point.

375
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,800
Oh!

376
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,840
Fuck.

377
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,080
You killed Julius.

378
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,240
Can I use your pencil?

379
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:12,960
Thank you.

380
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,800
No actually.

381
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,040
That would take me to one hit point.

382
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,220
Let's have you roll con to see if you lose

383
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,060
one hit point here.

384
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,300
Roll con.

385
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,260
Can it be taken into account that I wasn't

386
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:24,500
like trying to injure, I was trying to shock.

387
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,900
56 on a 55.

388
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:29,900
You did both.

389
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:33,420
Well did it?

390
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,260
Did it shock?

391
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,020
Do you respond to that other than?

392
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:38,740
Julius Summers vomits through the window.

393
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:39,580
Into the car.

394
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,260
Into the car, onto your lap,

395
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:44,020
into the white Mercedes C-Class.

396
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,580
Now do you believe me, dude?

397
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:46,660
That's a wound, man.

398
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,140
You're injured.

399
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,420
Julius, when you look down,

400
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:52,540
you see yourself absolutely covered in blood

401
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:56,380
and you are in a wild amount of pain

402
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:58,780
seemingly out of fucking nowhere.

403
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:02,900
What the fuck?

404
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,300
Yeah, yeah, exactly my dude.

405
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,140
Get in the car.

406
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:07,580
He stumbles into Jeremy's car.

407
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:10,080
Cal slaps the cherry on top,

408
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,940
slaps Jeremy in the face.

409
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:13,660
Thank you.

410
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:14,900
Get him to the hospital.

411
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:16,980
Do it for old lady news.

412
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,540
Absolutely, sir, yes sir.

413
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:22,260
Hand to my, hand to my, hand to my forehead,

414
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,460
fingers flat.

415
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,660
Julius hears like get him to the hospital

416
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:26,900
like they're not coming with me

417
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,260
and he gets out of the car.

418
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:34,260
We gotta solve it together.

419
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,780
Julius, you know, the last time you tried to pull this,

420
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,520
no offense, we lost God.

421
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,580
So why don't you just go to the fucking hospital?

422
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:42,780
If I recall correctly,

423
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,380
you lost God when I was in the hospital.

424
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:47,300
Who knows what happened when Julius.

425
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:50,380
Good point, I will not be going to the hospital.

426
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:54,020
And he starts to just kind of try to wipe himself off

427
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:57,480
and like holds the bullet wound.

428
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,620
Go ahead and roll a first aid on yourself

429
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:03,300
if you have it to try to look around and find.

430
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,180
Fail again.

431
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,660
Are you excited about that?

432
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:07,500
No.

433
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:09,620
Do you have any first aid back there?

434
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:13,020
You find some fast food napkins in Jeremy's glove box.

435
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:15,520
He shoves it in the wound.

436
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,420
I turn around to Stevie.

437
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:19,060
Stevie, is there any chance that you know like

438
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:21,100
maybe how to stop the bleeding on this?

439
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:24,200
Hey, I do have one luck that I have written down.

440
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:29,120
It's been scratched out and then replaced, but I have it.

441
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:33,500
That's extremely confusing based on the conversation

442
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,780
we had at the top of the app.

443
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,700
Okay, yeah, then I don't, nevermind.

444
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,260
I believe you, but it sounds like a lie.

445
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:46,380
I need you guys to answer a question for me

446
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:49,960
because I rolled for first aid.

447
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,360
I think base is 30, is that correct?

448
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,200
10.

449
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,020
10, yeah.

450
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:56,140
Okay, so I gave Stevie a plus 20.

451
00:19:56,140 --> 00:20:01,140
I rolled both D10s and one said 80

452
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:04,460
and the other one rolled off the table.

453
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:05,300
Reroll them both.

454
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,700
Am I supposed to reroll them both?

455
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:08,520
Yeah.

456
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,360
Yes, of course.

457
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,300
As we've always played.

458
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,260
So reroll both.

459
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:15,740
Okay, so then I rerolled both and I got a 69.

460
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:16,900
That's a critical success.

461
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,500
That's good news.

462
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,740
He's back to full health.

463
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,000
So Stevie is like, well, the only time that I ever had

464
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,540
any sort of like first aid training was this one summer camp

465
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:36,740
where we just learned how to like dress like bullet wounds

466
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,080
in the field.

467
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,380
What kind of summer camp was that?

468
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,700
Rich people.

469
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:42,980
Oh, okay.

470
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,740
I'll have to do a story about that.

471
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:46,580
Good news, Stevie.

472
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,560
I think it's a bullet wound.

473
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,760
Summer's camp me.

474
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:53,060
Scamp?

475
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,980
He leans his shoulder towards Stevie,

476
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:00,420
points at it with the napkin sticking out of it.

477
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:02,540
So she hops out of the Mercedes C class.

478
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:05,660
She rummages through Cal's trunk.

479
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,500
Which has a full first aid kit probably.

480
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,500
Which has a full first aid kit in the back of it

481
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,900
and she pulls that out, goes over to Julius.

482
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,200
Okay, I'm gonna need you to just kind of lean up

483
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,060
against the car and just, you know, bite down on this.

484
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:21,940
Julius lays down and then bites on this.

485
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:24,340
You get three hit points.

486
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,380
Hell yes.

487
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:26,700
Nice.

488
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,180
What is your max, Luke?

489
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,020
10.

490
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:29,840
And you're at four?

491
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,980
It's like I never poked you.

492
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:35,140
What do you need from me, Mr. Colorado?

493
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:37,460
What does lady journalism need?

494
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:39,660
I guess we need you to watch the exits.

495
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,820
We can only cover so many points of entryways

496
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:44,580
to the subway to watch the meeting.

497
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,540
So if you can keep them, you know,

498
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,260
if you can take up the rear.

499
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,100
Subway?

500
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,060
Eat fresh.

501
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:52,260
We're meeting Stevie.

502
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,740
Julius accepts that as an answer.

503
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:54,580
He did?

504
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,860
He's back, baby.

505
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:04,840
We're meeting, or Stevie is meeting, the gops.

506
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,340
The ones who stole our footage

507
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,440
and she's gonna recover it.

508
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,280
How many?

509
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,420
Just the two, as far as I know.

510
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,260
Which ones?

511
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,740
As far as we know, it's the guys

512
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:12,700
that we went to the apartments of.

513
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:15,580
Richard Riley and Wilson Wiley.

514
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:16,940
Oh, okay.

515
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:19,540
Beck is still kind of side-eyeing Julius.

516
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:22,860
Not sure if he's gonna die or not.

517
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:27,180
If you don't have good medicine skills,

518
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:30,020
then yeah, you might be very much still worried about that.

519
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,940
But he's not bleeding.

520
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:35,620
Blood isn't coming out of the hole anymore.

521
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:38,540
Whereas before, it seemed with every heartbeat,

522
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:41,280
there was just like a little glug.

523
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,480
Can you look at your phone and text me back?

524
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,320
Yeah, absolutely.

525
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,740
Here's my phone, looking at it right now.

526
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,540
It says, do you like me, yes or no?

527
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:51,460
Luke, roll grip.

528
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:53,980
Not to lose any or gain any,

529
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,860
but to know whether you...

530
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:58,180
I got a 13 on a 23.

531
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:03,180
Okay, with your grip and check, you do.

532
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,240
I do.

533
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,080
Yeah.

534
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,220
Now we're married.

535
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:11,880
You're meeting Richard Riley and Wilson Wiley.

536
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,480
Yeah, because they have the footage,

537
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,800
so I just need it back.

538
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,920
And that way I can...

539
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,280
That way I can...

540
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,200
You're not gonna meet him.

541
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,520
Blackmail my dad.

542
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,720
Well, no, of course we're not gonna meet them.

543
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,600
We're gonna ambush them while they meet Stevie.

544
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,440
Yeah.

545
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,260
That's the plan.

546
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:30,960
Julius picks a piece of brain off his face and says,

547
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,120
this is as close as you're gonna get to meeting them.

548
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,980
Oh, shit.

549
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,960
Julius, what do you mean?

550
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:42,800
They're dead.

551
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,640
Both of them?

552
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,640
Yeah.

553
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,760
Yeah.

554
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,240
They were, well, they were at Cannes.

555
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,640
I have so many questions,

556
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,180
but I think the first one is,

557
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:56,480
did you get the footage back from them then?

558
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,520
No.

559
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,360
What do you mean no?

560
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,360
Where was the footage?

561
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,440
Well, I'll be honest with you.

562
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,800
It all went down so fast.

563
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,760
And then I think I just broke.

564
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,400
You killed them.

565
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,240
Yeah.

566
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,360
Holy shit.

567
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,360
And Julius is like a thousand yard stare.

568
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,680
You killed Tife too, right?

569
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,800
Yeah.

570
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,920
Hey, Brack, he killed Tife.

571
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,760
He killed...

572
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,600
Tife.

573
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,520
You killed your uncle?

574
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,360
Yeah.

575
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:28,320
Well, he was gonna destroy the footage too, I think.

576
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,120
He didn't want it out.

577
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,760
He didn't want it out.

578
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:35,400
I think Beck is like sort of in shock.

579
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,800
Like this is too much.

580
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,640
Do we need to roll grip or?

581
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,280
Yeah, if you could both roll grip.

582
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,520
Cow passes just fine.

583
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,720
20 on a 41.

584
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,680
I got a 69.

585
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,480
Holy fucking shit.

586
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,320
Hell yeah.

587
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,800
That's my first 69 in a long time.

588
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:55,240
All right, you're gonna gain a D4 of grip back.

589
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,080
Ooh.

590
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,240
That's a four.

591
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,080
That's a four.

592
00:24:59,080 --> 00:24:59,900
Hell yeah.

593
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:00,740
Oh, nice.

594
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:02,620
It says four on every side of that.

595
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:03,460
Yeah.

596
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:07,940
Beck is able to internalize this real quick and easy.

597
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:11,540
What is this resolve that Beck has attained?

598
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:14,700
It's that, I mean, as crazy as this all is,

599
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:18,020
it's tied up some loose ends and answered some questions,

600
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:20,580
even though others are now posed.

601
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:22,780
But it's like kind of weirdly making sense.

602
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:23,620
Yeah.

603
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:26,780
So Julius, like, holy fuck, you killed him.

604
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,100
But you don't have the footage?

605
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,300
Where'd you get the gun?

606
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:31,600
Don't worry about that.

607
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,440
Who shot you?

608
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,260
Well, one of them.

609
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,580
It was a player, one of them.

610
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:37,140
RR or WW.

611
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,740
Or, or Tife?

612
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:41,300
No, Tife didn't have a gun.

613
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:44,660
And he looks even farther than a thousand yards.

614
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:45,500
Holy shit.

615
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:49,500
Could I, could I?

616
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,340
Wouldn't even say it.

617
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,120
Could I see your gun?

618
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:52,960
No.

619
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,780
Please?

620
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:55,500
No.

621
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:59,660
He like pulls up his shirt for a second

622
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:04,540
and flashes you and you see two guns on it, on either hip.

623
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:05,820
And then he puts his shirt back down.

624
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:07,340
Holy shit.

625
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:08,620
Okay, so.

626
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:12,300
I'm sure if we went back to the stationers,

627
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:16,160
they were meeting with Tife, you know, the cops.

628
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,000
Yeah.

629
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,980
So he was bad, right?

630
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,540
Yes, he was a bad man.

631
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:22,740
A bad man who hated the news.

632
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,660
I mean, I wasn't there, but yeah,

633
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:26,900
it sounds like you did what you had to.

634
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,420
I mean, they're not like bad.

635
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:31,140
I mean, they just do whatever the Godot company

636
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:34,380
wants them to do that doesn't make him like necessarily.

637
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,740
They follow orders without thinking, no matter what?

638
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:38,900
Exactly, yeah, like you said, yeah.

639
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,180
They're just following orders?

640
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:41,340
Yeah, agreed.

641
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:42,500
It's like, what's the big deal?

642
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,780
Can I hear that, Steve?

643
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,180
Oh shit.

644
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,360
A serious look, yeah.

645
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:49,940
Right, okay, so if the, okay, huh.

646
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:52,980
And Jeremy's like, wait, wait, okay, so like,

647
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:55,780
if all of this is happening,

648
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,580
do you guys need coffee or anything?

649
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:02,660
I think we will be able to grab some coffee

650
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:05,460
on our way through the door, back at the station.

651
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,480
Real quick, back to Stevie.

652
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,500
The Godot company is bad.

653
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,420
Not all Godot's are bad.

654
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,880
You're not bad, Stevie.

655
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:17,000
You could be, depending on what you choose to do.

656
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,780
They like smile.

657
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:19,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

658
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:21,500
But you're not bad because you're a Godot.

659
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,340
Yeah, not yet.

660
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:26,780
Exactly, none of us are bad yet.

661
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,780
I used to be.

662
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:31,740
I used to be a good guy.

663
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:35,440
I used to be a good guy, then I went insane.

664
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,500
Hey, Zach, will you check your phone?

665
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:44,860
Julius is texting while you guys are talking.

666
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:49,080
If we go back to the, Julius is, I mean, like,

667
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:52,100
do people know other than Jeremy, like, this all happened?

668
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,380
Like, is there, is it a crime scene?

669
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:56,140
Is it, are there gonna be a lot of cops there?

670
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,260
He seems lost in his phone.

671
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:59,940
We've got to accept that there's probably a lot of cops

672
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,700
and a crime scene environment there,

673
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,640
but we're the perfect cover.

674
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,000
We're Can News.

675
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
We are Can News.

676
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,700
We've got to come in and cover it, you know?

677
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:09,720
That's, they'll believe that.

678
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,400
I'm Cal Colorado.

679
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,880
Do we know that the footage is there?

680
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,660
Stevie, were you supposed to do the handoff here

681
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,340
or was this money being exchanged

682
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:19,140
and then you were gonna go get the footage somewhere?

683
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,020
No, they were bringing the footage here.

684
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,140
So maybe it's on them.

685
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:23,780
I mean, it could be, it's,

686
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:25,660
if they were gonna meet you guys,

687
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:27,900
it was probably in Tife's office.

688
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:28,740
Yeah.

689
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,560
I mean, maybe.

690
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,700
I didn't look too hard.

691
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:33,900
Also, I don't know if there'll be cops there or not.

692
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,620
Kind of depends.

693
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:38,260
And he's like staring at his phone, waiting for-

694
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:40,980
Depends on what, Julius?

695
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,860
Okay, this is the last one I'm sending.

696
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:44,200
Julius says.

697
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,520
Okay, Julius, like, is staring at his phone for a while

698
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,820
and you see it kind of deeing.

699
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:52,780
Synesthesia.

700
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:53,940
Yeah, I got synesthesia.

701
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,380
I heard your pussy stink.

702
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,180
I can't do it.

703
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:03,260
Guys, I, I want to tell you-

704
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:04,100
That's just a tweet.

705
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,660
I didn't make that up or anything.

706
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,740
That would have been nuts.

707
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:10,760
Yeah, I'm not that good.

708
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:13,660
Guys, I want to, I want to tell you something,

709
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:18,540
but if I tell you, it's nothing's ever gonna be the same.

710
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:20,580
And you don't take it lightly.

711
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:26,540
I, I don't, but nothing's been the same

712
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:28,900
for a couple days now.

713
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:30,660
You know what I mean?

714
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,380
Yeah, I think we were past samesies.

715
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:35,540
Yeah, the It Pit pretty much did it in for that.

716
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,500
Okay, well.

717
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,020
Well, do you, I, you know,

718
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:43,420
I don't normally carry guns around, right?

719
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,260
I wasn't sure.

720
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,100
Yeah, yeah, no, no.

721
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,740
You didn't really seem like a big gun guy before,

722
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:49,780
except for, you know, those cannons

723
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:52,540
and your, and your, that you call thighs.

724
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:56,060
Right, I've had these, I've had these guns a long time.

725
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,700
You are a gun guy.

726
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:00,620
Well, I have to be in my line of work.

727
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:02,300
Beck is just staring at you.

728
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,700
What, what, what's your line of work, son?

729
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,780
Well, it's technically government.

730
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:16,020
I work for, it's like maybe kind of like the FBI,

731
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:21,900
but for, you know, the shit we've seen the past few days.

732
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:24,940
Extreme.

733
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:31,660
Basically, that's, that's the closest I'd compare it to.

734
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:35,500
I don't know, I just have a connection that,

735
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:39,220
that pays me and tells me to, to do things and...

736
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:42,380
Can I, can I human this?

737
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:43,220
Yeah.

738
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,060
70 on a 70.

739
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:45,900
How does he feel?

740
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,860
Do you think he's telling the truth?

741
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:50,260
You know, Julius, you've had a really tough day

742
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:52,620
and I believe that you believe

743
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:57,620
that you're in the X-Files or whatever, but yeah.

744
00:30:57,620 --> 00:31:00,420
I mean, so why don't we just get back to the can building

745
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:03,180
and try to find the footage?

746
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:08,180
And we can talk all about your little alien adventures

747
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:09,180
or whatever.

748
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:11,020
Okay, well, just so we know,

749
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:16,020
you guys are kinda, I mean, kinda in now too, in on it.

750
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:18,260
So don't tell anybody.

751
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:19,980
Are you, Julius, are you telling me

752
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,900
that you have like an assignment?

753
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:22,740
What do you, yeah.

754
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:25,260
Do you know more about what's going on than we do?

755
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:28,820
Well, I know that we need that footage

756
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:32,380
and I need to kill Gops.

757
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:35,980
We agreed we need that footage.

758
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:37,900
What do you want the footage for?

759
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:38,980
Same reason you do.

760
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,540
To show to the world.

761
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:41,380
Yes.

762
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:42,700
I want to human that.

763
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:43,540
Roll it, baby.

764
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,380
Nice.

765
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:45,700
36.

766
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,940
How does he feel?

767
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,780
Julius is telling the truth.

768
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:51,540
Fuck yeah, baby.

769
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:52,780
Holy shit.

770
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:53,620
Okay.

771
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:59,020
We find the footage and we put it out on the TikTok.

772
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:01,780
Yeah, are you like a real producer too though?

773
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:05,660
Beck sees Julius texting they need that footage.

774
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:09,660
Beck sees Julius texting they know and sending it.

775
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:14,980
Well, Ty was my uncle,

776
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:19,460
but no, I never had any real training.

777
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:22,980
It was, I mean, I'm lucky that he was my uncle.

778
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,620
That's how I got the job, but.

779
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:26,860
Well, we, yeah, we all knew that part.

780
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:28,340
Probably could have clocked that a little sooner,

781
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:29,460
you're right, yeah.

782
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,700
No, no, no, I mean, that was, yeah.

783
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:34,620
But at the end of the day, I feel like I, you know,

784
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,860
I have the same kind of heart that you guys do.

785
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:38,100
I want the truth.

786
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:40,340
I want people to know the truth.

787
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:43,900
Well, at least enough truth that they won't, you know,

788
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:44,740
go nuts.

789
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:47,940
You mean the whole truth?

790
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:49,140
In a lot of cases.

791
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:53,380
In this case, we just rolled about this.

792
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:56,740
Yeah, Julius, yes.

793
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:01,380
Definitely in this case.

794
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:03,220
Julius text.

795
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:04,860
Julius, who are you texting?

796
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:08,900
We can call her X for X file.

797
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:14,340
If that's, you know, that's the easiest way to refer to it.

798
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:17,340
Have you ever met X in real life?

799
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:22,220
Yeah, she's my roommate.

800
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:23,060
Oh shit.

801
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,860
Okay, so like, but this is like a source

802
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:28,260
that wants to remain anonymous.

803
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:30,020
What's her real name?

804
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,540
We'll need to get clearance to interview her

805
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:32,940
and everything for this.

806
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:35,340
I don't know that that'll be happening,

807
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:37,700
but I do have good news.

808
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:39,980
She's got the footage.

809
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,340
X has the footage?

810
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:42,940
She just texted me.

811
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:44,940
Like at your place?

812
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,420
Is X gonna give it to us?

813
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:47,260
What?

814
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:48,100
Ha ha.

815
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:48,940
Pfft.

816
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:49,780
Pfft.

817
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:50,620
Ha ha ha.

818
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:51,460
Pfft.

819
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:52,300
Ha ha ha.

820
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:53,140
Ha ha ha.

821
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:53,980
Ha ha ha.

822
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:54,820
Ha ha ha.

823
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:55,660
Ha ha ha.

824
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:56,500
Ha ha ha.

825
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,340
Ha ha ha.

826
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:58,180
Ha ha ha.

827
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:00,140
And it's all my fault.

828
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,380
Is that enough to be the end of the episode?

829
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:05,220
That's the end, right?

830
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:06,060
That's the end.

831
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:07,100
Unfortunately for...

832
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,580
We're doing two episodes, so.

833
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:12,340
Was that enough time?

834
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:13,980
It's like 50 minutes.

835
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,180
Oh, all together?

836
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:16,020
Yeah.

837
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,660
So it ended down to like 30?

838
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:19,860
No, like easy 42.

839
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:20,700
33.

840
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,620
So unfortunately that can't be the end.

841
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:23,540
Yeah, sorry Joe.

842
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:24,380
Ha ha ha.

843
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:29,060
You should end it there and then have like

844
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:32,220
still like 20 more minutes of episode after.

845
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:35,420
Play the music and then here's the rest of the episode.

846
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:36,260
Yeah.

847
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:40,980
You can, yeah, just like play the first 10 seconds.

848
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,060
Not a full fucking song.

849
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:44,140
Nobody would listen to it.

850
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:45,060
Two seconds.

851
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:49,500
Yeah, I think she's gonna give it to us.

852
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,220
And he...

853
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:54,940
X?

854
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:57,780
X gonna give it to us.

855
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:02,780
But he texts back a house emoji or Z, question mark.

856
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,540
The house.

857
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:09,580
Okay, you guys wanna see my house?

858
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:10,500
What's Z?

859
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,460
Secret meeting spot.

860
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:14,140
Oh, for your little alien club?

861
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:16,460
It's, well...

862
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:18,500
What are you guys, like an internet discussion group

863
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,540
or something or?

864
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:20,700
Do you have like training?

865
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,220
Did somebody train you?

866
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,060
Peck.

867
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:25,540
Come on.

868
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,380
I mean...

869
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,940
I'll tell you guys the full story later

870
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:33,020
but I mean, unless you wanna hear it right now.

871
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:34,100
Ha ha ha ha.

872
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:38,540
Yeah, tell it to us on the way.

873
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:39,380
Okay.

874
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,220
This is perfect.

875
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:41,980
Okay, so what cars are going where?

876
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:43,420
Where is Jeremy going?

877
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:45,940
Beck is FaceTiming Julius

878
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:49,060
who is in Jeremy's car following behind us.

879
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:50,180
Or no, we're following them

880
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:51,700
because you've gotta lead us to your house.

881
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:53,380
Who am I in the car with?

882
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:55,140
You're FaceTiming from Jeremy's car

883
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:55,980
and you're only in the car with Jeremy.

884
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,620
You're back in your bloody seat.

885
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:00,380
Clark.

886
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:04,020
Beck is getting the...

887
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:08,540
Beck is putting the phone on,

888
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:10,180
like trying to balance it on the dashboard

889
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:13,180
while he rummages around for like Arby's napkins

890
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:15,780
to start wiping the vomit off of him.

891
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:17,500
Oh yeah, yeah.

892
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,740
Oh, were you sick?

893
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,180
It's not mine, Cal.

894
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:24,340
I poked Julius in his gunshot wound

895
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:26,180
because he didn't think it was a gunshot wound

896
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:28,140
and I was trying to show him it was a gunshot wound

897
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:30,180
and when I did that, he threw up on me.

898
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,220
Checks out.

899
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:32,060
Cal just...

900
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,300
Julius says over FaceTime.

901
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,420
Cal just kind of blinks

902
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:38,020
and turns his eyes back to the road.

903
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:41,300
Well, I mean, yes.

904
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:46,260
It started when I was in high school

905
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:49,100
and then the screen fades away.

906
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:49,940
Dope, dope, dope, dope, dope.

907
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:52,820
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

908
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:55,100
We see Julius Summers as a teenager

909
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:57,780
wearing a black and white track and field uniform

910
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:01,500
with the suburb sharks emblazoned on the front.

911
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:04,020
We see clips of him talking and smiling with friends

912
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,940
and teammates interspersed between highlights

913
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:09,060
of his sprinting, pole vaulting, high and long jumping.

914
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,380
Whoa, Julie, you jumped so high.

915
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:13,820
It cuts to Julius on top of a podium

916
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:16,860
wearing multiple gold medals and holding flowers.

917
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:19,500
Julius is surrounded by his friends and fans

918
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,980
and being showered with congratulations and praise.

919
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:23,700
His thighs are so big.

920
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:24,540
Eventually the crowd...

921
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:26,620
That's how I jump so much.

922
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:29,140
Eventually the crowd thins out as the event wraps up.

923
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:30,780
The other teens head home with their parents

924
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:31,900
or older siblings.

925
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,980
And eventually Julius stands completely alone

926
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:36,460
near the pickup lane at the high school.

927
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:38,340
He flags down someone walking to their car

928
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:40,020
and asked to use their cell phone.

929
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:43,180
Julius dials a number and holds the phone up to his ear.

930
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:45,860
Hey mom, are you...

931
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:46,980
Oh, okay.

932
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:49,540
Yeah, I won.

933
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:53,780
Yeah, okay, I'll just walk home.

934
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:54,700
See you tonight?

935
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:57,420
Julius hands the phone back.

936
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:59,620
Politely declines a ride home

937
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:02,620
and begins to walk the four miles to his mom's house.

938
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:03,860
About three miles down the road,

939
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:05,220
Julius steps off the pavement

940
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:06,980
toward an overgrown path in the woods,

941
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:09,420
a shortcut he's taken a thousand times.

942
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:10,940
About 50 feet onto the trail,

943
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:14,860
Julius hears a twig snap and a low gravelly voice.

944
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:16,300
Nice race.

945
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:18,060
Julius spins around to look at a man

946
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:20,180
in a tight, ratty black suit,

947
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:23,060
dark aviator sunglasses and worn combat boots

948
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:26,060
with thin waist-length pitch black hair

949
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:27,740
leaning up against a tree.

950
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:29,900
Julius's stomach jumps to his throat

951
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,820
as he manages to squeak out.

952
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:32,980
Yeah, thanks.

953
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:35,820
I've been watching you.

954
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:38,500
We've been watching you,

955
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,980
rooting for you,

956
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:44,300
keeping track of all your accomplishments and failures.

957
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,820
You're good.

958
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:49,100
Almost as good as some of our guys.

959
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:53,100
What the fuck are you talking about?

960
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:55,260
Come here.

961
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:57,140
Let me get a closer look.

962
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:59,660
Let me,

963
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:01,260
let me feel your strength.

964
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:04,340
Get the fuck away from me!

965
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:08,180
Okay, damn, we're gonna have to play it this way, huh?

966
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:10,860
Well, I'll give you a head start.

967
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:13,340
Julius stares at the man.

968
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:16,180
He notices how unevenly shaved the man's face is.

969
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,940
A patch of three or four hairs

970
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:20,140
inches longer than his five o'clock shadow

971
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:22,100
protrudes from his chin.

972
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:25,500
The man raises his hand up to stroke the longer hairs.

973
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,140
Five,

974
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:27,980
four,

975
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:30,380
three.

976
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:32,980
The man ever so slightly flicks his sunglasses down,

977
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:34,420
looks over them at Julius

978
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:36,980
and motions his head toward the trail.

979
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:38,260
Go, Mr. Summers.

980
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:42,580
Julius takes off sprinting towards safety.

981
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:43,780
Two.

982
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,180
He hurdles over fallen limbs,

983
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:47,300
rusted scrap metal and loose rocks.

984
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:50,860
His vision narrows as his flight response fully kicks in.

985
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:51,740
One.

986
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:53,580
Julius hears quick heavy footsteps

987
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:55,100
begin falling behind him.

988
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,900
He can almost see the end of the tree line

989
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:59,420
that opens up into the back of his neighborhood.

990
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:03,100
Looks like I'll be taking those medals today, boy.

991
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:06,980
Julius falls to the ground as he's tackled from behind.

992
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:09,500
His face is shoved into the mud as his legs

993
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,340
and hands are zip tied behind him.

994
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:12,660
The man flips over onto his back.

995
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,740
Can you say that again real quick?

996
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:16,140
His face is shoved into the mud.

997
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:18,060
The fact was so close.

998
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:20,940
Julius falls to the ground as he is tackled from behind.

999
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:23,100
His face is shoved into the mud as his legs

1000
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:25,220
and hands are zip tied behind him.

1001
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:28,420
The man flips over onto his back and stands over him.

1002
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:30,380
We'll get you in proper shape.

1003
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:31,260
Trust me, bud.

1004
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:34,460
The screen goes dark as the man's foot comes down

1005
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:35,780
on Julius's face.

1006
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:40,780
And then, yeah, pretty much just training every day.

1007
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:49,260
And then they tell me to do something and I do it.

1008
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:51,860
Did they ever tell you who they were?

1009
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:56,020
As far as you guys are concerned,

1010
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:58,740
for now they're X-Files and I'm X-Files.

1011
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:00,540
Wait, these are your nerd friends?

1012
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:02,140
Yeah.

1013
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:06,940
Sure, Cal.

1014
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:11,940
No, wait, that, that heroine story felt very real.

1015
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:18,460
This is the, you're, son of a bitch, you're an X-Files.

1016
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:19,420
I am.

1017
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:24,420
There's like a look of like relief and a resolve in Beck

1018
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,980
because it's all fucking real.

1019
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:28,860
He fucking knew it.

1020
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:30,660
Fuck yeah, fuck yeah.

1021
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:32,180
Cal vomits in Beck's lap.

1022
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:36,300
I'm gonna need some more of those napkins.

1023
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,380
Julius looks over at Jeremy.

1024
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:39,940
I guess you're in now, too.

1025
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:44,340
Jeremy's eyes are so fucking big, dude.

1026
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:47,220
That's an ep.

1027
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:48,060
Sweet.

1028
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:49,140
That's fucking dope, dude.

1029
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:53,020
It's great and it's all my fault

1030
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:59,980
because my life is great

1031
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:01,940
and it's all mine

1032
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:14,500
because my life is great

1033
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,780
and it's all my fault

1034
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:24,140
because my life is great
