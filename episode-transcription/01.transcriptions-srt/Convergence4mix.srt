1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,720
Shit.

2
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,440
God damn it, quit poking and prodding me.

3
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:04,840
I can't see shit.

4
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:08,200
Who put this fucking blindfold on me?

5
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,360
Hey, I'm talking to you, whoever, or whatever you are.

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,400
Cut that shit out now.

7
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,800
I got a damn show to run here.

8
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:21,560
Don't you know I'm broadcasting live from 694.2 PTBP,

9
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:27,080
the only radio station currently being run by an in-prison DJ

10
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,400
Wolf the Dog?

11
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,240
Now, we got a new Howlin' with Wolf, y'all.

12
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,480
And this week's comes from Nathan,

13
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,960
who claims he is either deep in the heart of Texas

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,800
or deep in the hell that is Texas.

15
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:44,560
He writes, shout out to Eric N for being the most badass

16
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:48,800
bone-digging buddy one could ask for in this dirty business.

17
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,280
And to my wife, Erin, who is so good at wrangling all those

18
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,080
werepuppies and kitties, I'm so glad you're diving

19
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,640
into a world of unseen horrors.

20
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,440
Love you, insert creepy cackling laugh.

21
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,200
Oh, shit.

22
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:12,400
To those hardworking cultural resource archaeologists

23
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,600
out in the field, keep on digging those holes

24
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,960
and hopefully those sinister abandoned cabins we find

25
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:24,960
on survey aren't the layer of any backwoods Eldritch cults.

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Stay safe and sane, says here a creepy cackling laugh

27
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,560
again but better this time.

28
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,200
Oh, God damn it.

29
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:42,920
Well, Nathan, thanks for forcing me to cackle not once

30
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:46,920
but two times on a day where I don't especially feel

31
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,160
like cackling.

32
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,400
I forgive you this time but next time.

33
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:55,720
Oh, buddy, you better hope it's a cackle day or else.

34
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,880
If you wanna write up something for this

35
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:01,360
and caged wolf to how, click on the show notes

36
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,400
and tag us on the internet at pretending pod.

37
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,440
One of those links down there is to patreon.com

38
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,360
slash pretending pod.

39
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,840
For the whole month of November, we here at PTBP

40
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,720
are taking any new and upgraded monies,

41
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,240
doubling it and using that scratch to buy blankets

42
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,200
and sleeping bags for cold folks in Springfield, Missouri.

43
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,640
And y'all have been super duper kind.

44
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:31,480
So far, you've raised $375.

45
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:36,480
So wolf gonna double that and we can spend $750

46
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,160
on supplies for those who need them.

47
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,040
And congrats, I said I'd give away a couple

48
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:47,040
of PTBP logo t-shirts to a couple fine patrons on Patreon.

49
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:52,160
So yay and good job to Jasmine Johnson

50
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,280
and Chainsaw Unicorn.

51
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,400
Please reach out by any means necessary

52
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,160
so we can send you a damn shirt.

53
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,520
Woo hoo hoo, it's time for the news.

54
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,320
The news is wild, y'all.

55
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,000
There's a pregnant girl in this motel room

56
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,320
that we all thought was meant for storage.

57
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:16,600
Hmm, hmm, Scott Adams, hmm, indeed.

58
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,480
Now I'm gonna give you all what we all need.

59
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,160
It's Brat Pit with Ms. Mary.

60
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,080
Mary, yeah.

61
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,960
I gotta work in the morning

62
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,960
and this shit's so important

63
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,960
so I can't get high.

64
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:50,840
No, I can't get high.

65
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:55,120
I thought this stuff helped anxiety.

66
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,360
There must be something inside of me.

67
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:02,480
Does anybody know why?

68
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,360
I can't get high.

69
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,400
I think we both thought you wanted to open it.

70
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,320
No, I was saying like this, I don't really like it

71
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,560
but it's really not that bad.

72
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,400
It's not.

73
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,000
But also every time I drink it, I go through,

74
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,520
I don't like it, it's fine.

75
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,400
I don't like it.

76
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,240
And of course, we're talking about

77
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,120
the new Limoncello Naturally Essence

78
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,160
Sparkling Water from La Croix.

79
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,480
We'll like it if La Croix does podcast ads.

80
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,800
That is true, until then, fuck La Croix

81
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,600
and fuck every brand that doesn't.

82
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,280
Yeah, we will keep talking shit about you

83
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,840
until you pay us off.

84
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,040
It's like a vanilla lemon thing.

85
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,640
There's too much vanilla in it, though.

86
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,640
No, it's kinda gross.

87
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:47,040
We're here with David Winters!

88
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,840
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.

89
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,480
Wam, wam, wam, wam, wam.

90
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:56,480
Winter is coming, now is the winters of your discontent.

91
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,320
What's up, man?

92
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,760
Yeah, hi.

93
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,440
Have you been having fun with us?

94
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,280
Have you enjoyed this?

95
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,920
You got some hot energy coming in.

96
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,280
Yes, yes, I have.

97
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,640
These are like those one-word answers

98
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:13,280
when your parents call and you are in the middle

99
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,760
of something and you pick it up.

100
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,920
Is this like when you're at like a con

101
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,240
and people ask you questions, you're just like,

102
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,960
hey, I loved the show so much, how is it?

103
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,800
Yes.

104
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,240
So are you a lawyer in real life?

105
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,080
No.

106
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,000
Who's your favorite PTV people?

107
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,200
Yes.

108
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,120
It makes for good radio.

109
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,120
It does, yeah.

110
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:39,960
Who's your favorite?

111
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:40,800
Really short.

112
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,640
Glass cannon.

113
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,120
To the point.

114
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:43,960
No.

115
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,040
Okay, so if you had to pick only one Colin Hanks movie

116
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,920
and then replace him with every.

117
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,000
Can you name a third Colin Hanks movie?

118
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,840
I can name Orange County and I don't know any more than that.

119
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,120
That's the end of my list, too.

120
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,240
Oh, right, I said Dexter, that's not even a movie.

121
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,200
All right, let's dive into this shit, shall we?

122
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,880
We just learned a lot of information, so much information.

123
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,200
Well, you learned some of the information.

124
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,320
We got cut off so rudely by the end of an episode

125
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:19,000
right at the about halfway point of an info dump.

126
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,840
I'm willing to keep dumping

127
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,480
if you're willing to keep receiving the dump.

128
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,320
Oh, please dump on us.

129
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,160
Dump all over us.

130
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,000
Please dump on us.

131
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,560
We got a glass table right here, we'll pull out.

132
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,400
Well, that made it weird.

133
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,720
Steam and hot info.

134
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,960
Yeah, you made it into like scat or something,

135
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:34,800
that was weird.

136
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,360
Yeah, we just want knowledge shat all over our chests.

137
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,200
Right.

138
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,720
I love these big steamy dumps that David is taking.

139
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,520
You just cracked open his notebook

140
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:52,440
and got a dump of several different happenings

141
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,920
that he has seemed to have researched in the area.

142
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,640
Things like livestock mutilations, livestock alterations,

143
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,680
some missing time, some helicopters being sighted,

144
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,840
including some muzzle flashes,

145
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,760
lights being sighted in the hills, some crop circles,

146
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:10,400
some notes about J.A. being Jane Allen.

147
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,520
Pregnant three weeks equals six months.

148
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,560
Exactly, and the aldermen who never go home.

149
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,320
That was in the notebook, his wide ruled school notebook.

150
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,160
Freak.

151
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,960
You, again, should be questioning his sanity.

152
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,320
And you still see his Macintosh power book

153
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:31,800
in front of you plugged into the phone outlet

154
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,800
as you had learned earlier when you tried to dial them.

155
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,320
Is there anything you'd like to do?

156
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:40,040
Can I ask a kind of retroactive question?

157
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,440
When I was looking at Jane Allen,

158
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,960
when Tan was looking at Jane Allen,

159
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,960
did she seem older than she should be?

160
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,640
Nope, she's still a high school senior,

161
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,560
looks like a high school senior,

162
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,200
actually looks very similar to some of those photos

163
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,160
that you saw of her family in her house

164
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,000
when you were there, right?

165
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,840
When her mom was dressed to kill.

166
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,600
At least one of you,

167
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:08,120
yeah, at least one of you was looking through

168
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,200
all the family photos and she looks as you would expect.

169
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,600
So back to the computer.

170
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,440
Sure.

171
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:20,440
Jodine goes over and turns it on and we saw he had AOL.

172
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,960
He does, however, in typical 1990s computer fashion,

173
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:30,800
it does still ask for a password as you open it.

174
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,400
Does anyone have an often underused skill?

175
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:39,080
SIGINT, signals intelligence.

176
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,280
I don't.

177
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,120
Exactly.

178
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,380
I have a 50 in pilot.

179
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,320
Can I pilot this computer too?

180
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,920
Can we negotiate with you here?

181
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,880
Luke, we need to seriously have a conversation

182
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,920
about the fact that I took special training in parachute.

183
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:00,760
Yeah, I knew both of those

184
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,560
and I didn't want to connect them yet,

185
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,840
but I know what's going to happen.

186
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,460
You don't need SIGINT.

187
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,000
SIGINT is one option,

188
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,240
but fortunately there's a second one

189
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,720
which is computer science.

190
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,080
Oh, good.

191
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,960
I've got computer science at a 50.

192
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,960
Oh, good.

193
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:22,420
50, with a 50, given how much time and effort

194
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:24,060
you've invested in knowing computer science.

195
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,100
You know, in the early 1990s,

196
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,680
people don't use the most secure passwords.

197
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,440
Not realizing that information security is important.

198
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,120
Guess me a password.

199
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,640
Love, one, two, three.

200
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,320
Okay, that doesn't work.

201
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,660
Watch the sky's exclamation point.

202
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:41,500
Purple.

203
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,360
Watch the sky's exclamation point actually worked.

204
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,180
That's all it was.

205
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,800
Well, I didn't try that one, so.

206
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,400
Shit, I'm not there.

207
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,240
Cindy.

208
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,060
I'm sorry, Joe.

209
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:49,900
Oh, Cindy's not there?

210
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:50,720
Oh, oh, okay.

211
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,560
I'm sorry, Joe.

212
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,940
Sorry, it's not, so did purple work?

213
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:56,640
Yeah, Joe, guess like 15 more.

214
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,160
I try watch the sky's one.

215
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,000
No?

216
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,380
I try watch the sky's two.

217
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,500
Oh, no.

218
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,340
I accidentally.

219
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,160
Maybe I should just have you roll.

220
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,860
I accidentally hit caps lock.

221
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,200
I go back to the one,

222
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,880
because I thought I might have mis-hit that one.

223
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,300
I countermeasured triggers,

224
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,200
and the computer catches on fire

225
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:20,220
due to 10 failed password attempts.

226
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,060
No, I'm just kidding.

227
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:21,880
I'll give it to you.

228
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,800
I wasn't going to actually make you guess every password

229
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,600
until you got to football one, two, three

230
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,000
was the correct answer.

231
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,320
Hey, I was on the backtrack.

232
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:32,420
Go team, you were, you were.

233
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,100
It cracks open.

234
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,660
You find a document on the desktop,

235
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:40,820
and I am going to display it in front of you now.

236
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:44,220
If you check out your television, it's long.

237
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:48,260
This is a long multiple paragraph document

238
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:53,260
written in kind of first person stream of consciousness.

239
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,900
It looks like it's,

240
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:59,340
they're looking for evidence of extra sensory perception.

241
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,540
I am wondering about the possibility

242
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,660
that the brain translates information

243
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,500
in terms of the extra sensory.

244
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,340
He literally told us not to read this.

245
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,900
And that's why it achieves.

246
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:12,020
Can we shut up for like two minutes and just read it,

247
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,860
and then we can talk about what it says?

248
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,900
Is it just like a stream of thought?

249
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,500
Yeah, it gets just insane.

250
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:22,260
Omni parent consciousness, open network.

251
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,100
Yeah.

252
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,660
It starts out kind of coherent,

253
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,380
but it gets a little rambly.

254
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,700
Oh, we get into some Jesus stuff.

255
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,480
I thought so too, but that's not what it is.

256
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,940
Yeah, it's French, just sweetie.

257
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,540
Yeah, French Jesus.

258
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,620
So it's a long,

259
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,500
and the reason why I said not to read it all out loud

260
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,060
is it would make no sense.

261
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:45,440
And people would have to rewind several times and be like,

262
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,340
what the hell are these guys talking about?

263
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:50,020
But suffice to say, this is something presumably

264
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:52,220
that was written by Scott Adams on his computer

265
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,400
stream of consciousness,

266
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:58,180
talking about extra sensory perception and existence

267
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:01,420
and seeing things and consciousness

268
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:05,020
and all sorts of nonsense related to thought

269
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:08,060
and the sensory experience.

270
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,660
He should have stuck to Dilbert.

271
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,820
He's branching out, okay?

272
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,300
You have to try new things.

273
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:20,300
Yeah, the file title was S-Z-E comma T.

274
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:23,900
Of course it was, of course it was.

275
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,820
But now you have that, that's thing number two

276
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,540
from this steamy dump.

277
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:32,380
Thing number three, you see a file on the desktop.

278
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:34,380
It's simply titled message.

279
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,420
It's a wave file.

280
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:40,240
And I am going to need an alertness roll from everyone.

281
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,860
Fail, 73 on a 70.

282
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:50,300
I also fail, a 75 on a 50.

283
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:53,020
Succeed, 39 on a 50.

284
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:55,320
I got a 36 on a 50, nice.

285
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,160
All right.

286
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,760
So Zach and Luke, keep your headphones on.

287
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,000
The other two of you, please take your headphones off

288
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,760
and then we will swap.

289
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,320
Dude, Zach, we can literally say anything about these guys

290
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,160
in the beginning.

291
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,180
Fucking idiots.

292
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,800
I love them both a whole lot.

293
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,260
Me too.

294
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,640
You fire up the message

295
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
and this is the clip you get.

296
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,560
Dealing with, it's been a long time

297
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,400
and we have many things to do

298
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,240
and you are not sure what you are doing.

299
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:29,780
Stop, stop, stop.

300
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:31,080
That's all you get out of it.

301
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:31,920
Okay.

302
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,280
So someone's telling this guy to stop what he's doing

303
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,960
because he doesn't know what he's dealing with.

304
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,780
Is that right, Luke?

305
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:39,620
Did I do it?

306
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,200
I wrote down, not sure what you're dealing with.

307
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,040
Stop now.

308
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:42,860
Wow.

309
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,320
One in the same.

310
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,240
Pop, swap, swap, swap, swap.

311
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,760
Zach didn't teach you the bird.

312
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,280
When he wants to call us back in,

313
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,920
we do this on our screens.

314
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,280
Oh, really?

315
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,240
We did it when we were remote

316
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,140
because we couldn't.

317
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:56,980
People can fly away at home.

318
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:59,360
You could see on the screen if we needed them back.

319
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,200
Fair enough.

320
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,280
Well, I've got you two now

321
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,360
and now it's time for you to fire up

322
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,000
this metallic squawky voice.

323
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,600
Dealing with, it's been a long time

324
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,400
and we have many things to do

325
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,240
and you are not sure what you are doing.

326
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,280
Stop now.

327
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,720
Stop now.

328
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,960
Tone Brown, is that like the Brown note?

329
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,320
He did say duty.

330
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,560
He just said duty.

331
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,200
Can I do the bird thing into the camera?

332
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,040
Is that how it works?

333
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:28,860
Yeah, do that.

334
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:29,700
Let's see if it works.

335
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,640
No one's looking, that's the problem.

336
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,140
We often combat that, yep.

337
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,760
Oh, it worked, it worked.

338
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,920
Saw the bird.

339
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,160
So we, Joe and I like sat there

340
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,320
like rubbing our ears vigorously

341
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,160
for like a minute and a half.

342
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,120
Saw that, yeah.

343
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,600
So we couldn't hear anything

344
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,320
and you two chuckle fuckers are just like sharing memes

345
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,640
and laughing and faking.

346
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,980
Yeah, I wasn't paying attention to you at all.

347
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:56,260
Luke has some really funny pictures on his phone.

348
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,100
Yeah.

349
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:02,380
Okay.

350
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:05,300
Well, that seems ominous.

351
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,860
Yeah, what did you think about the,

352
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:10,160
do you think he's working on the Brown note,

353
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,660
the tone that makes people shit their pants?

354
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,340
The Brown, what?

355
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,980
I had not, what?

356
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:17,820
The Brown note.

357
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,300
He said a Brown tone.

358
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,660
No, I didn't hear any, what?

359
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,480
That's not what I heard at all.

360
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,300
What do you mean?

361
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,140
We all heard it.

362
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,380
Play it again.

363
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,220
Here's the deal.

364
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:34,160
I'm not sure what you're dealing with, but stop now.

365
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,000
Yeah.

366
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,840
That's what we heard.

367
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,920
Yeah, we heard a man's voice, right?

368
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:37,920
It was kind of garbled.

369
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,240
We missed some words.

370
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,060
Right.

371
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,360
But it mostly just said,

372
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,040
you don't know what you're dealing with.

373
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,600
Stop now, stop now, stop now.

374
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,440
What did you hear?

375
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,260
Over and over and over.

376
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:50,060
Well, we heard some garbled words too, but we,

377
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,640
well, I think you took it down pretty well, huh?

378
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,320
You didn't hear a name.

379
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,360
They said Billy Webb.

380
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,520
No, we heard, we didn't hear no name.

381
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,680
They said a name?

382
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,720
Billy Webb?

383
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,040
Yeah, they talked about duty and they talked about.

384
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:02,880
A Brown tone.

385
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,280
They said to talk now.

386
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,120
Who's Billy Webb?

387
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,040
Was he on the list of the,

388
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,440
in the notes we got of all the different events?

389
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,920
I just remember Beau Laramie.

390
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,760
Nope.

391
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,600
Doesn't look like it.

392
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,420
Nope.

393
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,880
Billy Webb.

394
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,840
Like a web of Billys.

395
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,220
I don't remember if computers had this kind of stuff

396
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,380
back then, but is there anything that we can click on

397
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:28,340
that shows us when the file was made, like created?

398
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:31,220
Yeah, the file is only about three days old.

399
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,100
As far as this audio file goes,

400
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:36,380
the ranty dream of consciousness file,

401
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:38,260
that's only about two days old.

402
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,360
That seems to be a little bit more fresh.

403
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:43,380
And then obviously the notebook is handwritten.

404
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,660
So you'd have no idea exactly when stuff was written.

405
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,420
However, there are various dates

406
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:49,100
over the last month and a half.

407
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,800
It's tough to say which of those dates were reported to him

408
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,040
or maybe which of those bits of information

409
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,000
he collected himself.

410
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,240
There's nowhere a way to delineate between the two.

411
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,080
Sure.

412
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,760
What did you hear about Billy Webb?

413
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,600
That's it.

414
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,520
Just they said a name.

415
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:05,320
They said Billy Webb and then they kind of broke up.

416
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,440
And then there was a...

417
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,200
Did Billy Webb used to play center field

418
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,440
for the Ohio state?

419
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,840
University?

420
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,240
USO backwards?

421
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,840
Tan goes to the office and asks Riker for a phone book.

422
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:19,680
Nice.

423
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,640
And Riker will produce a phone book.

424
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,120
I go to W looking for Billiam Webb.

425
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:29,280
You can go to W and there are no webs in this town.

426
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,200
What a tangled web we don't weave.

427
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,040
Jeez.

428
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,120
Let's see what he did there.

429
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,440
So is this like one...

430
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,280
Okay.

431
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,040
Why did we play an audio file and we heard one thing

432
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,160
and you heard another?

433
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,440
Well, you misheard obviously.

434
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,920
Yeah, I think you guys are just wrong.

435
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,880
Well, if we don't know what Billy Webb is

436
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,440
and there's no Billy Webb here,

437
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,920
doesn't it probably lend itself to the belief

438
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,800
that we heard the correct thing?

439
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,280
I mean, we all heard the same thing.

440
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,440
You just misheard.

441
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,560
It's not like there are no Billy Webs ever.

442
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,920
It says Laurel just over and over.

443
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,440
Tan who is not a part of this conversation

444
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:09,520
cause he's in the office asks Riker,

445
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,240
do you know Billy Webb?

446
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,000
Is that, do you know?

447
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,840
No.

448
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,680
Okay, that's it.

449
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,160
Bye.

450
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,360
Bye.

451
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,160
On the computer, is that literally all we find?

452
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,720
Is there anything else that we should look

453
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,680
in this computer for?

454
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,520
That's really all that's relevant.

455
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,760
You can go through all the other notebooks and notes.

456
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:30,560
He has notebooks for various other towns all over the place.

457
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,360
He's based out of Tennessee.

458
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,560
So most of these towns are all related

459
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,320
to sightings in the area.

460
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,440
However, the Grover's Ville notebook is chock full of stuff.

461
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,120
It's just page after pages.

462
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,880
These are kind of the more recent pages,

463
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,200
but you go back and there are just progressively

464
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,840
more outrageous things that he has records of.

465
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,280
Little gray people walking through Main Street

466
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:55,240
and sighting of eight flying saucers.

467
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:58,120
And it goes back years actually of this Grover's Ville stuff.

468
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:01,440
It's only more recently when you're seeing specific things

469
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:06,440
about choppers or weird things about pregnant girls.

470
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:11,360
What is the oldest mention of like an alien occurrence

471
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,240
or sighting in Grover's Ville?

472
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,220
It's probably two or three years,

473
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:17,140
but it's similar to his other notebooks.

474
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:19,280
Most other places go back two or three years.

475
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,280
You can reason that's probably

476
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,860
when he kind of got in the UFO game.

477
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:22,700
Gotcha, okay.

478
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:27,000
He stopped writing comics and then got into the UFO game.

479
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,840
Good for him.

480
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,040
Tan goes back to the room and signals Cindy

481
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,180
to like come outside.

482
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

483
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,820
So he doesn't know anything about Webb.

484
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,820
I got an idea though.

485
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,420
Well, that's because Webb wasn't a thing.

486
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,260
What's your idea?

487
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,100
Yeah, I got an idea.

488
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:44,020
Okay, you know, everybody in the town's weird.

489
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:44,880
Yeah, for sure.

490
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,240
Probably an alien.

491
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,060
Sure.

492
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:47,900
They're covering something up.

493
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:48,920
Yeah, yeah.

494
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:53,920
What if we parade Jane down Main Street,

495
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,600
make a big scene,

496
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,760
and then we see who comes out to deal with it.

497
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,040
Then we got our main suspect.

498
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,640
That seems horrible to do to this poor girl.

499
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,600
Hearing that through the open door at Joe is like,

500
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,760
yeah, I think everyone would come out

501
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,920
to stop you from doing that, alien or not.

502
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,080
Plus the aliens, their whole deal

503
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,640
is that they're acting like people.

504
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,320
Yeah, but it's gonna piss them off.

505
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,040
They're gonna be really,

506
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,520
they're gonna be blase about it

507
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,800
like they've been blase about everything.

508
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,520
What we need to do is go to who has the most money

509
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,360
in this town and take them out

510
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,120
because they are provoking, they are threatening,

511
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,520
they are going around dealing in stuff

512
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,720
that they don't want other people poking their heads in.

513
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,200
And what do we know, Joe,

514
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,840
about people who don't want people poking their heads in,

515
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,420
who threaten other people?

516
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:39,620
It's always about...

517
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:40,460
Money.

518
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,280
Money.

519
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,840
It's always about money.

520
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,680
Joe is like looking at you intently

521
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:48,480
and he kind of like holds up a cardigan and hands it to you.

522
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,960
She puts on a second cardigan and calms down.

523
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,040
I only got one more, fellers.

524
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,360
As she's calming down,

525
00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:00,080
you hear out in the parking lot a car arrive.

526
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,080
We all turn and look.

527
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,320
Now, before we do that though,

528
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,760
I need to just talk to Joe.

529
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,880
Joe the character or Joe the human?

530
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:12,360
Sorry, Joe, that was such a bad choice, Thomas.

531
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,640
I think it's a good name.

532
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,480
It is a good name.

533
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,000
I don't fault you for that.

534
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,840
I think, look, do me a favor.

535
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:24,160
Next time you have a victim like myself

536
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,680
in this similar situation,

537
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:29,640
only use your four names scrambled between them.

538
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,800
There you go.

539
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,920
There you go.

540
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:35,440
Send us Troy Lavallee and we will do that to him.

541
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,480
Luke Zach.

542
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,320
Go, Thomas.

543
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,680
I want to talk to Joe the human being.

544
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,640
Real life, Joe.

545
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,760
Everyone else, wait for the bird signal.

546
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,280
It's just me and you, David.

547
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,480
It is just me and you.

548
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,840
And really, you know, I just wanted to take a break.

549
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,680
I'm good with you, yeah.

550
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,880
And really just, yeah,

551
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,600
just relax without those chuckleheads.

552
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,480
That's really kind of the main thing.

553
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,520
What you getting for dinner tonight?

554
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,360
Bad thing about saying that is at some point,

555
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,720
someone's going to be editing this

556
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:02,360
and I just called them a chucklehead, so, you know.

557
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:08,080
I hope it's you editing this episode and not anyone else.

558
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,600
However, I have news for you.

559
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,960
And I have news for your character.

560
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,560
I guess not you,

561
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:18,920
but that news is you feel a little bit different today.

562
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,720
You have no real change in appetite,

563
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,880
but for whatever reason, you're incredibly thirsty.

564
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,400
You just feel like you're always dehydrated.

565
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,400
You always need to be drinking something,

566
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,080
thinking about where you're getting your next drink.

567
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,440
Not necessarily an alcoholic beverage,

568
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,040
just water, coffee, anything,

569
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:37,240
but you can't quite quench that thirst.

570
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,960
Additionally, speaking of the dumps

571
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,120
we were discussing earlier,

572
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,480
you can still urinate,

573
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:47,200
but there's no more number two for you in your future.

574
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,080
Is it a constipation thing

575
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,480
or I just don't feel the need to?

576
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,080
You don't feel the need to.

577
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,200
Yes, I'm sorry.

578
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,280
I don't want to make it sound like

579
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:57,920
you have suddenly just become constipated and you need,

580
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,320
yeah, you need to go to a drug store and get,

581
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,560
no, it's not quite like that.

582
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,240
You have absolutely no urge to.

583
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,160
Okay, cool.

584
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,160
And that's pretty much it.

585
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,280
That's all you know.

586
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,920
Just the standard, last night was thirsty Thursday.

587
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,840
Today's Friday.

588
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,680
You know, it happens.

589
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,440
Some Fridays you just need to drink a lot of fluid

590
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,760
and you can never defecate ever again.

591
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,600
That's it.

592
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,440
You know.

593
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,360
All right, I'll do the bird thing.

594
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,080
It's working, it's working.

595
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,160
We got him.

596
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:26,200
A car has rolled up into the parking lot.

597
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:31,200
It is an early nineties Lincoln town car, in fact.

598
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,040
And it rolls up, sees you all

599
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:38,360
and a sharply dressed individual, a G man, if you will,

600
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:42,880
hops out of the car with a large duffle bag

601
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,320
and comes up towards the office, towards Riker's office,

602
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,720
kind of asks where you guys are.

603
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,920
Riker's in that office, points kind of down your way

604
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,480
towards the Scott Adams, Jane Allen room.

605
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:57,120
And he gets there and knocks on the ajar door.

606
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:57,940
Wait, hello?

607
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:00,880
He stands like in the middle of all of us,

608
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,600
quiet and then knocks on the door?

609
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,640
I thought you were inside.

610
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,040
You and I are outside.

611
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:05,880
Yeah, we're outside.

612
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,700
They're inside.

613
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:07,540
Cindy and Jane are outside.

614
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:08,380
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.

615
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,200
I thought everyone was inside.

616
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,360
So we're like waving at him as he comes towards us.

617
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,360
He just walks past you and ignores you.

618
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,200
No, just kidding.

619
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,480
He stops you.

620
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,520
Sorry.

621
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,760
Zach's head whipped to us.

622
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,600
He's like, that's fair.

623
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,440
What's that mean?

624
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,960
Okay, that's wild.

625
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,360
It's a clue.

626
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,960
He can't see you anymore.

627
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,480
You're now invisible.

628
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,960
We're the aliens.

629
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,280
Am I real?

630
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:32,060
Sorry, I didn't realize you were standing there.

631
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:32,900
Hello?

632
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,280
And he whips out a badge.

633
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,700
Agent Jordan Cook.

634
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,860
You are the agents, right?

635
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:40,660
Agent Cindy Wodabaga, DEA.

636
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:43,700
I'm Agent Tan Loothide, ATF.

637
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:44,780
Excellent, excellent.

638
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:49,580
Well, I have a delivery from your handler, if you will.

639
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:50,420
Thank you.

640
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,540
Yes.

641
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:54,900
Gives you an envelope and gives you a duffel bag.

642
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,000
Oh, sorry.

643
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,300
I almost forgot something.

644
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:02,060
He looks around back and forth,

645
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:04,900
makes sure Riker's not listening or anyone else.

646
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,220
Bubble gum tree.

647
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,780
Nice.

648
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:08,620
Bubble gum tree.

649
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:10,140
Bubble gum tree.

650
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:11,740
And then he turns around and just walks away.

651
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:14,300
How heavy is the duffel bag that I'm carrying?

652
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,460
Relatively heavy.

653
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,220
It's about 20 pounds.

654
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,180
And then you have one of those envelopes,

655
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:21,300
kind of an inner office mail sort of envelope.

656
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:24,860
One of those big yellow ones with like the string.

657
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:26,020
Manila envelope.

658
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,180
Vanilla envelope.

659
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:28,460
Vanilla envelope.

660
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,140
It smells like fresh vanilla.

661
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:32,740
It smells like a Yankee candle, kind of.

662
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:35,980
These new Limoncello La Croix envelopes

663
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:38,500
are not that good in my opinion.

664
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,340
I look at them and it's okay.

665
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:42,340
And then I look at it a little more and I'm like,

666
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:43,180
I don't like that.

667
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,020
I just don't know about it.

668
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:46,180
But I go ahead and open it up anyway.

669
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:48,940
I also unzip the duffel bag a little bit.

670
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:51,380
We like walk into the room as we do this.

671
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:52,220
Sure.

672
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:55,380
So in the envelope is a single piece of paper

673
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:57,380
with some stuff typed out on it.

674
00:25:57,380 --> 00:26:00,540
And then in the bag is a bunch of liquid.

675
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:03,260
Six gallons of liquid with two spray bottles.

676
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:04,620
Almost the same kind of spray bottles

677
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:06,180
you would use to clean with.

678
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,700
What does the liquid look like?

679
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:11,060
The liquid is basically colorless.

680
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:15,420
It just looks to be slightly foamy and bubbly, transparent.

681
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:17,520
Does anyone else have a high pharmacy?

682
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,700
I have a 50.

683
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:19,680
I don't know why I'm looking.

684
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,660
I don't have any.

685
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:22,260
How about you just look at the piece of paper?

686
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:23,100
Yeah.

687
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:23,920
In the envelope.

688
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,760
Yeah, maybe we do that.

689
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,160
Let's do some rolls first.

690
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,980
Yeah, let's do some rolls first.

691
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:29,320
She starts smelling them.

692
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,600
All right, yeah, yeah, yeah.

693
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,700
We read the paper.

694
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:34,540
Are you sure?

695
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:35,880
I mean, you can just mess around with the liquids

696
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,720
if you want.

697
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,540
We can also go that route.

698
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:38,380
Let's talk to the liquid for a while.

699
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:39,480
Slap these bags real quick.

700
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,520
Let's just start spraying each other with them.

701
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,000
You can.

702
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:44,840
Spray fight.

703
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,660
You can.

704
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:50,240
It's gonna be acid to break down a fucking body, dude.

705
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,500
No, as Tan is like reaching into the duffel bag

706
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:57,820
and about to touch one of the containers.

707
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:00,620
Yeah, no, go ahead and stop doing that, please.

708
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:03,140
If your stomach doesn't already hurt

709
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:06,020
from being aware of what we're about to do,

710
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:09,940
then I have the unfortunate pleasure to let you know that,

711
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,980
well, you can go ahead and read Harlan.

712
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:14,060
Your eyes look pretty big.

713
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:16,060
Go ahead and read that note there.

714
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:18,740
Okay, I read the note.

715
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,820
Yeah, I'll read the note to you

716
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:22,220
because there is no note for you to read.

717
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:24,420
How is it gonna talk to David?

718
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,140
Yeah, let me tell you what it says.

719
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:29,100
And it's a memo from Derringer, typed out on a typewriter.

720
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,420
He didn't even want this thing to hit the computer network

721
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:32,820
or be saved anywhere.

722
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:37,060
The tissue test came back on the muscle tissue

723
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:38,960
in Billy Ray's body.

724
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,860
And they're not really sure exactly what it is.

725
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:46,860
It's some sort of matter, extraterrestrial substance

726
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:50,140
that basically replaced his muscles.

727
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:52,020
And they're not sure exactly how it works,

728
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:54,620
but they've developed a detecting compound

729
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:56,800
that they've rushed together for you.

730
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,300
That's what's in the duffel bag.

731
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:01,820
You can spray it on things.

732
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:05,980
And when you spray it and it detects this matter,

733
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:08,180
things will turn purple.

734
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:09,380
Oh my God.

735
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:12,820
We're just gonna spray every folk in this town.

736
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:16,180
Yeah, Tan sprays his own arm.

737
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:17,620
Oh yeah, let's spray each other

738
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:19,140
and make sure we're all clean.

739
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,320
I spray everybody.

740
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,460
Okay.

741
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:28,460
Cindy, you did your nightly routine, right?

742
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:29,540
I did indeed.

743
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:30,380
Last night?

744
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:31,200
Yep.

745
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,300
Your entire face turns purple.

746
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:36,980
Harlan, you splashed water under your armpits

747
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:38,860
and threw on a fresh polo.

748
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:40,420
Your upper arms turn purple.

749
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:48,860
Anyone else that had a glass of water, I believe, up front,

750
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,080
your mouth, your lips,

751
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,940
the inside of your mouth turns purple.

752
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:53,900
Oh shit.

753
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,340
It's all over your hands

754
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:57,840
if you wash your hands after going to the bathroom.

755
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:01,060
Joe, I know that you stopped washing your hands

756
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:03,260
on purple hands years ago.

757
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,820
No, I said he used the bathroom.

758
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:08,160
I said he has a drink.

759
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,040
I don't know if surely he drank some water,

760
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,260
but we could also just have him back away in terror

761
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:13,100
from all of you.

762
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,760
It looks like they miscalculated.

763
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,320
It's just picking up sweat.

764
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,620
These are sweat glands, obviously.

765
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,940
Yeah, my face is really sweaty and purple.

766
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:24,380
Alien sweat glands, you son of a bitch.

767
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:27,900
I need two sanity rolls right now.

768
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:32,820
The first sanity roll is the fact that this stuff exists.

769
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:36,720
I had a fail and a crit fail.

770
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,660
The first one's a fail.

771
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:42,940
Okay, yeah, let's do the first one first.

772
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:45,760
On a fail on the first one, you're gonna take one.

773
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:48,840
I failed as well. Otherwise it's zero.

774
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,880
That's the unnatural though, so no check boxes for that.

775
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:54,320
The second though, realizing it's in your body

776
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,720
and the fact that to some extent,

777
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,120
you have ingested something in this town,

778
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,880
washed your hands in this town,

779
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,520
it's basically in the water supply.

780
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,680
You know that much so far.

781
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:12,020
Okay, that's gonna be one on a success, four on a failure.

782
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,380
And what about a crit fail?

783
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:18,480
I believe that is gonna be eight, no?

784
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,680
You can do whatever you want, dude.

785
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,800
I like that.

786
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,360
Think about, Tan, how you were sick

787
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:30,000
at the slightest sight of anything so far, right?

788
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,640
First, what was the, I forget the first time you puked.

789
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,600
Was it in?

790
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,480
It was at the office, the first video.

791
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,560
Was it the office, right?

792
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,400
Yeah.

793
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,720
Yeah, it was at the office the first video

794
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,600
and it got progressively worse

795
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:43,720
when you caught the smell of that dead body.

796
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,920
And now on your very first mission,

797
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:50,960
you recognize that it's not going particularly great for you.

798
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:54,800
So with taking eight sanity damage.

799
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,760
Right, I will say obvious.

800
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,200
Did you take one first?

801
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,040
Or did you pass that one?

802
00:30:59,040 --> 00:30:59,880
I did, I took one.

803
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:00,700
So you took nine total?

804
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:01,540
I took nine total.

805
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:02,440
Jeez Louise.

806
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:07,440
I am at 37 and my breaking point is 43.

807
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,360
Yeah.

808
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,480
So I'm quite a bit past that.

809
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,560
Okay, so technically- And I'm feeling good.

810
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,740
Yeah, feeling good, nothing happens.

811
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,900
Technically losing that five in a clip,

812
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:19,180
you're gonna go temporarily insane.

813
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:20,780
You can potentially suppress that

814
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:23,660
by projecting that onto one of your bonds

815
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:25,780
if you so choose or not.

816
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:27,340
You can just go temporarily insane.

817
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:28,180
It's totally up to you.

818
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:30,940
Tan really likes his bonds, so he just takes it himself.

819
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:33,180
Okay, all right, I'm gonna roll a die.

820
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:37,820
Your temporary insanity is going to manifest

821
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:40,340
in you fleeing.

822
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:44,220
Realizing this, you're just going to run away

823
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:47,180
from the hotel without saying much

824
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:48,160
while everyone else is there

825
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,260
also feeling pretty bad about things.

826
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:51,920
You just start to run away.

827
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,980
You will kind of come to after booking it,

828
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:57,060
losing your breath and kind of turn around

829
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:58,300
and be able to walk back.

830
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:03,300
Tan, he chokes down some vomit and then just runs away

831
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:07,260
and he runs right towards the mega deuce.

832
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:09,700
You run towards the mega deuce, okay?

833
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:12,340
Harlan hit a breaking point in that sanity loss also.

834
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:14,380
So did Joe Dean.

835
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:17,060
Well, I guess we all need to reset our breaking points.

836
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,340
I didn't hit a breaking point,

837
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:20,740
but I did lose five sanity.

838
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:21,740
Okay. Oh, shit.

839
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:26,400
Cindy is gonna submit, curl up,

840
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,820
just disconnect from everyone,

841
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,300
maybe go back into her room.

842
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,140
Oh, yeah.

843
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:32,140
Flashback to some of the crazy shit

844
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:33,780
she's seen in the field.

845
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:36,740
She goes to start a bath for herself

846
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:38,760
and as she goes to touch the knob

847
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,120
to turn the hot water on,

848
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:43,360
she like freaks out, hits the wall behind her.

849
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,400
And as she hits the wall behind her

850
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,800
in this small motel bathroom,

851
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:51,440
she sent into a flashback of her throwing her husband

852
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,560
up against the wall of a small motel bathroom.

853
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,160
And then she shakes her head

854
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,800
and goes and lays down in the bed.

855
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:03,800
Everyone else is going to have some anxiety going forward

856
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:08,200
when it comes to mealtime.

857
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:12,560
The thought of putting anything in your body at this point

858
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:16,840
is going to be somewhat anxiety provoking,

859
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,320
at least in the immediate term

860
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,280
before you seek any professional help.

861
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,520
As Tan runs towards the Megaduce,

862
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:26,960
that hits him and he gets scared again

863
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,120
and runs away from the Megaduce

864
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,520
because there's food there.

865
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:34,480
You've realized there's some substance out there

866
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,760
that got injected into Billy Ray,

867
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,400
presumably it's elsewhere in this town.

868
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,800
Clearly it's in the water supply

869
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,640
because it's on your hands, your face,

870
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,960
your mouth, your armpits.

871
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,640
Harlan's going to make eyes with Jodine.

872
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,640
It's in the water supply.

873
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,240
That makes sense now.

874
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,080
That's what we saw.

875
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,680
Right, shooting out of the tub.

876
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:03,040
I kind of fill in Tan and Cindy.

877
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:06,080
Real quick, I think that makes this the EPA's problem.

878
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:11,000
Also, Tan is just like wandering

879
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,960
around the parking lot right now.

880
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,800
Oh right, I forgot you were gone.

881
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,020
But it looked like mercury.

882
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,720
But it seemed conscious.

883
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:25,000
It seemed like it was moving of its own accord, right?

884
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,000
It seemed like some kind of unstoppable force to me.

885
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,340
I don't know.

886
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,560
I don't know if what I'd saw,

887
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:34,560
I'd call consciousness as we know it.

888
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:38,240
It dodged your glass.

889
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:41,160
It flattened itself out to break it, right?

890
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:43,400
Yeah, I guess that is pretty thoughty.

891
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,600
Or reactive at the very least.

892
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:48,200
Yeah, yeah.

893
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,340
Hey, I don't want to eat anything from the diner.

894
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:53,560
Should we get just a bunch of like little Debbie's and stuff

895
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,640
that comes in plastic from the gas station?

896
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,840
I want to hit the vending machine.

897
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,200
I'm parched.

898
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,200
The idea of not being able to drink the water here,

899
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,040
that scares me.

900
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:04,820
I need to top up.

901
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:05,720
Well, let's get you a Coke.

902
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:08,220
Everybody knows in 1992 that it's fat that makes you fat,

903
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,060
not sugar.

904
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:19,520
You can get some Olestra chips out of the vending machine.

905
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,360
You can do that though.

906
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:23,920
There is a vending machine right near the manager's office.

907
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,580
Soda, little Debbie's, little Dorito bags.

908
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:31,280
Harlan buys a Coke and he cracks the top on it

909
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:36,280
and he downs the Coke without it getting away from his lips.

910
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:39,900
And he tosses it in the trash can and buys two more.

911
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,800
A little thirsty there?

912
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,560
Yeah, I'm thirsty.

913
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,160
I don't want to drink the water here.

914
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,440
We can't drink the water here.

915
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,880
We can't drink the water here.

916
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:54,680
Yeah, I mean, that's a reasonable conclusion.

917
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:57,700
Would some of this mealtime anxiety be alleviated

918
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:00,000
when we do have like these prepackaged foods?

919
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,320
Yes, yes.

920
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:04,320
You feel safe enough that eating this,

921
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:08,140
it's more any food that someone else prepared for you.

922
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:10,120
Would be very suspicious to us.

923
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:12,560
Yeah, that is not a multinational corporation

924
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:16,440
trying to jack you full of low quality calories

925
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,300
through advertisement and other things.

926
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:21,360
Basically, you hate small business food providers.

927
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,520
That's kind of what I'm getting at.

928
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,760
No food trucks, no diners, you know.

929
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,800
All right, yeah, I love little things.

930
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,080
That tracks, dude.

931
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:32,000
So yeah, Joe Dean gets a couple sprites for himself.

932
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,160
He's like, yeah, maybe I will be thirsty, like Harland.

933
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,600
And then I guess they go back with the others.

934
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,840
Tan is in the parking lot.

935
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:43,280
He ran towards the Mega Deuce

936
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,440
and then ran away from the Mega Deuce.

937
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:49,520
And he's still got like one of the spray bottles in his hand

938
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,520
and he's just like spraying cars in the parking lot.

939
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:55,160
Well, hold Tan, Tan, Tan, Tan.

940
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,960
We don't want to go wasting that.

941
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,240
He stops spraying cars in the parking lot.

942
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:03,500
As you spray cars, there's not,

943
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,480
nothing's really turning purple.

944
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:08,460
Cindy Woodabaga walks out of her room,

945
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:11,560
moves her hands toward her cardigan

946
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,940
to kind of put her hands on her hips,

947
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:17,600
which reveals the baton and pepper spray she has

948
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:20,220
on either side on her belt.

949
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:24,260
And then she says, Merle.

950
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:28,200
So Cindy, we do need to talk to him,

951
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:31,060
but you know, you were talking earlier

952
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:33,020
about just taking him out.

953
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:35,560
I don't think we're quite at that place yet, are we?

954
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,580
We'll find out.

955
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:39,380
So Joe Dean has brought back some snacks

956
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:43,180
and he hands a candy bar to Cindy.

957
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:45,300
Here, have a Snickers.

958
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:47,220
You're not you when you're hungry.

959
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:50,300
Hey, that's a good, they should use that.

960
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,140
That's good.

961
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:52,340
No, that's nothing.

962
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:53,260
That won't ever be nothing.

963
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:54,780
She takes a couple of bites

964
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:57,040
and the camera whips back up to her face,

965
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:00,540
which has little granny glasses on it all of a sudden.

966
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:08,660
Took her down a couple notches, I think.

967
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:10,820
We just left Jane in that room, right?

968
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:11,660
You did.

969
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:12,780
Let's give her some food.

970
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:16,340
And this dude, the Delta Green, the FBI guy,

971
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:19,420
he took off once he gave us the duffel bag and the...

972
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:20,380
Yep.

973
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:21,580
He just bounced.

974
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:25,620
Woodabaga will go give some little debbies to young Jane.

975
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:27,900
Young Jane takes the little debbies

976
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,760
and just starts pounding them.

977
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:34,700
Much in the same way that Agent Nash just pounded that soda,

978
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:37,640
she does the same thing with the little debbies,

979
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:40,740
the Doritos, the Funyuns.

980
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:42,580
Whatever you put in front of her,

981
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:44,740
she just houses all of it.

982
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:46,860
She housed those Funyuns.

983
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:47,860
Housed them.

984
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:49,980
I've never heard that, but I like it.

985
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:50,820
Housing?

986
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:52,420
There's someone even in charge of it

987
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:53,260
at a government level.

988
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,500
You live in a house, Luke.

989
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,340
What do you...

990
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:58,740
You don't know that.

991
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:03,220
I was all for going to Merle,

992
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:05,060
but now that I've had the Snickers,

993
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:07,060
I'm up for whatever you guys are up for.

994
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:08,140
Well, we should just go to Merle,

995
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,820
but maybe not with murderous intent.

996
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:11,780
Man, it was just a baton and pepper spray.

997
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:13,020
During Cindy's rant,

998
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:15,080
you mentioned that Merle had been harassing people.

999
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,340
Did we get that from somebody?

1000
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:20,220
That is the giant leap that Cindy Woodabaga has drawn

1001
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:24,300
from someone was harassing Scott Adams,

1002
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:27,400
and she just assumes that it's the person

1003
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:31,380
who has the most money at risk and at stake.

1004
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:33,860
So what did we hear on that recording?

1005
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:35,060
It didn't matter.

1006
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:38,180
Billy Webb and something garbled,

1007
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:40,900
and then What Your Duty and something garbled,

1008
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:41,980
and they said, talk now.

1009
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:44,180
It sounded like a command, talk now.

1010
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:47,420
They also said, I'm sorry, I'm talking like Clark.

1011
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:50,760
I've been John for at least an episode and a half.

1012
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:54,480
And that ending, it said Tone Brown.

1013
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,740
It wasn't actually Brown Tone.

1014
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:57,220
Do your voice though, I like your voice.

1015
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:58,740
It was Tone Brown.

1016
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:01,740
Tone Brown and Duty.

1017
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:03,340
Do you see how that means nothing?

1018
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:04,380
Well, what did you hear?

1019
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:06,460
We literally heard someone saying,

1020
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:09,780
not sure what you're dealing with, but stop now.

1021
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:10,620
Stop now.

1022
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:11,440
Yeah.

1023
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,280
Stop now.

1024
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,120
Not sure what you're dealing.

1025
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:13,940
Stop now, stop now.

1026
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:15,840
You're not sure what you're dealing with, stop now.

1027
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,600
That makes a lot more sense, doesn't it?

1028
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,660
So it does.

1029
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:20,120
Putting our notes together,

1030
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,940
one of the things I got was talk now.

1031
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:23,760
So you're hearing stop now.

1032
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,160
Yes, we probably just heard it right.

1033
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,080
Don't you think?

1034
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,320
Yeah, I mean, it's almost like we failed a role

1035
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,140
and you passed it.

1036
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:32,120
And I don't wanna, obviously role-playing wise,

1037
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:32,960
it'd be great if we just-

1038
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:33,800
No, I know it's hard for-

1039
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,240
I can't believe in that.

1040
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:37,160
But I was wondering if we could put anything together

1041
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,960
from it and really glean the truth.

1042
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:39,800
Yeah, sure.

1043
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:40,620
If you wanna try-

1044
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:41,460
But we do gotta keep this moving.

1045
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:43,680
Adult men can never admit that they're wrong.

1046
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:47,680
Yeah, yeah.

1047
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,120
Thank you, Cindy, you're right.

1048
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,060
We heard it right.

1049
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,920
I believe that's a mundane day.

1050
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:01,340
So at least two of you heard it right.

1051
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:04,680
Let's recap where you are now.

1052
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:07,240
You've already gone and questioned

1053
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,760
the mother of the missing girl,

1054
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:11,900
who you have found and just happens to be very pregnant.

1055
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,100
You've talked to the sheriff.

1056
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:14,840
You've talked to one of the aldermen.

1057
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:18,480
You've talked to the guy who runs the only bar

1058
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,480
with a liquor license in town.

1059
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,280
You've talked to a bunch of random kids at the reservoir.

1060
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:27,400
You've talked to the manager of this hotel.

1061
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,000
We've gotten a lot done.

1062
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:29,840
You got a lot done.

1063
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:32,560
You've talked to, this is only a 1200 person town

1064
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,960
and you're starting to near the double digit percentage

1065
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,360
of people interrogated.

1066
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,800
We're good cops.

1067
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:40,640
Yeah, we are.

1068
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:43,000
Yeah, you should just line the rest up

1069
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,680
and we just go down the line.

1070
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:48,400
And we'll parade Jane Allen in front of them.

1071
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,380
Shame.

1072
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:51,960
Where do you wanna go?

1073
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,020
It's an investigation.

1074
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:53,860
Merle.

1075
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:56,600
Yeah, I think that's our last big.

1076
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,020
He's the papa.

1077
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:58,860
You wanna go to Merle?

1078
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:01,680
Billy is not that child's father.

1079
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,120
Oh, you think Merle is?

1080
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,640
No, I think it's aliens.

1081
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,840
Yeah, I think it's aliens too.

1082
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,880
That does bring up an interesting question.

1083
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,940
What do we do with Jane?

1084
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:13,600
We have to kill her.

1085
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,680
That's literally not what I was thinking.

1086
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,040
Well, that's why you guys are friendlies

1087
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,080
and we're the agents.

1088
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:20,560
Okay, I was thinking maybe.

1089
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,920
She kinda puts her hands on Tanner's shoulder

1090
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:26,480
and is like, we have to kill her.

1091
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:31,000
No, we don't have to do that.

1092
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:31,840
Okay.

1093
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:32,680
What?

1094
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:33,500
Then what is your solution?

1095
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:35,960
I was thinking maybe we bring her back

1096
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:38,100
to her parents' house.

1097
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:40,800
And then how would you explain the pregnancy?

1098
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,040
We let them explain it to us.

1099
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,360
This is a real 12 Angry Men situation

1100
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:47,840
and we got Harlan quick.

1101
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:51,080
I'm still leaning towards parading her down Main Street

1102
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:53,160
and seeing who gets pissed off about it.

1103
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:55,480
Your two options are taking her back to her loving parents

1104
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,540
or publicly humiliating her,

1105
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:59,560
but never killing her and the aliens

1106
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:00,660
spawn inside of her.

1107
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:01,840
I don't wanna kill her,

1108
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:04,480
but she's got an alien baby in her,

1109
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,360
which basically makes her an alien.

1110
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:08,340
So I don't know if she can feel human emotions.

1111
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:10,660
So who cares if we parade her downtown?

1112
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:12,480
I just think the optics are bad.

1113
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:13,560
I don't think we can-

1114
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:15,400
Yeah, use that same mindset.

1115
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,480
But what we can say is that we're gonna do it

1116
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:18,960
and then let everybody line up.

1117
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,440
Here's the deal, the optics don't matter

1118
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:22,480
because we're not supposed to even be here.

1119
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,720
So nobody's gonna hear.

1120
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:25,720
What, no, just because, no.

1121
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:28,160
Agent Dean, would you like to pull rank?

1122
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:31,960
All I'm saying is I suggested that you told me not to.

1123
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:34,240
I have accepted that we're not gonna do that.

1124
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:37,960
So what, I mean, what, we leave her in the hotel.

1125
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:40,720
I say drop her with me and see.

1126
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:41,560
That's what we're saying.

1127
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:43,240
I say drop her with Nancy.

1128
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:48,480
What if we use our car phone to call our handler

1129
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:49,840
and see what he advises?

1130
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:52,240
He said not to call him.

1131
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:53,080
Oh, I thought he said,

1132
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:55,040
do call me if you have any trouble.

1133
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:55,880
Cause it wouldn't be handy-

1134
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:58,200
He said they would only use a courier.

1135
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,200
We should have talked to him.

1136
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:02,240
We should have sent a message to him.

1137
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,080
Wait!

1138
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,280
He's like, so gone.

1139
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,220
We hop in the Bronco and tear off after him.

1140
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:12,440
No.

1141
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:19,400
She was fine in there for the last day, right?

1142
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,020
What if we threw in some snack foods

1143
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:21,960
and figured this out later?

1144
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:25,280
She is going to punch someone's head off.

1145
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,400
No, I don't think she is.

1146
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,480
She doesn't seem to have the muscle stuff going on.

1147
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,280
She's just got the alien baby.

1148
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:35,000
That thing is going to put itself in someone's head

1149
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,640
if what you told me was true happened in that bathroom.

1150
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:41,680
And then that thing is going to kill someone.

1151
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,240
You know, I'm not going to disagree with you there.

1152
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:44,440
That does seem, yeah.

1153
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:48,520
We have to stamp it out at the root.

1154
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:49,880
Oh, I don't like Delta Green.

1155
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:52,160
I refuse to be a part of this.

1156
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,480
I refuse to be part of this.

1157
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,480
I'll talk to Merle all day long,

1158
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,040
but I'm not killing,

1159
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:00,420
even if it's an alien, I'm not killing the baby.

1160
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:01,880
You don't have to.

1161
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:02,860
That's what I'm saying.

1162
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:03,700
I'm not going to.

1163
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:04,920
Go home.

1164
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:06,040
I'm going to go talk to Merle.

1165
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:09,920
You, Tanner leaves the room

1166
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:13,960
and just like sits down on the sidewalk outside the motel

1167
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:15,420
and it's like fucked up.

1168
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:18,280
Jodine follows him out and sits down next to him.

1169
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:21,200
And he lights a cigarette and offers it to Tanner.

1170
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:25,660
Tanner accepts and also pulls out his own pack of cigarettes

1171
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:26,840
and lights one up.

1172
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:28,000
What's your brand?

1173
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,660
He smokes Palmalls.

1174
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:31,120
Yeah, me too.

1175
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:35,040
Yeah, Palmall extra, extra red long

1176
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,720
for seven teams.

1177
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:37,800
Oh my God.

1178
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:41,680
So Jodine takes a real deep sigh

1179
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,720
and then a deep drag on the cigarette.

1180
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:44,560
And he says,

1181
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:48,360
I've had this moment too.

1182
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:51,480
Well, in what sense?

1183
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:52,800
Something real similar happened

1184
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,120
on my first time as a friendly.

1185
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:56,740
I'm not having a good time.

1186
00:45:56,740 --> 00:45:58,160
It's not a good time.

1187
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:59,200
Nobody said it would be.

1188
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:00,680
Do you want to kill that girl?

1189
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:01,840
Do you want to kill that baby?

1190
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:04,200
I don't want to kill that baby, but we have to.

1191
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:10,100
Tanner, what's inside that girl's belly

1192
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,440
is a danger to the entire world.

1193
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:15,320
Our participation in this organization

1194
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:17,760
is kind of precipitated on that understanding.

1195
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,520
Tanner is literally just like frowning

1196
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,360
and like dry crying.

1197
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:24,960
And not only does she have to die at Tanner,

1198
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:29,960
but if you don't get along with that picture,

1199
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,720
Cindy's gonna kill you too.

1200
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:32,560
What?

1201
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:35,220
Cindy's gonna kill me?

1202
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,100
She's nice though.

1203
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:40,100
We have tattoos together.

1204
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:41,600
Cindy's not nice.

1205
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:43,160
I'm not gonna do it.

1206
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:45,880
I won't stop you from doing it, but I'm not gonna do it.

1207
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:47,580
That's all we're saying.

1208
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:48,420
Oh, actually, yeah.

1209
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:49,720
You know, you are the youngest rookie.

1210
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:53,140
So you do have, sorry, I forgot the Delta green haze.

1211
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:57,680
You actually do have to kill this alien baby.

1212
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:59,840
There are rules in place, yeah.

1213
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:01,800
So when you guys look up from this conversation,

1214
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:04,880
you see, hopefully, as long as it's cool with you, David,

1215
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:09,700
Cindy walking this girl, Jane Allen, huddled over.

1216
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:13,060
She's got a couple cardigans on this girl,

1217
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:16,020
maybe even the comforter off the motel bed

1218
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:17,280
wrapped around her.

1219
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:21,400
And she's gonna walk her out to the Bronco.

1220
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:24,240
Wait, what about,

1221
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:26,720
and it goes against my Christian faith to say this,

1222
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:30,320
but what about an alien abortion?

1223
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:35,320
I think that it would look really cool

1224
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:39,040
in one of those hardcore metal fonts

1225
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:42,120
where you can't really read what it says.

1226
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:43,280
Yeah, it would be.

1227
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:44,760
We were talking junkie graveyard.

1228
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:46,920
It's junkie graveyard, alien abortion.

1229
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:48,880
These are good things.

1230
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:50,360
Good name.

1231
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:55,240
No, but surely there's a crooked doctor around here,

1232
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:59,480
a midwife who, I mean, look, these, I had a baby.

1233
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:01,680
Does that mean you know how to?

1234
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:04,240
We're in some dangerous territory right here.

1235
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:06,560
This doesn't feel like it was already iffy

1236
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:08,920
when we were killing somebody.

1237
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:10,920
Okay, hold on, hold on.

1238
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:15,520
I know, but you're really like, let's just kill her

1239
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:18,440
instead of trying to save her life at all.

1240
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:20,600
I think that's kind of a Delta Green thing,

1241
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:21,760
isn't it, to cover up?

1242
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:22,840
We gotta cover it, dude.

1243
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:25,680
Okay, but then you can't call the episode alien abortion.

1244
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:30,960
Tan is having like a serious-

1245
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:32,360
I can.

1246
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:35,120
I can call the episode whatever I want, Thomas.

1247
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:40,360
Tan is having like a serious like mental breakdown.

1248
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:43,880
When he sees Cindy Woodabaga walking Jane out,

1249
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:48,880
he's like crying and he pulls the 44 off his hip

1250
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:53,480
and like looks at Joe and like aims it at Jane

1251
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:57,280
and is like looking for some sort of approval.

1252
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,880
Yeah, Joe lowers your hand.

1253
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:02,680
I don't trust you not to wing Woodabaga

1254
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:04,820
and then she would kill you.

1255
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:07,880
Yeah, Tan breaks down once again and just starts crying.

1256
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:10,880
You just seem a little shaky in your gun hand right now.

1257
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:12,400
Cindy will get behind the wheel of the car.

1258
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:16,640
This whole time, Harlan has been kinda solemn into himself,

1259
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:20,300
but he is definitely walking toward the Bronco

1260
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:21,440
with no objection.

1261
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:24,640
Kid, why don't you and I go talk to Merle?

1262
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:27,760
We'll take the DEA, the DEA cruiser.

1263
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:31,400
Yeah.

1264
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:34,200
We go out to the middle of a field,

1265
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:37,300
outside of town where there's no one in sight.

1266
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:40,760
And her water breaks and you have to-

1267
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:44,480
You have to deliver the squid, baby.

1268
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,720
It's minute black, it's minute black.

1269
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:49,580
I'm not gonna make you roll on that.

1270
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:51,260
Can we just do the thing and they do a movie

1271
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:54,020
sometimes where it's now a shot at the top of trees

1272
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:56,940
and there's the birds fly off, a bunch of birds fly.

1273
00:49:58,460 --> 00:49:59,860
Sure, yes.

1274
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:02,240
Just the crack in the distance.

1275
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:06,380
And then it cuts abruptly to the two of you at town hall,

1276
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:09,940
rolling up in that sick DEA cruiser,

1277
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:14,180
the self-driving Knight Rider DEA cruiser.

1278
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:15,980
You've not been using that functionality

1279
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:16,860
for whatever reason.

1280
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:20,180
You have arrived at city hall.

1281
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:21,020
Thank you, CopNet.

1282
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:24,220
Does this have that brand new CopNet feature in it?

1283
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:26,540
Yeah, I think it does, but really the main,

1284
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:29,340
the shining beauty of this particular model

1285
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:31,060
is the garphone.

1286
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:32,140
Hey, have you eaten anything?

1287
00:50:32,140 --> 00:50:32,980
Are you hungry?

1288
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:34,660
I was gonna go to the mecaduce,

1289
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:37,540
but it scared me to even think about doing that.

1290
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:39,220
I hand him a couple of moon pies.

1291
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:42,340
I eat both of them very quickly.

1292
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:43,160
Great.

1293
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:46,140
And then I look at myself in like the mirror

1294
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:49,100
and see is there like still purple around my mouth?

1295
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:50,940
You could have wiped it off if you wanted to

1296
00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:52,660
or you can just walk around with that.

1297
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:55,660
There is still purple around my mouth and I wipe it off.

1298
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:56,620
And I guess theoretically,

1299
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:58,660
as your tears were streaming down earlier,

1300
00:50:58,660 --> 00:50:59,620
as you were crying,

1301
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:03,380
I've got like contact purple like streaks down my face.

1302
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:05,660
A purple rain, if you will, down your face.

1303
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:08,340
30 seconds of silence for Prince.

1304
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:12,220
Fingerprints.

1305
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:13,220
I barely knew him.

1306
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:15,360
I'm surprised.

1307
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:20,360
I'm surprised you didn't do any of that with Ryker yet.

1308
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:26,700
Tan wipes the purple off his face and just looks over at Joe

1309
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:31,420
and well, should we?

1310
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:33,480
No, I kind of just wanted you to calm down.

1311
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:36,260
I don't think their business is gonna take too long.

1312
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:39,140
Why don't you eat another moon pie

1313
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:41,540
and we'll wait for them to roll back into town.

1314
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:43,660
After eating two moon pies,

1315
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:46,620
he takes a third one and just like eats the marshmallow

1316
00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:50,460
out of the middle and then contently sits there.

1317
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:53,380
You're gonna wait until they finish their business

1318
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:55,260
out of town and presumably meet you there?

1319
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:58,020
As soon as he eats the marshmallow out of the middle,

1320
00:51:58,020 --> 00:52:01,540
they hear a very distant faint gunshot.

1321
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:05,660
Okay, they catch up to you.

1322
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:06,980
You wait long enough,

1323
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:10,220
a Ford Bronco comes speeding into town.

1324
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:14,940
Cindy has dirt all over her cardigans.

1325
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:18,180
Yeah, Harland's not as disheveled.

1326
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:20,420
He's obviously tried to clean himself up a little bit

1327
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:21,260
before getting here.

1328
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:24,660
You see some really like dirty shovels in the back.

1329
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:26,820
Joe takes Cindy aside.

1330
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:28,620
How did Harland do?

1331
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:29,560
He did great.

1332
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:32,100
You eliminated Jane and the Vector.

1333
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:35,500
Vector one down, 1,199 to go.

1334
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:38,960
All right, well, the kid calmed down.

1335
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:40,300
He's doing all right,

1336
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:42,460
but we're gonna have to keep an eye on him.

1337
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:45,220
All right, well, let's get going on to Merle's.

1338
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:47,020
When you go back to the car,

1339
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:49,560
you find Tan just like cleaning,

1340
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:52,660
like taking apart and cleaning his 44.

1341
00:52:52,660 --> 00:52:53,900
He's prepared himself.

1342
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:56,540
Should we go to his house or to his office?

1343
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:58,500
Well, they said the aldermen never leave work.

1344
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:00,420
Oh, he's an aldermen, that's right.

1345
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:02,380
And that's where you met us.

1346
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:04,060
So I get out of the car

1347
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:06,100
and I go ring the doorbell of City Hall.

1348
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:12,100
Where we are greeted by, what was her name?

1349
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:13,020
Jennifer Kahn.

1350
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:15,380
Jennifer Kahn.

1351
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:16,220
Got it.

1352
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:19,020
Yep, she's there at the front desk.

1353
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:19,860
Just chilling.

1354
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:22,140
I go pee real quick just in case, you know.

1355
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:24,340
Hey, there's a bathroom right there.

1356
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:25,300
Yes, just in case.

1357
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:27,700
You are more than welcome to go to the bathroom.

1358
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:28,540
And there's still a water.

1359
00:53:28,540 --> 00:53:30,420
Should I role play this out?

1360
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:31,700
He walks into the bathroom.

1361
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:32,980
Do you wash your hands?

1362
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:35,140
He does not.

1363
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:37,500
In for a penny, in for a pound.

1364
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:39,780
In fairness, he didn't wash his hands

1365
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:41,300
the first time you were in town hall

1366
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:44,000
and then you shook hands with Bradley Allen

1367
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,280
and it was wet and then you tried to lie.

1368
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:48,560
It was horrible.

1369
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:49,800
And he saw right through it.

1370
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:52,100
Cindy loved that so much.

1371
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:55,680
So everyone at this point is assuming

1372
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:56,720
you didn't wash your hands.

1373
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:59,160
So, you know, the aspect of the role play

1374
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:01,400
is strictly if you want to make peace with the fact

1375
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:03,560
that maybe you should start washing your hands

1376
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:05,680
now that you have this stuff all over you.

1377
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:09,080
He thinks about it, but then he just like

1378
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:11,800
imagines purple flowing out of the sink

1379
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:13,280
and he's like, no.

1380
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:14,880
While you guys are waiting for him

1381
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:15,800
to get back from the bathroom,

1382
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:18,200
you look over and Harlan is gulping down

1383
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:19,360
from the water fountain.

1384
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:24,040
Harlan.

1385
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:25,520
Harlan, Harlan, bud, bud, hey.

1386
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:26,360
Oh, shit.

1387
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:27,200
Oh, damn it.

1388
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:28,560
Oh, and he starts wiping his mouth.

1389
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:30,520
Sorry, I forgot.

1390
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:31,360
Fuck.

1391
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:32,360
Here, have another Coke.

1392
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:34,320
Yeah.

1393
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:35,640
Did you like Pavlov-ing him?

1394
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:39,280
Gentlemen, the receptionist sees you.

1395
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:41,680
Merle, Merle, we need Merle.

1396
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:43,480
Let me, let me go get him.

1397
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:46,160
Is there like a directory,

1398
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:49,200
like a map directory thing on the wall anywhere?

1399
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:51,000
All their offices are downstairs.

1400
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,800
So you, if you remember,

1401
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:55,760
you're going between the offices to see, you know,

1402
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:57,680
which one had the evasive answers,

1403
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:00,080
which one had the direct answers.

1404
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:01,600
Those are all downstairs.

1405
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:03,560
And there's actually one for each of the aldermen

1406
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:05,280
that were mentioned kind of in that note.

1407
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:07,800
So Merle has one, Bradley Allen.

1408
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:10,160
So Jane's father had another,

1409
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:12,880
that was the room you were in where he used his computer.

1410
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:14,800
So that's one hallway downstairs.

1411
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:18,400
Upstairs is like the conference room,

1412
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:21,480
the big boardroom where all of like the aldermen

1413
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:23,400
kind of bigger meetings happen.

1414
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,480
And then kind of the other side of town hall

1415
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:28,280
are the municipal things like the county court

1416
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:29,400
and things like that.

1417
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:31,880
Cindy pushes past Jennifer Kahn and says,

1418
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:33,840
we know the way, sweetie, it's okay.

1419
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:36,200
No, no, please don't.

1420
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:37,200
No, no, no.

1421
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,320
We actually like to talk to all the aldermen.

1422
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:40,520
I know they're very busy.

1423
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:42,680
It seems like they almost do nothing but work,

1424
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:44,520
but we should have to take a moment of their time.

1425
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:47,160
Do you guys wanna all flash our badges at the same time?

1426
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:48,000
Yeah.

1427
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,840
And we all flash our badges at the same time.

1428
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:50,680
Flip, flip.

1429
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:51,520
US Marshall.

1430
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:52,360
I-T-A.

1431
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:53,200
The E-A.

1432
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:56,200
And what bureau are you with, remind us?

1433
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:59,800
Oh, was that the, that was the county of Grover?

1434
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:02,200
You're not in a bureau, that's right.

1435
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:04,720
Okay, well, Cindy, lead the way.

1436
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,600
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

1437
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:08,600
I'm gonna have to ask you to not.

1438
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:10,200
All right, thank you.

1439
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,000
Just to freak her out a little bit,

1440
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,300
he remembers the name of the color of lipstick

1441
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:17,320
that he found in her purse.

1442
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:20,840
And he's like, oh, yeah.

1443
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:22,720
That's so fucking creepy.

1444
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:26,040
Coral reef looks real good on you.

1445
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:30,240
And she just gets really, really quiet.

1446
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:31,520
And we turn and walk.

1447
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:33,120
And your arm too, right?

1448
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:34,120
We have arms.

1449
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:35,040
You're also, you're-

1450
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:35,880
Two of them.

1451
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:40,360
In my hand, I have my Magnum 40.

1452
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:44,060
Oh my God, so much worse now.

1453
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,080
That you demon put away

1454
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:47,760
while you're going to the bathroom.

1455
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:49,280
He's just kind of like,

1456
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:52,880
he's like scratching his temple with like the muzzle.

1457
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:55,480
And he's like, wow, Coral looks real good on you.

1458
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:57,080
Oh, I hate it.

1459
00:56:57,080 --> 00:57:00,560
A little drip of piss falls off the barrel of the gun.

1460
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:03,440
Jesus Christ.

1461
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:05,640
Because you pissed in the barrel?

1462
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:07,680
I was holding the gun while I pissed

1463
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:09,840
and it just got a little bit on there.

1464
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:11,200
Oh, we've all been there.

1465
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:15,480
Plaques, go embarrass yourself before this is over.

1466
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:19,360
So you sufficiently freak her out.

1467
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:21,920
She stops in her tracks silently.

1468
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:24,760
Why don't you lead the way, Ms. Khan?

1469
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:25,600
I thought we were gonna-

1470
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:26,920
I said we knew where we were going.

1471
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:28,800
Yeah, we're going to Merle's office.

1472
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:30,360
Cindy.

1473
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:31,200
Are we going to Merle's office?

1474
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:32,760
I just feel like she's kind of on his end.

1475
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:34,440
They're all upstairs.

1476
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:35,920
The offices are all empty.

1477
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:37,160
They all seem to be upstairs.

1478
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:39,600
Just like last night, if you remember.

1479
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:41,840
Bradley Allen came down from that room

1480
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:43,480
and based on what she said here,

1481
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:45,240
she's saying like they're upstairs.

1482
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:46,080
Yeah, we go upstairs.

1483
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:47,440
Yeah, we go upstairs.

1484
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:48,440
Okay.

1485
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:50,560
You get to the conference room.

1486
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:53,140
It's double doors, double wooden doors,

1487
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:56,560
labeled Aldermen Conference Room.

1488
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:57,720
Pretty straightforward.

1489
00:57:57,720 --> 00:57:59,320
Hello, Aldermans.

1490
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:00,440
Should we knock?

1491
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:02,360
No, the door's open, we walk in.

1492
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:05,240
Okay.

1493
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:06,400
You walk in and you see a couple.

1494
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:07,400
And I knock anyway.

1495
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:10,400
You knock as you walk in.

1496
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:11,240
It's polite.

1497
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:13,240
Yeah, and I ring the doorbell and ring, ring.

1498
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:16,540
It is polite to call ahead, in particular,

1499
00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:18,600
when you're ambushing a bunch of Aldermen.

1500
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:21,200
Especially in this instance,

1501
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:23,380
because as you open the door,

1502
00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:26,000
you notice presumably what the conference table was

1503
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,720
in the middle of the room has been hacked into pieces.

1504
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:30,400
And those pieces have been put up,

1505
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:32,600
basically boarding up the walls.

1506
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:35,080
All the bookshelves are turned over.

1507
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:38,480
The bookshelves are also used to block the windows.

1508
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:41,880
There's very little light coming into this room.

1509
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:43,160
And in the center of the room,

1510
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:48,120
occupying almost half the floor is a big pile of goo.

1511
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:52,920
And that big pile of goo has about eight bodies

1512
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:54,720
extending out of it.

1513
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:58,220
You see legs kind of coming out of the bottom,

1514
00:58:58,220 --> 00:59:00,900
some arms, a few heads.

1515
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:03,580
They look like suited humans,

1516
00:59:03,580 --> 00:59:06,180
just stuck in this pile of goo.

1517
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:08,260
And this is a metallic goo,

1518
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:12,300
very similar to the stuff from the water supply.

1519
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:13,680
And outside of that,

1520
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:15,780
the only other thing you see in this room

1521
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:18,080
is a very high-tech looking computer,

1522
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:21,580
up against the wall, plugged in,

1523
00:59:21,580 --> 00:59:24,180
and also wired into the internet,

1524
00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:27,240
in a giant pile of metallic goo.

1525
00:59:28,220 --> 00:59:31,740
Uh, excuse me, Aldermen,

1526
00:59:31,740 --> 00:59:33,040
could we interrupt your meeting

1527
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:34,540
to ask you a few questions?

1528
00:59:34,540 --> 00:59:39,540
I gotta work in the morning,

1529
00:59:50,340 --> 00:59:53,240
and this shit's so important,

1530
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:55,840
so I can't get high.

1531
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:57,300
Can't get high.

1532
00:59:57,300 --> 00:59:59,560
No, I can't get high.

1533
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:00,900
Can't get high.

1534
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:06,900
I thought this stuff helped anxiety.

1535
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:09,900
It must be something inside of me.

1536
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:13,900
Does anybody know why?

1537
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:17,900
I can't get high.
