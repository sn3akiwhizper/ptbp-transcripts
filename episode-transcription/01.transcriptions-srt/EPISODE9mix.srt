1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,320
Hello to all my friends and all my enemies, it's your boy Wolf the Dog growling at you

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:12,420
from Contention's best radio station, 694.2 PTBP.

3
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:17,200
It's time for our first segment, the unveiling of Howlin' with Wolf, where we get to hear

4
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:21,600
from y'all, my pups, my babies, my children.

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,540
I'm only doing this out of the love in my big ole wolf heart, sharing airtime, fuck,

6
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:29,460
but my pups are that important.

7
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,100
Alright let's kick it off with this one from an anonymous listener.

8
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,340
Dear V-cell, do not enter the mirror room.

9
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:39,560
Do not let John enter the mirror room.

10
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,500
Destroy the mirror room.

11
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,340
Destroy Orotech.

12
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,020
Destroy John.

13
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:46,540
Destroy the world.

14
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:50,140
Dear V-cell, nothing is real and everything is alive.

15
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:53,260
The end has come and will come and come again.

16
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:55,300
Find my bones, hear it and see.

17
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,660
No, wait for me.

18
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:59,780
I'm coming, but time moves so slowly.

19
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:06,140
Wow, uh, that's uh, that's real something y'all.

20
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:11,220
So if you want me to read whatever crazy horseshit you gotta say, submit a 5 star review on your

21
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:17,880
podcast app, screenshot that shit and send it to us, or tag us on social media, at pretending

22
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,880
pod on instagram and twitter, pretending to be people on facebook.

23
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,780
Now let's hear some news y'all.

24
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:29,840
Last time, the roving gang of tunnel vision cops left Mildred Mitchell, sans granddaughter

25
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,620
and information.

26
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:36,020
They went to Forgotten Treasures and bullied the nice lady there until she put her own

27
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:40,660
life in danger by telling the cops about the drunk man who threatened her.

28
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:45,660
Upon leaving, the white Toyota they'd been searching for peeled out onto the road.

29
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:51,860
After a short, dangerous pursuit, Keith Vigna gunned down Charles Donovan and John Lee Pettymore

30
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:56,900
fired warning shots into the air as well as Clark's tires, and they found a bald man

31
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,580
tied up in that old trunk.

32
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:01,500
I'm surprised they didn't shoot this old boy too.

33
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:07,300
Keith is riding with the bald man to the clinic as he is unconscious and in critical condition.

34
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:11,860
Wolf wants his pack to keep this old boy in your singing bowls.

35
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:20,860
Now rub your hands together so fast it makes a weird sound for kudzu with no backbone.

36
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:44,780
Is he still bound in that chain?

37
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:47,820
I'm gonna try to take the chain off and put like actual handcuffs on him.

38
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:48,820
Okay good.

39
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:49,820
Zip tie.

40
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:50,820
Citizen's arrest style.

41
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,820
You can never break the chain.

42
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:56,700
Alright Keith you are in the ambulance.

43
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:03,620
You have replaced Billy Harrison's chain with handcuffs and you guys are heading to the

44
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:04,620
clinic.

45
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:09,860
I want to ask one of the paramedics back there, hey is there anything you know maybe for this

46
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:14,940
pain in my foot so maybe I can I know I'm supposed to keep off of it but you know in

47
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,800
case I ever need to be on it like stay in the pain.

48
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,320
No pun intended.

49
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:26,360
I don't I don't know if I'm supposed to just give out medication.

50
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,520
Who's gonna get you in trouble?

51
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,960
I'm a police officer.

52
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,200
I'm gonna get you in trouble.

53
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,200
I'm a police officer.

54
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,040
Gotcha bitch.

55
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:41,880
Are you saying this to a terrified like 19 year old EMT?

56
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,360
Roll Persuade.

57
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,360
Nice.

58
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,480
13 on a 70.

59
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,560
Oh my god.

60
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,080
Um yeah okay just uh.

61
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,920
Shh this is our secret.

62
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:03,600
Like the crazed look in your eye right now is like you actually are like intimidating

63
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,680
some of your drugs.

64
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,160
You look so scary.

65
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,800
Yeah I guess you could.

66
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,880
And he reaches into a bag of pills.

67
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,800
Yeah he just pulls out a handful.

68
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,800
He's like take one to four of these.

69
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,120
What did they do?

70
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,000
Roll a D4 and see how many you take.

71
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I take D6 again.

72
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,560
I'm a cheater.

73
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,560
Take one.

74
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,360
I take one.

75
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,360
What does it do?

76
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,640
It's not effective when you take one.

77
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,640
It's Oxycontin.

78
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:41,680
He just gives you like a bottle full of Oxycontin.

79
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,600
Can I want to ask you if I take these?

80
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,800
I'm thinking I probably get a plus to something and a minus to something if I take one.

81
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,800
Yeah.

82
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,760
Can you tell me what that is right now before I take one?

83
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:55,760
So your trap rap game is now off the hook.

84
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:00,600
I am the least knowledgeable about prescription drugs but if he's actually in pain won't it

85
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,720
do good more than it does detriment?

86
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,040
Like it'll attack pain receptors?

87
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,760
It'll do more good for the pain than...

88
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,760
But I don't think...

89
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,760
But he's gonna be...

90
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,760
Like he's not using it recreationally.

91
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,760
I'm gonna be on Oxycontin.

92
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:16,520
He's gonna be like every housewife you know but don't realize.

93
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,440
They're all so happy.

94
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,440
Fake happy.

95
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,720
Who does that?

96
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,720
Fake happy.

97
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,720
Don't worry.

98
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,720
Oh shit.

99
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,720
Fake happy.

100
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,680
Okay I'm looking up the side effects of Oxycontin.

101
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,680
Like you'll be loopy right?

102
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,680
Yeah you'll be a bit loopy.

103
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,680
You'll be a little scratchy.

104
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,280
Kind of a little bit of a goof.

105
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,280
And maybe sleepy.

106
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,680
I mean like if I take like one...

107
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,680
Fake happy is by Paramore.

108
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,680
Okay.

109
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,680
Awesome.

110
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:50,400
Common side effects of Oxycontin include constipation, nausea, stomach pain, loss of appetite, vomiting,

111
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,960
sleepiness, tiredness, drowsiness, dizziness, lightheadedness, weakness, itching, headache,

112
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,200
dry mouth, sweating, and decreases the ability to feel pain.

113
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,040
Ask your doctor if you want some.

114
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:08,520
Okay I'll keep these for later but I'm probably gonna take them all the time sparingly.

115
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,240
Alright Clark and John what do you guys want to do?

116
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,920
Check out Dr. Marie Jacobs.

117
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,680
See where she fits into this mystery.

118
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,840
What was the doctor's scrubs we got?

119
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,840
Zaboomafoo?

120
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,840
Zabrowski.

121
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,840
Dr. Zaboomafoo.

122
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,480
Doctor between the lions.

123
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:26,660
Dr. Marie Jacobs was she in contention or was she in the city?

124
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,660
She's in contention.

125
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:28,660
Do I know her?

126
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:29,660
Have I heard of her?

127
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,280
Do I know anything about her?

128
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,280
She's Clark's ex-wife.

129
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,780
No you probably wouldn't have any reason to know her.

130
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:42,100
She's got a private practice and that's all you know about her.

131
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,760
Family practitioner.

132
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:50,620
You do have an address and she lives in the suburbs which is in the northeast part of

133
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,620
town.

134
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,100
Are you taking both vehicles there?

135
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,100
Probably yeah.

136
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,100
Let's get a burger first.

137
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,100
Okay.

138
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,100
What is the burger place called?

139
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,100
Burgatory?

140
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:02,380
It's on the other side of the highway.

141
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,540
It's like five minutes out of your way if you want to hop up there and grab a burger.

142
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:06,540
Yeah.

143
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,540
Yeah.

144
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:12,060
I kind of need a, you know, in the salon I work you can't take like too many mental

145
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:16,300
health days off, but I need a mental health hour after watching Charles explode all over

146
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,300
that work.

147
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,300
For sure.

148
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,300
Frosty root beer.

149
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,300
That might soak me all right.

150
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,300
All right.

151
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:28,400
So you guys grab some grub and then you head down back into town into the, yeah.

152
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,400
Number one.

153
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,400
Burger.

154
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,200
Oh, I'll have that.

155
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,840
Number two.

156
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,840
Vegan burger.

157
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,840
We have a vegan burger.

158
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,840
Absolutely not that.

159
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,840
Yeah.

160
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,840
I already ordered some.

161
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,840
I'm not reading anymore.

162
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,840
Number three.

163
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,840
Oh, I don't want to even hear this.

164
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,840
Yeah.

165
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,840
I'm editing all that up.

166
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:52,160
I remember when we ordered waffle house for 30 minutes.

167
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,000
Do they really not have pancakes at waffle house?

168
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
No.

169
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
No, they don't.

170
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
That's fucking crazy.

171
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,200
I just kept trying to order pancakes.

172
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,200
It makes sense though.

173
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,960
They don't like covered in some other for your browns and capped.

174
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,160
Capped is what Charles is now.

175
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,160
He's covered in mushrooms.

176
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,160
He's covered in mushrooms.

177
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:15,520
Well, eventually he would be since we probably buried him on the side of the roof.

178
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,360
Does Dr. Marie Jacobs run her practice out of her home?

179
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,360
No.

180
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,360
Is it midday?

181
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,360
Will she be at the clinic?

182
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,160
I feel like we should go to go to her wherever she is.

183
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,360
No, that like the sun just went down.

184
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,360
Okay.

185
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,360
Then yeah, we'll head to her house.

186
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:33,920
On the way to Dr. Marie Jacobs home, you guys pull onto our street in the suburbs.

187
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:39,200
And as you are going down the street, you see kind of off to the right.

188
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:44,520
There's a man with extremely unkempt hair and facial hair standing in his front yard,

189
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:49,560
wearing a white tank top under some like rubber looking waders.

190
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:56,120
And he is messing with a vacuum, holding the hose with one hand and pointing the wand like

191
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:02,080
of the vacuum cleaner to the ground, kind of like he's challenging his yard to a duel.

192
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:07,640
And he begins to hold the wand with both hands and his arms shake violently up and down and

193
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:13,080
all around before he drops the vacuum wand and begins sprinting out into the street in

194
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:17,040
front of your car, not even paying attention to you whatsoever.

195
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,040
What do you want to do?

196
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,400
I was texting, so I just run him down.

197
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,200
Did you say, did you say it was vacuum like or it was a vacuum?

198
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,200
It was a vacuum.

199
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:29,240
I was messing with that like hose wand thing that comes off the side.

200
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,560
And it doesn't look like a fucked up vacuum.

201
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,560
It's just a normal vacuum.

202
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,560
No, normal vacuum.

203
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:36,520
I wrote down disheveled man vacuuming his yard, so let's just keep going.

204
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,520
Okay.

205
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,520
Yeah.

206
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:43,600
So yeah, I slam on the brakes and I say, sir, this might sound crazy, but were you trying

207
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,440
to vacuum an oil creature out of this guy?

208
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,160
He's like running away.

209
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,240
He has not even paid any attention to you whatsoever.

210
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:57,600
As you slammed on the brakes, he begins running down the street as he's running.

211
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:04,320
He begins to float off the ground and his legs are still flailing in a desperate gate

212
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,320
roll sanity.

213
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,160
Man, you really don't want us to see Marie Jacobs.

214
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:16,520
I pass nine on a 52 47 on a 53 neither one of you lose any sanity.

215
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:21,640
Basically you think maybe it's the air currents from the,

216
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,040
he must be a Poppins.

217
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,040
Yeah.

218
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:30,360
Perhaps he has jumped very high, but what you do see is a young boy and girl standing

219
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,720
in their front yard across the street and their jaws are dropped.

220
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:41,760
They failed the rules hard and they are watching this dude as he begins to float into the air.

221
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,400
So what do you do?

222
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,680
How far in the air is he?

223
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,680
Two feet.

224
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,080
Like I run up and I try to pull him back down.

225
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,080
Okay.

226
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:54,200
Is not coming down.

227
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:58,440
You are actively fighting against a force that you cannot see Clark.

228
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,440
What do you do?

229
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:06,600
I grabbed the other leg, his pants fall down.

230
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:17,320
So I need you guys to both a roll strength pass 23 on a 65 fail 76 on a 50 John, you

231
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:20,760
lose grip and slide down his leg.

232
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:26,600
As you are pulling on his shoe, as he kind of begins to get higher, you pull a shoe off

233
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:33,480
of his foot and Clark, you are holding him, but you feel a force actively lifting him

234
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,480
upward.

235
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,440
He is three feet off the ground at this point.

236
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,640
And you are the only thing holding him from floating away.

237
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,040
And he is screaming.

238
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,040
Oh, Holy.

239
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:50,360
Oh, you have to, you have to get the, get the, get the shit, get the fucking, get the

240
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,360
vacuum, get the vacuum.

241
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,360
I turned to John.

242
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,360
John, get the vacuum.

243
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,360
He says, get the vacuum.

244
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,080
I turned to those kids across the street.

245
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,080
Kids get the vacuum.

246
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:03,680
The two kids run and grab the vacuum from this man's yard.

247
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:09,160
I'm kind of like, I'm overseeing the children now I'm as I'm in a supervisory role.

248
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,160
Yeah.

249
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,280
I mean, you're delegating right there, right there.

250
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:24,280
And, uh, these two children, uh, are running over with the vacuum on an extension cord

251
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:28,400
that is like extremely long and they're bringing it out into the street.

252
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:36,560
Clark, I need you to roll strength for me one more time here, 46 on a 65 while I'm holding

253
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,560
onto them.

254
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,560
We got, we got you, bud.

255
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,560
They're coming with the vacuum.

256
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:43,080
Get the, get my feet, my feet, it's all around.

257
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,080
It's all around.

258
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,280
It's everywhere.

259
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,280
What is it bud?

260
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,280
What is it?

261
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:55,440
And these kids bring the vacuum to you, John suck, suck those feet up right there.

262
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,040
Just put that hose to his feet.

263
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,040
You two are heroes.

264
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,520
How old are these children?

265
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,200
They're like nine.

266
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,200
Both of them.

267
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,200
Yeah.

268
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:12,240
So the girl is holding the wand and the little boy is holding the vacuum, like hugging it,

269
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,240
like holding it up.

270
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,200
And he reaches over and flicks it on.

271
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:21,520
And the girl holds the one kind of up to this man's feet and they're both like, yeah, what

272
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,520
do we do?

273
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,000
You're doing great kids.

274
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:32,240
But is this, why, why is how you stop people from flying now?

275
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,240
Keep going.

276
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,800
I'm making you both honorary deputies.

277
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,160
You're vacuuming the hell out of that.

278
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,160
This man's shoes.

279
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,160
Just keep going.

280
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:44,880
Do we have fake badges at the police station?

281
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,600
I was already thinking that I've got them in my car.

282
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:50,240
I've got little that I hand out to kids.

283
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,520
The wand starts to move in jagged motions.

284
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:56,440
Oh my God, there's something.

285
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,440
I'm sucking up something.

286
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,640
No.

287
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,640
No, yeah.

288
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,640
I can't do this.

289
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:13,840
I think it was worse with the hand gestures, but it might play better on audio.

290
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:19,640
But that was, uh, yeah, John, John very quickly like grabs the end of the hose and was like,

291
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,640
you're doing great.

292
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,840
I got that from here.

293
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:29,640
The boy holding the vacuum is like, I can feel it too.

294
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,640
It's inside now.

295
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,240
What are you?

296
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,240
What are your names?

297
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,240
I'm Aiden.

298
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,240
Aiden.

299
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,240
I'm Aiden.

300
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,240
And she's, I don't know.

301
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,240
Like yeah.

302
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,240
Brooke.

303
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,240
No.

304
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,240
Brooke is a decent.

305
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,240
What's like a millennial's kid's name.

306
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,240
Kids in contention probably still have good biblical names.

307
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,240
Yeah.

308
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,240
They're, they're not worried about their names right now.

309
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,240
Yeah.

310
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,240
They are.

311
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,240
Cutback.

312
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,240
Cutback.

313
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:05,640
Clark, you actually feel the pressure is releasing and it is easier to hold this guy closer to

314
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,640
the ground.

315
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,640
And he is looking down.

316
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,640
He's like, you're doing it.

317
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,740
Oh, you're doing it.

318
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:16,240
Clark is feeling really good about being able to pull him down.

319
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,240
I'm strong.

320
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:21,240
John is watching all this like hands on hip satisfied like, yes, team.

321
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,240
Yes.

322
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,240
Clark, you get him all the way to the ground and he just begins sprinting.

323
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,240
He is sprinting.

324
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,240
He's like, run.

325
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,240
Run.

326
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,240
Run away.

327
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,240
Run.

328
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,240
Can I do a check that I don't let him go?

329
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,240
Yeah, absolutely.

330
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,240
You can roll strength or unarmed combat.

331
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,240
I'm using my unarmed combat skill.

332
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,240
Okay.

333
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,240
I pass.

334
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,240
53 on a 70.

335
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,240
He rolled an aught.

336
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,240
Aught.

337
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,240
It's a critical fail.

338
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,240
It's a critical fail.

339
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,240
His legs fall.

340
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:49,240
So you can do whatever you want to him.

341
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:56,240
I want to grab him, like bear around the shoulders and pull him to like the nearest lawn.

342
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,240
I just want to get him away from that area that he was floating in and off the road.

343
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,240
And then if he's still struggling, I want to get him to the ground.

344
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:09,240
Okay, yeah, you can get him to the ground and you're holding him and he's still screaming

345
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,240
like, get away from me.

346
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,240
Get away.

347
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,240
Now I need both of you guys to roll sanity for me.

348
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,240
Fail.

349
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,240
62 on a 53.

350
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,240
61 on a 52.

351
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,240
I also fail.

352
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,240
You guys are both going to lose a D4.

353
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,240
Oh, fuck.

354
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,240
Four.

355
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,240
Two.

356
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,240
So my sanity is now at 50.

357
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,240
Mine's at 49 and I'm one away from my breaking point.

358
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,240
I am two away from mine.

359
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:43,240
You guys can actually see on the street where you were, flashing in your vision is a thin

360
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:48,240
layer of this viscous, like writhing ooze.

361
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:54,240
And it is moving down the street into one of those drainage.

362
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,240
Storm drain.

363
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,240
Yeah.

364
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,240
Off the side of the road where the sidewalk meets.

365
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:04,240
And all of the ooze that was on the street is going down that drain.

366
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,240
What happens when you shoot it?

367
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,240
I shoot it.

368
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,240
Okay.

369
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,240
Kids, get out of the way.

370
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,240
And roll firearms.

371
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,240
67 on a 60.

372
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,240
Okay, so you just fire a few shots.

373
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,240
Those kids are dead.

374
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,240
I told them to get out of the way.

375
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,240
The kids both like completely-

376
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,240
Probably think it's pretty cool to see a cop she's killing, right?

377
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:28,240
They're completely blank faced and they're backing away.

378
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,240
The boy is still holding the vacuum.

379
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:34,240
Hey, junior deputies, get back here.

380
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,240
Drop that vacuum, first of all.

381
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:39,240
And as the two of them are being talked to by you,

382
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:44,240
you see the bag on this vacuum just explodes.

383
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:51,240
And you see both of these kids are immediately just covered in this black viscous goo.

384
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,240
They are gone.

385
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:59,240
Not necessarily from your vision because you can currently see this mass of ooze.

386
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:08,240
So more so you see the limbs of these kids inside of this ooze struggling to get out.

387
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:14,240
God, I mean it's so dark that it seems to dampen the brightness of everything around it,

388
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,240
all the lights shining down and stuff.

389
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:24,240
And it kind of melts down into the ground and begins slowly at first,

390
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,240
but surely gaining speed flowing toward you, John.

391
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,240
What do you do?

392
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,240
Do kids count as one kill or half a kill?

393
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,240
John just got two kills.

394
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:39,240
Also go ahead and roll sanity.

395
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:43,240
No way. Yeah, 92 on a 49.

396
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,240
So this is going to be a breaking point moment.

397
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,240
I critically fail.

398
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,240
66.

399
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:53,240
John, roll a D6, cut it in half and add four.

400
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:56,240
Oh, fuck.

401
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,240
Okay, cool.

402
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,240
Five.

403
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,240
Clark, you lose seven.

404
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,240
So that's a breaking point for me.

405
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,240
Same.

406
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,240
Also, man, I am bonkers now.

407
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,240
What are you down to?

408
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,240
44.

409
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,240
That's not too bad.

410
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,240
I have 40.

411
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,240
I'm at 43.

412
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,240
I'm fucking crazy.

413
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,240
What accent was that?

414
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,240
It was all of them.

415
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,240
I was doing all of them.

416
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,240
How do you calculate the new breaking point?

417
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,240
Okay, so yeah, let's do that real quick.

418
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,240
Keith Vigna, you're at 40, correct?

419
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:25,240
I'm at 40 and my last breaking point was 40, so how do I do my new breaking point?

420
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:30,240
Right, so yours is easy because your power is 10, so you just subtract your power from

421
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,240
your current sanity.

422
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,240
So what's 40 minus 10?

423
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:40,240
Clark, your sanity is currently 43 and your power is 12, so your new breaking point is

424
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,240
31.

425
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:47,240
And John Lee Pettymore, your sanity is 44 and your power is 12, which means your breaking

426
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,240
point is 32.

427
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:54,240
Hitting your breaking point will begin to change your character through the use of a

428
00:19:54,240 --> 00:20:00,240
new disorder that your character has gained and it will affect your willpower.

429
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,240
I will discuss this off-microphone with you.

430
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:07,240
I feel like John's definitely going to be a lot less cavalier with the lives of children

431
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,240
after this incident.

432
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:15,240
It's too late to try to vacuum them out of it.

433
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:21,240
You kept describing how horrible it was and I was like, I want to vacuum, but I guess

434
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,240
I hit my breaking point and froze.

435
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,240
Losing that much sanity?

436
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,240
10 or 5.

437
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,240
I've lost 9 this session.

438
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:35,240
I need you to roll against your power in order to act.

439
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:38,240
And hey, this is really important.

440
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,240
58 out of 60.

441
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,240
You lucky son of a bitch.

442
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:49,240
As this flowing dark ooze is moving toward you, you can move.

443
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,240
I'd die for the vacuum.

444
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,240
Oh, the bag burst.

445
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,240
Yup.

446
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,240
Yeah, I run.

447
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:06,240
Yeah, this guy in Clark's arms is freaking the fuck out and he's like, no, I fucking

448
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,240
told you to run.

449
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,240
I don't know.

450
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,240
And Clark, what are you doing?

451
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,240
I'm like, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

452
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,240
I'm getting up and running.

453
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,240
Maybe following wherever he runs, but running away.

454
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:22,240
Oh, we should run to our cruisers.

455
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,240
No, I'm sorry.

456
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,240
I want to follow the guy who's been sucked up in the air.

457
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,240
See where he's running.

458
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:31,240
No, I know, but maybe we should get in off foot.

459
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,240
This thing seems quick.

460
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:39,240
Okay, so he begins to run down the street away from you and also toward Marie Jacobs'

461
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,240
house.

462
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:45,240
John, do you want to head to your cruiser or are you following after this unkempt man

463
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:48,240
and Clark Bishop as they haul?

464
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:53,240
Are they running down like an alley or the road?

465
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,240
What was that?

466
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,240
I was going to say hot footed or something.

467
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,240
I don't know what I was going to say.

468
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,240
Hot footed is a weird thing.

469
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:05,240
I was like, hot footed?

470
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,240
What do you want to do?

471
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,240
Are they running down a street or alley?

472
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,240
They're running down the street in the suburbs.

473
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,240
It's honestly a nice neighborhood.

474
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,240
Yeah.

475
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:18,240
I get in my cruiser and I take off after him with the ultimate goal of collecting them

476
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,240
both and getting to Julie's.

477
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,240
Jacobs?

478
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,240
Yes.

479
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:30,240
As you get in your cruiser, you'd see this writhing mass and it disappears from your

480
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,240
vision.

481
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,240
I mean, it was there.

482
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,240
It didn't move anywhere.

483
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:38,240
It was moving, yes, at the time, but it didn't move out of your sight.

484
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,240
It just disappeared and you can't see it anymore.

485
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,240
I'm not afraid of silly putty.

486
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,240
I'm not afraid of silly putty.

487
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,240
I'm not afraid of silly putty.

488
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:49,240
You hop in your car, take off down the street, and make it to Clark Bishop and this unkempt

489
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:53,240
man wearing a white tank top and rubber-like waders.

490
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:58,240
You look to your right and you see the address for Dr. Marie Jacobs' house.

491
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:15,780
Keith Vigna, you are at the clinic in contention where the ambulance has brought you as well

492
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:16,780
as Billy-

493
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:17,780
Billie.

494
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:18,780
Was that his name?

495
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:19,780
Billy Harrison.

496
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:20,780
Billy Harrison.

497
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:28,420
And you are standing in a hallway waiting and a doctor comes to you and lets you know

498
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:30,820
that he has woken up.

499
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:32,940
He has a concussion.

500
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:40,060
He took a pretty huge blow to the back of his head and he was unconscious for quite

501
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:47,540
an amount of time, which leads them to believe something might have gone wrong neurologically.

502
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:51,880
So they did some scans, they're waiting on the report back, but he is currently awake

503
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:56,080
and you can go talk to him and he's cuffed to the bed.

504
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:02,120
As you walk into the room, he is laying in the bed, one cuff, yep, onto the bed.

505
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:05,740
Is he like hostile or is he just like kind of confused?

506
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,060
He's just sitting there.

507
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:12,820
I'm gonna go into the room and, hey, Billy, uh, do you know where you are right now?

508
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,220
He kind of looks around.

509
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,220
H-h-hospital.

510
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:20,140
Yeah, so you're in the contention hospital.

511
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,980
My name is O-Officer Vigna.

512
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,460
I have a couple questions for you.

513
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:24,460
You're not in trouble.

514
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:26,340
He kind of moves his hand.

515
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:32,040
Yeah, I think, uh, so you suffered a concussion, so you might be a little confused, but I just

516
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:37,500
want to set a timeline of what you remember meeting up to what I know.

517
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,540
Does that make sense to you?

518
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:40,540
Yeah.

519
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:43,460
Okay, so can you tell me your name?

520
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,580
Billy Harrison.

521
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:48,920
Do you know where you are right now?

522
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,260
You said contention.

523
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,660
We're in contention.

524
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:54,140
Are you from contention?

525
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:55,140
No.

526
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:56,140
Where are you from?

527
00:24:56,140 --> 00:25:06,120
I'm from, I'm, I'm from, I, I don't remember.

528
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,500
Do you know how old you are?

529
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:12,500
I'm 31.

530
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:13,820
I'm 31.

531
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:14,820
Close enough.

532
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:18,340
What is the last thing you remember before you remember talking to me?

533
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:22,260
I was, I went to my friend John's.

534
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,260
John?

535
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:25,260
Uh, Peters.

536
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:26,260
John Peters.

537
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,260
How do you know John Peters?

538
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:29,820
We were in the army together?

539
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:33,300
No, I'm, I was in the army.

540
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,820
We're just friends.

541
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:37,300
So John Peters was not in the army with you?

542
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,900
I don't think so.

543
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:41,220
No, he's an old friend.

544
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,220
Okay.

545
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:44,780
Do you remember why you went over to his house?

546
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:48,940
He, he, he hadn't responded.

547
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:52,020
He hadn't responded to any of my messages.

548
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,020
And how long?

549
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:55,100
A couple of days.

550
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,500
I tried calling him.

551
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,820
Yeah, I tried calling him.

552
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,580
He didn't, he didn't respond.

553
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:00,980
I got worried about him.

554
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:03,260
How often do you usually see John?

555
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:05,860
I don't see him very often.

556
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:08,840
Or how do you, how often do you keep in contact with him?

557
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,220
We talk a lot.

558
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:12,020
We play video games together.

559
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:13,020
Okay.

560
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:15,860
He didn't respond long enough for you to be worried about him.

561
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:16,860
Right?

562
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:17,860
And that's why you went and checked on him?

563
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:21,260
Yeah, I was on my way through town.

564
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:22,740
Did you get to his house?

565
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:23,740
Yeah.

566
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:25,460
And did you talk to him?

567
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,220
No, he wasn't there.

568
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:31,260
I was, I was looking in, something happened at his house.

569
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:34,020
Did you look into the windows or did you get into his house?

570
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:36,660
I was looking in the window.

571
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:40,380
That's that's the last thing you remember or can you think any harder?

572
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,380
Is there anything?

573
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:45,180
Have you seen anybody in the house or do you remember anybody coming up to you?

574
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:50,140
No, I was looking through the window and now I'm here?

575
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:51,580
What happened?

576
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:55,100
Do you know a man by the name of Charles Donovan?

577
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,500
No.

578
00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:03,380
Okay, so what's happened here is that we were chasing after a man named Charles and we found

579
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:09,700
you tied up in the back of his car and he gave you, he must have hit you with something

580
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:13,700
while you were looking through John's house or looking into John's house and he gave you

581
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:18,700
a concussion and that's why you're here just for some tests and some just surveying to

582
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:24,880
see what your health is like but do you know any one that would have wanted to hurt John?

583
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:30,620
Did John ever talk about any enemies or any people he might have owed a debt to or anything

584
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:34,440
that he might have been caught up with?

585
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,540
Any kind of trouble that he was in?

586
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:38,940
No, not that I can think of.

587
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:40,860
What kind of video games did you play with him?

588
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:43,220
Online or with him?

589
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,220
Online.

590
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:47,980
So did he ever tell you much about his personal life?

591
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:54,660
I mean we just knew each other growing up and stayed in touch because we both played

592
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:55,660
Call of Duty.

593
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:56,660
Okay.

594
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:59,340
Do you know anybody that drives a white Toyota?

595
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:00,340
I mean...

596
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,340
What kind of car do you drive?

597
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,340
Probably.

598
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:04,020
Let me start over.

599
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:08,580
What kind of car do you, what car did you drive to John's house?

600
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,340
White van.

601
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,340
White van.

602
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:12,340
Okay.

603
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:15,620
And when did you go over to John's house?

604
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:17,140
The third?

605
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,140
What day is it?

606
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,140
Today's the third.

607
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,140
Thank god.

608
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:21,220
About what time did you get there?

609
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:22,540
I don't remember.

610
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:25,740
I think the sun was up.

611
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:26,820
How late is it?

612
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:28,820
It's about eight o'clock in the evening.

613
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:32,140
So had you eaten lunch before you went or?

614
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:33,140
Yeah.

615
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:35,940
Okay, so early afternoon probably.

616
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:36,940
Yeah.

617
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:37,940
So about six.

618
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,300
Okay.

619
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,300
About six hours you've been out.

620
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,300
Oh god.

621
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,300
Um.

622
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,300
That's really bad for you, isn't it?

623
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,540
Well, we'll let the doctors decide that.

624
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:46,540
I'm not a doctor.

625
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:48,820
I'm just a very good police officer.

626
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:49,820
So you can trust me.

627
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:51,600
You can tell me anything that you want.

628
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,580
What kind of line of work are you in now?

629
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:56,540
I'm on leave from the army.

630
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:57,540
Okay.

631
00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:02,260
You don't happen to know anybody that works at a dog grooming facility, do you?

632
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:04,260
You're asking some weird questions.

633
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:08,540
I know these sound weird, but you've got a concussion, so you might not.

634
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:10,020
None of these questions are weird.

635
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:12,020
You just might think they are.

636
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,020
Okay.

637
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:16,540
I don't know anyone who works at a dog grooming establishment.

638
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:17,540
Okay.

639
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:22,340
I guess, uh, you know, I, I got, I'll give you some rest and I'll talk to the doctor

640
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,340
to see how you're doing.

641
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:28,380
I'll, I'll let you, I'll leave you to it and kind of moves his hand with the handcuff on

642
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:29,380
it.

643
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:32,540
Is this still necessary?

644
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:41,580
Kind of feel like I was the victim and I mean, you're not treating me like I'm arrested.

645
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:46,260
No, you're not under arrest, but I'm, I'm going to stick around here at the clinic until

646
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:48,380
I get word from the doctor that you're okay.

647
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:53,780
Um, you know, we don't want you getting up and walking off and you know, dying out there.

648
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:56,620
Yeah, that makes sense.

649
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:57,740
Okay.

650
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:08,020
Well then can you at least take this off for now?

651
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:09,620
I don't, I don't know about that.

652
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:14,100
I am I under arrest?

653
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,700
Should I put you under arrest?

654
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,980
No, sorry, sir.

655
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:22,060
You've been pretty cooperative so far, but you're making me question whether I should

656
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:24,120
be done with this interview.

657
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,580
Why were you at John Peter's house for real?

658
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:28,220
I was just checking.

659
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:31,540
You were checking on your friend that you play video games with?

660
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:34,500
Yeah, I thought he might be in trouble.

661
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,660
Why would you think that he was in trouble?

662
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:39,980
There's times where I text my friends and they don't text me back or call me back for

663
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:44,340
a couple of days and it's for no reason, especially my close friends.

664
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:46,660
I don't know about if you're that close with him.

665
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:51,380
Tell me why you were at John Peter's house and I pull out my other pair of handcuffs

666
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:57,180
and handcuff his other hand to the other side of the bed.

667
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,180
Out of game.

668
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:01,300
Is this something I should pursue or am I wasting time?

669
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,500
You can do anything you want.

670
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,860
Here's what we're going to do.

671
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:16,180
As you walk up to his bed with the other pair of handcuffs, I need you to roll unarmed combat.

672
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:20,700
I got a 54 on a 40 and he got a success.

673
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:30,020
So as you approach him in one swift motion, he pulls your gun from your holster and immediately

674
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:36,580
has it drawn on you and he says, uncuff my hand right now or I'm going to shoot you.

675
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:40,860
Can I roll humant to see if he is just scared or...

676
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:41,860
Absolutely.

677
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:42,860
40 on 80.

678
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:50,160
Yeah, not only is he not scared in this moment at all, it looks like he has done this before

679
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:53,480
and he is going to shoot you.

680
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:57,440
What would I roll?

681
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:02,720
I'm thinking of like, I want to like jump and just tase him, but I like, do I have the,

682
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,760
I'm thinking I have a taser gun, but do I have like a stick it in his neck kind of taser?

683
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,760
Oh, I don't know.

684
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,760
You probably have the gun.

685
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,680
I think that's what they carry these days.

686
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:13,720
Hey Luke, he's going to shoot you.

687
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,720
Okay.

688
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:20,800
Okay, I put my hand up.

689
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,800
Okay.

690
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:26,520
I'm reaching down to my pot, to my, what do you call the little thing they wear?

691
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,520
Tactical belt.

692
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,520
Yeah.

693
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,520
Okay.

694
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,800
I'm reaching down to my belt to pull out the key.

695
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,080
Please don't shoot me.

696
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:38,200
He kind of moves the handcuff in a position to make it easy for you to unlock it.

697
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:41,600
I put the key in the lock, I twist it.

698
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,600
It unclicks.

699
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:45,880
I put the key back on my belt and the handcuffs are unlocked.

700
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:49,680
He says, turn around.

701
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,260
I turn around.

702
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:53,320
He stands up and he's behind you.

703
00:32:53,320 --> 00:33:00,000
He's got the gun pressed firmly against the back of your head and he says, all right,

704
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,400
here's what we're going to do.

705
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,400
Fuck.

706
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,400
Okay.

707
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:07,960
I guess roll alertness for me.

708
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:08,960
Pass.

709
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,840
53 on a 60.

710
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:11,840
Okay.

711
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:15,360
72 and your lights go out.

712
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,880
All right.

713
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,680
Thomas and Joe.

714
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:36,600
John Lee Pettymore drives his cruiser down the road of the suburbs and makes it to where

715
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:43,000
Clark Bishop and this haggard looking man are running down the street and you guys kind

716
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:48,280
of slow down as you're looking behind you and the guy says, it's gone.

717
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,400
Oh, it's gone.

718
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,400
Yeah.

719
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,360
I can't, I can't see it either, man.

720
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,040
What the fuck was it?

721
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:58,120
Oh shit.

722
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,120
It's here.

723
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:04,900
And he turns and he kind of bends down and looks inside the cruiser and he sees John

724
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:13,820
Lee Pettymore and he backs up immediately and he's like, I can, what are you, what are

725
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:14,820
you?

726
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:15,820
And he looks at both of you.

727
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:16,820
He's like, what are you doing?

728
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:20,940
And he just fucking starts running back toward his house immediately.

729
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:21,940
Whoa, whoa.

730
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:22,940
Hey, but whoa.

731
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:23,940
And I'm trying to chase after him.

732
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:25,440
If I can get a hand on him.

733
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,440
You can get a hand.

734
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,500
I mean, do you want to like, he's, he's really trying to get away.

735
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,380
So I would just like to grab him so we can't get away.

736
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:32,380
Whatever that would take.

737
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:33,380
Yeah.

738
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:35,100
I mean, you could do unarmed combat or strength.

739
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:37,940
I'll do an armed combat.

740
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:38,940
Okay.

741
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:41,860
I fail fucking 91 on a 70.

742
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:42,860
Okay.

743
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:43,860
He passes.

744
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:47,780
So he gets away from you and he starts running down the street and he looks crazy.

745
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:54,540
I mean, this guy's wearing a white tank top with big rubber waders on and he's just like

746
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,100
hoofing it down the street.

747
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,100
I don't know.

748
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,100
Squeak, squeak, squeak.

749
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:02,060
Uh, yeah, I don't think I'm going to pursue.

750
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:04,020
I think I'll watch him run away.

751
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,020
Same.

752
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,020
Okay.

753
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,020
So he runs back to his house.

754
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,020
I know where he lives.

755
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:13,300
We, I, we know where you live.

756
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:18,780
He looks back over his shoulder, crazed the look in his eyes like dips into his house.

757
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:19,780
Cool.

758
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:20,780
All right.

759
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:23,460
So you guys are like right in front of the Jacobs home.

760
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:29,220
It's a beautiful modern home with a large front yard and a recessed interest entrance.

761
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:35,420
Just like every home on this street and in this neighborhood, you are in the suburbs.

762
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:39,940
Honestly this, this part of town seems a little nice for waiters, like the waiter guy, not

763
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:40,940
waiters.

764
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:45,820
This part of town does seem a little nice for waiters.

765
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:49,380
I mean, we've all, no servers live in this neighborhood.

766
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:53,180
We've all waited tables, but I'm realizing suddenly that it's a little weird roleplay

767
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:57,100
wise that we shrug our shoulders and go investigate Dr. Murray's house.

768
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,060
I don't know what you're talking about.

769
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:03,660
This seems convenient and perfect to me.

770
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,720
I don't feel great about those kids.

771
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:08,540
You know, they fucking, they're fucking gone.

772
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:15,200
All right, listen, Clark, we never saw two kids, but they were, they were just, you understand

773
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:19,660
that we cannot have like, we can't be on the hook for the death of two children.

774
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:24,100
Nobody's going to believe the crazy guy and the waiters.

775
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,740
There were never any kids.

776
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:26,740
Yeah.

777
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:28,380
Yeah, there weren't.

778
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:35,940
We don't know what happened to those two, those two, those two children.

779
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:38,340
There weren't, there weren't, there weren't, there weren't no children.

780
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:39,340
There were no children.

781
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:42,940
Let's uh, let's see what this doctor knows about our cases.

782
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,500
You guys mark up to the front door?

783
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,500
Yeah, I'll knock.

784
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,940
This is good knocking.

785
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:53,100
This is much better than Luke's.

786
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:58,660
You hear scuffling from inside and then you can like very clearly hear someone approaching

787
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:03,460
the door and you hear some heavy breathing, like right on the other side of the door.

788
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:12,800
It's just like Dr. Jacobs, we have a few questions for you now.

789
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,340
We'd just like to talk ma'am.

790
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:17,500
If you could just even open your door, we could just have a word with you right here.

791
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:21,300
We can talk through the door.

792
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:24,580
Go away ma'am.

793
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:25,580
We're the police.

794
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:26,980
We, we need to, we need to talk to you.

795
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:27,980
I know who you are.

796
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:29,980
You have a warrant?

797
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:30,980
Maybe.

798
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:33,740
Uh, we don't, we don't need a warrant to find out.

799
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:35,780
You can come back with a warrant.

800
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:37,140
No, that's not her voice.

801
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,140
I don't know.

802
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:39,140
Yeah.

803
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:40,140
Do you want to?

804
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:41,140
Yeah, I do.

805
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:42,140
Restart?

806
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:43,140
I do.

807
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:44,140
Okay.

808
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:45,140
She has a nicer house than that.

809
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,140
Yeah.

810
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,140
Fuck.

811
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,140
Contention PD.

812
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,140
Go away.

813
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:51,980
See, I thought you were going to go less witchy.

814
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:52,980
Yeah.

815
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:53,980
Nope.

816
00:37:53,980 --> 00:38:02,040
John, it's a witch.

817
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,040
It's a witch.

818
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,040
What'd you say?

819
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,040
You said contingent PD?

820
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,040
Yeah.

821
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:11,040
Uh, we just, we just need to, I wasn't doing that, I didn't care.

822
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,040
Do you want me to say that?

823
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,040
Clark's mind is preoccupied.

824
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,040
What?

825
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,040
Did you just say contingent PD?

826
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:18,900
Uh, would you, uh, we just need to ask you some questions ma'am.

827
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:20,660
Okay.

828
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:21,660
Can you open the door for me?

829
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:24,300
You can ask your questions through the door.

830
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,140
Pausing the role play.

831
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:27,820
What do we want to ask her actually?

832
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:28,820
Yeah.

833
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:32,940
So her, she was just circled in the phone book at Julie Maxwell's place.

834
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:35,060
That's the only real lead we have to come here.

835
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:36,060
So maybe if she knows her.

836
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:37,260
I thought we had a couple other things though.

837
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:41,180
I thought other people had, I thought there were two or three vectors to her.

838
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:42,180
Nope.

839
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:43,180
I do have something else to her.

840
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:44,180
Oh, do you?

841
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:45,180
Yes.

842
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:46,180
Uh, she bought the radio from the treasure shop.

843
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,180
Yes.

844
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:48,180
That's important.

845
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:49,460
Good.

846
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,460
Good fucking call.

847
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:51,880
John and Thomas.

848
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:59,420
So then what do we want to ask her like, radio repair.

849
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,420
What were you saying?

850
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:03,780
I put it together in my head that Julie might've just circled her name in the phone book as

851
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:06,820
another person who bought a crazy item like her camera.

852
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:10,220
So she might not know who Julie Maxwell is either way.

853
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:15,340
Ma'am, we just wanted to, uh, did you purchase anything from the, uh, oh shit.

854
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:16,340
What's it called?

855
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:17,340
Sorry.

856
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:21,100
Did you purchase anything from forgotten treasures in the last, uh, let's say month.

857
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:24,420
I buy many things from forgotten treasures.

858
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:27,180
Did you happen to buy an old radio?

859
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:30,460
No.

860
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:31,460
We think you did.

861
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:32,700
And we're just kind of interested in it.

862
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:33,700
Go away.

863
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:34,700
You didn't do anything wrong.

864
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:38,020
We just, uh, we're just curious about that old radio you bought.

865
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:39,500
You want to open the door for us?

866
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,500
Why?

867
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:41,640
So we can take a look at that old thing.

868
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,640
It sounds cool.

869
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,640
It's not here.

870
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:46,060
Uh, where, where'd it go?

871
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:47,060
It's gone.

872
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:48,780
Did you sell it?

873
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:49,780
No.

874
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:50,780
What'd you fetch?

875
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:51,780
What kind of price you fetch for that?

876
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:52,780
Can I hement her to see if she's lying?

877
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:53,780
Yeah.

878
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:54,780
I do not pass.

879
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:55,780
83 out of 50.

880
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:56,780
You don't know.

881
00:39:56,780 --> 00:40:00,820
Uh, so if you didn't sell it, why, why is it not here?

882
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:02,380
A man came and took it.

883
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:03,980
A man came and took your radio?

884
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:04,980
A man came and took it.

885
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:06,020
I'm sorry to hear that.

886
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:07,500
Did you get a good look at the guy?

887
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,460
We can, we can go and get that for you.

888
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:10,620
He said no cops.

889
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:12,020
Oh, we can be discreet.

890
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:13,100
Oh, can you?

891
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:16,060
Knocking on the door, yelling about radios.

892
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:17,800
Who's got us there?

893
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,060
We can be discreet from here on out for you.

894
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:23,260
It's a lot easier to be discreet when you let us inside, ma'am.

895
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:25,180
There's nothing here for you.

896
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:26,300
Go away.

897
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:28,020
Was that man John Peters?

898
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:30,160
I don't know who that is.

899
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,700
Can you describe the man who took that?

900
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:32,700
He was tall.

901
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:33,700
He was drunk.

902
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,740
He was very mean.

903
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:37,580
Did he break into your house to get that radio?

904
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:38,580
Yes.

905
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:39,940
Did you watch him carry it away?

906
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:40,940
He had a gun.

907
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:42,220
Did you see him drive off?

908
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:43,220
No.

909
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:44,220
Is he still here?

910
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:45,220
No.

911
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:49,300
He's gone, as is the radio that you so desperately desire.

912
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:50,300
I turned to John.

913
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:53,260
John, I mean a tall, drunk guy stealing a radio.

914
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:55,660
It's gotta be Charles, right?

915
00:40:55,660 --> 00:41:00,980
There was the description of the menacing, drunk, mean guy with the gin blossoms.

916
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:01,980
That wasn't Charles, right?

917
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:02,980
I think it was.

918
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:03,980
Oh, okay.

919
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:04,980
Yeah, I think you're right.

920
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:07,380
Because he was at Treasure, fucking, what's it called?

921
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:08,380
Forgotten Treasures.

922
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:10,860
I'm forgetting the word forgotten.

923
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:11,860
He was at Forgotten Treasures.

924
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:13,620
He was drunk when I saw him.

925
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:16,020
It's gotta be Charles, and he's dead.

926
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:18,540
Well, we need to follow up on his hotel room, then.

927
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:20,380
He's staying at the same hotel as Vigna.

928
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:21,380
Go away.

929
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:25,660
Just to satisfy our curiosity while we're here, what kind of doctor are you?

930
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:28,340
I am a doctor.

931
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:31,340
I am a family doctor.

932
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:32,340
That's a noble profession.

933
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:33,340
Thank you, ma'am.

934
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:34,340
Thank you.

935
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:35,340
Okay.

936
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:36,340
Hey, Salem.

937
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:37,340
Oh, God.

938
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:39,300
I think she might be a witch.

939
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:43,100
As she says that, you kind of see, so she's got one of those doors that has the glass

940
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:48,260
pane at the top, and so you can see movement through there, and you didn't see any shape

941
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:53,500
or anything earlier when she came to the door, but there is kind of the shape of a taller

942
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:56,420
person there, and she's like, I have to go.

943
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:59,860
If you would like to continue talking, I will be back post-haste.

944
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:02,060
Ma'am, is there somebody in there with you?

945
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:04,060
Clark, I don't think we need a warrant anymore.

946
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:05,780
I think we have reasonable ...

947
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:13,540
You know the words.

948
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:15,540
Okay.

949
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:20,300
We can't start doing takes and shit, though.

950
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:23,900
Clark, I think we have reasonable ...

951
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:30,540
John, are you trying to say reasonable suspicion?

952
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:31,540
I sure am, Clark.

953
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:32,540
I think we might as well.

954
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:33,540
All right.

955
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:34,540
I kick down the door.

956
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:36,540
Okay.

957
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:39,540
Go ahead and roll law.

958
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:41,540
How about that?

959
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:42,540
35 on a 50.

960
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:44,540
Yeah, you've done this before.

961
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:45,540
You know how to do it.

962
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:46,540
Okay.

963
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:48,540
I mean, they train you how to kick in a door.

964
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:49,540
For sure.

965
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:51,540
I figured it would be a strength test.

966
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:53,540
Not like a cop test, but I like it.

967
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:55,540
I'm trying to change things up.

968
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:58,540
The cop test was so that you knew you were in the right to do this.

969
00:42:58,540 --> 00:42:59,540
Exactly.

970
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:03,540
You had the force of the law behind your kick.

971
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:06,540
So, I've kicked down the door at gun drawn.

972
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:11,540
We're here to protect you, doctor.

973
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:14,540
You kick in the door and you immediately see the house.

974
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:16,540
The house is a complete wreck.

975
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:17,540
It smells weird in here.

976
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:21,540
There's a haze in the air, but she's not there.

977
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:25,540
But you can kind of hear yelling like ...

978
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:26,540
Like from the basement.

979
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:30,540
There's a door very clearly kind of around the corner that leads to the basement and

980
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:32,540
it's open.

981
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:35,540
Do you guys want to start going there or do you want to look around the rest of the house?

982
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:40,540
I want to do just a visual scan as I'm walking toward the basement door.

983
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:41,540
What can I see from ...

984
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:42,540
An ocular pad.

985
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:43,540
An ocular pad and of the premises.

986
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:45,540
So, there's not a lot specific up here.

987
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:48,540
All over the house, there's a bunch of random stuff.

988
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:54,540
It's on the counters, the tables, any surface is full of stuff and not clean.

989
00:43:54,540 --> 00:44:01,540
There are beakers and other types of like containment objects all over the place as

990
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:06,540
well as mini jars, which is another thing that I just said.

991
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:08,540
Something you can contain things in.

992
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:11,540
Also, some bowls.

993
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:12,540
No, I'm just ...

994
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:15,540
So, lots of stuff like that around.

995
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:18,540
Just kind of like all around a mess.

996
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:27,540
There's shit everywhere and in fact, it smells terrible and it kind of smells like shit in here.

997
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:28,540
People or animals.

998
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:29,540
Which is weird.

999
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:30,540
Well, when you ...

1000
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:31,540
Just general.

1001
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:32,540
Both, yeah.

1002
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:43,540
However, good question because when you go around, you do see a litter box, but there's

1003
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:47,540
poop in it, but it doesn't look like cat poop.

1004
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:48,540
Is it too big?

1005
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:49,540
It's too big.

1006
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:50,540
She is a fucking witch.

1007
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:53,540
She's got a giant cat man named Salem.

1008
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:55,540
Can we discern anything that she's yelling?

1009
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:58,540
As she starts walking up the stairs.

1010
00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:01,540
She's like, did you kick down my door?

1011
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:03,540
We thought you were in trouble, ma'am.

1012
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:05,540
I am in no trouble.

1013
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:08,540
Please leave my home immediately.

1014
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:13,540
Ma'am, we believe you are Harvey and a legal giant cat man in this premises.

1015
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:16,540
Do you hear the words coming out of your mouth, officer?

1016
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:17,540
I just point to the litter box.

1017
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:22,540
She looks over at it and she says, Salem is going to get some licks for that.

1018
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:23,540
Can you show us Salem, ma'am?

1019
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:24,540
Yeah.

1020
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:29,540
And she points at a picture on one of the countertops somewhere.

1021
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:31,540
It's a picture of her and her husband and their cat.

1022
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:32,540
They have a black cat.

1023
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:34,540
Ma'am, there was somebody else in this house.

1024
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:36,540
Do you know where they went?

1025
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:37,540
That was just Doug.

1026
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:38,540
Who's Doug?

1027
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:39,540
Doug's my husband.

1028
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:40,540
She points at the same picture.

1029
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:41,540
Where'd Doug go?

1030
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:43,540
He's downstairs.

1031
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:45,540
He does not want to be disturbed.

1032
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:49,540
Well, tough titty said the kitty.

1033
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:52,540
I brush past her and start walking down the stairs.

1034
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:53,540
No.

1035
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:54,540
I holler down the stairs.

1036
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:57,540
Doug, I need you to come up here.

1037
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:59,540
You hear?

1038
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:01,540
Meow.

1039
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:02,540
From downstairs?

1040
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:03,540
Yeah.

1041
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:12,540
It's a fucking cat man.

1042
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:13,540
Oh my God.

1043
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:14,540
All right.

1044
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:17,540
Cover me.

1045
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:22,540
A cold chill runs down Clark's spine as the joke that they were having suddenly becomes

1046
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:24,540
very real.

1047
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:26,540
This was never a joke to me, Clark.

1048
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:27,540
It was to me.

1049
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:28,540
Don't go down there.

1050
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:32,540
And she kind of like tries to get in front of you and close the door to the steps to

1051
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:33,540
the basement.

1052
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:34,540
I hold the door.

1053
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:35,540
She's just looking up at you.

1054
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:40,540
By the way, Dr. Marie Jacobs is an older, short, plump woman.

1055
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:43,540
She has mascara smeared all over her entire face.

1056
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:45,540
Her hair is a complete disaster.

1057
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:49,540
And she is wearing a white coverall with long neoprene gloves.

1058
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:54,540
Does it look like if you smeared the mascara off her face, she might actually be a cat?

1059
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:59,540
From what you know about both humans and cats, I would say no.

1060
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:01,540
Okay.

1061
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:05,540
As she does this, she looks at John and she says,

1062
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:08,540
Actually.

1063
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:10,540
And turns to Clark and says,

1064
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:12,540
You can go downstairs.

1065
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:13,540
And looks back at John.

1066
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:15,540
Join me in the kitchen for a moment.

1067
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:17,540
Sidebar, Clark?

1068
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:18,540
One moment, ma'am.

1069
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:19,540
Doctor.

1070
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:20,540
Thank you.

1071
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:24,540
I didn't go to seven years of school to be called ma'am.

1072
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:25,540
Of course not, doctor.

1073
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:26,540
Hey, Clark.

1074
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:28,540
You're not going to let me go down there alone, right?

1075
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:29,540
No, no.

1076
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:30,540
We got to arrest her right now, right?

1077
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:32,540
Like this is suspicious as hell.

1078
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:33,540
Yeah.

1079
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:35,540
She's like dissecting a cat man down there or something, right?

1080
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:36,540
Yeah.

1081
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:38,540
Something unholy is happening in this house.

1082
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:39,540
Things are real weird.

1083
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:40,540
That's against the law, right?

1084
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:42,540
At the very least, the guy downstairs ain't coming up.

1085
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:44,540
And after I told him to come up.

1086
00:47:44,540 --> 00:47:45,540
So.

1087
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:46,540
Handcuff her?

1088
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:47,540
Yeah.

1089
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:48,540
I just started handcuffing her.

1090
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:49,540
And I started reading.

1091
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:55,180
Ma'am, you're under arrest for suspicion of harboring an unholy cat man for impeding the

1092
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:58,860
investigation of two officers for just being creepy as hell.

1093
00:47:58,860 --> 00:48:01,540
Clark, you got anything to add?

1094
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:02,540
No.

1095
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:03,540
That was it.

1096
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:04,540
All right.

1097
00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:05,540
Yeah.

1098
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:06,540
I'm real sorry, doctor.

1099
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:08,540
But you are just under all kinds of arrest.

1100
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:09,540
Salem!

1101
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:17,540
And you hear just this like boom, boom, boom, like coming up the stairs.

1102
00:48:17,540 --> 00:48:18,540
I cuff her as quickly.

1103
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:20,540
I try to cuff her like very quickly.

1104
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:21,540
All right.

1105
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:22,540
Roll.

1106
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:24,540
You can either roll law or dexterity.

1107
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:25,540
Dexterity.

1108
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:26,540
Okay.

1109
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:28,540
58 on a 65.

1110
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:29,540
Well done.

1111
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:37,540
You get the cuffs locked and you are ready for whatever is about to happen next.

1112
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:40,540
Thank you.

1113
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:40,540
