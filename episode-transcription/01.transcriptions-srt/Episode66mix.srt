27
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,860
with pretty sexual

28
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:47,620
the tops of trees thick enough to obscure any view of what is below and covered in a

29
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:54,220
layer of kudzu seem to go on endlessly up and down over hills and valleys mountains

30
00:03:54,220 --> 00:04:01,720
and gorges there is nothing but dense verdant forest a circular calm lake finds itself somewhere

31
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:07,560
in the midst of this lush wilderness and in the middle of that lake a small island with

32
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:13,060
less than a quarter mile from shore to shore a long wooden dock on the north side of the

33
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:19,400
island leads to a charming two-story boat house with six well-kept cedar canoes tied

34
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:25,500
up below the second story apartment if the island is the face of a clock that dock is

35
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:31,660
at high noon there are six cute cozy little cottages evenly dispersed along the shore

36
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:37,920
of the island at one o'clock three o'clock five o'clock seven o'clock nine o'clock and

37
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:44,240
eleven o'clock five of the six cottages are in pristine condition the eleven o'clock place

38
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,840
might be too but it looks doubtful since the entire building is covered in a massive blue

39
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:56,480
tarp surrounding each of these cottages is truly master craft landscaping stunningly

40
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:02,140
gorgeous flowers in every shade and shape fill varied gardens and planters that somehow

41
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:08,760
both overrun the terrain and complement it perfectly each cottage has a cobblestone walkway

42
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:13,700
lined on either side by these lovely flower beds and the walkways all make their way to

43
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:19,100
the center of the island where a large equally cute and cozy hexagonal building sits

44
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:30,700
break y'all there is a small welcome sign on the south side of this building right at six

45
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:40,780
o'clock welcome to calm comfy campgrounds and then we go into this main building this main

46
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:48,020
large hexagonal building and inside we find a room that is circular the wall never ceasing

47
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:54,020
and never creasing at any point even where the wall meets the ceiling and the floor the angles

48
00:05:54,020 --> 00:06:01,220
are rounded off there are six chairs in a half circle facing a single chair in front of them

49
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:06,420
each chair has a bottle of water next to it and standing around this room or sitting in

50
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:11,820
these chairs are the four of you along with two others let's go ahead and go around and

51
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:18,980

53
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:34,940

54
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:44,580
on his arm is his wife Angela who is a lively young woman with a thick mane of curly hair in

55
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:52,060
a floral sundress with strappy leather sandals that go up above her ankles and the two of them

56
00:06:52,060 --> 00:07:03,540
are in a corner of the room standing and talking yeah well hey there Joe hey there's that are you

57

58
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:22,940
right standing at six o'clock on this large island surround island surrounded by Lake calm and you

59
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:29,860
guys are walking up a cobblestone pathway up to a large hexagonal building ahead of you you see

60
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:36,620
everything the flowers just verdant gardens all around bushes and trees make up much of this place

61
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:42,060
and through some of them on either side you can see these small cute little cottages tucked away

62
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:47,580
in their own little areas but ahead of you is this large hexagonal building and you said we were

63
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:54,740
walking up from six o'clock yes so we started at the south side of yes and Angela looks at you

64
00:07:54,740 --> 00:08:01,540
and she's kind of like bouncing back and forth between from cobblestone to cobblestone and she's

65
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:09,500
like Raj I just think this is gonna be such a solid experience for you Roger kind of stretches

66
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:18,260
out he's in a nice white seersucker suit that's his leisure wear yeah yeah of course and he does

67
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:25,900
a big stretch take in that sweet lake air and that that's that's real nice in it it's beautiful

68
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:32,100
I'm so glad that we could just get away and really focus on like finding our emotions and really

69
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:38,540
being able to communicate right Raj I don't know about all that but I'm happy to go along with

70
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:44,340
whatever you think is gonna help us I think it's gonna be great and she like twirls out and spins

71
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:50,860
and it's really taking in the Sun is beating right down on you guys and it is a gorgeous day

72
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:59,820
here at calm comfy campgrounds but as she's spinning her arms wide stretched taking in all

73
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:12,060
the vitamin D she can get Jesus I'm the worst you notice that on her arm on the inside of one of her

74
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:20,340
arms track marks that you have not noticed before and she stops spinning kind of like crumbles into

75
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:25,820
herself and looks at you she's kind of lurches toward you and throws her arms around your neck

76
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:33,740
and it's like this is gonna be a perfect weekend to start our marriage off on the right foot kind

77
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:42,500
of hesitantly but mindfully avoiding asking about those marks yes if you think it's gonna

78
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:48,980
help us I I'll do what I can turning around you see the sign for calm comfy campgrounds and you

79
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:56,660
walk up on to this large hexagonal building it's like made of wood almost like like a rustic

80
00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:04,100
hunting house however it seems more modern than that it has certain amenities and you would know

81
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:17,180
calm comfy campground is a luxury so this is not just a cabin in the woods it's not it's different

82
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:24,980
than that it's on a island that's on a lake that's in the woods it's completely different gotcha a

83
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:32,500
cabin on the lake in the woods at the bottom of the ocean the main building this hexagonal

84
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:40,620
building is similarly bestroon with delightful flowers made of many shades and shapes and as

85
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:47,940
you guys walk in the inside is equally rustic and elegant and modern and there's a massive wooden

86
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:54,620
chandelier hanging over the foyer on the desk to your right is a bell with a sign that says please

87
00:10:54,780 --> 00:11:01,900
boop for assistance and a vase with a single red rose there's a little area back there with a chair

88
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:07,380
but it's currently empty and then you notice on your left there's a table with a coffee pot and a

89
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:13,740
water cooler on either side of a bowl of fruit Roger's gonna walk over to that Bell and see that

90
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:20,500
sign huh don't mind if I do and it says boop as he rings says boop as your answer of course you

91
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:30,740
have to go ahead and roll alertness oh boy first roll or since you're listening for someone coming

92
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:41,540
roll search okay damn it I failed an 86 on a 60 oh damn I still fail there's just silence and you

93
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:47,220
don't hear anything but then now that taking up your oral connection in your brain is a slight

94
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:54,860
little you turn back around there she is Angela with a flask in her hand just like taking a quick

95
00:11:54,860 --> 00:12:01,380
pull and she like puts it down and wipes her mouth she's like some coffee and water over here I mean

96
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:07,460
that's fine I assume they would have a bar but it's kind of early to be starting in it and Angela

97
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:12,180
I don't I don't know if we should be drinking before we start are we not on vacation oh you're

98
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:17,180
right I guess the work is something we can focus on at a sober time that's fine that's fine that's

99
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:21,460
makes sense and then she puts it back in her little clutch that she was carrying you guys

100
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:26,260
would have had luggage with you I was just about to ask have we been to our cottage yet no you have

101
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:33,020
not okay so are you carrying yeah suitcases yeah okay once we once we get checked in then maybe we

102
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:37,020
can break out the flask I just think that we should focus you know make sure our heads are

103
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:41,580
clear when they give us instructions and things like that she walks up to you slowly puts her

104
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:48,820
hand on your chest I just knew that once we got here you would be receptive and you'll make the

105
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:57,660
best go of this possible I love you look love you too Angie that goes without saying well that was

106
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:05,540
weird yeah we're gonna get real weird together Oh Joe maybe Oh babe

107
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:20,220
Thomas my character is off on his own it's the circular room there's no corners but it looks

108
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:25,540
like he's somehow managed to like squeeze himself into a corner kind of space you don't know how

109
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:31,420
he's done it but how is he done it he's he's created like he is just projecting this air of

110
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:38,680
like impenetrable personal space around him and he is he has a pager in one hand and he's looking

111
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:43,840
down at it and he's talking on a big old-fashioned cell phone in the other hand kind of quietly he's

112
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:51,080
wearing a nondescript CSU gray hoodie jeans and sneakers and a baseball cap and sunglasses

113
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:57,000
indoors and you are having a difficult time hearing the person at the other end of your

114
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:06,240
phone call as the service keeps cutting in and out what did you say and what I I'm having a

115

difficult time hearing you as the service keeps cutting in and out so good so good wow that was

116

121
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:05,760
at it I'm sure I'll never slip up so Martin you're standing at six o'clock on this island and in

122
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:12,800
front of you is a long cobblestone pathway leading to a large hexagonal building this is the main

123
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:21,040
main Lodge for the calm comfy campground on either side of this cobblestone pathway or flower beds

124
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:27,720
just filled with these beautiful flowers of all different shape and shade and on either side of

125
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:36,440
you are just tons of bushes and trees and greenery it would be decently thick to have to walk through

126
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:42,840
but you can kind of see through on either side these beautiful little cozy cottages that are

127
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:49,920
lined out evenly across the island on the shore of this circular island standing there kind of

128
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:56,880
looking around you notice that kind of behind you off to the side a little bit there's a man

129
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:04,600
short stout man in his later years older guy he's got a thick white beard he's wearing a dark

130
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:12,960
navy beanie and a wool plaid shirt under olive corduroy overalls and he is just staring out at

131
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:19,680
the water Martin takes a deep breath and does it smell does it smell good it smells strange it's

132
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:26,120
it's it's not a smell that you've smelled before but with the Sun shining down from directly above

133
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:34,120
on you and this beautiful scenery it makes the smell seem nice is there at least also a smell

00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:33,880
o'clock nine o'clock and eleven o'clock on this island and through all this dense tree line and

264
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:38,520
stuff you can still see these cottages they're tucked away and you notice with your keen

265
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:47,360
investigative eyes so this is an automatic success because your alertness and your search I'm

266
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:58,400
guessing are super fucking high yes confirmation and so on top of cottage three which is immediately

267
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:03,240
to your right as you're walking up to this large building you see down this long cobblestone

268
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:10,000
pathway this cottage and on top of the roof of that cottage just far in the distance but with

269
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:20,320
your eagle eyes you see a young girl with pigtails on top and she's messing with some wiring hmm can

270
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:25,960
I get a little closer take a look at that yeah sure my investigative nature would be like I

271
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:30,960
gotta see what's going on yeah you'll have to get off the trail the path and go through some of the

272
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:36,400
trees unless you want to go into this building and then around the side yeah let's do that yeah

273
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:45,520
as you're walking through the brush you notice that she pulls out binoculars oh I'm familiar

274
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:52,840
with these items and they are pointed directly at you you're not so used to being on this side

275
00:33:52,840 --> 00:34:00,800
of binoculars yeah I think I would uh awkwardly wave to like acknowledge like hi can I can see

276
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:06,600
you seeing me just like like a kind of an awkward like raise of the hand immediately she dips back

277
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:14,720
behind this like roof area and is out of sight okay I think I think I'd maybe still keep walking

278
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:19,360
towards that way or would this be weird what I would I know not to you wouldn't know anything

279
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:26,720
okay yeah I'll just I will investigate that's what that's what I do baby yeah as you're walking

280
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:33,920
closer and closer you see this little girl take off running from behind cottage three and she's

281
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:40,200
running along the shoreline of the lake toward cottage number one I will kind of like hurriedly

282
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:46,680
follow hey hey what are you doing like trying to get her attention see if she responds at all she

283
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:52,760
does not turn back and she continues to run toward the cottage and you see she goes around the back

284
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:59,680
of the cottage and disappears I'm gonna with a hurried a little pep in my step hurry towards

285
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:05,800
it just to be like what's what's going on here yeah so moving through all these trees and branches

286
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:11,680
and brambles you make your way into a small clearing where this cottage is and it's really

287
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:19,000
cute and there's a nice little front door and a window in front and windows on the sides and you

288
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:25,040
see some movement through one of the side windows and you think it's basically the rough outline of

289
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:31,480
a small person can I look through the windows without it being like creepy that is entirely

290
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:38,640
up to the people who watch you creep them yeah I'm gonna try and do a little like like how I would

291
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:43,840
do like some kind of like stealthy search maneuvers creep up to the window and be able to

292
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:50,080
like peek roll alert actually first roll stealth sorry I haven't rolled with a character and so

293
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:57,120
so very long yeah this is is this the first one and the one shot for the patreon oh yeah but yeah

294
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:05,600
this is the first like this character isn't just hastily Justin party time party time for Justin

295
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:17,280
with pretending people couldn't remember the name of the show I pass 65 on a 70 okay so looking

296
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:22,960
through this window you see that there is this young girl with pigtails and she is wearing

297
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:30,800
overalls with a little striped shirt underneath overalls and she is sitting at the kitchen counter

298
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:38,280
and eating a sandwich and then walking in from the other room is an average build man he looks

299
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:45,480
to be in his late 30s but his eyes have aged and his hair his grade like someone who is in the war

300
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:52,000
or went through some sort of traumatic experience he's wearing a white dress shirt gray slacks and

301
00:36:52,000 --> 00:37:00,120
black shoes and he walks over pours a glass of milk and slides it over to the girl who then

302
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:08,000
drinks it okay I feel like a fucking creep I feel like a creep number one but I feel like I would

303
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:14,720
like try to dip out at this point because it looks like that's probably her dad or something yeah I

304
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:22,200
think at this point I'd be like oh I shouldn't be doing this like oh stealth it again nope it'll

305
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:26,840
count so you are enrolled a successful stealth we get up to that spot so you know exactly how

306
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:33,240
to get out of this spot yeah I will duck out to be like okay time to stop being a creep so now

307
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:38,240
the question you're at one o'clock do you want to enter the main building from that side of the

308
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:42,680
island or do you want to go all the way back around is there a reason we were going to the

309
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:47,800
there was just that was where you were and there was a sign on that side of the building that said

310
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:54,160
welcome to calm comfy campground and you see no such sign from this side okay yeah I'll go to the

311
00:37:54,200 --> 00:38:01,520
main building okay so you walk back through all this brush and all these trees and bushes and I

312
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:10,400
need you to roll an alertness check for me crit success 22 on a 70 crit success yeah that's

313
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:20,160
fucking awesome so my first ever as you're walking your foot your toe cap hits a wire

314
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:28,760
and it lifts up off the ground as you step and immediately your eyes follow this wire to a tree

315
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:37,960
and then looking about 12 feet up the tree you see the small lens of a camera that's poking out

316
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:44,560
from a knot in this tree what the fuck can I investigate it yeah what do you want to do how

317
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:49,200
high up did you say it was 12 feet I'm gonna try and like clamber up it a little bit yeah

318
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:55,960
roll survival or athletics to climb up this tree because sometimes climbing a tree is for your

319
00:38:55,960 --> 00:39:02,000
survival I'll do athletics because I ain't got no survival I'm from the city man what's your

320
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:12,840
athletics 50 all right roll it up hard fail okay so trying to get up this tree you realize that

321
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:17,520
there aren't any branches low enough and there's no like grips on this tree that are in the direct

322
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:22,720
area to begin a climb so you can't even get off the ground I think I'll just leave it alone for

323
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:27,560
now because I'm I would assume it's for some kind of security or something and I don't want to like

324
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:33,080
knock it out with a rock or anything so I would I'm just gonna be like okay that's weird maybe

325
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:39,520
I'll come back here later sounds good yeah so when you walk back around to the front of this

326
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:44,640
large building you see that sign and there are two double doors on a porch a couple steps up to

327
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:50,400
a porch and then the double doors going in I go ahead and enter upon entrance you see this

328
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:57,480
beautiful rustic and elegant lobby with a large wooden chandelier hanging above you to your right

329
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:06,080
there is a young boy and to your left there is an old man and I'll bring Luke into the building

330
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:12,520
which one do you think he is the young boy yeah God for the voices sake I hope it's a young boy

331
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:27,240
not as creepy old man voice is it anything like people puby so at that exact moment the recording

332
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:35,760
cut out and we ran out of space on that hard drive perfectly timed because Luke and Justin

333
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:45,120
went on with that voice for a while well I got just enough time to really get into it and now

334
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:57,720
I'm changing my voice Jesus so Charles Digby you walk into this foyer look up see everything that

335
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:05,080

372
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:58,680

373
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:06,160
large hexagonal building and inside we find a room that is circular the wall never ceasing and

374
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:12,240
never creasing at any point even where the wall meets the ceiling and the floor the angles are

375
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:19,120
rounded off there are six chairs and a half circle facing a single chair in front of them

376
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:24,480
each chair has a bottle of water next to it and standing around this room or sitting in these

377
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:31,440
chairs are the four of you along with two others and the door opens and a man of a man of average
