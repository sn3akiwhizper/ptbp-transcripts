1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,200
my closest comrades.

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:05,100
Some of you may have noticed a strange occurrence

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,920
in the past couple weeks.

4
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:10,960
I, Wolf the Dog, your fearless leader,

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,640
have been held against my will for a time.

6
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,340
But I have escaped the torturous restraints

7
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:19,820
of Judge Ephraim Cortland's sloppy meat trees

8
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:20,920
he calls hands.

9
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,360
And I am now back triumphantly crawling

10
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,000
once again into your ear holes.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,080
Here on 694.2 PTBP,

12
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:35,520
contention's oldest and only radio station.

13
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,240
Now that the true wolf is on the bone throne once again,

14
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,600
I think it's about damn time for some truth.

15
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,440
Fuck every billionaire.

16
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:47,080
Greed should only exist in the dumpster.

17
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:51,800
Mm, what's wet, stinky, and made for sharing?

18
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,960
It's the news.

19
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,600
No shit, that disgusting excuse of a human,

20
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,880
contention's so-called Judge Ephraim Cortland,

21
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,040
was keeping me locked up in a cell.

22
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm deeply sorry to leave you so unsatisfied

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,880
for so long, my pups.

24
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:11,840
I promise to never get caught in a slop trap ever again.

25
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,080
Trapped me with slop bait once, shame on you.

26
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,520
Trapped me with slop bait twice, shame on you.

27
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,080
Trapped me with slop bait three times,

28
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,920
what the fuck is wrong with you?

29
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,760
It's clear I can't help myself.

30
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,400
And your crew would just take an advantage of that?

31
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,760
Jesus.

32
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:31,080
Anyway, maybe we should burn down the courthouse.

33
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,240
Silas Cole can host any trials or legal matters

34
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,160
out on his property by the mine.

35
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,840
And he may as well preside over them too.

36
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,920
He is, after all, the reason contention

37
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,480
is so very prosperous.

38
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,000
Slap your knee to the beat if you agree.

39
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,080
It's the Creek Rocks with

40
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,480
Can't You Hear the Wolves Are Howlin'?

41
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:55,600
["Can't You Hear the Wolves Are Howlin'?" plays in bright rhythm.]

42
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,480
["Can't You Hear the Wolves Are Howlin'?" plays in bright rhythm.]

43
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,920
Do you guys know where the word howdy comes from?

44
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,680
No.

45
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,520
No.

46
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,480
How do you do?

47
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,320
Yeah.

48
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,560
How do you do?

49
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,960
How did I not know that?

50
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,080
Howdy.

51
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,720
They shortened how do you do down to how do ye.

52
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,560
Howdy.

53
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,360
Which then became howdy.

54
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,200
Howdy.

55
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,080
Howdy.

56
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,400
How did I not know that?

57
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,240
Hey.

58
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,480
Ooh.

59
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,480
Got it.

60
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,440
I've got something that good for you here.

61
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,480
Why did the cowboy take hay to bed

62
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,840
to feed his nightmares?

63
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,080
Oh my God.

64
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,920
Mm.

65
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,760
Mm-hmm.

66
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,600
Mm-hmm.

67
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,720
Mm-hmm.

68
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,800
Got any others?

69
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,160
Yeah, you got any other good ones?

70
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,000
No, no more good.

71
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,440
No, no good ones, but I've got another one.

72
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,280
What did you Google?

73
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,680
It looks like he's really enjoying it.

74
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,800
I'm Googling cowboy jokes.

75
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,800
Am I frozen or something?

76
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,720
Yeah, you're frozen, but you're doing a cute little smile.

77
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,240
It's a very cute smile.

78
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,080
A hand behind the head.

79
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:48,920
Oh, another cute smile.

80
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,680
Very mischievous, Luke.

81
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,720
Oh my God, that one's even better.

82
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,680
What do you call a happy cowboy?

83
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,160
A jolly rancher.

84
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,000
Oh.

85
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,600
Got it.

86
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,360
Luke, have you delivered this joke before?

87
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,720
No, but I just was trying to think.

88
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,680
Luke's been sending him these all week.

89
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,880
Okay, my internet seems to be fucking up,

90
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:20,360
so let me try, okay, my hotspot is on,

91
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:25,360
but it's not showing up in my, oh, here we go.

92
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,320
Okay, I probably will disconnect for a second.

93
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,160
Bye.

94
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,000
Goodbye.

95
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,960
Quick, let's make all our Luke jokes right now.

96
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,920
Am I still here?

97
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,760
Fuck.

98
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,000
Okay, that worked.

99
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You could have kicked Luke

100
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,800
and we could have had an all out Luke roast.

101
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,400
It's not a roast unless I'm here.

102
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,800
Yeah, you're yeah.

103
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,720
Yeah, you're yeah.

104
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,360
Did you see that Alec Baldwin roast

105
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,880
with like his daughter was doing it?

106
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,240
Yeah.

107
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,680
Yeah, pretty bad.

108
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,040
Yeah, it hit pretty hard.

109
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,160
That way Alec Baldwin got roasted by his daughter.

110
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,040
Yeah, like at a roast thing and the opening.

111
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,840
Oh my God, Luke's frozen in the exact same.

112
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,200
It's in spotting, it was just the smile.

113
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,360
That's insane.

114
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,240
Fuck.

115
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,080
Can you hear me?

116
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:10,920
Screenshot.

117
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:16,240
It's so cute.

118
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,200
What a cutie.

119
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,680
I hope he looks like that forever.

120
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,680
He will, have you seen his fucking dad?

121
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,480
Oh, that's so true.

122
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:28,040
Well, Efron fell off his damn old horse,

123
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:31,080
broke his big ass spine in twain.

124
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,240
I fucking wish.

125
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,560
Everett crawled inside him.

126
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,320
Oh, okay, let's go.

127
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,680
Okay, am I good?

128
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,680
You seem good.

129
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,520
Okay.

130
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,520
Yeah.

131
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,440
Can you put your arm behind your head

132
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,040
and smile for us really quick?

133
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:50,360
Silas Cole is on his knees with his hands behind his back

134
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:54,000
shackled by preacher-sheriff Dr. Bobby Custard

135
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,120
with Judge Ephraim Cortland standing right behind him,

136
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,480
right next to the preacher-sheriff doctor

137
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:04,840
watching as Jack Perlman, Professor Horace Green

138
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,720
and Everett Pace loaded the rug out of the back

139
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:13,760
of Silas Cole's wagon and then slowly unfurled the rug

140
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:18,040
after seeing shoes on one side and Everett, I believe,

141
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:22,120
reached in to the other side and felt some patchy hair,

142
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,800
a very thin-skinned scalp,

143
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,160
almost touching the skull right off the bat.

144
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,240
And as soon as the rug is completely unfurled,

145
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,680
hopping onto all four haunches, haunches?

146
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,680
Haunches.

147
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,120
You're on your own with this one.

148
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,920
Haunches.

149
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:48,040
Haunches are like, would be with your legs, right?

150
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,240
Hopping onto her back two haunches

151
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,800
with her human arms in front of her.

152
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,240
Are they touching the ground, the front arms?

153
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,920
No, she's in a two and a half point stance.

154
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,040
Velociraptor.

155
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:08,720
Which means she's got like one arm kind of halfway down.

156
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,640
The other one's on a knee, elbow on a knee.

157
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:15,480
You notice there are no fingernails on her hands

158
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,920
that are moving back and forth quickly

159
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,840
with these wild eyes.

160
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,320
She just slits right under them

161
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,520
from where her cheekbones are poking through

162
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:28,040
the thin skin on her face, blood dripping down

163
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:32,400
and she lets out a guttural scream.

164
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,680
Run, run, run, run.

165
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,760
And then we're gonna go ahead and roll

166
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,640
to see who she attacks.

167
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,960
Oh boy.

168
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,560
If it's a one or a two, she's gonna attack Jack Perlman.

169
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,400
No.

170
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,520
If it's a two or a three, she's gonna attack,

171
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,520
oh, three or four, she's gonna attack Everett Pace.

172
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,360
No.

173
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:55,520
Five or six, it's gonna be Professor Horse Green.

174
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,160
Hey Luke, can you roll a D6 for me

175
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,400
and tell me what you get?

176
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,640
Six.

177
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,760
Oh, that's gonna be Professor Horse Green

178
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,040
that she jumps directly toward.

179
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,920
You made him your executioner.

180
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,320
Hey Luke, do you wanna hurt one of your friends?

181
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,560
Sorry.

182
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:19,680
What does Professor Horse Green do as this human

183
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,680
wearing these unfathomably out of fashion clothes

184
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:30,760
with thin skin, open mouth, tongue waggling about,

185
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,240
jumping at you, arms first,

186
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,920
these fingernail-less hands going to grip

187
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,760
onto either side of your shoulders.

188
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,280
He shoots at her with his pistol.

189
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,280
And gets a,

190
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,160
And gets a what?

191
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,680
A hundred.

192
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,520
Oh no.

193
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,160
Oh my God.

194
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,000
What?

195
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:01,920
What?

196
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,240
Holy shit.

197
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,080
You nailed it.

198
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,800
Oh no.

199
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,720
What are the chances of that?

200
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,200
Holy shit.

201
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,960
Professor Horse Green, your sidearm

202
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,000
is still in the holster when you reach down to grab it,

203
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,800
pull it out, and you flick the trigger

204
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,120
right there on your holster.

205
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,480
Go ahead and roll damage.

206
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,120
What's the damage on that pistol?

207
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,600
Ah.

208
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,240
That's one D10 plus two.

209
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,640
Holy shit.

210
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,080
Nice.

211
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:42,960
Six.

212
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,400
Professor Horse Green,

213
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,160
your kneecap goes right into the dirt.

214
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:53,120
Bone shards from your knee are now sticking up

215
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,480
out of the dirt as blood just begins spurting

216
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:01,400
a fountain of blood away from your leg

217
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:05,680
out onto this dusty ground beneath you.

218
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,640
How many hit points did you have total?

219
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,760
I was at 11.

220
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,400
Yeah, so I'm going to need a constitution check there

221
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,800
to stay conscious, buddy.

222
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,000
Got a 50.

223
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,080
And I roll an 85.

224
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:25,240
Horse Green instantly collapses unconscious

225
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,800
as he bleeds out on the ground.

226
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,040
Oh shit.

227
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,040
Damn.

228
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,000
Holy shit.

229
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,840
What?

230
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,800
I might get to play video games a little bit earlier

231
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,000
than I thought tonight.

232
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,200
Oh my God.

233
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,000
He's been practicing with Red Dead,

234
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,040
but only using the bow and arrow.

235
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,160
Judge F from Courtland, it is your turn.

236
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,080
What do you do?

237
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:02,280
From what I'm seeing, I'm busy with Silas

238
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:05,520
and I just hear a scream and I turn around

239
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:08,600
and I see her like hunched over.

240
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,640
So I'm like within an arm's reach of my horse.

241
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,320
So I grabbed my lasso off the horse

242
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,280
and try to get her with the lasso,

243
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:21,320
like around her arms and try to demobilize her.

244
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,720
Roll rope use for me.

245
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,560
Okay.

246
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,080
That is a 85 on a 40.

247
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:27,920
Oof.

248
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,720
Oh no.

249
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,280
Well, this isn't going great so far.

250
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,840
Oh shit, my internet just went out.

251
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,360
Fuck, I wasn't recording either.

252
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,320
Damn it.

253
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,160
Oops.

254
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,600
Yeah, we're gonna have to do it again.

255
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,600
Yeah, we're gonna have to do all live from the get go.

256
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,240
So as I hear the scream, I turn around,

257
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,280
grab the lasso and throw the lasso,

258
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:58,120
but I had forgotten to tie the rope into a lasso.

259
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,520
So I just threw the end of a rope at her.

260
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,720
So the end of a rope hits her in the shoulder

261
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,640
and it's a heavy rope and she grabs on

262
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,160
to the other end of the rope.

263
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,800
Preacher Sheriff Bobby Custard.

264
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,040
Oh no.

265
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,280
Freezes in terror.

266
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,640
Just failed a sanity check.

267
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:29,040
A sanity check that I forgot to have all of you roll,

268
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,080
which you'll need to roll now.

269
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,400
I'm not conscious, baby.

270
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,440
You are unconscious, so you are good.

271
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,000
Oh, I rolled a crit fail.

272
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,640
Oh my God.

273
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,480
Did you really?

274
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,600
Welcome to the party, baby.

275
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,960
I rolled a 99.

276
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,120
Ooh, I got a 33 on a 50.

277
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,200
Crit success.

278
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,040
There you go.

279
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,360
Okay, I got a normal success.

280
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,960
And bringing the luck back up to our side.

281
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,800
Oh my God.

282
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,840
God damn these beautiful dice that Joe gave me.

283
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:59,480
Okay, Everett Pace, you lose no sanity.

284
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,640
Not sure how, not sure why.

285
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:05,560
It just looks like a scared battered woman in front of me.

286
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,840
She's just wild with fear.

287
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,960
And therefore you'd lose one sanity

288
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:13,280
because the success is still losing one sanity on this one.

289
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,120
That is my apologies.

290
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,240
She's real beat up though and that's not right.

291
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,120
It's definitely not right.

292
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:23,120
Judge Ephraim Courtland, you're going to lose zero sanity

293
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,280
with the full disregard that you have for all humans.

294
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:31,080
Yeah, I've seen countless people hanging by my own hand,

295
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,160
so really doesn't affect me too much.

296
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,040
Honestly, those smashed up watermelons

297
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,480
made me feel worse than this.

298
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,640
Glad I could add some horror for Judge Ephraim Courtland

299
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,840
in this short arc.

300
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:47,080
Jack Perlman, you're gonna lose a D4 plus one,

301
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,440
except for with a crit fail,

302
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:51,640
that D4 is automatically a four,

303
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,320
which means that you lose five sanity,

304
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,600
which just happens to be enough for you

305
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,880
to have a short bout of insanity.

306
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,880
Yay. Oh, lucky.

307
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,120
Yeah, that sounds fun.

308
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,240
Yeah, it's super fun.

309
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,640
So this is the thing where I'm gonna have you rank,

310
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:13,160
fight, flight, or freeze from most likely to least likely.

311
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:16,040
Fight, freeze, flight, most likely fight.

312
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,480
If you roll a one, you're gonna run away.

313
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,000
If you roll a two or a three,

314
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,360
you're gonna freeze for one round,

315
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,640
and if you roll four, five, six,

316
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,720
you will immediately fight,

317
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:33,240
which would just be fine in this situation, seemingly.

318
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,800
That'll be a freeze.

319
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,640
Perfect.

320
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,640
So Jack Perlman, on your turn,

321
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,680
Me and Bobby, doin' the Lord's work.

322
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,560
You're gonna do what future Sheriff Dr. Bobby Custard

323
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,160
is doing, which is...

324
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:49,200
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh.

325
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,480
Everett Pace, it is your turn.

326
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,040
Judge Courtland threw the lasso.

327
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,440
She grabbed onto it, so she's still holding it onto her end,

328
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,080
and he's holding onto his end, right?

329
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,080
That is correct, yes.

330
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,320
I wanna grab the rope anywhere that I can

331
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,360
to pull as hard as I can,

332
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,840
the purpose being to have her fall on her face.

333
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,680
Sounds good.

334
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,840
You roll, I'll roll.

335
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:13,120
Everett, you just roll strength.

336
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:13,960
Will do.

337
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,920
I pass a 23 on a 50.

338
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,960
I pass with a 46.

339
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,520
Fuck.

340
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,800
How does that...

341
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,920
That is an interesting question, Everett Pace.

342
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,040
Can we just be in a stalemate on the tug?

343
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,960
You know what, yeah, since we both passed,

344
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,360
the rope goes completely taut,

345
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,760
and she's looking directly at you

346
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:46,320
with these wild, wild eyes.

347
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,160
Roll psychology.

348
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,880
Son, I ain't got none of that.

349
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,800
A 96 on a 10.

350
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,720
I got natural world out the wazoo.

351
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,680
Would that help me?

352
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,200
Yeah, go ahead and roll that.

353
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,160
I pass that a 53 on an 80.

354
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,840
You've seen a feral possum.

355
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,360
Yeah, for sure.

356
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:12,680
These eyes, this sick combination of fear,

357
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:17,040
loathing, and pure rage of needing to survive.

358
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,360
And Las Vegas.

359
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:23,800
Has only ever been seen in modern day in Las Vegas,

360
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:28,160
and in the eyes of feral possums,

361
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,760
and I'm sure other things.

362
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,960
Feral mongese.

363
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,320
No, those are cute no matter what.

364
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,160
Oh, I'm sorry.

365
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,000
And with that...

366
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,200
Feral skunks.

367
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,720
It's Jack Perlmanster.

368
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,920
Oh, I get to do something. Feral spirits.

369
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,440
No, I just want you to tell me...

370
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,600
How scared I am.

371
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,720
Will Ferrell? Yeah, just talk to me

372
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,720
about what's happening in your brain.

373
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,440
So inside of Jack's brain,

374
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,600
he's been beaten down just sanity-wise

375
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,280
over and over and over again from the get-go,

376
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:05,080
because I think I failed every sanity roll this time.

377
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,040
But he's just hit the breaking point

378
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,520
where it's like the rubber band of stress

379
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:13,480
has been stretched too much, and it snapped.

380
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,120
And when it snapped, he just, he can't do anything.

381
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,840
He doesn't know how to put it back together

382
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,680
and do something that's useful right now.

383
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,960
Paralyzed.

384
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,280
I'm paralyzed with fear, baby.

385
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,320
He says to Everett.

386
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,880
Hey, Everett, I can't move.

387
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,920
I'm too scared right now.

388
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,320
And as those thoughts are going through your brain,

389
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,960
out of the corner of your eye,

390
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,880
you see Tilde be this crazed teenage girl

391
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:46,160
in a complete bout of madness in her own right,

392
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,560
drops the rope and lunges directly at your neck.

393
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:56,280
Unable to respond, she doesn't even try to pin you.

394
00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:00,480
She just like, mouth first, goes straight to your neck.

395
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,280
She misses the jugular.

396
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:05,560
She goes around the side, almost behind your ear,

397
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,120
and bites down.

398
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,880
You're gonna lose four damage.

399
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:15,680
As she bites down to where her teeth, top and bottom,

400
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,640
touch, and then she rips her head back.

401
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,120
Blood begins pouring down,

402
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:26,840
and you feel the shirt on your back become wet

403
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:31,360
with thick, hot Jack Pearlman blood juice.

404
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,600
That's yucky.

405
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,960
And she begins chewing.

406
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,940
Judge, Courtland, it is your turn.

407
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:45,120
So the rope gets let go of

408
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,760
and kind of, you know, loses all of the tension.

409
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,280
And the opium is really starting to hit the judge right now

410
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,720
combined with all the whiskey he's drank.

411
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,120
So he- I forgot about that.

412
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,200
He starts to nod off a little bit

413
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,920
and then wakes up and just starts to coil the rope

414
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,160
back and then takes a swig of whiskey

415
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:08,120
and just lackadaisically starts tying it

416
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,160
into an actual lasso.

417
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,000
Okay.

418
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,720
Unaware of what's happening to Jack.

419
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,960
Yeah, completely unaware.

420
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,360
Horace Green is now on the ground.

421
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,880
Jack Pearlman is standing there

422
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,600
with part of his shoulder neck.

423
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,200
His traps are missing on one side a little bit.

424
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,780
And blood gushing down his shirt.

425
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:33,220
Judge Ephraim Courtland staring off into the distance,

426
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:36,500
coiling up his lasso and ever at pace,

427
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:40,180
holding on to the other end of that there rope.

428
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:44,900
Silas Cole stands up from his position, still handcuffed,

429
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:49,900
and begins making his way toward the front door of the house

430
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:52,820
and he gets up onto the porch

431
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:57,820
before it is Bobby Custard's turn, who immediately turns.

432
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:03,220
Okay, now Silas, something crazy's going on here and...

433
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:07,380
And with that notices, Tildy B takes his attention

434
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:12,380
off of Silas and is going to fire at Tildy B. Mitchell.

435
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:16,740
Strikes true with eight damage.

436
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:17,820
Nice.

437
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:18,660
Yeah.

438
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:22,540
Fires three rounds into Tildy B. Mitchell's chest,

439
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:27,340
who staggers backwards and lets out another.

440
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:28,180
Ahhh!

441
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:34,980
Fuck.

442
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,940
Three bullet holes in her.

443
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:41,940
Blood begins pouring down her shirt

444
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:45,120
that is clearly the cut of another time.

445
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,460
I don't know how many different ways I can say that.

446
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,880
Some kind of future cloth.

447
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,780
What is Forever 21?

448
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:00,000
Everett Pace, it's your turn.

449
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:04,260
I wanna take some of the watermelon out of my pocket

450
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:06,700
and throw it toward her feet.

451
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,460
I'm trying to bait her, so I'm saying things like,

452
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:11,180
here, here, you hungry, you hungry?

453
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:13,540
Here, here, take some of this, take some of this.

454
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:16,160
And I'm just chucking watermelon out of my pockets

455
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,000
onto the ground in front of her.

456
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,140
I thought you were going for like a banana peel effect.

457
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:23,600
Either way, either way, I'll take either way.

458
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,380
Boy, howdy.

459
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:29,620
Okay, I bet you don't have charm.

460
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,220
So let's have you roll.

461
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:35,780
Even though Everett charms all of our hearts,

462
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:37,820
every week on PTBP.

463
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:42,540
I've got farming and this is a pretty classic farming skill.

464
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:45,740
You gotta throw watermelon at the ground sometimes.

465
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:50,740
For fertilizer to get the chickens back into the coop.

466
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:53,060
And if you run into a feral possum,

467
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:55,980
it's handy to have some watermelon in your pocket

468
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:58,140
to feed it to get its attention away from you

469
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:58,980
while you get away.

470
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:02,060
Yeah, so give him like a plus 20 on that roll, Zach.

471
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:04,260
You could just do that for us real quick.

472
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:11,340
Okay, roll farming.

473
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:12,220
Are you, okay.

474
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:14,620
I pass.

475
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:19,300
It's a 41 out of 60.

476
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:24,300
This watermelon goo in the most appetizing way

477
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,400
you possibly could have.

478
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,500
Michelin star.

479
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:33,140
For an animal, oh my God.

480
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:36,180
This watermelon goop is so well plated

481
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:38,900
on this dusty, dusty ground.

482
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,700
As if I was planting it.

483
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:43,460
That's how well it's landed in this ground.

484
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,180
Jesus.

485
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,820
Yeah, no matter what happens,

486
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,700
whether I remember to or not,

487
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:54,540
the epilogue of this story is the growth

488
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,300
of watermelons next year.

489
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:00,980
Hey, I wanna throw that watermelon on the ground

490
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,280
and start getting out of there.

491
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,260
It's a distraction.

492
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:05,180
So I'm walking back toward the horses.

493
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:09,380
Can our next arc be like going inside one of the characters

494
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:11,340
cause he swallowed a watermelon seed

495
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:14,060
and it's gonna grow inside of him.

496
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,420
We gotta get it out.

497
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:17,180
Are you playing the watermelon seed?

498
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,020
Sure.

499
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:18,840
Yes.

500
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,880
Watermelon seeds.

501
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,400
We're food in the next arc.

502
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,480
Everett, go ahead and roll.

503
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,000
Are you trying to sneak away

504
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,200
or are you just kind of walking?

505
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,080
Just kind of walking,

506
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,840
hoping that I distracted her enough

507
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,960
that her attention is not on me.

508
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:34,780
Okay.

509
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:35,620
But I don't have stealth.

510
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:37,700
I mean, that's just not something I can do.

511
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,960
Yeah, no, you can walk away.

512
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,800
That's fine.

513
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,200
There wasn't a lot to hide behind anyway.

514
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,260
No big rocks.

515
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,680
I mean, if you're on stealth, big rock appear.

516
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,840
You roll stealth, big rock appear.

517
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,800
Jack Promo, what are you up to?

518
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:55,120
Oh, you know, slowly dying probably.

519
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,520
That's what it feels like

520
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:59,560
as I put my hand over what used to be

521
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,040
part of my neck and shoulder.

522
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,040
And now I assume it's like a donut.

523
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,680
Like when you take just a single or like a bagel

524
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,920
and it's that perfectly round bite,

525
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:12,320
but just out of the chunk of my well-toned shoulders.

526
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,320
Oh, Jack.

527
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:17,320
You ever fall in love with your own character?

528
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:20,320
Yep, that's exactly why.

529
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:25,920
Roll to, I want to roll to kiss Jack Pearlman.

530
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,020
Justin does.

531
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,120
Oh, I crit failed again.

532
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:33,120
Am I like kind of shocked back into reality

533
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,560
with the bite I'm assuming?

534
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,400
I'm like, whoa.

535
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,220
Yeah.

536
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,840
You were in slow-mo before.

537
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:42,840
And then as soon as she rips the muscle up out of your neck,

538
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:47,280
everything fast-forwards back in place.

539
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,540
Back to reality.

540
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:49,640
Back to reality.

541
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:52,600
I want to like try and,

542
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:55,960
is she like real fast and kind of like spindly and wiry?

543
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,640
Yeah, she's not giving up that easy.

544
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,960
I would like to like,

545
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,400
can I like grapple her to the ground almost

546
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,920
and like hold her down on the ground?

547
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,440
You can certainly try to do that, yeah.

548
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,260
Okay.

549
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:07,100
Shove her face in that watermelon.

550
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:09,600
I have fighting brawl or strength, I don't know.

551
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,740
Fighting brawl would be the one

552
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:13,300
that I would like you to roll against me on.

553
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,140
Okey-dokey.

554
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:15,820
And yeah, I basically want to just like

555
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:18,600
grapple her to the ground and kind of like hold on to her,

556
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,580
but in a position where I cannot be bit, like.

557
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:22,540
Yes.

558
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:25,100
She succeeded with an off four.

559
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:27,140
I got a 10.

560
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:28,220
Yeah.

561
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,360
Yeah, that'll do.

562
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,860
With a success.

563
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:31,700
Hell yeah.

564
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,520
That'll do.

565
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:35,900
So for a pin, no damage will be dealt to her,

566
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:38,580
but you are now pinning her,

567
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:42,100
which gives her a negative and you a positive

568
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:45,580
on your next rolls and her a negative on any opposing rolls.

569
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:46,420
Okay.

570
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,260
You're moving forward.

571
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:49,500
However, as you have her pinned to the ground,

572
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,020
you look around you.

573
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:52,200
Right next to you on the ground,

574
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,860
you see Professor Horace Green,

575
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:56,300
who just lost another hit point this round.

576
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,780
Oh no.

577
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,140
Four.

578
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,340
Oh shit.

579
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:01,380
Damn.

580
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:04,300
Everett Pace, who is slowly backing away

581
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,140
from the entire situation.

582
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:10,740
Silas Cole, who is on the porch of the house,

583
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:13,540
heading into his home, hopefully.

584
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:15,960
Preacher Sheriff Bobby Custard,

585
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,520
who is gun drawn looking around.

586
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,320
So he seems to be a good ally here.

587
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,460
And Judge Ephraim Courtland,

588
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:24,260
who seems to not care so much about all this,

589
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:26,140
care far more about getting his rope

590
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:29,540
back into its upright position.

591
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:32,820
Y'all better get on over here and help me out now.

592
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:33,640
Everett.

593
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:37,240
He's walking away from me.

594
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,840
It's Tildy B. Mitchell's turn again

595
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,880
and I'm gonna go pee real quick.

596
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,640
Hey, I do wanna bring up for Horace's sake

597
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:46,680
that opium is a natural painkiller,

598
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,940
so if that can help in any way.

599
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,280
And he smoked some of it.

600
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,680
Yeah, no, he can't feel it.

601
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,560
You like that?

602
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,600
Good, good.

603
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,240
He can't feel that he's dying.

604
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:05,160
Can't believe I rolled a 99 and then a 10 on these guys.

605
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,400
High and low.

606
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,800
Thank God he hit that 10, though.

607
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,640
That gives us a moment.

608
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,960
I would have probably died, I think.

609
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,120
What happened to Horace Green?

610
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,700
That's when the dogs were getting here,

611
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:16,880
so I couldn't hear.

612
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,120
He shot his knee off.

613
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:22,440
He crit failed a gunshot.

614
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,320
Oh, no.

615
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,360
Did she attack you first and then you did it?

616
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,680
He said that she was going to attack him,

617
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,360
so he preemptively shot.

618
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,600
Yeah, I tried to shoot at her and just blew my knee off.

619
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,400
Oh, my God.

620
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,480
I thought she'd like crit attacked you

621
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,300
or something like that in success.

622
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,320
That's crazy.

623
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,600
Good old crit fail.

624
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,560
Always fun.

625
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,720
It was a hundred, too.

626
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,120
It was the crittest of fails.

627
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,320
I saw the roll, but I didn't see what led up

628
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,760
or what happened because of it.

629
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,600
Oh, right.

630
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,600
That's fucking wild.

631
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,700
Wanna hear a joke?

632
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:54,680
Yeah, go for it.

633
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,800
Okay, a big Texan cowboy stopped at a local restaurant

634
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:02,080
following a day of drinking and roaming around in Mexico.

635
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,260
While sipping his tequila,

636
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:05,680
he noticed a sizzling scrumptious looking platter

637
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,360
being served at the next table.

638
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,320
Not only did it look good, but the smell was wonderful.

639
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,720
He asked the waiter, what is that you just served?

640
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,040
The waiter replied, ah, you have excellent taste.

641
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,520
Those are bull testicles from the bullfight this morning.

642
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,840
Delicacy.

643
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,960
The cowboy undaunted said, what the heck?

644
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,780
I'm on vacation.

645
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:22,620
I'll have some.

646
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:24,640
The waiter replied, I'm so sorry.

647
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,280
There's only one serving per day

648
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,600
because there's only one bullfight each morning.

649
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,080
If you place your order now,

650
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,840
we'll be sure to save you the delicacy for tomorrow.

651
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,740
The cowboy placed the order and the next evening,

652
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:37,520
he was served the one and only special delicacy of the day.

653
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,860
After a few bites and inspecting the contents

654
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:42,180
of his platter, he called to the waiter and said,

655
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:44,760
these are delicious, but they're quite a bit smaller

656
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,080
than the ones I saw you serve yesterday.

657
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,000
The waiter shrugged his shoulders and replied,

658
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,620
sometimes the bull wins.

659
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,280
Nice.

660
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,120
It's a good one.

661
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,040
So it was like he ate the person's balls.

662
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,440
He ate the matador's balls.

663
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:00,100
Nice.

664
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,400
If only he'd been there a day earlier,

665
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,680
he could have gotten the bull's testicles that he wanted.

666
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:06,440
Yeah, that's actually more of a dramatic tale

667
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,280
that you told us.

668
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:10,400
A cowboy asked me if I could help him round up 18 cows.

669
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,540
I said, sure, that's 20 cows.

670
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:20,600
I like it.

671
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:25,600
Jack Perlman, roll, brawling, fight again for me.

672
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:30,600
What if I don't want to tell you what I rolled

673
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,080
because it's 61 on a 60.

674
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:39,080
Oh, and with the success from this unnatural teenager,

675
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:44,560
Jack Perlman is thrown at least four feet in the air

676
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:48,480
and he lands on his back.

677
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,860
You'll take no damage from this, but.

678
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:54,960
It's scary, but don't make me roll a sanity, please.

679
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,520
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

680
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,360
Roll sanity.

681
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,180
Okay.

682
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,480
Fail.

683
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,960
Oh, God damn it.

684
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,280
I've lost nine sanity so far in these episodes.

685
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:15,600
Lose one more as you're staring up at the sky,

686
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,640
you think about, was Perlman a religious man?

687
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,840
No.

688
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:21,660
He is now.

689
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,280
Should have been praying.

690
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,360
Oh my God.

691
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,080
Judge F from Courtland, it's your turn.

692
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:32,640
After the judge gets his rope coiled up,

693
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:37,440
he notices that Silas is not on the ground by him anymore

694
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,640
and catches him out of the corner of his eye

695
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:43,260
and sees him running off towards his house.

696
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:44,520
And he's going to drop the rope

697
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:47,360
and just chase after Silas.

698
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,200
Okay.

699
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,280
And if I can get to him, I want to grab him.

700
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:54,680
Let's go ahead and have you roll.

701
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,280
Character sheet here.

702
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:59,000
Climb for climbing stairs.

703
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:03,760
Drive wagon coach, which is what everybody in town

704
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,360
calls your fat ass.

705
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,960
I'm not seeing anything.

706
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,920
So I'll have your old dexterity.

707
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:16,760
Okay.

708
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,800
29 on a 60.

709
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,280
Nice.

710
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,120
39.

711
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,160
Fuck.

712
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,000
Damn.

713
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,240
Gotcha, baby.

714
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,080
It makes sense.

715
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,280
Judge F from Courtland's this big lumbering creature,

716
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:34,340
almost as horrifying as Tildy B. Mitchell.

717
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:37,900
And he makes it right up onto the stairs

718
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:42,900
as Silas Cole slams the door directly in his face.

719
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,920
Ephraim stops at the stairs

720
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,240
and just kind of like blinks hard and looks

721
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,440
and takes another swig of his whiskey.

722
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:56,280
Preacher Sheriff, Dr. Bobby Custard is going to...

723
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,320
Save us all.

724
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:01,380
Actually, let's see who's going to roll this for me.

725
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:03,200
Joe, you can roll it.

726
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,480
Roll a D six.

727
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,640
If you roll a one, two or three,

728
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,440
he's going to shoot Tildy B. Mitchell.

729
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,800
If you roll four, five or six,

730
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,720
he's going to start giving first aid

731
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,220
to Professor Horse Green.

732
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,340
It's a four.

733
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:17,320
Right next to his bag,

734
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:22,320
he grabs his medicine bag out of his side saddle there,

735
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,540
part of his tack.

736
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:25,380
Nice.

737
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,600
Maybe, I don't know.

738
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,760
And he rushes to Horse Green

739
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:37,340
and begins successfully doing first aid.

740
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:42,640
Horse Green, conscious again, you gain three hit points.

741
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,360
Hello.

742
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:51,160
His eyes open and he says, hello.

743
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,000
I don't feel a thing.

744
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,240
Now his eyes open and he says,

745
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,080
Ah!

746
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,200
Ah!

747
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:01,300
Ah!

748
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,260
Help me!

749
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:07,640
And your face, it's your turn.

750
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,920
So she's devouring this watermelon

751
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:13,800
and she's just all about the watermelon right now, right?

752
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,720
Like it's probably her favorite thing right now, right?

753
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,520
She might be looking at the watermelon.

754
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,920
She's scrambling over toward it.

755
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,600
She thinks it's part of Jack still.

756
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,240
Her socks have little watermelon slices on them,

757
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,420
so you know she's a fan.

758
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:30,040
And he's trying to get to Sheriff Bobby Custard's horse

759
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,640
to grab the rifle out of the side saddle there.

760
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,460
Smart.

761
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:36,640
Can I get there in time and shoot or do I just get there?

762
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,040
No, you can get there and shoot.

763
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:42,000
I'd like to shoot at Tildy B, at the scary zombie lady.

764
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,480
Yeah, you don't know her name.

765
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,840
And she screams,

766
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:45,680
Ah!

767
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,520
Ah!

768
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,680
My name is Tildy B Bitcha!

769
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,440
So now we can all start calling her that.

770
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,460
Oh my God.

771
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,540
Oh, I can push.

772
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,840
So I rolled a 77.

773
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:05,520
That would be a crit fail on a 70.

774
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,800
I'm gonna push this roll.

775
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,200
I forgot about pushing.

776
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,620
Hey, you know what?

777
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:11,040
You can't push.

778
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,400
Oh, a fucking crit.

779
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,800
God damn it.

780
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,760
Oh, cool, okay.

781
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,820
God damn it.

782
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,680
Okay.

783
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:19,520
What?

784
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,280
Our dice are cursed tonight.

785
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,380
Fuck.

786
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:23,220
All right, yeah.

787
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:24,040
That was a crit fail with a...

788
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:24,880
Roll damage for me.

789
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,380
Yeah, okay.

790
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:28,560
That's a D10 plus four.

791
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,600
Ooh.

792
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,540
Four, so eight total.

793
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:32,720
Eight total?

794
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:33,560
Yeah.

795
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,280
Preach your sheriff, Dr. Bobby Custard, let's out a

796
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:43,160
Ew, oh, fucking shit!

797
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,840
Oh my gosh.

798
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,000
Oh, damn it.

799
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:51,960
With his own gun.

800
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:56,240
Professor Horace Green, the first thing you see actually

801
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:58,320
when you open your eyes and start screaming

802
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,860
once you've come back to reality a little bit,

803
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:06,800
the front of Preacher Sheriff, Dr. Bobby Custard's torso,

804
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:11,520
just on his left side, explodes through

805
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:16,080
and viscera and awful just starts kind of pouring out

806
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:16,920
the front of him.

807
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,480
My bad, my bad.

808
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,080
It's like you threw a crispy.

809
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:23,800
I criss-succeeded on my constitution check.

810
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,960
Hell yeah, so he instantly heals and we're all good.

811
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:27,920
Let's just keep going.

812
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:28,920
Whose turn is it now?

813
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,720
It is Jack Pearlman's turn as Preacher Sheriff,

814
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:39,440
Dr. Bobby Custard grabs almost the entire thing of gauze

815
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,560
in his pack and shoves it like a fistful

816
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:46,200
just right into his own gut.

817
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,880
Jack Pearlman gets his knife out.

818
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,600
He's going for blood.

819
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:56,200
He's going to stab Tildibee or swipe at her,

820
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,800
whatever, whatever works, whatever you think works.

821
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,960
Stab, swipe.

822
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,080
Stab, swipe.

823
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,360
So you're gonna roll.

824
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:05,480
I believe it's fighting brawl.

825
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:08,440
Unless you have a knife skill that's different than that.

826
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,680
The knife is brawl skill.

827
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:11,520
Oh, that's cool.

828
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,960
Well, I failed, so 72 on a 60.

829
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:17,400
She did too, so she won't be able to use your knife

830
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,080
against you in any way, but you're just.

831
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,920
Oh, it's good to know that's up for.

832
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,240
Oh, always.

833
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,800
She takes a negative if she's already gone this round,

834
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,720
that's just kind of how it works.

835
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,640
If she was to fight against one of you guys

836
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,520
and you could fight back,

837
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,800
you'd take a negative that round as well.

838
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,520
So I could push though if I wanted to

839
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,920
since I didn't crit fail.

840
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,920
Yes.

841
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,960
But then if I do fail, I crit fail.

842
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,280
Yeah, that is correct. I'm going for it.

843
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,800
Hell yeah, don't stab yourself.

844
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,680
I can't roll this bad this many times.

845
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,400
Right guys, right?

846
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,080
Famous last words.

847
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:55,560
Okay, so you swing wildly as she, Neo from the Matrix,

848
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:59,400
like bends back, dodging all of your side swipes.

849
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,000
What are you doing to try to?

850
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:04,400
So I like to imagine he has it where it's like down,

851
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,760
like he's holding it and it's going down

852
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,320
and he's swiping like that.

853
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,960
And then as he misses one of his swipes,

854
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:13,160
he's going to go for like jamming it into her instead.

855
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,280
The American plunge.

856
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,120
Yes.

857
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,880
Well, yeah.

858
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,960
She succeeds with a 20.

859
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,480
I fail with a 91.

860
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:26,600
Oh no, what is your damage on that knife, sir?

861
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:29,440
A D4 plus two plus a D4.

862
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,160
So two D4 plus two.

863
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,000
What kind of knife was that?

864
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,840
Cause he has a damage bonus.

865
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:35,680
The knife has a damage bonus.

866
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,640
I'm very strong, so when I stab myself,

867
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,000
it's going to hurt really bad.

868
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,760
All right, do you want to roll one D4

869
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,560
and I'll roll the other one or do you want?

870
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,320
We're connected through our dice.

871
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,040
I rolled a two.

872
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,760
I rolled a one, oh, thank God.

873
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,600
So five?

874
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,440
Yeah, five.

875
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,480
That's still not great.

876
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,880
How many hit points did you have?

877
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:58,840
I had 10 and now I have five.

878
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,000
What did you start with?

879
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:00,840
14.

880
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,920
Holy shit, okay.

881
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,520
You had 10, now you have five.

882
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:07,560
Taking half of your current hit points in one round.

883
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,760
I'm going to need a constitution check for you,

884
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,360
Jack Perlman, and you've been doing nothing

885
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,120
but rolling great this entire time.

886
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,840
So I'm sure you'll have no issues staying conscious.

887
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,560
I'm gonna use one of these metal babies.

888
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,400
Joe.

889
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,720
Metal baby.

890
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:23,200
I can't believe you fucked me like this, Joe.

891
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,080
Oops.

892
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:28,840
Wait a minute.

893
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:29,680
No.

894
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,520
A 10.

895
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:35,440
Can I only roll the worst ever or super low?

896
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,280
Wait, what did you tell me to roll?

897
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,120
No, that's great.

898
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,640
You're still good.

899
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,160
I was confused on what I asked you to roll.

900
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,440
So you can stay conscious.

901
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:45,760
That was a constitution check in order to stay conscious.

902
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:49,640
However, your knife is directly in between

903
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:52,280
the two bones in your femur.

904
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,280
Nope, femur's one bone.

905
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,120
Tibia and fibula.

906
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,120
What's the bone right next to the femur?

907
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,160
PP bone.

908
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,000
It's in your PP bone.

909
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,160
I stabbed my PP.

910
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,160
Tibia and fibula.

911
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,000
Is that your thigh?

912
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,440
That might be in your arm.

913
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,360
No, that's your leg.

914
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,720
It's the lower calf.

915
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:06,720
Lower part of the leg.

916
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,720
I broke them bad boys.

917
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,440
I don't know shit about no bones.

918
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,360
It's in my leg.

919
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:13,080
It's in your leg and it is scratching

920
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:15,640
up against your femur.

921
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:20,040
You think that if you were to pull out your femur bone

922
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:24,080
and look at it, it would have Tildi B's initials on it.

923
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,120
It's completely dug in there.

924
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:29,640
And she helped guide it away from her

925
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:32,240
and right back directly into your leg.

926
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,520
And it is stuck there.

927
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:37,480
How could she do that chewing on watermelon?

928
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,520
She's a great multitasker.

929
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:41,040
Yeah, you forgot to give me my plus 40 bonus.

930
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:44,920
So from watermelon distraction.

931
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,680
Professor Horace Green, it's been a while.

932
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:47,640
Indeed.

933
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,600
Am I still losing hit points?

934
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,480
No longer, no.

935
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,840
You've been stabilized by the good preacher sheriff doctor.

936
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:54,680
Oh, good.

937
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,560
I'd like to shoot Tildi B.

938
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,840
Yes, that does make sense.

939
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,640
If you'd like to roll firearms.

940
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:06,120
Oh, no.

941
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,200
It's not a crit fail, but a 95.

942
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:11,360
I'll push it, push it real good.

943
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,200
Fuck it.

944
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,040
Yeah, I'll push it.

945
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,640
Oh, no.

946
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,960
What's a crit fail if you fail a push, right?

947
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:24,800
Yeah.

948
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,240
Yeah, I failed.

949
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,880
Oh, boy.

950
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:32,880
Horace, yeah, Horace blind with pain tries to shoot again.

951
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:39,080
And what does he do, Zach?

952
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:41,440
Well, guess who's right above him.

953
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,280
Oh, no.

954
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:45,080
Who just got shot himself with his own rifle.

955
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,360
Who is just giving you first aid.

956
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:51,560
Who's right in between you and Tildi B. Mitchell.

957
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,920
Bubby.

958
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,800
Right before you can aim your gun down

959
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:59,680
to point at the unnatural creature tearing apart

960
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,320
Jack Pearlman with his own turns,

961
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:05,320
you fire the pistol on its way down.

962
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,800
Go ahead and roll damage for me.

963
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:14,320
Oh, boy.

964
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:17,000
Was it max damage?

965
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:17,920
It's 11.

966
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,520
Oh, my god.

967
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,960
I think we got it dead.

968
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,200
Holy shit.

969
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:29,960
Did you guys know that the gunfight at the OK Corral,

970
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:33,400
most famous, most infamous gunfight probably of the West,

971
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,400
happened in Tombstone in 1881?

972
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,800
People always think of it as this, you know,

973
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,800
Tombstone, right?

974
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,120
Big gunfight.

975
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,400
Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday.

976
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:48,840
It only lasted 30 seconds, which is five rounds of this game.

977
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:53,080
And we're at the end of round three currently.

978
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:56,240
So this all adds up to me.

979
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,040
Yeah.

980
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:57,560
Yeah.

981
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:01,240
In just 20 seconds, we've literally dismantled our shot.

982
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:04,640
Could you share if Dr. Bobby Custard's head explodes

983
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:08,600
and his body flies off in a completely different direction

984
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,520
than where you actually shot?

985
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:13,640
Quentin Tarantino style?

986
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:14,200
Yeah, no.

987
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,720
He flies into the back of the wagon.

988
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:20,680
His headless body is just flung.

989
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:23,920
You Gallagher'd his head.

990
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,000
It's weird that that's the first Gallagher reference.

991
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,920
I was trying to get a Gallagher reference at the other house,

992
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:32,360
and I just couldn't work it in.

993
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:36,280
And pretty sure if Dr. Bobby Custard is fully, fully dead,

994
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:41,200
I need everyone to roll sanity for me, even me,

995
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,880
since I didn't see it.

996
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:43,600
No, not you.

997
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:44,920
You feel like Cotton.

998
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,760
Hey, I crit failed again, so.

999
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:50,800
Jesus.

1000
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,600
My god, dude.

1001
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:53,520
What is happening?

1002
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,840
I don't know.

1003
00:42:55,840 --> 00:43:00,120
This has to be like our crit fails per minute

1004
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:03,080
has to be a record right now.

1005
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,440
So I lose like two sanity instead of one?

1006
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:06,640
Yeah.

1007
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,360
Yeah, that's exactly right.

1008
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,800
I regular failed.

1009
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:12,280
OK, you're going to lose one sanity, Everett Pace.

1010
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:14,680
Jack Perlman knew it would lose two sanity.

1011
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:17,240
And Professor Horace Green.

1012
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:18,280
I pass.

1013
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:19,360
Loses no sanity.

1014
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:22,840
Totally cool with what he did to that guy.

1015
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:26,720
And it blasted the wrong way, so he didn't even see it.

1016
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:29,240
Exactly.

1017
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:32,760
Completely blinded by the gunpowder.

1018
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,720
Unable to see.

1019
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:39,200
Here's a noise that sounds like, no, as it's happening.

1020
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,200
And honestly, that noise is coming out

1021
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:44,400
of these vocal cords that are hanging out

1022
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:48,240
the top of this body, just waggling back and forth

1023
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,920
in the arid wind.

1024
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:56,040
And you assume that that noise is Tildy B. Mitchell,

1025
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:58,400
the unnatural creature that you must have surely

1026
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,600
killed just now.

1027
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:03,160
However, at the top of this round,

1028
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:06,720
you all see Tildy B releases the knife that

1029
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:09,880
is in Jack Perlman's thigh and begins

1030
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:13,080
running as fast as she can.

1031
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:13,840
Away?

1032
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:14,680
Away.

1033
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:15,920
Oh.

1034
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:19,320
She runs around the backside of the house.

1035
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:22,640
And she actually runs so far in this round.

1036
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,520
This is a six-second round.

1037
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,640
She makes it about 75 yards.

1038
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:27,920
Holy fuck.

1039
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:34,520
And you could see that she is running up out of this area

1040
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:38,560
in a southwesterly direction.

1041
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:42,200
That's the son of a bitch what killed Dandelion.

1042
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:46,120
I yell to no one in particular.

1043
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:49,800
And with that is Judge Ephraim Cortland's turn.

1044
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:53,480
He walks up the stairs, kicks the door as hard as he can,

1045
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:56,040
and yells, Silas, get out here.

1046
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:58,560
I'll burn your fucking house down.

1047
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:02,880
And he is digging around in his pocket for his lighter.

1048
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,160
Holy shit.

1049
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,960
But I want to try to kick the door down at the same time.

1050
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,000
Thin door.

1051
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,280
You can certainly do that if everybody else could

1052
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:11,280
take their headphones off.

1053
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:12,100
Whew.

1054
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:26,280
Judge Ephraim Cortland, the smell of rotten flesh

1055
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:28,840
is the first thing you notice when

1056
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:31,800
you kick in the front door of the coal abode.

1057
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:34,320
At first, you think the stench could

1058
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:36,920
be from the unattended dishes strewn

1059
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:41,200
throughout this living room, the ruminants of several meals

1060
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,080
now covered in a few buzzing flies.

1061
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:48,480
But that static hum of these buzzing around flies

1062
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:53,560
is so loud in your ears due to the large swarm hovering

1063
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:58,080
above and about the body of Miss Kitty,

1064
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:02,120
which is laying lifeless across one of the sitting chairs.

1065
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:06,520
Lifeless, to be sure, because this body, the skin

1066
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:10,840
is chewed up so badly that chunks are hanging off

1067
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:15,000
or completely missing the dripping dark red blood pooling

1068
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,520
below on the floor, but especially

1069
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:21,280
lifeless due to the way this body is crumpled.

1070
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:27,360
Her back held directly in the middle by one of the armrests

1071
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:33,320
there at an unnatural angle as the top half of her torso

1072
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:37,920
dangles straight down perpendicular to the floor.

1073
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:44,400
Roll sanity.

1074
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:48,360
A 50 on a 50.

1075
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:49,240
Oh.

1076
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:53,000
Make it a 49 as you lose one sanity

1077
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,320
from this horrifying scene.

1078
00:46:56,320 --> 00:47:02,280
And go ahead and roll a listen check for me.

1079
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:03,120
Fail.

1080
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:04,240
That is all.

1081
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:05,560
I'm going in.

1082
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:07,040
Can I see Silas or?

1083
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:07,840
No, no.

1084
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:09,600
So this is a shotgun style house.

1085
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:12,640
So basically front door leads to the first room

1086
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:15,040
and there's one door all the way ahead of you.

1087
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:15,640
Yep.

1088
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:16,840
I'm going to keep going.

1089
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:17,960
I want to find Silas.

1090
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:21,600
And you're going to be able to make it to the next door.

1091
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:23,240
Is it a closed door?

1092
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:24,320
It's not like an archway.

1093
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:26,320
It is a closed door.

1094
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:32,400
While I'm going, I'm yelling, Silas, get your ass out here.

1095
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:32,880
Awesome.

1096
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:47,960
As this speedy, speedy teenage non-human

1097
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:51,520
takes off into the distance, Judge Courtland

1098
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,920
kicks in the door of the Silas home,

1099
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:57,560
takes in his surroundings before you hear,

1100
00:47:57,560 --> 00:48:01,520
Silas, get your ass out here.

1101
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:02,720
Sorry.

1102
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:03,520
Who is it?

1103
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,160
So many people on this list are dead now.

1104
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:05,640
Everett.

1105
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:10,080
It is Everett Pace.

1106
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:14,480
I want to keep my gun now trained on the front door,

1107
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,480
kind of given whatever kind of cover

1108
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:18,160
I can if somebody comes out that front door.

1109
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:20,160
But I want to be making my way to whoever

1110
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:23,920
looks most injured between Jack and Horace.

1111
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:25,720
I could visually tell that, couldn't I?

1112
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:28,160
You would be able to visually tell which one is more injured.

1113
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:29,560
Jack, what are your hit points at?

1114
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:30,480
Five.

1115
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:31,920
What are you at, Thomas?

1116
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:32,440
Three.

1117
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:33,120
Oh, shit.

1118
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:35,040
I'm going to head over to Professor Horace

1119
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:39,840
and try and do a little first aid on him.

1120
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:40,400
That cool?

1121
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:47,480
Professor Horace freaks out.

1122
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:50,480
It's a crit pass, a 66 on a 70.

1123
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:51,320
Yeah.

1124
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:52,200
Four.

1125
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:54,200
Four hit points right off the bat.

1126
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:57,680
I feel like half my old self again.

1127
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:59,440
Sheriff Bobby got his head blown off.

1128
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:01,160
He just dropped all his medical supplies

1129
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:02,280
right there on the ground.

1130
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:06,320
I reached down and grabbed with one hand some gauze

1131
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:10,480
and just like patted it into the knee area.

1132
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:13,240
And I've done it a lot.

1133
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:15,040
Living out there on the land by myself,

1134
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:17,240
I had to patch up myself all the time.

1135
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:18,280
So I'm real good at it.

1136
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:21,800
And I keep one gun trained on the door, my rifle,

1137
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:24,920
and the crook of my elbow here while I get his knee back

1138
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:25,760
in tip top shape.

1139
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:26,320
Perlin.

1140
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:30,720
I would like to perform first aid on my leg, my thigh.

1141
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:31,200
What?

1142
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:31,960
My thigh.

1143
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:33,920
My thigh.

1144
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:36,760
Thigh.

1145
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:38,760
Tell me about it, stud.

1146
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:43,480
I want to rip off a chunk of my shirt with my teeth

1147
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:46,240
and tear it up and then wrap it real tight.

1148
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:50,800
It perfectly cuts like Queen Amidala.

1149
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:53,840
It perfectly cuts into a cute little crop top.

1150
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:57,320
Oh, yeah, I do from the tummy, not from my sleeve.

1151
00:49:57,320 --> 00:50:00,320
Remember that bullshit.

1152
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:03,560
Yeah, I do the tummy cloth, not the arm.

1153
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:07,120
I was thinking arm cloth, but I like the idea

1154
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:09,800
of a long sleeve crop top.

1155
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:15,000
Like a long sleeve dress shirt crop top.

1156
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,480
Jack Perlman is a man of great fashion.

1157
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:21,520
And of not weight.

1158
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:22,680
Yeah, not passing.

1159
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:23,680
Regular fail.

1160
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:25,160
You just kind of wrap it around.

1161
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:27,040
Yeah, great.

1162
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:31,360
What happens if you push a first aid roll and then fail?

1163
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:35,600
What's a crit, fail, first aid look like?

1164
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:37,280
Slice the artery.

1165
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:39,280
Do you want to find out?

1166
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:40,200
I'm going to push it.

1167
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:41,320
He's going to find out.

1168
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:42,240
What's your first aid?

1169
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:43,880
Yeah, is this worth it?

1170
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:44,800
Oh, shit.

1171
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:47,560
That's pretty good bad.

1172
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:48,440
It's 50-50.

1173
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:49,440
Pretty good, pretty bad.

1174
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,200
Let's see what happens.

1175
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:53,960
Do it for the vine, bro.

1176
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:54,800
Oh, no.

1177
00:50:58,040 --> 00:50:59,600
Wait, hold on.

1178
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:00,240
Yeah, yeah.

1179
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:01,320
Yeah, that's a fail.

1180
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:04,480
Yeah, I rolled the exact same fucking thing again.

1181
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:05,880
What are the chances?

1182
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:08,440
What is happening?

1183
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:12,480
Jack Perlman, roll a D4.

1184
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:13,360
Oh, a four.

1185
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:14,000
That's good.

1186
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:22,120
Jack, you wrap the shirt around, and it

1187
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:23,520
doesn't stop the bleeding.

1188
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,520
And so you think to yourself, well, obviously I've

1189
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:26,880
got to get this knife out.

1190
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:29,320
And so you grab onto the handle of your knife.

1191
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:32,480
I thought she took the knife away and ran away with it.

1192
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:33,760
No, she left it in there.

1193
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:34,280
Oh, OK.

1194
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:35,680
Did I say she ran off with it?

1195
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:36,320
I think you might have.

1196
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:37,120
I thought you did.

1197
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:39,200
I thought you said she took it out.

1198
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:40,760
OK, whatever works.

1199
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:42,360
At some specific point, you did say

1200
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:44,280
she dropped your knife, his knife.

1201
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:47,440
I don't know if it was still in his leg when that happened or not.

1202
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:51,560
In my mind, she was just holding it into his leg,

1203
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:56,160
and then she let go and released it so that she could bail,

1204
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,760
but just left it in his leg.

1205
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:00,440
She doesn't need a knife.

1206
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:03,120
She got chompy chompies.

1207
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,280
She got chompy chompies.

1208
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:07,280
So yeah, I gank that knife out.

1209
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:08,560
Yeah, you pull it right out.

1210
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:11,080
And as you pull it out, it nicks an artery,

1211
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:13,720
and blood just starts going everywhere

1212
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:18,880
as you're desperately trying to tie tighter and tighter

1213
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:22,840
this shirt bottom around your leg.

1214
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:25,280
And you lose four hit points.

1215
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:28,960
Taking you from five to one.

1216
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:31,040
So I'm going to need you to roll another constitution

1217
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:35,040
check to stay conscious.

1218
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:35,520
Joe?

1219
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:36,840
Well, now that we know what happens

1220
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:39,560
if you crit fail a first aid roll, just don't do it, Justin.

1221
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:46,280
Seems pretty obvious in hindsight.

1222
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:50,720
I rolled a crit success on my constitution check, a 44 on an 80.

1223
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:53,680
Then you get to be awake for all this pain.

1224
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:56,080
Extra awake, like super awake.

1225
00:52:56,080 --> 00:53:00,920
I'm so conscious during a time I wish I could pass out.

1226
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:04,600
Blood is now soaking the dirt and creating

1227
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:10,200
mudblood underneath the back of your knee here on the ground.

1228
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:11,040
Mudblood.

1229
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:13,560
And Professor Horsegreen, it is your turn.

1230
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:15,680
Oh, also, Jack, your boots are ruined.

1231
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:18,080
God damn it.

1232
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:20,040
Blood is fully soaked into the leather

1233
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:22,000
to the point of non-return.

1234
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,160
Well, we're not in combat anymore, are we?

1235
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:25,240
We are.

1236
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:26,920
Oh, with Sylas.

1237
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:28,880
How much mobility do I have?

1238
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:33,440
Mechanically, you're going to be at a disadvantage on anything

1239
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:36,320
that needs you to run or be dexterous or anything

1240
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:36,920
like that.

1241
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:38,760
But you can hobble.

1242
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:44,040
So you're just as good as Everett Pace was always.

1243
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:45,560
OK.

1244
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:47,800
Well, when you put it like that, I hobble over

1245
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:49,760
to where Everett is covering the door.

1246
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,480
Is that what you did after you healed me?

1247
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:52,640
I don't think I moved.

1248
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:54,560
I think I just got to your position.

1249
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:56,280
You're all three kind of bunched up

1250
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:59,640
in this location, which I'm picturing about 10 yards away

1251
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:02,920
from the front porch of the Cole home.

1252
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:05,000
You guys are right out front.

1253
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,800
Horsegreen crawls behind a wagon or a barrel

1254
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:11,720
or whatever's in Sylas Cole's front yard to find some cover

1255
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:13,720
and trains his pistol on the front door.

1256
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:16,640
And you can very clearly hear Judge Ephraim Courtland

1257
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:18,560
in the living room.

1258
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:23,520
Just a reminder that he was in the first room of this house

1259
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:27,480
hollering, Sylas, get your ass out here.

1260
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:29,600
And the three of you can take your headphones off.

1261
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:41,800
Judge Ephraim Courtland, as you are,

1262
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:43,320
no, you failed your listen check.

1263
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:45,240
So you're just kicking in the next door?

1264
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:45,880
Yeah.

1265
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:48,400
They're trying to just open it if it's open.

1266
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:49,680
Oh, you're just going to open it?

1267
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:50,320
If it is open.

1268
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:51,880
Describe to me exactly what you do.

1269
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:53,680
You know what, I'm pissed off and I'm big.

1270
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:58,120
So after I'm yelling, get your ass out here,

1271
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:01,360
I kick in the other door, the next door.

1272
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:05,080
I need you to roll listen and spot hidden,

1273
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:06,560
two separate rolls.

1274
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:07,560
Listen first.

1275
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:10,560
Listen first.

1276
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:13,320
Fail the listen.

1277
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:18,320
Crit success on the spot hit 33 on him.

1278
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:21,120
45.

1279
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:26,840
As you kick in the door, you find yourself in the bedroom.

1280
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:30,320
The bed has been completely flipped over

1281
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:35,440
to use as cover on the right side of this room.

1282
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:42,040
And you see a small one inch in diameter metal sphere

1283
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:45,800
rolling directly toward you.

1284
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:46,920
What do you do?

1285
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:49,280
I see the sphere, but I don't really

1286
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:50,440
pay any attention to it.

1287
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:51,600
Yeah, it's like a marble.

1288
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:52,160
Yeah.

1289
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:54,440
So I'm going to be careful not to slip on it,

1290
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:59,440
but I'm going to go and just brute force grab the mattress

1291
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:01,880
and throw it away to see if he's behind there.

1292
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:05,960
When you grab the mattress, you just rip it away,

1293
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:09,640
throw it right up against the wall to your side.

1294
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:12,920
And you see Silas Cole, he's hunkered down

1295
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:18,080
and he is chanting something quietly to himself.

1296
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:24,400
Bob da ha ha, Bob da ha ha, Bob da ha ha, Bob da ha ha.

1297
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:25,880
Can I grab him?

1298
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:27,480
You can.

1299
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:28,840
I just go up to him.

1300
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:31,800
I put my right hand on a collar of a shirt.

1301
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:35,080
My left hand, I grab one of the belts he's wearing

1302
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:37,720
and I just lift him up over my head.

1303
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:43,000
And as you do that, you feel a hot pinch

1304
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,680
on the back of your neck.

1305
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:52,240
And we, me and you, Luke, we see Judge Ephraim Courtland freeze.

1306
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:57,000
Multiple shiny limbs extend from the small metal sphere

1307
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:01,200
and slam into the wooden floor beneath you,

1308
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:05,080
giving it the leverage it needs to shove down

1309
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:09,320
as one of its appendages slices into the soft tissue

1310
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:12,960
on the back of Judge Ephraim Courtland's neck.

1311
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:18,440
Another snaps his head forward and you hear the fracture

1312
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:21,520
as a third metal tendril reaches in,

1313
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:25,520
gripping the top of Judge Courtland's spine

1314
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:29,080
where it meets his head, the C1 vertebrae,

1315
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:34,080
and it rips his entire spinal cord out of his body

1316
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:38,600
in one swift motion, promptly forcing itself

1317
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:46,080
into the now vacant spinal column of Judge Ephraim Courtland.

1318
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:48,680
So this I'm gonna...

1319
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:54,800
Judge Ephraim Courtland is now being controlled by M-A-R-Y.

1320
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:55,880
Hell yeah.

1321
00:57:55,880 --> 00:58:00,600
So your goal is to make sure that there are no witnesses

1322
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:03,160
to what has happened here on the property today.

1323
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:05,160
There are a couple ways you can do this.

1324
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:11,720
One, you can kill them.

1325
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:15,520
You would be able to keep the body of Judge Courtland

1326
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:18,560
if you wanted to do that and then control Courtland

1327
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:20,800
whenever you wanted to around town.

1328
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:22,560
It might be kind of tricky at this point.

1329
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:26,880
M-A-R-Y typically likes to only control

1330
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:29,920
like one townsperson at a time

1331
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:33,720
and then other people that she can use for outside towns.

1332
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:36,400
However, the judge would be a...

1333
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:39,400
A pretty good one to have on their side.

1334
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:42,440
So I could kill them or double agent style?

1335
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:46,160
Yes. You could also, if they kill you,

1336
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:48,120
that also works in your advantage,

1337
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:50,040
but you typically don't want it.

1338
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:51,920
You don't want someone else to be there

1339
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:53,560
because then they'll know the secret,

1340
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:57,480
and if they get away having known that, then you're fucked.

1341
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:01,080
The third way is that Silas Cole, you know now,

1342
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:03,160
that Silas Cole is chanting

1343
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:05,320
and will continue to chant the spell

1344
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:08,480
that after a couple rounds will open up a portal

1345
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:11,960
in the floor of this room, the middle room of this house.

1346
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:14,840
You know that there is a back room, which is the kitchen,

1347
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:16,600
a front room, which is the living room,

1348
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:18,920
and then the middle room, which is your guys' bedroom,

1349
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:22,920
and the portal can be in front of both doors

1350
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:24,520
on one side of the room.

1351
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:25,600
And it's in the bedroom?

1352
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:29,840
Yeah, so if they come in too quickly and they fail a check.

1353
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:30,960
They get portaled.

1354
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:32,560
This technicolor portal.

1355
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:33,400
Okay, sweet.

1356
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:35,680
So those are your options.

1357
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:37,560
I like my options here.

1358
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:39,240
Okay, and it's gonna be their turn,

1359
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:40,760
so I'm gonna let them choose what happens next.

1360
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:43,680
Okay, are we still doing, this is still one episode?

1361
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:45,640
Oh shit, how long have we been playing?

1362
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:50,640
["Get Your Head Around My Poor Little Darling"]

1363
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:20,640
["Get Your Head Around My Poor Little Darling"]

1364
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:50,640
["Get Your Head Around My Poor Little Darling"]
