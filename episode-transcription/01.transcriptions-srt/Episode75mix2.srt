1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,680
Welcome, babies one and all.

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:05,360
Welcome, rabies one and all.

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,080
Get them shots before you foam at the mouth.

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:16,320
It's Wolf the Dog, here to administer your rabies medication live from 694.2 PTBB.

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:22,160
I don't accept insurance, but I'll gladly accept your soul as payment.

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:29,280
We wanted to give a few special shout-outs before we dip into this very special Plot Talk episode.

7
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,520
Spoilers abound, y'all.

8
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,520
First, check out our Reddit.

9
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,600
It's filled with a fun community.

10
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,640
You can find that at reddit.com r slash pretending to be people.

11
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,920
You can find a link to the Discord in there somewhere.

12
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,960
Come chat with us and hang out a little bit.

13
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:52,960
Also, go on over to twitch.tv slash pretending pod streams.

14
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:58,400
I've heard some dummy named Justin has been trying to stream more often lately.

15
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:03,520
And some of those other pretending to be people boys sometimes join in on the fun.

16
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,240
I wish I knew what streaming was.

17
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,440
Sounds like it involves a lot of liquid.

18
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,640
And you know I'm always all about that.

19
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,160
But that all is besides the point.

20
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:20,960
The point is that this episode is about discussing the finer points.

21
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,320
What is the point?

22
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,920
Where are we even?

23
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,000
Where do we go when we sleep?

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Am I human after all?

25
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,400
Probably not.

26
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,560
But anyway, it seems these pretending to be people boys

27
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,840
finally figured out how to record from a distance at the scientist's insistence.

28
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:47,040
So with no more resistance, I howl out for assistance from the tune that fuels this wolf's existence.

29
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:53,600
It's kudzu with no back bone.

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:25,760
5, 6, 7, clap.

31
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,240
My last clap hit my fingertips a little, but it should be still loud enough.

32
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,040
That second one sounded like we did it in such unison

33
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,920
that I actually didn't think anyone else did it except me.

34
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,040
I think it was perfect, yeah.

35
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,760
Even the video aligned beautifully.

36
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,560
But also when I'm editing these, it makes me sound like the Dumbo.

37
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,760
Because if you're all set to this clap one, then you're all together.

38
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,680
And I'm slightly off from you.

39
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,200
So you say something and then I'm like...

40
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,720
Good one, Thomas.

41
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,160
Just like a little bit too late.

42
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:07,040
Anywho, I'll just match it up with the Zoom call and it'll all be good.

43
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:07,680
Hell yeah.

44
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,600
Getting it figured out.

45
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,600
Let me know when to go, daddy.

46
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,480
Oh, son, it is game time.

47
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:23,440
Hello everyone and welcome to the pretending to be people plot talk Q&A episode.

48
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,280
How's everyone doing on this beautiful spring day?

49
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,240
Real good.

50
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:28,800
Good.

51
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,520
Doing good.

52
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,720
I'm living large and I'm in charge.

53
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,600
Now, Zach, I'm going to need you to talk less because I am in charge of the podcast now.

54
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,640
You gave me the power and it will never come back.

55
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,440
Y'all just want to hop into some of these questions.

56
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,600
We got a whole lot of them to get through today.

57
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,760
Yeah, let's do it.

58
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,360
No, that's okay if we don't want to.

59
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,160
So first question.

60
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,760
Oh, do you want, do we, should we do a description of what we're about to do today?

61
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,960
Well, Luke and I are too busy changing our Zoom backgrounds.

62
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,460
Yeah.

63
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,040
Oh man.

64
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,000
Read this.

65
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,920
Luke's is reminding me of playing enter the matrix and it really

66
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,320
makes me want to bust out my PS2.

67
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,080
Read this stuff right above my head.

68
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,400
No.

69
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,480
I, a hacker, enter my world.

70
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,680
You call us criminals.

71
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,200
This is my manifesto.

72
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,120
Oh no.

73
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,000
This is creepy.

74
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,680
Is it actually a manifesto?

75
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,680
This says I didn't show it.

76
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,320
Show my work.

77
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,840
Did you just Google image search manifesto and then set it as your background matrix?

78
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,960
I like the thing that says damn kids.

79
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,240
They're all alike.

80
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,040
And then I can see hacker question mark.

81
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,880
Tasteless.

82
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,960
Thomas has a very, very cute Murphy behind him.

83
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,080
Oh, I love him.

84
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,360
We love Murphy.

85
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,600
I shouldn't say I love, we all love Murphy.

86
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,680
Which one should I set it to for the rest though?

87
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,720
I got quite a few.

88
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,680
What's your favorite?

89
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,800
Oh, I couldn't possibly choose that one.

90
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,840
Yeah, that one's a good one.

91
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,720
Yeah, I lied.

92
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,600
That one's the best.

93
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,800
This one's pretty good.

94
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,840
We all chose Ainsley.

95
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,840
Please get Ainsley.

96
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,120
Eats the Hills.

97
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,320
There we go.

98
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:18,800
Thank you.

99
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,360
There it is.

100
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,240
Not a baby eats a boy.

101
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,080
How do we have like what, three or four questions to do?

102
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,320
Yeah, just, just one or two, one or two quick ones.

103
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,480
So yeah, let's get to it then.

104
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,080
So we can really goof off.

105
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:41,120
So for anyone who's new to the podcast, maybe now isn't a good time to jump in.

106
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,400
Yeah, don't be here right now.

107
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,200
Yeah.

108
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,640
Go back to the first one.

109
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:48,560
Maybe this is the best time to grasp as much as you can.

110
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:54,720
Oh yeah, you can form a study guide and then go back to the beginning and re-listen to everything.

111
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,360
If you're one of those people who reads the last page of every book you read before you read it,

112
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,080
then yeah, then we don't want you listening to a podcast.

113
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:03,840
Fuck you.

114
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,920
This is going to be, uh, extreme spoiler heavy.

115
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:11,680
Spoilers you may not have even known existed before today.

116
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,480
Well, hopefully we're going to avoid some of that.

117
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:20,800
Basically what I'm going to reinforce here is going to be a look back at many of the

118
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:26,240
things we've forgotten and then basically just like theories and opinions from each

119
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,440
of the players on what is happening and what their plans are moving forward.

120
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,320
Luke just vaped in against the zoom green screen.

121
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,360
It looked fucking awesome.

122
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:43,360
All right guys, uh, first question comes from Glue B and it says,

123
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,520
what NPCs besides Drew do you trust the most?

124
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,880
None of them anymore.

125
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,680
Probably, um, oh, what's his face?

126
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,120
Daily.

127
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,760
Gary Daily.

128
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,880
That's a really good answer.

129
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,160
At the Daily-fa.

130
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,840
Daily and, and clinker.

131
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,880
Yeah, I definitely trust him.

132
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,400
Harry clinker of clinkers.

133
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:06,240
Who's the one that saw us or like put a spell on us when we were kids or something?

134
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,200
Uh, clinker, right?

135
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,960
Because it was in his daycare.

136
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,520
It wasn't his daycare, but it was his partner Gary Daily.

137
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,320
Okay, cool.

138
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,000
Yeah, that's my answer.

139
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,720
Yeah, that's a, that's a good dude.

140
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,600
We should, once we go back to contention, if we do, we'll probably get in contact with him.

141
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,520
And, and John Lee Pettymore still trusts his family.

142
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:32,880
Thomas, you actually asked the question when I had you guys ask questions and I would answer

143
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:39,280
them in dreams for you, uh, in which I really didn't answer the questions, but, uh, just

144
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,720
made weird fucked up dreams surrounding the idea of your question.

145
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,960
You asked if you could trust Gary Daily and Harry clinker.

146
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:52,480
And that's when you, that's where the scene of him putting the spell on us was, right?

147
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:52,960
Yeah.

148
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,600
And you also saw like his grandpa.

149
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,640
You later confirmed in a phone call on the way to the city.

150
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,240
You saw him like with the book.

151
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:02,560
Yeah.

152
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,280
He was, he was like, grandpa, you old wizard.

153
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,080
Joe, write that down so we can get back to it.

154
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,720
When we, what about you, Joe?

155
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:18,480
Clark definitely still, uh, has a lot of trust in Maggie just because of how their relationship

156
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,160
was before all the shit hit the fan.

157
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,840
He also has a little bit of trust in old Clark just because it's old him.

158
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:30,480
Like he sees his own face and thinks that I would, why would old me want to fuck me over?

159
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:37,760
And, uh, uh, until recently, I think, uh, Leon was high on his trust list and maybe

160
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,880
he's questioning that a little more these days, but yeah, a lot of, a lot of trust in

161
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,680
Maggie for sure.

162
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:44,880
Oh.

163
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:52,000
And, uh, he, he also still feels pretty strongly about his, uh, his, uh, fellow officers.

164
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,840
I don't think that he has a, a lot of mistrust in them right now.

165
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,600
I'd say the same for Keith.

166
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:57,920
Yeah.

167
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,360
Oh, uh, my niece, my niece, for sure.

168
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:03,840
Your niece.

169
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,040
She's family, you know,

170
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,080
bigger than blood.

171
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,000
Keith can trust anyone who he's killed because they can't betray him.

172
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:25,840
Um, this next one comes from the lay suit for the boys.

173
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,960
That's how I would say it.

174
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,480
I think, yeah, I think it's Lejuet.

175
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:29,680
The Lejuet.

176
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,200
Oh, I wouldn't.

177
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,880
Or Lejuet.

178
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,040
Yeah.

179
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,960
Like a, like a leisure Jesuit.

180
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,760
Maybe.

181
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,160
Maybe.

182
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:37,760
Yeah.

183
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,680
Oh, my mom was a leisure Jesuit.

184
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,560
Oh, I'll say.

185
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:48,400
They write for the boys, what hooks slash bangs do you wish you had followed up on?

186
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,280
And what are some of your favorite bangs?

187
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:56,240
Uh, I wish that we would have not royally fucked up when we saw that guy in the woods.

188
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,440
Yeah.

189
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:57,760
Yeah.

190
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,240
Great one.

191
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,240
That was, that was all about the roles though.

192
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:00,880
Kinda.

193
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,120
Yeah.

194
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,200
I mean, we didn't necessarily do anything wrong.

195
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,800
We just rolled terribly.

196
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:10,640
I want to say each of you rolled a critical failure, like a critical, critical failure

197
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,320
within like five minutes of each other.

198
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:19,280
Also, did we ever follow up on the note you got from the robot guy?

199
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:19,840
Not really.

200
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,600
That's one too.

201
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,320
What did it say?

202
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,480
Uh, hold on.

203
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,800
I was just reading this earlier.

204
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,120
I think, I think I know if you can't find it.

205
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,440
Remember when we were recording both the dog and I said a robot massage, and I thought

206
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,320
that was really funny that John Lee Fattimore was in love with a robot and got a massage

207
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:45,280
from, I mean, they would be good at it.

208
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:48,160
I bet if they were programmed for massaging.

209
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,360
Yeah.

210
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,880
You got to think about that.

211
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,360
Well, you got to think about the build structure.

212
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,520
I mean, you're not going to be metal, you know, if you're made from massaging, you're

213
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:05,040
going to have to come up with some very, very human like parts to get in there.

214
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,920
To really get in there.

215
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,920
Is your chiropractor a robot, Zach?

216
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,000
Yeah, but that's just because they're the best chiropractors.

217
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,440
Exactly.

218
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,480
And he's got no heart.

219
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,480
You need a man with no heart to really crack his spine.

220
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,560
Even if I die, my spine will be straight.

221
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:22,880
Yes.

222
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,200
And no, in the review, it just says that I sent it off to Drew to see what it says.

223
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,960
And it says, I killed the, oh wait, sorry.

224
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,160
Do you know it, Joe?

225
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,640
Yeah, it's I killed the chief's pops, John.

226
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,120
Right.

227
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,480
That's exactly what it says.

228
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,320
Word for word in binary.

229
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,160
Write that down, Joe.

230
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:46,960
Make a note of it.

231
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:50,000
See what, who else or what else?

232
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,120
I wrote down that I, uh, I wish we would have, um, explored the helmet some more.

233
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,720
We, we kind of got it and tucked it away and never really researched it.

234
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,240
I would have liked to have known more about it.

235
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,520
Who has the helmet now?

236
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,160
We do.

237
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:02,720
Oh, fuck.

238
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,480
Oh my God.

239
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,040
The cat's just knocked down my, uh, soundproof blanket.

240
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,800
Well, it made a whole lot of noise.

241
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,360
Ironic.

242
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,960
But yeah, for sure.

243
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:22,880
The, uh, the helmet would have been interesting.

244
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:27,520
I mean, you guys had a pretty long scene, uh, but none of the focus was on the helmet.

245
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:33,280
It was just on, um, you know, Luke and Keith Vigna and pastor Adam Kane.

246
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:37,600
Not liking, uh, each other pretty, pretty clearly.

247
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:44,080
Actually, I don't even think Keith Vigna like thought about pastor Adam Kane except for himself.

248
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,560
He gave me some food.

249
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,480
The second part of that was what are your favorite bangs?

250
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:56,400
I was a big fan the very first time we ever saw a creepy picture come out of that Polaroid camera.

251
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,920
I don't know if you consider that a bang or not.

252
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,600
That's pretty integral to the story, but it came out for sure.

253
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:01,840
Cool.

254
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,240
That's like a set charge, right?

255
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,960
It's like when they use this, this will happen.

256
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:12,880
It's like, I love doing this with people and locations once we're like into the game to be

257
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:18,240
like, it's up to them if they want to make this happen, but if they reach out to this person,

258
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,680
this will unlock this plot essentially.

259
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:28,720
It's like, if you happen to decide to call someone, then you're going to make something

260
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,760
happen there because you're not just going to call them and have nothing be happening, right?

261
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,400
Something will be happening, but if you don't call them, it's up to me to decide at that point,

262
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,960
like, well, what happened?

263
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:46,640
Is it still this interesting convoluted story or would that not be as interesting because

264
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,760
they weren't there for it?

265
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,160
I always want you guys there for the action.

266
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:57,120
So I don't know if this was a bang probably, but when Keith snuck on the bus and then all

267
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:03,120
the homeless people got on and I was stuck on it and you guys know what happened.

268
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,720
That was pretty good.

269
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,520
That was just their like written trajectory for that scene.

270
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:13,760
It's like, these people are going to do this and these are their objectives and this is

271
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,800
how they're going to do it.

272
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,960
And then you got into the exact bus that they were going to leave on.

273
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:28,400
Thomas, did you have a good hooker bang that, that really hooked you into the door while

274
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:28,960
hooking you?

275
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:36,800
Leo piston and, um, what's your face's body literally being banged, uh, banged into the

276
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,240
ground by the unseen forces.

277
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:39,760
Ooh, fuck.

278
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,320
Yeah.

279
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,400
That was a disturbing imagery moment that I personally loved.

280
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:44,640
Yes.

281
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,440
That certainly got John Lee Pettymore's attention.

282
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:48,640
That's awesome.

283
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:56,480
That was one of those things where I don't plan a lot in advance for like how things

284
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,440
are going to play out.

285
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,080
I did not expect Clark to critically succeed on a firearms check and kill her.

286
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,560
Old eagle eye Bishop.

287
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,280
You know it.

288
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:10,480
We got a next question here from super five-ish.

289
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:15,280
Super fish or super fish with a five is a F is super five-ish says what happened to

290
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:21,680
the grammar, poor torch-wielding would be invaders hinted at in the early episodes.

291
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,280
Are they still kicking about?

292
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:27,200
And this is, uh, this is in the, one of those pictures that you were talking about there,

293
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,400
Joe, but this is the picture I believe that was well.

294
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:30,720
Okay.

295
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:37,520
So I, I don't, I mean, I think that that is part of what is like being alluded to, but

296
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,880
I think he's referencing the note that we got it because when he said grammar poor,

297
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:48,000
it says we are striking with darkness, reading torches, hesitate, not, um, and it says,

298
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,360
are they still kicking about?

299
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,320
I don't, I don't know.

300
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,720
I assume it has something to do with the picture we saw of people holding torches, but I don't

301
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,220
know.

302
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:56,640
Yeah.

303
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,720
I completely misread that question.

304
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,080
I had to think about it when they, when they said grammar poor, I was like, who was grammar

305
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:02,480
poor?

306
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:08,560
And then I remember I thought we could all just tell from the picture of them that they

307
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,440
looked like they didn't know.

308
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,400
So any ideas?

309
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,320
I, we got a question about that now.

310
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,360
Let's just jump to it now.

311
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,320
Where is it?

312
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:24,400
A non a no, no, no asks when that cloud portal yeeted John Peters at the boy's car, where

313
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,680
was he thrown from?

314
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,960
Is that the place the spooky picture depicts?

315
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,460
Yeah.

316
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,600
I think so.

317
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,560
I like to think so.

318
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:37,120
Cause we had seen John Peters in the stocks in those pictures and it was that inky black

319
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:37,840
void.

320
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:42,880
So I fear he, if he was there and then not there, maybe he got spit out, but no, there's

321
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,720
nothing being confirmed one way or the other.

322
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,560
What's your computer notes say, Zach?

323
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,320
It just says in all caps.

324
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:50,960
Oh fuck.

325
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,920
Come up with something.

326
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,320
No, it's the answer.

327
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,000
It just, I'm looking at the answer.

328
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,440
Do you guys want me to screen share with you?

329
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:06,080
I've got a question here from the leisure for me or for someone who's got a name that

330
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,840
sounds like mine, but is spelled differently.

331
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:12,880
It's for Zach with a K from the original timeline slash campaign slash thing.

332
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,160
What dangling hooks do you wish the boys would have followed up on?

333
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:23,200
Yeah, I'd probably say the grammar poor torch wielding would be invaders hinted at in the

334
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,080
early episode.

335
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,120
Hey Joe, write that down.

336
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,040
By the, by the nature of the game and the story you're telling, there's nothing that

337
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:34,640
we couldn't like go back and follow up on if we really felt the need to.

338
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,400
That's absolutely correct.

339
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,920
Things might've changed since we first saw it, but there's no reason we couldn't go and

340
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,400
do a little more research on something.

341
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,360
Absolutely.

342
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:48,720
I think the next arc is going to start with you wake up and you're on four wheelers driving

343
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,840
to the woods.

344
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,880
Don't fuck up this time.

345
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,320
Well now I've got to change it.

346
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,280
Oh, just edit that part out.

347
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:02,160
Oh, we got another question here from Maladory asks Ari Manstein feels more important than

348
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,760
they have been given credit.

349
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:08,000
What were they and why were they working with the CPD?

350
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,440
Also, what about Jan Manstein and Stan Manstein for that matter?

351
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,400
Why could the only the boys understand Stan at the meaner?

352
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,920
Yeah, the fuck me.

353
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:19,360
And what does he mean by our past is different?

354
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,680
That's a loaded and a lot.

355
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,560
I I've got it.

356
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,360
I've got a theory.

357
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,080
I don't know.

358
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,040
What's your theory?

359
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,800
Stan obviously seems super important.

360
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:32,000
He was telling us a lot of really good info before we tried to kill him, but he was talking

361
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:38,240
about how pasts have changed and so I mean there's some kind of timey wimey thing that

362
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,320
for some reason we're all sure that we remember different names for Ari.

363
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,960
He kind of alluded to the fact that that's not going to happen anymore that she's a fixed

364
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,040
point in some way and that his his life is definite or her life is definite now.

365
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:55,120
I don't know, but he seemed to know a lot about how all this timey wimey shit is working

366
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,960
and I don't really grasp it all, but it seems super important.

367
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,600
I agree.

368
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,640
Hey, I've got a question.

369
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,360
I want you all to answer it on the count of three.

370
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,280
Who is the dentist in contention?

371
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,840
Do you have an answer in your mind?

372
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,960
I mean, I definitely can picture him and I know his business card.

373
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,520
Yeah.

374
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,120
I don't remember his name exactly.

375
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:15,680
Old man.

376
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,280
Moller?

377
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:17,920
Moller?

378
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:24,960
Well, so there was the the guy who told us he was a dentist, but he was helping settle

379
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,280
the estate right of James.

380
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,800
Yeah, he shit his pants.

381
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,120
But that is not Dr. Moller.

382
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:35,840
Right, there's a more of a real dentist or as he was not so much a dentist, maybe is

383
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,520
what we gathered from his card.

384
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,120
When did we meet a real dentist?

385
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,120
We didn't meet and we sent off dental records to a dentist one time.

386
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,640
Oh, I forget for what body.

387
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,880
It was for the body of Chief Maggie Cook.

388
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,640
Right, in the house explosion.

389
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,120
Yeah.

390
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,160
What was his name?

391
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,080
Was it another Andrews sibling?

392
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,680
No, his name was Randy Angst.

393
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,400
Randy Angst.

394
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,600
The guy who was at James the mill worker's house with you guys.

395
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,120
His business card said dentist and lover or something like that, right?

396
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,360
And historical society.

397
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:07,840
Yeah.

398
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,480
Yeah.

399
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:13,280
But yeah, just to point out that you guys sent off dental records to the only dentist

400
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:17,920
in town, Dr. Moller, and then you met a dentist named Randy Angst.

401
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,440
Write that down.

402
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,520
That's just a thing that happened.

403
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,360
Probably not important though.

404
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:28,480
I mean, I think we all noted it at the time that it was weird that he was settling in

405
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,480
a state and his card had like four different occupations on it.

406
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,360
But yeah, I don't know.

407
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,400
Yeah, I agree.

408
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,720
Thomas, do you have any theories about Ari Manstein?

409
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,200
I don't know who that is.

410
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,400
Tim Manstein was a colleague of mine.

411
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,160
One of the finest cops I ever knew.

412
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:54,640
Um, uh, yeah, we're actually going to be attending their funeral soon.

413
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,760
I think I got a question here from crane song.

414
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:02,720
Zach, what was the decision made by the players that stands out to you as the most derailing

415
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,840
what you had planned?

416
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,200
We know that you parenthetical allegedly.

417
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:08,800
I don't lie.

418
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:14,720
Had to rewrite the campaign after someone Thomas joked about it being the mine.

419
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,080
Were there any other parts of the campaign that had to be redone?

420
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:23,280
Any really, really, really obvious plot points that the players bypassed or previously pivotal

421
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,160
characters that were either killed or ignored?

422
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:30,960
I'm just imagining Zach control effing mine and changing it to mill every time.

423
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,120
Control H, baby.

424
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,880
So yeah, that was Thomas who did the mine thing.

425
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,000
And that was when I was still writing the story and I was like, yeah, you're right.

426
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,280
I shouldn't make it that.

427
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:51,600
Um, but, um, like rewritten, uh, constantly, I would, yeah, I rewrite stuff literally all

428
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,320
the time.

429
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:57,280
If you guys do something to affect my plan, then I have to rewrite everything.

430
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,240
And that happens like every single time we sit down to play.

431
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,480
Cause you guys are fun to play with, you make choices.

432
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:09,680
And that's the thing that matters most in role-playing is, uh, we're making the story

433
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,160
together.

434
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:13,200
So every time you make a choice, I get to play with that choice.

435
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,040
And that's why I like role-playing I'm with you.

436
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,800
That was the question, right?

437
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,440
Yeah.

438
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,480
I think you got it.

439
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,960
Obvious plot points that the players bypassed.

440
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,760
Yeah, of course.

441
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:25,760
All right.

442
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,480
So we've got a question here.

443
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,400
I was about to tell Joe to write it down.

444
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:38,400
Oh, previously pivotal characters that were either killed or ignored, uh, just on the

445
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,360
killed part.

446
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,560
Like, yeah, for sure.

447
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,040
Got a murderous crew.

448
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:50,480
I like straight up for one did not think that that car chase with Charles Donovan was going

449
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,480
to end in his murder.

450
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,560
Who would have done that?

451
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:02,560
I also didn't think you were going to murder every single person you came into contact

452
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,800
with at city state university.

453
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,480
They were coming right for us.

454
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:12,800
Oh boy.

455
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:18,480
We got one from a non, uh, no, no, no.

456
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:25,680
And they said, when that cloud portal yeeted John Peters at the boy's car, where was he

457
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,880
thrown from?

458
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,200
Is that the place the spooky picture depicts?

459
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,640
We did this one.

460
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,800
Oh, well, thanks.

461
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:42,160
Uh, go ahead and hit that antiseptic mouthwash goat sex picture.

462
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,920
Just wanted to share things.

463
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:50,080
And what happened to those kids that, that saw the gooey vacuum?

464
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:50,480
Thanks.

465
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,320
There were no kids.

466
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,440
And I don't, I don't know, uh, what vacuum incident you're talking about.

467
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,640
That's not a, that's not a thing.

468
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,440
Joe, Joe, no, no.

469
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:07,120
When we, when we got those kids killed, cause we, well, yeah.

470
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,960
Instead of telling them to run away or something, we told them to hold a vacuum.

471
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,960
No, we wouldn't have done that.

472
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,680
That's ridiculous.

473
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,480
No, they died.

474
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,240
That's I can't believe I wasn't involved in that one.

475
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,320
We can never let Vigna know.

476
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,080
We really keep those kids up.

477
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:36,960
Oh, so on the way to the city, you guys were on the phone with Harry Klinker on speakerphone

478
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,200
and John told that whole story.

479
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:45,520
With Keith in the car and Doug Jacobs in the body of agent Trent and Chad also in the car.

480
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,880
I tried to tell Trent Chad that it was like part of his trip, right?

481
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,560
That he was dreaming it or something.

482
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,120
Yeah.

483
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:51,600
Yeah.

484
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,080
And then that he was like, I don't know.

485
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,040
And he's like, no, no, no.

486
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,800
They just talk to each other like this all the time.

487
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,240
Yeah.

488
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:05,520
We got another one from J sake, which they wanted to make sure is not pronounced J sake

489
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,320
for audio formatting purposes.

490
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:13,040
I pronounce it like quote for sake, not Japanese rice wine.

491
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:20,560
J sake's question is does the daily pho have a yellow sign hanging on the wall?

492
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,200
Ain't on a no, no, no, no.

493
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,240
No, they commented.

494
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,040
Are we talking a specific yellow sign?

495
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,760
TM J state comments back.

496
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,880
I think so.

497
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,480
I'm doing a quarantine release.

498
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:40,320
I'm doing a quarantine re listen.

499
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:45,760
And when the art Gary has on the walls of the restaurant is described, it kind of sounds

500
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:51,600
like one is the yellow sign, not a yellow sign, if you know what I mean, but it could

501
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,440
be some other occult symbol.

502
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,720
I'm not familiar with.

503
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,640
I went back and listened to the description of all those things on the walls.

504
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:03,840
And one of them definitely sounds like a yellow sign description, but none of our characters

505
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:08,400
would know that like, there's no way that they would know that is what that is.

506
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:15,040
I bet John Lee Pettymore saw like the first 30 minutes of the first season of true detective

507
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,360
and didn't get it and turned it off.

508
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:22,000
Oh, thankfully they use a different yellow sign.

509
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,160
Also, the yellow sign can be anything.

510
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,840
They can look like anything.

511
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,760
So, but there is one that looks a whole heck of a lot.

512
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:34,000
Like when I Googled yellow sign, it sounded exactly like something you described.

513
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,840
Yeah, it does.

514
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,480
Doesn't it?

515
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,720
Looks like one of those things.

516
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:49,680
And then when, when you asked him what that one meant, he said, oh, that one is about

517
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,680
a land unknown.

518
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:57,520
Yeah, which we, we kind of took for granted because it's described as like question marks

519
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:01,840
kind of like it was a question mark with a line coming out the other side and yada, yada,

520
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,480
yada.

521
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:07,040
When I originally read that question, I thought it was a reference to like the yellow missing

522
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:07,840
signs.

523
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:08,720
And I was like, huh?

524
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,000
But now I realize nothing to do with that.

525
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,120
Speaking of nothing.

526
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:16,800
Okay.

527
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:20,880
Nothing for wrote us a question.

528
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,760
Look out world.

529
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,160
Sorry.

530
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:25,680
I am a transition guy.

531
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,400
Um, okay.

532
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:30,240
Nothing for wrote a question.

533
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,920
They wrote a question I actually was curious about too.

534
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:44,400
What happened to the FBI agents who visited the contention PD and said they'd be in contact

535
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:48,080
within 48 hours and Maladory followed up?

536
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:53,040
Weren't the agents at the den of sin when Marvin got terminated or were those different

537
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:53,760
agents?

538
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:58,560
Well, didn't the FBI agents say that they would call us if we didn't call them?

539
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,120
That's for sure.

540
00:27:59,120 --> 00:27:59,680
Part of it.

541
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,600
And then we, we tried to call them.

542
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,160
Yeah.

543
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:05,120
Keith called them and got an automated, uh, system.

544
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:05,920
Yeah.

545
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:10,160
So we just kind of laid out that we needed to contact them, ask them stuff or something.

546
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,920
And it just was like, thank you.

547
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,640
Have a good day.

548
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,760
So that thread kind of ended.

549
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,720
And then, yeah, as far as the den of sin goes, I think that's what I'm operating under is

550
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,480
that that was them that we saw in the audience going into Marvin's room.

551
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:29,040
And I think I brought up with you guys that we don't know for sure what the fuck that

552
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:29,440
means.

553
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:34,560
That could mean that they are on Marvin's payroll maybe, or they had followed us into

554
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:37,520
the glass compound and we're trying to help.

555
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,160
I don't know.

556
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,440
I don't know what they were doing there.

557
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,760
I think we, we still would like to talk to them.

558
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:52,800
And their goal in front of your eyes, like what you saw was them get rid of silver or

559
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:58,880
not even get rid of, but just put one silver ball that none of them were touching into

560
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,160
the Nike bag.

561
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:04,240
Maybe the Nike bag teleported it to glass.

562
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,200
Straight to glass.

563
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,080
That's that could be.

564
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,040
I think you guys have had this conversation before.

565
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,160
I think we might've done it off the podcast one day.

566
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:12,960
Oh yeah.

567
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:19,760
I was reading, I was reading the overview of episode 34 and it's one where it's, I

568
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:25,920
think it's right before the entity shows up to yell at Clark Bishop about the book.

569
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:31,840
And you guys are all standing in the mausoleum courtyard, essentially, and just talking about

570
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,680
the plot for the entire time.

571
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:39,200
And the overview of that episode is just like intense plot point after intense plot point

572
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,520
after intense plot point after intense plot point.

573
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:46,880
So yeah, if you want to go for listeners 34, if you want to go back and listen to them,

574
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,520
try to figure some stuff out before we hop into this.

575
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:53,680
I mean, I know that's what this is, but damn, that episode is chock full of shit.

576
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,240
Nice.

577
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,240
I'll have to go back and listen to that one too.

578
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:56,800
All right.

579
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:00,320
Moving right along crush 36 rights.

580
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,480
Who do the robots work for?

581
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:08,800
Were the graveyard boys, robots or glass type dudes that we fought the first robot guy and

582
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:14,160
he had the, uh, so it was the double helix sees that created an M that we have like on

583
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,200
a ring and stuff.

584
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:20,080
We later found out from old Clark's Heidi hole in Jim Cook's house.

585
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:20,720
It's myriad.

586
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:25,760
It stands for myriad, which is a company that I think creates androids.

587
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:31,680
The, it was in operation stapler that they were like cutting costs on androids.

588
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,080
Yeah.

589
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:36,880
So yeah, I don't, did we find out who myriad was or what they were, what they were associated

590
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,520
with?

591
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,800
Were they owned or did they own the beans corporation?

592
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,400
I'll have to ask Keith's brother.

593
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:53,600
Bruce Robin was extremely emotionally affected by Keith having a myriad ring.

594
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,320
Oh, that's right.

595
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:59,680
When we were in the office, he saw your ring and was like, oh, he, did he have one on two?

596
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,920
He was really embarrassed by the faux pas.

597
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,200
How dare you?

598
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,520
He, he did have one on two, right?

599
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,120
Cause I tried to like touch them together.

600
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:09,760
I think.

601
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,040
Or am I making that up?

602
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,240
I don't, I don't remember.

603
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:12,800
I don't either.

604
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,160
I don't have an overview for that one.

605
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,520
You should get on that.

606
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:23,440
Then Zach, I'm just kidding for the listener.

607
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:28,400
It's our job to write some of these overviews and we suck at doing that on time.

608
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,040
We're like half the season behind.

609
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,280
I did two of them the other day.

610
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:36,640
It doesn't take very long if you listen at double speed.

611
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,920
However, I will say one of them was already done.

612
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:40,400
Shit.

613
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,040
Which one?

614
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,080
And Joe had done it.

615
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,520
So it was way more in depth.

616
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,120
I put on only the good stuff in there.

617
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,200
I didn't write a transcript.

618
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:56,640
Oh, Joe's putting a lot of fluff in those overviews.

619
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,400
He's putting up his font size.

620
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,880
He's not paying us by the word, Joe.

621
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,520
I can start paying you by the word if you want.

622
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,960
Oh, mine'll be so long.

623
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,480
It was the best of soads.

624
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,840
It was the worst of soads.

625
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:15,520
I'm always so nervous that Zach's word choice is going to be super important.

626
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:20,160
So if he says like her grimacing face,

627
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:23,440
I'm going to put in that grimacing just in case that means something later.

628
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:27,120
It only does like 25% of the time, but that's pretty high.

629
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,560
And then graveyard boys, robots or glass type dudes.

630
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:35,600
They weren't fish, if that was what the question was.

631
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,120
Did we ever investigate their bodies?

632
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,520
We didn't think they were fish, but they were weird,

633
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:44,080
like alien creature kind of things, right?

634
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,840
Oh, those boys.

635
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:54,560
The long, tall, like lanky gray entity that like,

636
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:57,440
and wearing a full suit screamed at Clark.

637
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,600
It screamed at me and I didn't know what the fuck.

638
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,240
But yeah, even at the time, I think we noted that it was,

639
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,600
there was a similar description between them and Marvin himself.

640
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,440
We wondered if they were of the same ilk.

641
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,200
Yeah, man.

642
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,400
I mean, yeah, they're described the same.

643
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,360
They look very similar.

644
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,400
Write that down.

645
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:22,480
They don't act the same at all though, which is an important distinction.

646
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:27,040
They certainly don't, but they also probably aren't human

647
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,120
based on those descriptions that I gave.

648
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:33,440
Not a lot of eight foot tall humans walking around.

649
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,560
Not a lot, Zach, but they're out there.

650
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,600
There are some.

651
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,080
Enough.

652
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,080
I don't think there's anyone eight feet tall in the world right now.

653
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,440
What Zach is saying is that if you're over eight feet tall,

654
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,120
he doesn't consider you human.

655
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,320
I completely agree with that.

656
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,840
Oh my God.

657
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,640
Watch fucking Chuckling Boy be like eight foot five.

658
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,720
Friendship with PTBP over.

659
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,520
Oh boy.

660
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,280
Speaking of, we got a question from Jayhawk Inc.

661
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,840
More from him later or her them later.

662
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,960
Are there any things that have quote official names

663
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,600
that haven't been named as such in the podcast?

664
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,240
Yes.

665
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:21,840
Like I don't remember the chanting fish men being called deep ones.

666
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:22,640
They weren't.

667
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,640
And they discovered that trove of weapons,

668
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:27,840
but only Joe mentioned that it was likely a green box out of character.

669
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,080
I'm curious if we've like seen a ghoul.

670
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,680
No, but didn't realize it was a ghoul.

671
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,600
No, because no one called it that, you know?

672
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,640
Yeah, probably no ghouls, but maybe.

673
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:37,520
I don't know.

674
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,240
I like to make ghouls look different than traditional ghouls.

675
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:43,920
I used ghouls heavily in a former campaign.

676
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,280
Eight foot tall.

677
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:55,840
So, you know, they weren't human creatures that tortured Joe's character's family.

678
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:02,240
He like woke up with like with like graveyard dirt all over him one night

679
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,840
and was like, what's going on?

680
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,040
That sounds just like Joe.

681
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,880
So yeah, definitely.

682
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,040
And also no.

683
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,360
Maladory has one for us.

684
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,800
So a question about ball.

685
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,560
If ball contains consciousness of some people,

686
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:22,400
how did it have John Pettymore the third's original body?

687
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:28,640
Also, how come some ball seems to act with intelligence when they take a body

688
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,360
and some kill themselves or go berserk?

689
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,400
That's a question about ball.

690
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,200
Excellent question about ball.

691
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:39,200
So I went through all these questions and typed out just little thoughts on all of them.

692
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,560
And this is one that I wrote.

693
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:43,040
I still don't know anything about ball.

694
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,400
Yeah, exactly.

695
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,880
I don't understand it.

696
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,080
No fucking clue.

697
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:51,120
I don't know for sure if I'm ball or not, but it's been implied for sure.

698
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,080
I don't know what that would mean for me or not for me.

699
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,960
I don't know much about ball at all.

700
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,080
Something we maybe should follow up on.

701
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,040
I don't know how though.

702
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,960
It seems like ball central was Marvin Glass's compound.

703
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,680
It does seem that way.

704
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,800
Let's head on back, boys.

705
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,800
We can still go.

706
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:21,280
No, if you'll remember, we were planning on going back there to intercept,

707
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,800
was it the FBI agents before they got killed?

708
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,160
We were going to talk to somebody and then Maggie showed up and she's like,

709
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,520
this will only take two hours.

710
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,200
And then all the university shit happened.

711
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,520
Yeah, I don't think so.

712
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,320
It's like the mill.

713
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,680
Zach doesn't want us to do that.

714
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,560
When I was reading back over the overview,

715
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:47,680
I noted in one of the overviews that I wrote early on and said,

716
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,400
they chose not to go to the mill.

717
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:52,580
Wow.

718
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:58,180
Well, this next one comes from crush 36.

719
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:00,260
I don't know if you all have any more ball thoughts.

720
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:01,460
No, no, that was perfect.

721
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:05,300
I have tons of plot ball thoughts, but you know,

722
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:07,860
can we, can we real fast think about all the balls we've seen?

723
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:14,340
For real though, I know the first one it was in,

724
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:18,420
it was in the potential green box in a tub that was filled with gore.

725
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:21,700
And when we opened it, it was a woman's head in the middle of it,

726
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:24,260
split open with a ball sitting in the middle of it.

727
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:27,540
So that was our first encounter with ball.

728
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,460
Ball one.

729
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:32,100
Is that the ball that you had in your pocket, Thomas?

730
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:32,980
I think so, right?

731
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:33,700
I believe so.

732
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:37,620
We've got tub head ball that then John pocketed.

733
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:42,900
And then the agents McKinley and Kennedy had their own ball.

734
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:45,220
When we, when we brought them the Nike bag,

735
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:48,500
they brought their own ball out of their pocket and popped it into the bag.

736
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,420
And we didn't tell them that we already had a ball.

737
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:51,220
I don't think.

738
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,140
So that's two balls we know of now.

739
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:57,540
Third ball would be whatever John himself is, right?

740
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,620
He or was the ball in his pocket.

741
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:00,340
What became him?

742
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:01,060
Do we know that?

743
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:03,620
I don't know if my character knows that and it's been said, I don't know.

744
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:06,420
So we don't have to say motherfucker.

745
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,700
You, you did, right?

746
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:12,580
Didn't you say that you were ball in your dad's body?

747
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:14,420
And then you were like, I think we're all ball.

748
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:17,300
I'm pretty sure that conversation happened at the cemetery.

749
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:20,580
Yeah, but I'm saying if I was the ball that I picked up and put in my pocket

750
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:22,820
and that's, that's how I became ball.

751
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:24,100
That would, that'd be big news.

752
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,620
I don't think that's true though.

753
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:29,140
And then, so the ball that was in Marvin's possession.

754
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:29,380
Right.

755
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:35,220
That, uh, Rosemary flung or no Marvin flung it at Rosemary, but yeah.

756
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:36,900
Do we know the origin of that ball?

757
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:42,260
Do we know if that was, came out of John's pocket maybe when we were last there?

758
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:47,300
Keith had seen videos of kids in rooms.

759
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:51,380
They tried to get them to touch the ball and it would come kill them.

760
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:55,780
So it seemed like maybe that ball had been there for a while.

761
00:38:55,780 --> 00:39:03,460
Cause they had tapes and tapes and tapes of kids getting, it would rip their spines out

762
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:05,300
or tear them apart, right?

763
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:11,780
I believe it would rip their spines out and enter them and then repeatedly slam their

764
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:15,780
own head into the wall until they fell.

765
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:18,020
Are those all our ball thoughts today?

766
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:21,220
I think that's every ball accounted for that we know of.

767
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:25,140
So when you guys were standing on the water and Marvin Glass

768
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:27,700
pulled up the body of John Wayne Pennymore.

769
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:28,820
Oh yeah, that's right.

770
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:31,300
He popped it open like a jar.

771
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:35,460
I know plot-wise that didn't happen very long ago, but

772
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:40,100
has enough real-time past that you'll let me listen to those episodes, Zach?

773
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:41,780
Yeah.

774
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:43,700
Pump up them numbers, baby.

775
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:47,460
Slap some ads on there and then you guys can go back and re-listen everything.

776
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:55,940
Also, I'm wearing a pair of, I'm wearing a pair of MeUndies right now and they're super

777
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:56,500
comfortable.

778
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:02,020
My mattress isn't a Casper mattress, but boy, do I wish it was.

779
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:11,220
Man, I heard if you go to MeUndies.com and type in pretending to wear underwear,

780
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:12,660
you could get 15% off.

781
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:13,780
Long coupon.

782
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:16,980
All right.

783
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:17,700
Hold on.

784
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,140
I got a bag of chips I need to eat.

785
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:25,620
Maladori writes, back at the campsite flashback.

786
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:27,220
Oh, did you guys talk about the homeless people?

787
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:28,020
No, you skipped one.

788
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:28,520
Oh, did I?

789
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:29,540
Oh, shit.

790
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:29,860
Sorry.

791
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:30,340
Okay.

792
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:33,220
Our favorite fan, Crush 36 writes,

793
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:37,220
JK.

794
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:38,500
Crush 36.

795
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:44,100
Oh, it sounds bad no matter what I do.

796
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:50,100
Crush 36 writes, I'm re-listening on episode four.

797
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:52,420
What was up with all the homeless people?

798
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:55,300
I feel like I remember some call back to them later,

799
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:58,580
but it's not stuck in my head like the other major plot points.

800
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:01,140
I can take this one.

801
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:03,300
We found out all about them.

802
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:11,940
At Glass's facility, we rescued Kathy Piston and she kind of filled us in that she was

803
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:16,980
trafficking those homeless people to both the Circle of Knowledge and Marvin Glass.

804
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:18,820
Did you say you rescued her?

805
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:20,020
Oh, right.

806
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:22,740
Well, we took her down off the hook and talked to her for a while.

807
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:28,740
She was our MVP in the fish man fight.

808
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:32,820
She kept sniping dudes down and then a sickle got her right to the...

809
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:33,380
That's right.

810
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:39,060
I went back to listen to that episode so I could make sure that I wasn't divulging stuff

811
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:40,180
you guys didn't know.

812
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:45,220
And we did talk about this in the Circle that I told you guys, I know that the Circle of

813
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:49,620
Knowledge uses homeless people to keep the evil thing that I saw at bay.

814
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:54,260
And then I asked Kathy, so I know what the Circle of Knowledge is about.

815
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:55,540
What's Marvin using them for?

816
00:41:55,540 --> 00:42:00,900
And she told us that he uses them for fights and that's all she knows and that she always

817
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:05,460
got the Circle of Knowledge homeless guys back in good, healthy shape.

818
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:10,260
Whereas the Marvin Glass guys came back, beat up and spent.

819
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:12,340
Or not at all, I believe.

820
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:18,820
Luke was just talking about seeing those videos of the experiments done with ball.

821
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:20,100
Gotcha.

822
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:26,660
And I believe it was evident that those were the people being used in those experiments

823
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:27,300
were the kids.

824
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:28,820
Orphan, no animals.

825
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,060
Yeah, just orphans.

826
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:33,460
Like poor ol' Walter.

827
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:38,740
I played FDR in Annie when I was in 8th grade so I can say all this.

828
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:42,820
I wore my underwear underneath my polio blanket.

829
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:43,380
Cool.

830
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:44,340
Are they me undies?

831
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:46,900
I've got a plug.

832
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:47,540
Does Casper...

833
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:49,940
Any other homeless people?

834
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:50,660
I believe not.

835
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:52,340
That was, yeah, very succinct.

836
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:57,220
I mean, there is a chance that Pastor Adam Kane is doing something with him also.

837
00:42:57,220 --> 00:43:04,660
When we crashed his church, we went down into that cafeteria area.

838
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:08,580
And I think that you describe that crowd as a homeless-looking crowd.

839
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:10,180
I always knew there was something off about that guy.

840
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:12,660
I got the feeling he was like a middleman or something between.

841
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:13,380
Yeah, maybe.

842
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:15,060
Or he was in on it with the pistons.

843
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:15,620
Either way, the food was good.

844
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:16,420
He's like, I'll feed him.

845
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:17,540
You transport him.

846
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:19,460
I'll Jesus him.

847
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:21,860
You feed him the power of Christ.

848
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:27,620
Yeah, he could have been saving them all because he knew they were going off to die.

849
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:29,220
It's like a kind of nice thought.

850
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:30,740
Yeah.

851
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:33,940
I mean, he didn't try to stop it from happening.

852
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:35,940
Yeah, he seemed like that kind of guy.

853
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:40,660
Okay, express train to heaven.

854
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:45,780
Holy shit.

855
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:47,780
I love when you can buy that package at a church.

856
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:49,160
Yeah.

857
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:54,340
You're telling me all I have to do is beat up some kids in a cage?

858
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:56,820
Sign me up.

859
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:02,740
Like the Ozark mountain daredevil said, if you want to get to heaven, you got to raise a little hell.

860
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:10,660
To quote the Ozark mountain daredevils, chicken train.

861
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:11,940
Running all day.

862
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:15,620
Laser beam in my dream.

863
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:18,180
I really liked that community episode.

864
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:22,500
The chicken train one, or you got another episode here from Maladory.

865
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:27,060
We've got another episode coming up right now.

866
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:36,740
I hope Q and a special in a row.

867
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:43,060
No, I, we, Oh, I'm so excited to start playing again, but that is for the end of this.

868
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:46,500
Maladory on like five or six more Q and A's.

869
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:52,820
Back at the campsite flashback.

870
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:58,180
What was with the weird tree arm trap and mirror that threw a spear?

871
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:02,740
The only acting forces we see are K cell black goo and ball.

872
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:06,100
None of them really seem like trap people.

873
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:09,300
That's presumptuous and K cell burns the cabin.

874
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:10,500
So they weren't using it.

875
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:13,140
What does that mean?

876
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:15,620
What do you guys think that means?

877
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:17,220
It was the witch.

878
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:20,020
I've got a theory about it all.

879
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:28,260
So if you remember back to Stan Manstein's monologue, he talked about how Silas Cole

880
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:30,980
discovered the ooze and then became an inventor.

881
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:37,220
When I went into the cabin, I found plans for the gun and a bunch of tubes of ooze.

882
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:40,020
So I wonder if it has something to do with Silas Cole.

883
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:45,620
Maybe it was his laboratory or something, but the time thing is all crazy.

884
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:49,460
I don't know how any of that works out, but that's been my theory for a while now that

885
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:50,500
that has something to do with it.

886
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:53,460
Can I remind you of something else that you saw in the cabin?

887
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:58,260
It was paperwork for Cole's orphanage.

888
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:00,340
Right, right, right, right.

889
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:02,500
Further strengthening the coal ties.

890
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:04,100
Further strengthening the coal ties.

891
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:05,060
Perhaps.

892
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:07,300
I mean, it was just named after him, so who knows.

893
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:08,900
Was it named after him or his wife?

894
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:10,260
What was Mary Cole?

895
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:11,940
There was something that was named for Mary Cole.

896
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:13,460
Do we remember what that was?

897
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:15,060
I believe the library.

898
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:16,420
Oh, okay, okay, yeah.

899
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:17,220
That's been my theory.

900
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:21,460
I don't know anything really about how the traps or mirrors or weird tree and all that

901
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:25,220
stuff worked or if, I don't know.

902
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:26,020
I don't know any of it.

903
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:29,700
That's just been what I've, the two dots that I've connected myself.

904
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:31,620
What do you guys think the cabin was?

905
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:33,700
I don't know.

906
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:37,460
I mean, I didn't get to explore the woods very much.

907
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:46,100
I forgot you were stuck in a tree for a lot of episodes.

908
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:47,700
You got to become the woods.

909
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:49,220
The whole time, I think.

910
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:54,340
You hung out with some people, though, before you ran away from them.

911
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:56,420
Oh, yeah, that's right.

912
00:46:56,420 --> 00:47:01,860
I got freed by the agents or whatever, but then I got killed, so I don't know.

913
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:06,260
Yeah, that was something my character didn't interact with a whole lot.

914
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:07,700
I don't know much about them.

915
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:13,780
Because they were scoping out the cabin after they freed me.

916
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:19,060
I don't really know, though, especially like the, I don't think, I don't think the weird

917
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:21,300
tree thing was like a trap necessarily.

918
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:24,100
I think it was more like supernatural.

919
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:24,900
Gotcha.

920
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:26,100
And I'm an expert on it.

921
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:27,540
Studied it.

922
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:30,740
Any other thoughts on the traps?

923
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:36,900
Yeah, Thomas, when you went into, when you got on the other side of the moat, you found

924
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:38,980
a room that I don't think anybody else went into.

925
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:45,140
What was in that room?

926
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:54,020
On the inside of the moat with the cabin, there was like a storage.

927
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:56,100
Oh, was it all the dead orphans?

928
00:47:57,060 --> 00:48:04,820
It was a lot of dead bodies without their spines that were hanging like on racks with

929
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:07,220
a closet full of their clothes.

930
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:11,380
That's so spooky, which is why I must have blocked it out.

931
00:48:14,180 --> 00:48:17,620
So yeah, that's like ball.

932
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:22,740
I will say when I went back and listened to those, I was super incredibly frustrated that

933
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:27,700
when I went into that room with the plans for the gun, you were like, there's these

934
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:32,100
ooze like coffin things and there's these paperwork and there's these diagrams.

935
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:36,500
And I investigated all of those, but you also said there's a chest in the corner.

936
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:38,260
And there's a wooden trunk.

937
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:40,020
Never, it never got brought up again.

938
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:41,940
I totally forgot to check into it.

939
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:43,940
There could have been something cool inside.

940
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:48,820
I wonder, I think that that was why I decided not to check it out is because I thought I

941
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:53,300
knew what it was, but to have not actually said, let's open that bad boy up.

942
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:56,260
It might've.

943
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:58,500
It was real frustrating to listen back to.

944
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:02,340
I think that's probably something that the listeners can relate to.

945
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:05,800
All right.

946
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:10,180
Justin, you have any theories about the woods?

947
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:13,620
Oh, they seem bad and like you shouldn't be there.

948
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:14,120
Nope.

949
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:23,140
And you shouldn't be putting your arm inside of a weird monster tree that desires flesh.

950
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:26,180
I was so glad that you did it like right away.

951
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:27,860
You just did it so quick.

952
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:28,900
I mean, it's funny.

953
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:32,500
It's funny looking back, but it was like you said a loop trap.

954
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:37,540
Almost as if what does this button do?

955
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:38,340
Oh boy.

956
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:40,740
Whatever happened to our naked raccoon friend?

957
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:42,020
Oh, right.

958
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:45,380
He's he's did he get killed at the end?

959
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:47,060
Did I, did I see him get killed?

960
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:48,980
How long do raccoons live for?

961
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:51,460
Uh, I'll Google it.

962
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:56,980
I'm going to say four years.

963
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:04,260
Two to three years, 28 inches, two to three years in the wild.

964
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:09,220
And 10 to 15 years old as a pet.

965
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:09,940
Oh wow.

966
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:11,780
We should be getting more raccoons as pets.

967
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:14,100
What if there's a human inside?

968
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:16,580
Uh, split the diff.

969
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:20,180
That's what Google says.

970
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:22,260
Human inside, not outside.

971
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:24,020
Human inside.

972
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:24,520
Yeah.

973
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:28,100
I accidentally Googled how long do raccoons.

974
00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:31,140
How long do raccoons Zach?

975
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:37,460
So they, uh, Jay Hawk Inc asked any of the side story characters that could show up in

976
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:43,300
the main story or the inverse, like the boys getting to explore the calm, comfy campgrounds.

977
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:50,020
Uh, yeah, I, um, I made plans a while ago for the calm, comfy campgrounds in case you

978
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:54,820
guys wanted to go there as far as side stories showing up in the main story.

979
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:56,820
Um, it's all main story, baby.

980
00:50:57,380 --> 00:51:01,140
I know like some of them are in the past, but this is all one big story.

981
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:02,900
That's all interconnected.

982
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:05,380
So it's all main story.

983
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:10,340
So they could all show up anywhere if they're still alive or if they're not, maybe, uh,

984
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:15,940
Jay Hawk Inc also says, I think I'm going to make one of my social distancing projects,

985
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:18,260
quote, re-listen and fill out the Wiki.

986
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:21,540
Hell yeah, but do it.

987
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:23,300
Good luck indeed.

988
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:24,900
But yeah, that would be sick.

989
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:31,540
Uh, I'll send you the overviews of the episodes if you want help with doing that.

990
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:36,660
And then, uh, they also said, and maybe pay more attention to the community.

991
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:41,300
I don't follow on Twitter for some reason, do it that pretending prod on Twitter and

992
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:45,140
didn't even know we had a discord until it was mentioned in the last episode.

993
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:46,020
How dare you?

994
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:48,180
How did I not know we had a discord?

995
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:49,780
How did you not know we had a discord?

996
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:50,980
We never talk about it.

997
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:57,220
I mean, we kind of mentioned it offhandedly, but I don't think we've, have we ever like

998
00:51:57,220 --> 00:51:58,980
explicitly shouted it out on the show?

999
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:00,740
I don't know.

1000
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:06,260
I think Wolf the dog does it fairly often.

1001
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:08,820
And it's definitely not in any of the early episodes.

1002
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:09,380
That is true.

1003
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:12,500
But I'm afraid at this point because the discord is awesome.

1004
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:17,860
And the more people join, the more likely for it to be not awesome anymore.

1005
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:18,900
Oh, it's, it's easy.

1006
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:21,380
You just ban them when they're dumb immediately.

1007
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:24,420
Shout out to crush 36.

1008
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:26,500
Shout out to pretending to be Justin.

1009
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:30,660
Mod it up boys.

1010
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:32,980
We got another question.

1011
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:34,260
This one's a fun one.

1012
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:35,780
Guys, lighten up.

1013
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:37,540
You're taking this way too seriously.

1014
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:39,940
This is a fun one.

1015
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:46,180
Crane song asks, let's suppose the boys parentheses, including Drew and Maggie and whoever

1016
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:52,420
Zach decides is covered by quote, the boys were put under quarantine like we are today.

1017
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:57,140
Assuming that for some reason, contention PD is not considered an essential service,

1018
00:52:58,100 --> 00:52:58,740
which I love.

1019
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:04,100
How do you, how do they, how do they spend their isolation or would they ignore?

1020
00:53:04,740 --> 00:53:06,660
Oh, don't give that option to them.

1021
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:09,860
Would they ignore a statewide stay at home order?

1022
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:11,380
That's unfortunate.

1023
00:53:11,380 --> 00:53:12,580
We know the answer.

1024
00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:12,820
Yeah.

1025
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:15,140
But unfortunately, you know, John Lee Pennymore would.

1026
00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:19,300
I know the first thing that would come out of your mouth is that John Lee Pennymore wouldn't

1027
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:20,580
give a fuck.

1028
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:22,660
Well, he would like, Oh my God.

1029
00:53:22,660 --> 00:53:23,540
Such an idiot.

1030
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:24,100
I know.

1031
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:29,460
And there's this dude I know on Facebook, the shit he's posted about COVID is like,

1032
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:33,380
definitely what the kind of media like John Lee Pennymore would consume.

1033
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:39,300
Oh, like baseless theories about how it's like trying to control us as a population.

1034
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:41,780
Like, yeah, like 5g conspiracy theory shit.

1035
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:42,740
Oh yeah.

1036
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:43,860
So just like true stuff.

1037
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:48,500
Yeah, the straight shit.

1038
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:51,940
Honestly, he might take it seriously.

1039
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:57,540
Uh, he might be that kind of like prepper conspiracy theorist who's like, kind of been

1040
00:53:57,540 --> 00:54:00,820
waiting for this, but he also just has like a lot of land.

1041
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:06,580
So he's probably out there just like shooting guns all day and riding around on like a four

1042
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:09,860
Wheeler and watching his DVDs.

1043
00:54:09,860 --> 00:54:14,900
Any existential crisis inside John Lee Pennymore about enjoying the quarantine?

1044
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:18,900
No, I don't think John Lee Pennymore ever sweats having a good time.

1045
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:21,780
Why are you going to feel guilty about living your life, baby?

1046
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:26,820
Not much would change for Clark.

1047
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:29,780
He just wouldn't be going to work, but he'd still be at home.

1048
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:35,540
Uh, maybe he'd break out his old jigsaw puzzles and, uh, he might, uh, he might teach

1049
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:38,340
himself how to cook, not a TV dinner.

1050
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:41,700
He might learn to boil an egg.

1051
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:45,300
I have 40 boiled eggs.

1052
00:54:45,860 --> 00:54:48,500
He gets a chef's hat with one notch in it.

1053
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:52,740
What about Keith Vigna?

1054
00:54:53,540 --> 00:55:00,180
Uh, Keith gets a side job delivering newspapers in his cruiser and then continues to cruise

1055
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:05,540
around the city the whole day, basically ignoring that he's not essential and just to have some

1056
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:06,660
sort of authority.

1057
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:10,100
That's worse than John's.

1058
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:12,900
Oh, that's worse than John's.

1059
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:17,300
Yeah, except for the Facebook share.

1060
00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:23,300
Like I harass people in the parking lot of the grocery store.

1061
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:28,900
You're just hanging out at the first church of contention every Sunday and Wednesday,

1062
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:30,100
handing out tickets.

1063
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:31,540
Yeah, exactly.

1064
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:36,420
I think Wolf the dog would seize as much power as he possibly could since he knows everyone's

1065
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:38,580
stuck at home listening to him constantly.

1066
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:40,180
It's like Mitch McConnell.

1067
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:46,740
You could also just like maybe fuck off to like another time until things get like, I'm

1068
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:48,420
going to where the garbage is.

1069
00:55:51,940 --> 00:55:53,700
People have been very conscious of their garbage.

1070
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:54,580
What would Drew be doing?

1071
00:55:54,580 --> 00:55:57,460
Would he be working on his, uh, his YouTube channel?

1072
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:03,140
I think Drew would honestly, uh, get really upset.

1073
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:04,340
He lives alone.

1074
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:07,940
So he would get really, really lonely.

1075
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:15,540
And every day that went by without a zoom call, uh, or even the request for, uh, any

1076
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:21,380
sort of friendship would lead him to slowly stop enjoying the things that he previously

1077
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:23,460
liked, like playing Minecraft.

1078
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:28,340
For his millions of YouTube subscribers.

1079
00:56:28,340 --> 00:56:32,580
Shit does that, I just remembered that Drew and John are millionaires.

1080
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:38,180
John would be much more of a problem.

1081
00:56:38,180 --> 00:56:45,380
He would have been down at his ass off and like Pensacola.

1082
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:50,580
Just being a problem.

1083
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:57,700
And Drew, I would assume is like maybe having a good time ordering himself everything he

1084
00:56:57,700 --> 00:56:58,820
ever wanted from Amazon.

1085
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:07,620
I think, uh, he is just waiting that extra week and trying to avoid articles about any

1086
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:13,860
sort of worker strikes, uh, in order to feel fine about ordering from Amazon.

1087
00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:24,580
And meanwhile, he's just got like maps of different cities up on his wall and stats,

1088
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:31,140
uh, for how many potential youths lives can be changed with the money that he's bringing

1089
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:36,020
in for each city, uh, trying to decide where he can do the most good.

1090
00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:36,740
Wow.

1091
00:57:36,740 --> 00:57:37,860
And a boy.

1092
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:38,580
Good job, Drew.

1093
00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:42,100
He only has $5 million.

1094
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:52,020
He's got a $10,000 Mike, uh, Minecraft computer and all the cool ASMR stuff you could imagine.

1095
00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:54,420
So much bubble wrap.

1096
00:57:58,660 --> 00:58:00,020
All the bubble wrap.

1097
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:03,540
The only music Drew listens to is ASMR Youtubers.

1098
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:05,620
And bubble wrap.

1099
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:07,060
Bubble wrap.

1100
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:12,100
Oh, you guys, this is a really good bubble wrap compilation.

1101
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:15,620
Bubble wrap would be a great name for like a kid's hip hop album.

1102
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:16,820
Oh yeah.

1103
00:58:16,820 --> 00:58:21,380
It works at least in three ways that I can think of.

1104
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:24,580
Bubble wrap sounds like a Kiro Kiro Benito album.

1105
00:58:24,580 --> 00:58:26,340
Oh, Oh, Thomas.

1106
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:27,460
We got a speed round.

1107
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:36,020
We got to hit when Thomas gets back speed round round.

1108
00:58:36,020 --> 00:58:40,180
They're all about me and the things that I am going to say.

1109
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:45,460
So I want you guys to ask me these questions as fast as you can.

1110
00:58:46,340 --> 00:58:50,900
And don't decide who goes first or who goes next, but please go as fast as you can.

1111
00:58:51,140 --> 00:58:56,420
BazingaBegins asks, who are the four skeleton boys on the PTP logo supposed to be?

1112
00:58:56,420 --> 00:58:58,420
Do they have one-to-one analogs in the story?

1113
00:58:58,420 --> 00:59:00,100
Which came first, the story or the logo?

1114
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:05,220
It is Luke, a cowboy, an FBI MIB type agent.

1115
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:06,660
And, oh, fuck.

1116
00:59:06,660 --> 00:59:07,460
What's the last one?

1117
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:08,180
I'm blanking.

1118
00:59:08,180 --> 00:59:09,620
I'm blanking so hard.

1119
00:59:09,620 --> 00:59:10,180
A cop.

1120
00:59:10,180 --> 00:59:12,260
It's a cop with a mustache.

1121
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:14,580
A one-to-one analogs in the story.

1122
00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:15,080
No.

1123
00:59:15,860 --> 00:59:17,460
Which came first, the story or the logo?

1124
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:18,180
The story.

1125
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:23,540
But the logo, while not one-to-one analogs is definitely, I chose them for a reason based

1126
00:59:23,540 --> 00:59:24,740
on the whole story that we're telling.

1127
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:25,540
So get ready.

1128
00:59:25,540 --> 00:59:26,660
Jayhawk Inc.

1129
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:28,820
Just how big is contention?

1130
00:59:28,820 --> 00:59:32,580
Like there was a school bus full of homeless people, but I'm not sure where they all came

1131
00:59:32,580 --> 00:59:32,980
from.

1132
00:59:32,980 --> 00:59:35,300
How many people work at Contingent PD?

1133
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:38,740
5,000 people live in contention or slightly fewer.

1134
00:59:38,740 --> 00:59:43,140
And four people, five people work at Contingent PD.

1135
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:44,180
No, six.

1136
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:49,460
The three of you, Drew, Maggie, and Ray, Ari, Tim, Florence.

1137
00:59:50,180 --> 00:59:56,340
BxBori9181 asks, I feel like clothes in certain situations are very important.

1138
00:59:56,340 --> 00:59:58,260
Am I imagining that or is it so?

1139
00:59:58,260 --> 00:59:59,460
It is very important.

1140
01:00:00,260 --> 01:00:04,100
It's an audio medium where I have to describe people and then you have to remember them

1141
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:04,660
for later.

1142
01:00:04,660 --> 01:00:08,500
So I have to keep the same descriptions of either what they're wearing or what they look

1143
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:12,500
like every time they pop back up or most of the time when they pop back up, depending

1144
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:14,260
on how subtle I'm trying to be.

1145
01:00:14,260 --> 01:00:14,980
Nice.

1146
01:00:14,980 --> 01:00:20,500
BazingaBegins asks, after season one wraps, will Zach be posting full lore notes slash

1147
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:21,300
background?

1148
01:00:21,300 --> 01:00:24,420
Any chance of turning this into an official module for Delta Green?

1149
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:28,820
Turning this into an official module for Delta Green would take as much time as writing a

1150
01:00:28,820 --> 01:00:31,940
book and I'm willing to put it in if we can make it happen.

1151
01:00:31,940 --> 01:00:37,380
But our Patreon would have to be at a higher level and we'd also have to get Delta Green

1152
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:38,660
behind us to publish it.

1153
01:00:38,740 --> 01:00:42,900
But if they don't want to publish it and the money's there, I will definitely spend the

1154
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:47,780
time to write this thing out into a full book and get illustrators and do maps for every

1155
01:00:47,780 --> 01:00:51,380
building and everything and it would be fucking awesome and I would love to do that.

1156
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:52,980
Jayhawk Inc.

1157
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:58,980
How many clues did the group miss or misinterpret before the ding was edited in after correct

1158
01:00:58,980 --> 01:00:59,620
guesses?

1159
01:00:59,620 --> 01:01:04,260
Clues have been missed and misinterpreted constantly from the beginning and that's how

1160
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:07,780
role-playing works constantly and that's what makes it so much fun.

1161
01:01:07,780 --> 01:01:12,500
The ding was only in like one or two episodes and it was for fun.

1162
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:16,500
LordDary asks, have you guys ever thought about a collaboration with Last Podcast on

1163
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:17,060
the left?

1164
01:01:17,060 --> 01:01:18,580
I dream about it every night.

1165
01:01:18,580 --> 01:01:20,420
I love Last Podcast on the left.

1166
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:23,540
Everyone should tweet at Last Podcast on the left and be like, hey, you guys don't have

1167
01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:26,340
a role-playing podcast on the Last Podcast network.

1168
01:01:26,340 --> 01:01:27,380
Maybe you should have one.

1169
01:01:28,420 --> 01:01:29,620
And then mention us.

1170
01:01:29,620 --> 01:01:30,820
Don't forget about that part.

1171
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:32,820
Yeah, that would be, yes, thank you, Luke, please.

1172
01:01:32,820 --> 01:01:33,460
Next.

1173
01:01:33,460 --> 01:01:37,620
Bazinga Begin says, how long did you think it would take the boys to play through the

1174
01:01:37,620 --> 01:01:38,740
campaign, i.e.

1175
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:41,540
how many episodes did you think season one would be?

1176
01:01:41,540 --> 01:01:45,140
What's the most important detail that got added after your initial plans?

1177
01:01:45,140 --> 01:01:47,700
40 episodes tops, whole thing.

1178
01:01:47,700 --> 01:01:50,020
I was like, easy, done, for sure.

1179
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:54,260
What's the most, and it'll probably be 100 is my guess currently.

1180
01:01:54,260 --> 01:01:57,620
What's the most important detail that got added after, all of them, all of them got

1181
01:01:57,620 --> 01:01:59,540
it added after the initial plans.

1182
01:01:59,540 --> 01:02:04,420
What I planned was just background and the first like two episodes.

1183
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:09,860
Jayhawk Inc, is there a list of loose threads or abandoned or unresolved elements?

1184
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:10,180
Yes.

1185
01:02:11,940 --> 01:02:16,980
OkayNothing4 asks, what happened to the gun, helmet, radio, etc?

1186
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:18,900
They just vanished from the story?

1187
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:22,180
They vanished from the story because the players aren't where they are.

1188
01:02:22,180 --> 01:02:28,900
The radio and the helmet are in the contention evidence locker and the gun and the camera

1189
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:31,220
are in Marvin Glass's compound.

1190
01:02:31,220 --> 01:02:36,020
Jayhawk Inc asks, has anything been forgotten by accident that might have changed the story

1191
01:02:36,020 --> 01:02:37,940
if it had been remembered at the time?

1192
01:02:39,620 --> 01:02:42,980
Yes, 100%, absolutely, constantly.

1193
01:02:42,980 --> 01:02:44,980
I think that's the story of the podcast.

1194
01:02:46,020 --> 01:02:48,660
If you remember something, it becomes more important.

1195
01:02:49,620 --> 01:02:50,740
Thomas, read that last one.

1196
01:02:52,180 --> 01:02:52,660
Hold on.

1197
01:02:54,900 --> 01:02:56,820
It's a speed round, come on.

1198
01:02:56,820 --> 01:02:57,940
Bazinga begins.

1199
01:02:57,940 --> 01:02:59,460
On page what counts as a story?

1200
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:01,060
Speed round.

1201
01:03:01,620 --> 01:03:03,700
Sorry, when you said last one, I went to the last one.

1202
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:04,820
We got to keep saying speed round.

1203
01:03:04,820 --> 01:03:05,540
Speed round.

1204
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:08,500
All right, Bazinga begins.

1205
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:10,740
What counts as a story arc on the show?

1206
01:03:10,740 --> 01:03:15,380
The past two episodes mentioned that season one has three more story arcs left.

1207
01:03:15,380 --> 01:03:19,220
How many have there been so far in your opinion and where are the breaks roughly?

1208
01:03:19,220 --> 01:03:23,220
You read that so well and I really appreciated you doing that.

1209
01:03:23,220 --> 01:03:26,660
Like your cadence was perfect and your voice-

1210
01:03:26,660 --> 01:03:27,620
Speed round.

1211
01:03:27,620 --> 01:03:30,580
Can you read it as fast as you can?

1212
01:03:30,580 --> 01:03:31,380
I'm just curious.

1213
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:32,260
I think it'd be fun.

1214
01:03:32,260 --> 01:03:33,140
Bazinga begins.

1215
01:03:33,140 --> 01:03:34,420
What counts as a story arc on the show?

1216
01:03:34,420 --> 01:03:36,660
The past two episodes mentioned that season one has three more story arcs left.

1217
01:03:36,660 --> 01:03:38,740
How many have there been so far in your opinion and where are the breaks roughly?

1218
01:03:38,740 --> 01:03:39,860
That was amazing.

1219
01:03:39,860 --> 01:03:41,300
That was so impressive.

1220
01:03:41,300 --> 01:03:46,340
Should we all, at the same time, all at the same time as fast as we can?

1221
01:03:46,340 --> 01:03:47,140
Three.

1222
01:03:47,140 --> 01:03:47,700
Count us down.

1223
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:49,540
Three, two, one.

1224
01:03:49,540 --> 01:03:51,380
What counts as a story arc on the show?

1225
01:03:51,380 --> 01:03:54,340
The past two episodes mentioned that season one has three more arcs left.

1226
01:03:54,340 --> 01:03:57,140
How many have there been so far in your opinion and where are the breaks roughly?

1227
01:03:58,820 --> 01:03:59,540
Nice.

1228
01:03:59,540 --> 01:04:00,660
I fumbled a few words.

1229
01:04:02,180 --> 01:04:04,420
It was kind of weird hearing it all at the same time.

1230
01:04:04,420 --> 01:04:06,020
It was like a speech jammer.

1231
01:04:06,020 --> 01:04:07,780
Everyone answered at the same time.

1232
01:04:07,780 --> 01:04:10,740
No, so there have been seven arcs so far.

1233
01:04:10,740 --> 01:04:11,540
There are three left.

1234
01:04:11,540 --> 01:04:12,580
That'll be 10 total.

1235
01:04:12,580 --> 01:04:17,140
Episodes one through 14 was the start to the FBI agents leaving contention.

1236
01:04:17,140 --> 01:04:19,860
Episodes 15 to 25 is the next arc.

1237
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:24,180
Flashbacks of their past to the officers leaving contention.

1238
01:04:24,180 --> 01:04:31,380
Episodes 26 through 35 is them going to the city to chanting inside Ari Manstein's mausoleum,

1239
01:04:31,380 --> 01:04:34,260
which is where we've, you know, the end of where we've reset to.

1240
01:04:34,260 --> 01:04:38,100
And then 37 to 46 was the glass compound in Planet Juggernaut.

1241
01:04:38,100 --> 01:04:40,660
47 to 53 was the woods in the past.

1242
01:04:40,660 --> 01:04:44,180
54 to 64 was the numbers in City State University.

1243
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:48,900
And 66 to 72 is calm comfy campground, also in the past.

1244
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:51,620
That is the end of that.

1245
01:04:51,620 --> 01:04:52,100
Yes.

1246
01:04:52,100 --> 01:04:56,340
And then bonus arc is eight Q&A episodes.

1247
01:04:58,100 --> 01:05:01,460
Yeah, and we have Maladory asks, what is your favorite type of plot?

1248
01:05:01,460 --> 01:05:05,620
I am personally a big fan of scatter, but I can't fault anyone who enjoys a good box plot.

1249
01:05:05,620 --> 01:05:06,980
I'm a graph kind of guy.

1250
01:05:06,980 --> 01:05:08,100
I like a probability plot.

1251
01:05:08,100 --> 01:05:09,460
I like a good one.

1252
01:05:09,460 --> 01:05:10,500
I like pie.

1253
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:12,820
I like when the plot thickens.

1254
01:05:12,820 --> 01:05:16,260
Damn Guardian asks, are we going to see Drew again?

1255
01:05:16,260 --> 01:05:17,860
Everyone answer on the count of three.

1256
01:05:17,860 --> 01:05:18,580
One, two, three.

1257
01:05:18,580 --> 01:05:19,460
Absolutely.

1258
01:05:19,460 --> 01:05:20,820
Hell yeah.

1259
01:05:20,820 --> 01:05:22,020
Yeah, no doubt for sure.

1260
01:05:22,740 --> 01:05:24,500
That is the end of the speed round.

1261
01:05:26,820 --> 01:05:28,740
I didn't know that's where that speed round ended.

1262
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:31,540
I think we nailed it so fast.

1263
01:05:31,540 --> 01:05:34,420
I can't wait to listen to us all ask the question at the same time.

1264
01:05:34,420 --> 01:05:35,860
It's my favorite part of the episode.

1265
01:05:36,820 --> 01:05:41,940
Uh, so we've got a question here from Maladory asks with contention being abandoned or emptied

1266
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:46,180
recently and the town having turned against the CPD because of the non-denomination specific

1267
01:05:46,180 --> 01:05:50,500
pastor, is anyone there left around or is it mostly just the people in the city?

1268
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:55,620
Did anyone actually make it out or was everyone gobbled up by the old goo monster?

1269
01:05:55,620 --> 01:05:58,740
Curious as to what your guys's thoughts are on the matter.

1270
01:05:58,740 --> 01:06:04,020
Is he actually non-denominational or is he, uh, like Pentecostal or a Baptist?

1271
01:06:04,100 --> 01:06:08,740
He is non-denominational, but not the denomination of non-denom.

1272
01:06:08,740 --> 01:06:11,220
Just he doesn't have a denomination.

1273
01:06:11,220 --> 01:06:14,180
First church of contention, pastor Adam Kane.

1274
01:06:14,180 --> 01:06:18,100
I think that we can answer that when we go back.

1275
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:22,260
Yeah, that's, that's what I wrote in my little notes here is that we don't know for sure.

1276
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:27,460
I think Drew has told us that it seems dead around the city or around contention.

1277
01:06:27,460 --> 01:06:33,940
I have a feeling that we will arrive, uh, to a nightmare scenario, but that's just my guess.

1278
01:06:34,580 --> 01:06:36,980
Or everything's fine, probably.

1279
01:06:38,660 --> 01:06:40,660
Everything's just completely back to normal.

1280
01:06:40,660 --> 01:06:42,260
Which would be almost even scarier.

1281
01:06:42,260 --> 01:06:43,220
If we've done our jobs right.

1282
01:06:43,220 --> 01:06:48,020
In the last numbers arc, the city university arc, did we, we tried to call Drew a few times,

1283
01:06:48,020 --> 01:06:50,100
didn't we? And it just kept going to voicemail?

1284
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:50,580
Yeah.

1285
01:06:50,580 --> 01:06:51,060
Okay.

1286
01:06:51,060 --> 01:06:54,660
So go, going back to that last question, probably not then.

1287
01:06:57,780 --> 01:07:02,740
Okay, nothing for, how have the decisions made affected the trust held between the

1288
01:07:02,820 --> 01:07:05,220
three contention PD officers?

1289
01:07:05,220 --> 01:07:08,820
How did it affect you when you found out that I killed my brother?

1290
01:07:08,820 --> 01:07:09,780
It wasn't great.

1291
01:07:12,500 --> 01:07:16,740
I, uh, I feel like Clark still has a level of trust for you guys though.

1292
01:07:16,740 --> 01:07:21,060
Just because we've gone, we started at zero and we've gone through so much crazy shit together

1293
01:07:21,060 --> 01:07:25,860
that like, I'm a little more understanding about you doing fucked up shit in this world now.

1294
01:07:26,660 --> 01:07:30,260
I think possibly it has raised the trust level.

1295
01:07:30,260 --> 01:07:31,860
Probably for Keith it has.

1296
01:07:31,940 --> 01:07:37,700
Yeah, definitely like I've seen Keith handle himself in these situations now.

1297
01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:42,500
And so I don't think it, I don't think he was surprised to learn about Keith killing his brother.

1298
01:07:44,980 --> 01:07:46,180
That tracks, that tracks.

1299
01:07:46,180 --> 01:07:46,340
Yeah.

1300
01:07:47,460 --> 01:07:51,540
But I think I definitely find Keith more capable than I might've at the start of the series.

1301
01:07:51,540 --> 01:07:55,540
I think Keith has gotten more capable as time goes.

1302
01:07:57,220 --> 01:08:01,060
It's been hours since I've been a truly pathetic police officer.

1303
01:08:01,860 --> 01:08:05,940
Crane song asks players.

1304
01:08:05,940 --> 01:08:11,220
Are there any in character secrets that you suspect the other players are keeping from you?

1305
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:16,020
Any theories about the other characters that you aren't sure of, but you're willing to share?

1306
01:08:16,580 --> 01:08:19,620
So don't answer that one right now.

1307
01:08:19,620 --> 01:08:21,060
I don't know.

1308
01:08:21,060 --> 01:08:21,540
Can you hear me?

1309
01:08:21,540 --> 01:08:22,020
Don't do it.

1310
01:08:22,660 --> 01:08:22,900
Yeah.

1311
01:08:24,740 --> 01:08:26,420
Pretend you can't answer it.

1312
01:08:26,420 --> 01:08:32,020
Uh, so I'm going to break you guys off as soon as this quarantine's over.

1313
01:08:32,020 --> 01:08:34,740
I'm just going to break you guys.

1314
01:08:34,740 --> 01:08:35,380
Bring it, bitch.

1315
01:08:35,380 --> 01:08:37,060
Break a piece off of you, Joe.

1316
01:08:39,620 --> 01:08:41,140
Hey, okay.

1317
01:08:41,140 --> 01:08:42,900
I'd like to see you try.

1318
01:08:43,460 --> 01:08:46,260
Break me off a piece of that Joe Terry.

1319
01:08:47,780 --> 01:08:48,580
Come on, get a snack.

1320
01:08:49,460 --> 01:08:58,340
So, uh, so yeah, be thinking about, uh, whether or not you have any theories on the other

1321
01:08:58,340 --> 01:09:01,620
characters while, uh, who's going to pee first.

1322
01:09:01,620 --> 01:09:02,660
I have to pee.

1323
01:09:02,660 --> 01:09:04,900
Want to see all the bubblies I've drank so far?

1324
01:09:04,900 --> 01:09:07,540
One, two.

1325
01:09:08,740 --> 01:09:09,380
Oh my God.

1326
01:09:10,100 --> 01:09:10,420
No way.

1327
01:09:10,420 --> 01:09:10,660
Three.

1328
01:09:12,340 --> 01:09:13,220
No, you're not going to pull.

1329
01:09:13,220 --> 01:09:13,620
Four.

1330
01:09:13,620 --> 01:09:13,940
Four?

1331
01:09:15,300 --> 01:09:15,780
You're out of control.

1332
01:09:15,780 --> 01:09:19,220
And then two, two in the trashcan that I've thrown away.

1333
01:09:19,220 --> 01:09:20,900
And this is the one I'm drinking right now.

1334
01:09:20,900 --> 01:09:23,220
That's an expensive habit you're picking up there.

1335
01:09:24,740 --> 01:09:26,900
Well, I'm in my parents' house, so they're buying it.

1336
01:09:26,900 --> 01:09:28,900
Those are the three Coke Zero I drank.

1337
01:09:29,780 --> 01:09:31,300
Oh, wowzers.

1338
01:09:31,940 --> 01:09:34,740
I had two cold brews and I am sweaty.

1339
01:09:34,740 --> 01:09:38,420
I had a small water bottle and now I'm working on a big water bottle.

1340
01:09:39,140 --> 01:09:40,180
Fuck off.

1341
01:09:40,180 --> 01:09:43,060
Shut the fuck up, Joe.

1342
01:09:43,060 --> 01:09:46,420
Oh, I added, uh, I added Emergen-C to the small water bottle.

1343
01:09:46,420 --> 01:09:46,900
Oh, nice.

1344
01:09:46,900 --> 01:09:48,820
I've been drinking a lot of that too.

1345
01:09:48,820 --> 01:09:53,220
I haven't drank alcohol this whole quarantine, so I've been replacing it with bubbly and

1346
01:09:53,220 --> 01:09:54,180
Pocky sticks.

1347
01:09:54,180 --> 01:09:55,300
Nice combo, man.

1348
01:09:55,300 --> 01:09:57,860
Yeah, it makes me have to pee and poop all the time though.

1349
01:09:57,860 --> 01:09:58,340
So, bye.

1350
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:03,860
All right, I'm going to sing.

1351
01:10:03,860 --> 01:10:05,220
Should I take my headphones off?

1352
01:10:05,220 --> 01:10:07,540
Cause I can hear what you guys say in the bathroom.

1353
01:10:07,540 --> 01:10:11,860
You shouldn't have told us that and you should have just popped up like a cool bathroom guest.

1354
01:10:13,060 --> 01:10:15,060
All right.

1355
01:10:15,860 --> 01:10:22,180
I am going to send Thomas off to the waiting room and I'll bring you back in shortly.

1356
01:10:22,180 --> 01:10:22,820
Bye.

1357
01:10:22,820 --> 01:10:23,060
Bye.

1358
01:10:23,940 --> 01:10:25,140
Oh, that's fun.

1359
01:10:25,140 --> 01:10:25,460
Hi.

1360
01:10:25,460 --> 01:10:30,740
Oh, zoom is so much easier than having the, like you guys in the living room, like screaming

1361
01:10:30,740 --> 01:10:33,140
at each other because we're all the loudest people ever.

1362
01:10:33,140 --> 01:10:37,220
I hope that they remember to keep their recordings going and that you get to hear what we talk

1363
01:10:37,220 --> 01:10:39,700
about when we're in the living room.

1364
01:10:41,060 --> 01:10:41,860
Oh yeah.

1365
01:10:41,860 --> 01:10:42,820
I didn't think about that.

1366
01:10:43,300 --> 01:10:45,780
Wait, can you guys see each other when you're in the waiting room?

1367
01:10:45,780 --> 01:10:48,500
They can't hear you, nor can I tell you the answer to that.

1368
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:52,820
Do you want to put me in the waiting room and then bring me back?

1369
01:10:53,780 --> 01:10:54,900
He's gone.

1370
01:10:54,900 --> 01:10:55,380
Oh no.

1371
01:10:56,180 --> 01:10:56,900
All right.

1372
01:10:56,900 --> 01:10:57,780
Let's bring him back.

1373
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:00,980
We sent a scout into the portal.

1374
01:11:00,980 --> 01:11:01,700
Oh God.

1375
01:11:01,700 --> 01:11:04,340
No, it was just a blank screen.

1376
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:06,340
There's nothing on the other side.

1377
01:11:06,340 --> 01:11:06,980
Oh God.

1378
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:10,580
That's almost worse than what I was expecting.

1379
01:11:10,580 --> 01:11:12,420
I've seen the waiting room.

1380
01:11:12,500 --> 01:11:15,220
Somebody Thomas changed his name to mommy.

1381
01:11:15,940 --> 01:11:20,100
Hey, that's fun.

1382
01:11:20,900 --> 01:11:21,540
I like that.

1383
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:23,140
Okay.

1384
01:11:23,140 --> 01:11:23,780
What's up, Joe?

1385
01:11:25,540 --> 01:11:27,060
You're the only one who's here.

1386
01:11:27,060 --> 01:11:28,660
I've got a question for you.

1387
01:11:29,780 --> 01:11:31,300
Justin is also here.

1388
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:32,740
Got a question for you.

1389
01:11:33,700 --> 01:11:35,940
It's Hey, who is Angela Fairfield?

1390
01:11:37,220 --> 01:11:41,380
So it turned out I believe it was Annie or Ann.

1391
01:11:41,380 --> 01:11:45,060
It was, uh, the woman that killed Clark's parents.

1392
01:11:45,700 --> 01:11:48,740
And I kind of wish I would have, it would have dawned on me at the time in

1393
01:11:48,740 --> 01:11:53,380
role-playing, but the little girl who I think we're assuming is Maggie now came

1394
01:11:53,380 --> 01:11:57,780
running up the sidewalk and was like, and, and good to see you.

1395
01:11:58,340 --> 01:12:04,660
And I think I failed a human role to see how Ann reacted to that and how James

1396
01:12:04,660 --> 01:12:05,380
reacted.

1397
01:12:05,380 --> 01:12:05,620
Yeah.

1398
01:12:06,420 --> 01:12:10,660
But yeah, it, after the fact, I, it kind of, it, uh, it all, it all came around

1399
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:11,460
full circle too.

1400
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:16,980
Oh, I remember you realizing after we'd stopped recording and you were like,

1401
01:12:16,980 --> 01:12:17,620
what?

1402
01:12:17,620 --> 01:12:18,580
Zach, you motherfucker!

1403
01:12:18,580 --> 01:12:21,700
Like you like really, and I, I never...

1404
01:12:21,700 --> 01:12:28,500
To have made Joe married to the character that killed his other character's

1405
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:30,660
parents was a really weird mind fuck.

1406
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:32,740
Yeah.

1407
01:12:34,980 --> 01:12:35,700
Thank you.

1408
01:12:35,700 --> 01:12:36,980
Yeah, you nailed it.

1409
01:12:38,180 --> 01:12:40,020
Also renamed the parents.

1410
01:12:40,020 --> 01:12:42,740
Yeah, Jerry and Eunice.

1411
01:12:44,260 --> 01:12:44,740
Love that.

1412
01:12:46,740 --> 01:12:51,540
I wrote down in my notes here that I wanted to remind the audience that Clark

1413
01:12:51,540 --> 01:12:57,860
actually saw Ann in the circle of knowledge room when he very first was

1414
01:12:57,860 --> 01:12:58,420
brought there.

1415
01:12:59,620 --> 01:13:02,740
He saw a glimpse of her as a door shut closed.

1416
01:13:03,460 --> 01:13:06,740
So another reason I should have picked up on the fact that she was running in

1417
01:13:06,740 --> 01:13:08,420
the circle of knowledge crew.

1418
01:13:08,900 --> 01:13:14,420
Probably you would have expected her to still be in jail, likely, based on you

1419
01:13:14,420 --> 01:13:17,940
being at her hearing and her pulling a double homicide.

1420
01:13:18,580 --> 01:13:20,180
And admitting to it on the stand.

1421
01:13:20,180 --> 01:13:21,940
She said, I did it and I do it again.

1422
01:13:23,300 --> 01:13:28,740
One might've assumed that she would not be free to go wherever she pleased.

1423
01:13:29,780 --> 01:13:33,860
But there's also a timey-wimey fucky thing going on with Clark's memories too.

1424
01:13:33,860 --> 01:13:36,660
So, I mean, there's a little bit of like, did that happen?

1425
01:13:36,660 --> 01:13:37,460
Did that not happen?

1426
01:13:37,620 --> 01:13:38,420
Did that not happen?

1427
01:13:38,420 --> 01:13:38,580
Yeah.

1428
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:40,420
It's real, it's real, real wild for him.

1429
01:13:40,420 --> 01:13:45,860
I think if we're this deep in the game and you're not questioning reality, then

1430
01:13:45,860 --> 01:13:47,540
you're not paying attention.

1431
01:13:48,260 --> 01:13:53,940
Bazinga begins asked, so Clark and Maggie, is Clark in love with her or what?

1432
01:13:55,220 --> 01:13:59,300
Maybe in like an Oedipal way, but I think it's way more of an authority

1433
01:13:59,300 --> 01:14:03,540
figure that he respects and wants the approval of.

1434
01:14:04,100 --> 01:14:05,460
I think he's got hots for teacher.

1435
01:14:06,100 --> 01:14:06,740
Yeah, there you go.

1436
01:14:06,740 --> 01:14:12,660
Maybe that, but it's, it's not surface level romance for sure.

1437
01:14:13,300 --> 01:14:17,380
Maladory asks, are we going to see more about Clark's parents?

1438
01:14:17,380 --> 01:14:21,620
What info can you give us that we know about them, but might not have stuck in?

1439
01:14:22,420 --> 01:14:24,820
All the best letters got me emotionally.

1440
01:14:24,820 --> 01:14:27,460
And I hope Clark finds some closure there.

1441
01:14:27,460 --> 01:14:32,580
So early on, we mentioned that we gave Zach the free reign to do whatever he wants to

1442
01:14:32,580 --> 01:14:34,420
our characters' backstories.

1443
01:14:34,420 --> 01:14:36,420
And he's done exactly that with the parent stuff.

1444
01:14:37,220 --> 01:14:39,780
That was never written into my character description.

1445
01:14:40,420 --> 01:14:44,980
So I'm learning and absorbing as much as the audience is when all that stuff comes up.

1446
01:14:45,780 --> 01:14:49,060
So as far as stuff that stuck out to us that we, or maybe that hasn't stuck out to

1447
01:14:49,060 --> 01:14:52,020
us that needed to have stuck out to us, I hope I didn't miss any of that.

1448
01:14:53,460 --> 01:14:54,900
But I'm loving it.

1449
01:14:54,900 --> 01:14:59,300
I think it's, you were already given the best letters is a really fucking ominous

1450
01:14:59,300 --> 01:15:03,620
and cool hook that I'm, I really want to explore so much more.

1451
01:15:03,620 --> 01:15:06,260
Yeah, I feel like it's, but yeah, I'm right there with you.

1452
01:15:06,260 --> 01:15:10,900
I feel like it's adding a really interesting wrinkle to Clark's weird character.

1453
01:15:11,540 --> 01:15:12,100
Totally.

1454
01:15:12,100 --> 01:15:13,700
I'm loving playing it too.

1455
01:15:13,700 --> 01:15:14,260
Yeah.

1456
01:15:14,260 --> 01:15:18,500
When we found old Clark's hidey hole and we found that tape of his parents playing on

1457
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:21,620
Wheel of Fortune, that was a really cool just moment.

1458
01:15:21,620 --> 01:15:23,060
Like what the fuck's going on?

1459
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:23,560
Yeah.

1460
01:15:24,020 --> 01:15:25,060
I have a question.

1461
01:15:25,060 --> 01:15:27,620
Why do you, other than, nevermind.

1462
01:15:28,580 --> 01:15:30,420
So let's see.

1463
01:15:31,780 --> 01:15:35,860
Clark's parents were seen in the flashback, obviously.

1464
01:15:36,580 --> 01:15:40,500
We've got the picture as well.

1465
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:42,020
Oh yeah, fuck.

1466
01:15:42,020 --> 01:15:42,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1467
01:15:42,740 --> 01:15:43,620
Jim Cook's house.

1468
01:15:44,260 --> 01:15:45,940
Jim Cook was friends with my parents.

1469
01:15:45,940 --> 01:15:46,900
I forgot about that.

1470
01:15:47,540 --> 01:15:49,380
It's just a picture of them with Jim, right?

1471
01:15:49,380 --> 01:15:49,620
Yep.

1472
01:15:49,620 --> 01:15:51,380
And they're all like smiley.

1473
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:54,020
I think your parents were smiling and Jim Cook was like.

1474
01:15:54,020 --> 01:15:55,460
Yeah, he was stern.

1475
01:15:55,460 --> 01:15:56,260
Audio medium.

1476
01:15:58,260 --> 01:16:00,260
He was stoic.

1477
01:16:00,260 --> 01:16:00,660
It's weird.

1478
01:16:00,660 --> 01:16:05,620
I have more trouble with that now that we're on Zoom than I ever did when we were literally

1479
01:16:05,620 --> 01:16:06,260
face to face.

1480
01:16:07,940 --> 01:16:09,060
I don't know.

1481
01:16:09,060 --> 01:16:15,060
And then we've got them being at the circle of, yeah, sure.

1482
01:16:15,060 --> 01:16:18,740
At the circle of knowledge's calm, comfy campground, right?

1483
01:16:18,740 --> 01:16:26,340
So curious as to like metagaming, what your thoughts were when you found out that your

1484
01:16:26,420 --> 01:16:29,700
parents had been to comfy campground.

1485
01:16:29,700 --> 01:16:32,740
You were freaking me out that you were trying to imply that Anne was my mom.

1486
01:16:32,740 --> 01:16:35,940
Now I remember that we saw the names on the tapes.

1487
01:16:37,060 --> 01:16:37,700
Eunice would never.

1488
01:16:37,700 --> 01:16:38,980
I was like, what the fuck?

1489
01:16:39,540 --> 01:16:44,820
Yeah, no, seeing Eunice and Jerry, I mean, so yeah, it's metagame wise, it's all coming

1490
01:16:44,820 --> 01:16:47,700
together that they had something to do with the circle of knowledge.

1491
01:16:47,700 --> 01:16:52,180
They were, or actually maybe not the circle of knowledge, the tapes were people who had

1492
01:16:52,180 --> 01:16:53,780
participated on the island.

1493
01:16:53,780 --> 01:16:57,220
So maybe the circle of knowledge needed something from them.

1494
01:16:57,220 --> 01:16:58,260
Yeah, that's what it is.

1495
01:16:58,260 --> 01:17:01,300
They needed something from Clark's parents.

1496
01:17:01,300 --> 01:17:02,260
Holy shit.

1497
01:17:02,260 --> 01:17:04,260
I didn't put that together until just now.

1498
01:17:04,260 --> 01:17:05,940
That's super fucking dope.

1499
01:17:05,940 --> 01:17:10,100
It's, I have a few theories already now what they might've got.

1500
01:17:10,740 --> 01:17:13,460
Oh, that made me really happy watching your face change.

1501
01:17:14,660 --> 01:17:15,460
That's dope.

1502
01:17:16,020 --> 01:17:16,740
That was cool.

1503
01:17:18,980 --> 01:17:19,380
Yeah.

1504
01:17:19,380 --> 01:17:20,580
All right, let's move on.

1505
01:17:20,740 --> 01:17:25,620
Bazinga begins asks, what happened to Clark's heart?

1506
01:17:26,180 --> 01:17:27,380
It got poked out.

1507
01:17:27,380 --> 01:17:27,700
Next.

1508
01:17:30,660 --> 01:17:31,540
Very succinct.

1509
01:17:32,420 --> 01:17:32,740
Okay.

1510
01:17:35,700 --> 01:17:38,740
I think maybe what they were actually going for is where did we leave it?

1511
01:17:38,740 --> 01:17:41,060
And I don't remember exactly.

1512
01:17:41,060 --> 01:17:45,860
I was showing Maggie and she pulled the rod out in front of me and like reassure me that

1513
01:17:45,860 --> 01:17:46,580
I would be okay.

1514
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:48,980
And I think we just went to the next scene.

1515
01:17:48,980 --> 01:17:49,940
I think I left it there.

1516
01:17:51,460 --> 01:17:51,780
Yeah.

1517
01:17:51,780 --> 01:17:52,820
Clark didn't take it with him.

1518
01:17:52,820 --> 01:17:54,900
So it is at them.

1519
01:17:54,900 --> 01:17:59,140
Is it in like a little cooler assume and it says Clark's bag of ice.

1520
01:17:59,140 --> 01:18:01,620
I'm hoping that they don't touch Clark's.

1521
01:18:02,260 --> 01:18:04,100
I popped it into the freezer.

1522
01:18:05,620 --> 01:18:05,940
Okay.

1523
01:18:05,940 --> 01:18:10,820
Nothing for asked how many versions of Clark Bishop have there been so far?

1524
01:18:10,820 --> 01:18:11,540
Oh, I'm curious.

1525
01:18:11,540 --> 01:18:12,420
Did you look this up?

1526
01:18:12,980 --> 01:18:14,020
I did it from memory.

1527
01:18:14,900 --> 01:18:17,140
But I don't know the, I don't know totally.

1528
01:18:17,140 --> 01:18:17,380
Okay.

1529
01:18:17,380 --> 01:18:21,940
So I'll tell you the instances that we've seen other Clarks, uh, one ran into the police

1530
01:18:21,940 --> 01:18:24,500
department and told Drew not to go to Maggie's house.

1531
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:29,220
There was one that was running across a field while I was standing in my kitchen.

1532
01:18:29,220 --> 01:18:32,420
And it was right when the circle of knowledge first abducted me.

1533
01:18:32,420 --> 01:18:36,500
Like I saw him running toward me and realized it was, it was a Clark.

1534
01:18:37,140 --> 01:18:40,100
And then I blacked out and woke up in the circle of knowledge.

1535
01:18:40,100 --> 01:18:43,220
And then we've just got the old Clark's fuckery.

1536
01:18:43,220 --> 01:18:45,460
He's in a robe and doing symbols and shit.

1537
01:18:46,340 --> 01:18:51,220
I don't know how to categorize that if that's like a bunch of different Clark bishops, or

1538
01:18:51,220 --> 01:18:56,500
if it's the same Clark bishops at different points in his life, coming back to touch my

1539
01:18:56,500 --> 01:18:57,540
Clark's life.

1540
01:18:58,180 --> 01:18:59,460
I don't know how to differentiate.

1541
01:18:59,460 --> 01:19:05,220
So I, yeah, so that's the, those are the instances of different Clarks, unless I'm forgetting

1542
01:19:05,220 --> 01:19:05,460
one.

1543
01:19:05,460 --> 01:19:07,380
Do you remember if there was another Zach?

1544
01:19:07,380 --> 01:19:08,100
No idea, man.

1545
01:19:08,580 --> 01:19:14,180
Uh, that'll do it for the, wait, I want to answer the, uh, lead in.

1546
01:19:14,180 --> 01:19:15,220
Oh yeah.

1547
01:19:15,940 --> 01:19:17,700
Crane song asked players.

1548
01:19:17,700 --> 01:19:21,460
Are there any in character secrets that you suspect the other players are keeping from

1549
01:19:21,460 --> 01:19:25,220
you or any theories about other characters you're not sure of, but you're willing to

1550
01:19:25,220 --> 01:19:25,620
share?

1551
01:19:25,620 --> 01:19:31,460
So the only thing that I think is maybe being, maybe purposefully kept from me, but I don't

1552
01:19:31,460 --> 01:19:36,340
know if it's that, or if it's just Thomas not remembering, but I feel like he saw files

1553
01:19:36,900 --> 01:19:38,660
that had a lot to do with all of us.

1554
01:19:39,220 --> 01:19:44,420
And he told me like he saw an in one of the files and love.

1555
01:19:45,220 --> 01:19:49,780
I just don't know if he was being cagey with me because he, there was more in the file

1556
01:19:49,780 --> 01:19:54,020
that he didn't want to share with me or if he was just not remembering it all.

1557
01:19:54,020 --> 01:19:57,700
I feel like that is an interesting thing that Clark would like to know more about all the

1558
01:19:57,700 --> 01:19:58,980
files that Thomas saw.

1559
01:19:58,980 --> 01:20:03,940
And then also everything that happened to John Lee Pettymore is a little bit fuzzy as

1560
01:20:03,940 --> 01:20:05,380
far as truth or not truth.

1561
01:20:06,340 --> 01:20:10,500
But I, again, I don't know for sure if it's purposeful or not, but yeah, I think that's

1562
01:20:10,500 --> 01:20:10,980
fair.

1563
01:20:10,980 --> 01:20:15,300
And those are the big ones that I'm, I'm curious about anything, theories about other

1564
01:20:15,300 --> 01:20:17,380
characters that you aren't sure of, but you're willing to share.

1565
01:20:18,020 --> 01:20:20,740
Clark is really fucking conflicted about Maggie.

1566
01:20:20,740 --> 01:20:27,140
I feel like he, there's a lot of signs pointing to her being shady, but she showed him the

1567
01:20:27,140 --> 01:20:29,380
fucking scary thing that scared the wits out of him.

1568
01:20:29,380 --> 01:20:32,260
So he just knows that he needs to make that not a thing.

1569
01:20:33,220 --> 01:20:38,580
But like we found that note that was maybe her dad saying that Maggie, like he had underlined

1570
01:20:38,580 --> 01:20:43,060
and over-lined words to like maybe cast aspersions on Maggie.

1571
01:20:43,060 --> 01:20:46,580
And you found that in the secret room at Jim Cook's house.

1572
01:20:46,580 --> 01:20:51,140
That that we're, we're rolling with the theory that it was maybe where old Clark was living.

1573
01:20:51,140 --> 01:20:52,900
So I just, yeah, I don't know.

1574
01:20:52,900 --> 01:20:54,180
Clark is super conflicted.

1575
01:20:54,180 --> 01:20:57,540
Joe is super conflicted about where to stand with Maggie.

1576
01:20:57,540 --> 01:20:57,780
Yeah.

1577
01:20:58,340 --> 01:21:01,620
Again, he's, she's somebody that he would trust implicitly though.

1578
01:21:01,700 --> 01:21:05,380
So he's, he's going to go along with it until something smacks him over the head.

1579
01:21:05,380 --> 01:21:05,780
I think.

1580
01:21:06,980 --> 01:21:07,700
Yeah.

1581
01:21:07,700 --> 01:21:08,740
Thank you, Joe.

1582
01:21:08,740 --> 01:21:09,240
Thank you.

1583
01:21:10,660 --> 01:21:12,660
I love having you as a player.

1584
01:21:12,660 --> 01:21:14,260
I love playing with you.

1585
01:21:14,260 --> 01:21:14,980
You're my favorite.

1586
01:21:17,780 --> 01:21:19,540
I'm going to, I'm going to go, I'm going to go tell them.

1587
01:21:19,540 --> 01:21:21,220
And let's get Joe the fuck out of here.

1588
01:21:21,220 --> 01:21:22,740
Get the fuck out of here, Joe.

1589
01:21:24,500 --> 01:21:28,020
I'm glad you lied to him about being your favorite.

1590
01:21:28,020 --> 01:21:28,900
He, he needed it.

1591
01:21:29,700 --> 01:21:32,340
He, I mean, he has to have it.

1592
01:21:32,340 --> 01:21:36,180
He just like, Oh man.

1593
01:21:36,180 --> 01:21:39,460
Obviously, obviously player.

1594
01:21:40,660 --> 01:21:40,980
Let's see.

1595
01:21:40,980 --> 01:21:43,060
I'm pulling Thomas up right now.

1596
01:21:43,060 --> 01:21:43,940
Let's see if he's here.

1597
01:21:43,940 --> 01:21:44,500
There he is.

1598
01:21:48,980 --> 01:21:49,480
Hi.

1599
01:21:51,060 --> 01:21:53,220
I got one question for you, baby.

1600
01:21:53,220 --> 01:21:53,940
Yeah.

1601
01:21:53,940 --> 01:21:55,380
Where the money at?

1602
01:21:55,380 --> 01:21:55,860
Oh man.

1603
01:21:55,860 --> 01:21:56,500
I wish I knew.

1604
01:21:57,220 --> 01:21:59,060
Not in podcasting.

1605
01:22:01,780 --> 01:22:02,020
Yeah.

1606
01:22:02,020 --> 01:22:03,460
If anybody finds out, let me know.

1607
01:22:03,460 --> 01:22:09,940
Do you know where the money that you made from the drug deal as John Lee

1608
01:22:09,940 --> 01:22:12,980
Pettymore is currently?

1609
01:22:12,980 --> 01:22:13,460
Yeah.

1610
01:22:13,460 --> 01:22:16,580
John, John knows he's not going to tell anyone.

1611
01:22:17,220 --> 01:22:18,500
I'm cool with that actually.

1612
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:18,900
Yeah.

1613
01:22:18,900 --> 01:22:21,380
Oh, I mean, you're going to bullshit your way out of it.

1614
01:22:22,100 --> 01:22:27,620
That works for me because I looked it up and we never talked about where you hid

1615
01:22:27,620 --> 01:22:29,700
the money before you passed out drunk.

1616
01:22:29,700 --> 01:22:33,860
So I would assume that you hid the money somewhere.

1617
01:22:33,860 --> 01:22:34,580
That's the answer.

1618
01:22:34,580 --> 01:22:35,860
John doesn't quite know.

1619
01:22:39,380 --> 01:22:40,100
It's perfect.

1620
01:22:44,020 --> 01:22:44,820
Oh my God.

1621
01:22:44,820 --> 01:22:49,300
I keep saying that there's only three arcs left, but I keep thinking like you

1622
01:22:49,300 --> 01:22:54,340
literally, you brought this idea to me how long ago, months ago you were like,

1623
01:22:54,340 --> 01:22:55,940
there should be a Pettymore.

1624
01:22:56,660 --> 01:22:58,500
Everybody plays Pettymore's.

1625
01:22:58,500 --> 01:22:58,820
Yeah.

1626
01:22:58,820 --> 01:23:00,980
That it's like 25 years in the future.

1627
01:23:01,700 --> 01:23:03,380
An old man Pettymore's property.

1628
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:07,380
You're trying to find the old John Lee Pettymore money.

1629
01:23:09,300 --> 01:23:11,540
And then Drew also had $5 million.

1630
01:23:12,260 --> 01:23:15,620
However, it was taken from Drew by Rosemary.

1631
01:23:15,620 --> 01:23:17,380
But then John took it back from her.

1632
01:23:17,380 --> 01:23:24,100
And so it is in the evidence locker along with the helmet and the radio.

1633
01:23:25,220 --> 01:23:32,100
Do you have any suspicions that you're being lied to by either of your fellow PCs?

1634
01:23:32,740 --> 01:23:33,860
Yeah, probably Joe.

1635
01:23:38,180 --> 01:23:44,100
I don't think we're getting the straight dope on the COK.

1636
01:23:44,100 --> 01:23:44,900
The what?

1637
01:23:44,900 --> 01:23:46,100
The circle of knowledge.

1638
01:23:46,660 --> 01:23:48,820
Oh, the COK.

1639
01:23:52,260 --> 01:23:56,260
I really honestly am shook that we've never called it that before.

1640
01:23:56,260 --> 01:24:00,260
Any theories or do you think Luke's being straight with you about what Keith Figna's up to?

1641
01:24:00,260 --> 01:24:05,220
I think Luke's been almost perfectly straight with us about what Keith Figna's been up to.

1642
01:24:06,580 --> 01:24:08,420
If he's pulled any punches then...

1643
01:24:12,020 --> 01:24:12,980
That's a good strategy.

1644
01:24:13,780 --> 01:24:16,020
Yeah, like, oh, I murdered my brother.

1645
01:24:16,020 --> 01:24:20,980
Like, be upfront about that so you can hide a smaller betrayal.

1646
01:24:24,660 --> 01:24:28,500
That makes me nervous about being your friend.

1647
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:30,100
That's a really good strategy.

1648
01:24:30,100 --> 01:24:31,380
It's Keith's strategy.

1649
01:24:31,940 --> 01:24:34,500
Sure, sure, sure, sure, sure, sure, sure.

1650
01:24:36,340 --> 01:24:42,500
Any other thoughts before your time to go back into the void of the waiting room is your reality?

1651
01:24:43,620 --> 01:24:45,220
Yeah, just namaste.

1652
01:24:45,220 --> 01:24:45,940
Oh, thanks, bud.

1653
01:24:45,940 --> 01:24:46,500
Thanks, dude.

1654
01:24:46,500 --> 01:24:47,140
I love you.

1655
01:24:47,140 --> 01:24:47,620
Love that.

1656
01:24:49,060 --> 01:24:52,900
God, I just, I think that's so cool of you.

1657
01:24:57,860 --> 01:24:59,300
Get the fuck out of here.

1658
01:24:59,300 --> 01:25:00,340
Randy's gone.

1659
01:25:02,980 --> 01:25:04,020
All right, let's bring in...

1660
01:25:04,980 --> 01:25:07,220
Oh, fuck, I actually used his real name.

1661
01:25:07,220 --> 01:25:09,700
We've been using fake names on the podcast this whole time.

1662
01:25:09,700 --> 01:25:10,200
Oh, shit.

1663
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:11,800
Uh, hey...

1664
01:25:14,760 --> 01:25:16,440
I accidentally said your real name.

1665
01:25:16,440 --> 01:25:17,480
Doesn't have headphones.

1666
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:20,040
He doesn't have his headphones in.

1667
01:25:20,680 --> 01:25:22,600
So I totally doxed you and...

1668
01:25:22,600 --> 01:25:23,960
Is his microphone even on?

1669
01:25:26,040 --> 01:25:26,540
Hey.

1670
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:27,100
Hi.

1671
01:25:27,720 --> 01:25:28,920
Uh, hey, Luke.

1672
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:29,480
Sup, sup.

1673
01:25:29,480 --> 01:25:31,400
Uh, what do you think about the watch?

1674
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:32,200
The watch?

1675
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:33,080
Yeah, the watch.

1676
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:34,120
Oh, the watch.

1677
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:38,440
Shit, I don't really know.

1678
01:25:38,440 --> 01:25:41,560
I think it's something to look into.

1679
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:46,280
Yeah, I remember I saw...

1680
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,240
I was, like, digging through the ground and I saw...

1681
01:25:50,120 --> 01:25:51,160
What did it say?

1682
01:25:51,160 --> 01:25:52,920
Like, it was at Beans Pond.

1683
01:25:52,920 --> 01:25:53,880
Is that right?

1684
01:25:53,880 --> 01:25:58,040
You did see Beans Pond in your weird, like...

1685
01:25:58,040 --> 01:25:59,160
Like a vision?

1686
01:25:59,160 --> 01:26:03,320
When you put on the watch, it felt like your consciousness was changing the channel

1687
01:26:03,320 --> 01:26:05,560
and you began to phase out of your reality

1688
01:26:06,120 --> 01:26:08,920
and then you seemed to be somewhere else entirely.

1689
01:26:08,920 --> 01:26:12,360
You felt wet grass and dirt on your fingers

1690
01:26:12,360 --> 01:26:15,240
and you were looking at a door in the ground

1691
01:26:15,240 --> 01:26:17,960
like a sealed metal door that was mostly buried

1692
01:26:17,960 --> 01:26:20,840
and on the door was an inscription that said

1693
01:26:28,360 --> 01:26:32,280
So it's my parents' tomb or something?

1694
01:26:32,360 --> 01:26:35,960
And then I did see that that was at Beans Pond?

1695
01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:38,440
Or is that a different part of the vision?

1696
01:26:38,440 --> 01:26:43,480
I think you just saw Beans Pond, like, in that vision?

1697
01:26:43,480 --> 01:26:46,680
Because you brought it up later, but it's not on the overview.

1698
01:26:46,680 --> 01:26:48,680
Okay, because I remember that part.

1699
01:26:48,680 --> 01:26:49,240
Yeah.

1700
01:26:49,240 --> 01:26:53,160
And that is locked up in a safe in my motel room, right?

1701
01:26:53,160 --> 01:26:54,680
Hotel motel, baby.

1702
01:26:54,680 --> 01:26:55,320
So it...

1703
01:26:56,120 --> 01:26:57,960
I mean, definitely we need to go check that out.

1704
01:26:57,960 --> 01:27:01,480
I even said that we need to go check out Beans Pond at one point.

1705
01:27:01,560 --> 01:27:02,920
Yeah, you definitely did.

1706
01:27:02,920 --> 01:27:08,440
So probably go get that watch and maybe see what happens if the other boys put it on.

1707
01:27:08,440 --> 01:27:09,640
Hmm, interesting.

1708
01:27:10,280 --> 01:27:11,160
Joe, write that down.

1709
01:27:13,320 --> 01:27:13,560
Joe?

1710
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:15,080
Joe?

1711
01:27:15,080 --> 01:27:15,720
Joe?

1712
01:27:15,720 --> 01:27:15,960
Joe?

1713
01:27:15,960 --> 01:27:17,640
Maladory writes,

1714
01:27:17,640 --> 01:27:22,040
Is there any beans left or is Keith the last standing member?

1715
01:27:22,040 --> 01:27:24,360
Oh, the last standing inheritor.

1716
01:27:24,920 --> 01:27:26,520
So my bro's dead.

1717
01:27:28,040 --> 01:27:29,720
My parents are dead.

1718
01:27:29,800 --> 01:27:31,320
His wife is dead.

1719
01:27:32,040 --> 01:27:33,800
Is my niece alive still?

1720
01:27:34,600 --> 01:27:35,320
Well, I don't know.

1721
01:27:36,280 --> 01:27:37,240
We never saw her die.

1722
01:27:37,240 --> 01:27:43,560
So possibly, I guess, she would inherit my brother's stuff.

1723
01:27:43,560 --> 01:27:47,640
But I think it's just me, Bean, and my niece.

1724
01:27:48,280 --> 01:27:52,120
Do you have any theories about your fellow officers?

1725
01:27:52,120 --> 01:27:54,680
Any secrets you think they might be hiding from you?

1726
01:27:54,680 --> 01:27:55,880
Things they're lying about?

1727
01:27:55,880 --> 01:28:01,960
I think that Clark probably knows more than he's leading on about the circle,

1728
01:28:01,960 --> 01:28:04,200
since he's the only one that's visited it.

1729
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:07,000
I don't know if he knows more about, like, old Clark,

1730
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:11,960
but I think there's maybe something that he hasn't necessarily lied about,

1731
01:28:11,960 --> 01:28:13,080
but just hasn't let up.

1732
01:28:14,120 --> 01:28:16,280
And then who fucking knows with Pettymore?

1733
01:28:17,320 --> 01:28:19,640
Nothing off the top of my head that I can think of,

1734
01:28:19,640 --> 01:28:23,560
like, that I have a suspicion about, but I'm sure there's something.

1735
01:28:23,560 --> 01:28:27,160
He's always being sneaky and hiding shit.

1736
01:28:28,440 --> 01:28:30,440
Always sneaky.

1737
01:28:30,440 --> 01:28:32,200
Always hiding shit.

1738
01:28:32,920 --> 01:28:34,360
John Lee Pettymore.

1739
01:28:34,360 --> 01:28:35,160
Are we all back now?

1740
01:28:35,160 --> 01:28:36,520
The crew's back together.

1741
01:28:37,160 --> 01:28:37,720
Welcome.

1742
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:39,480
Hello, everybody.

1743
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:42,520
Welcome to Calm Camfy Comf Grounds.

1744
01:28:43,240 --> 01:28:45,960
Calm Camfy Comf Grounds.

1745
01:28:45,960 --> 01:28:46,280
No.

1746
01:28:47,240 --> 01:28:50,680
Hey, I got another question.

1747
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:53,320
It's from Bazinga Begins.

1748
01:28:53,800 --> 01:28:59,160
What's the coolest piece of lore or detail that no one or too few people have picked up on yet?

1749
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:04,040
I don't use, like, so much Delta Green lore.

1750
01:29:04,040 --> 01:29:06,520
I think it's very good and interesting,

1751
01:29:06,520 --> 01:29:10,760
but I am far more interested in, like, coming up with homebrew shit,

1752
01:29:10,760 --> 01:29:17,640
and so I don't use a lot of the, like, main lore about the program or the outlaws.

1753
01:29:17,640 --> 01:29:20,040
I will here and there cherry pick stuff to use, but...

1754
01:29:20,040 --> 01:29:22,760
What about Zachy Reeves lore that nobody's picked up on?

1755
01:29:23,640 --> 01:29:24,520
Zachy Reeves lore.

1756
01:29:24,520 --> 01:29:27,240
Well, we got another question here, also asked by Bazinga Begins.

1757
01:29:27,240 --> 01:29:29,960
They said, related to the Kudzu no backbone

1758
01:29:29,960 --> 01:29:32,360
Silver Sphere relationship brought up last week,

1759
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:38,760
were the character developments that happened to the boys after their deaths in the Den of Sin

1760
01:29:39,320 --> 01:29:42,680
supposed to be a weird reversal of the Wizard of Oz?

1761
01:29:43,240 --> 01:29:47,400
Clark loses his heart, John Lee Pettymore loses his spine,

1762
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:50,520
and Keith loses his mind and his empathy.

1763
01:29:51,080 --> 01:29:51,640
Hmm.

1764
01:29:51,640 --> 01:29:57,880
And this makes me so happy because I never thought anyone would get that, ever.

1765
01:29:57,880 --> 01:30:00,840
I just thought I thought it was such a silly little thing

1766
01:30:01,640 --> 01:30:06,280
that, like, is so subtle and stupid that, like, no one would ever pick up on it.

1767
01:30:06,280 --> 01:30:12,200
So, bless you, Bazinga Begins, for being the first person I've seen to make that connection.

1768
01:30:12,200 --> 01:30:12,520
Hell yeah.

1769
01:30:12,520 --> 01:30:14,760
I had not made that connection at all.

1770
01:30:14,760 --> 01:30:19,480
I was so high when I put that together,

1771
01:30:19,480 --> 01:30:24,200
and it's because, uh...

1772
01:30:24,200 --> 01:30:25,400
It was because it's...

1773
01:30:25,400 --> 01:30:30,280
This is also really fucking stupid, but it's because Oz Mayhem Wolf was there.

1774
01:30:30,280 --> 01:30:31,480
Oh, wow, sure.

1775
01:30:31,480 --> 01:30:34,680
And I just, like, saw it and then, like, started thinking about it

1776
01:30:34,680 --> 01:30:37,160
because I was thinking about the spine, and then I was like,

1777
01:30:37,160 --> 01:30:39,880
oh, ha, ha, like, when I came up with the heart thing,

1778
01:30:39,880 --> 01:30:44,520
then I knew that we had to do something with Luke for the mind,

1779
01:30:44,520 --> 01:30:46,280
and I didn't know how I was going to do it.

1780
01:30:46,280 --> 01:30:48,120
And then I sent out everybody, like,

1781
01:30:48,120 --> 01:30:53,800
hey, pick your talents, and Luke literally picked a talent that got rid of his empathy.

1782
01:30:55,880 --> 01:31:00,200
And so he literally just, like, fulfilled it without me having to do anything.

1783
01:31:00,200 --> 01:31:04,120
So that was, like, the coolest shit that made me really happy.

1784
01:31:04,120 --> 01:31:08,040
But Oz, he had a brother, and I was coming up with a brother's name,

1785
01:31:08,840 --> 01:31:15,000
and his name is Elby because Oz is ounce and Elby is pound.

1786
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:20,440
It's just, honestly, it's a lot of dumb little shit like that,

1787
01:31:20,440 --> 01:31:24,040
but the Wizard of Oz reversal was one of the bigger ones.

1788
01:31:24,040 --> 01:31:25,320
That's super cool.

1789
01:31:25,320 --> 01:31:26,600
I'm excited to talk.

1790
01:31:26,600 --> 01:31:29,400
Like, at the very end of this whole, like, campaign,

1791
01:31:30,520 --> 01:31:33,720
I'll do a walkthrough of my dumb shit.

1792
01:31:33,720 --> 01:31:35,320
Joe, that's one of your favorite movies, right?

1793
01:31:35,320 --> 01:31:36,520
Yeah, Wizard of Oz is...

1794
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:40,120
I have the poster hanging on my wall back there.

1795
01:31:40,120 --> 01:31:40,620
It's...

1796
01:31:41,160 --> 01:31:43,400
This one's on Joe, guys.

1797
01:31:43,400 --> 01:31:46,280
Which version?

1798
01:31:46,280 --> 01:31:48,280
The James Franco masterpiece.

1799
01:31:50,840 --> 01:31:51,640
I've actually got...

1800
01:31:51,640 --> 01:31:54,200
So the Wizard of Oz poster is a reprint,

1801
01:31:54,200 --> 01:31:57,880
but I've got an original Return to Oz poster hanging over there, too.

1802
01:31:57,880 --> 01:31:58,840
Oh, damn!

1803
01:31:58,840 --> 01:32:00,520
Yeah, because I love Return to Oz.

1804
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:01,320
It's great, also.

1805
01:32:01,320 --> 01:32:03,720
I honestly don't know if I've ever seen Return to Oz.

1806
01:32:03,720 --> 01:32:04,600
It holds up, dude.

1807
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:07,320
It's so bizarre and cool-looking.

1808
01:32:07,320 --> 01:32:08,280
It's good.

1809
01:32:08,280 --> 01:32:10,600
Is it the same actors, or...?

1810
01:32:10,600 --> 01:32:11,000
Nah.

1811
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:12,920
Dorothy is played by Feruza Balk.

1812
01:32:13,480 --> 01:32:15,400
You guys might know her from Waterboy.

1813
01:32:15,400 --> 01:32:16,120
Interesting.

1814
01:32:16,120 --> 01:32:17,080
That's Kathy Bates.

1815
01:32:17,080 --> 01:32:18,840
That's your Feruza Balk pull?

1816
01:32:19,560 --> 01:32:20,840
Yeah, for sure it is.

1817
01:32:22,920 --> 01:32:26,760
Have you ever seen the HBO series about the Wizard of Oz?

1818
01:32:31,560 --> 01:32:32,440
Oh, boy.

1819
01:32:32,440 --> 01:32:34,360
I was late on the uptick on that one.

1820
01:32:34,360 --> 01:32:39,400
I'll have to watch Return to Oz to come up with my plot for next season.

1821
01:32:40,360 --> 01:32:41,880
Maladory asks,

1822
01:32:41,880 --> 01:32:47,320
For the boys, what is the plot thread you are most interested in seeing the end of?

1823
01:32:48,120 --> 01:32:50,520
And then another question which I don't want you to answer.

1824
01:32:52,600 --> 01:32:56,280
Plot thread you aren't interested in slash care the least about.

1825
01:32:57,560 --> 01:32:58,440
Be nice, guys.

1826
01:32:59,640 --> 01:33:01,160
I just want to go back to contention.

1827
01:33:01,160 --> 01:33:03,080
I want to see what's up with that.

1828
01:33:03,080 --> 01:33:04,280
What's up with that?

1829
01:33:04,280 --> 01:33:05,960
All the helmet and gun and stuff.

1830
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:08,360
That's what I wrote down in my notes.

1831
01:33:08,360 --> 01:33:13,880
I really wish that, A, the helmet itself, but B, just all the relationships with those items

1832
01:33:13,880 --> 01:33:18,200
and all their history and all that is a thread that I would love to know more about.

1833
01:33:18,200 --> 01:33:20,280
Yeah, I want to see how contention got the way it is

1834
01:33:20,920 --> 01:33:27,000
and why it's so connected to all this shit seemingly going back quite far in its past.

1835
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:30,360
I really want to see the backstory for Rich and Dick Nichols.

1836
01:33:31,160 --> 01:33:33,480
30-something episodes of how they got.

1837
01:33:33,480 --> 01:33:36,120
That's what the people have really been demanding.

1838
01:33:36,840 --> 01:33:41,480
There's a lot of Rich and Dick stans out there who add us constantly.

1839
01:33:42,280 --> 01:33:45,640
They sent us pretty abusive DMs, but we get it.

1840
01:33:45,640 --> 01:33:46,920
You're passionate.

1841
01:33:46,920 --> 01:33:48,280
You're passionate for Rick and Dick.

1842
01:33:49,640 --> 01:33:50,760
Honestly, that's a conkin.

1843
01:33:52,680 --> 01:33:53,160
Call back.

1844
01:33:53,960 --> 01:33:55,400
Yeah, hashtag conkin.

1845
01:33:55,400 --> 01:33:57,080
That's what a lot of the stans say.

1846
01:33:59,160 --> 01:34:00,280
All our conkers out there.

1847
01:34:01,880 --> 01:34:05,640
What we're saying is we hear you and if we reach a certain Patreon goal,

1848
01:34:05,640 --> 01:34:12,680
there will be just a slice of life sitcom spin-off where they're roommates.

1849
01:34:12,680 --> 01:34:14,040
And we got one.

1850
01:34:14,040 --> 01:34:15,080
Oh wait, sorry.

1851
01:34:15,080 --> 01:34:17,400
Which plot threads do you guys care the least about?

1852
01:34:18,120 --> 01:34:18,920
They're all great.

1853
01:34:25,560 --> 01:34:27,640
And we got one last question here.

1854
01:34:27,640 --> 01:34:29,080
Justin, take it away.

1855
01:34:29,080 --> 01:34:34,360
BXBori9181 asks, what happened to Keith's dog?

1856
01:34:34,520 --> 01:34:40,840
They posted this question on the first Q&A and we talked about it and then we recorded

1857
01:34:40,840 --> 01:34:45,800
last week's episode and then they posted it on this week's episode and then edited their post

1858
01:34:45,800 --> 01:34:47,560
and was like, wait, just kidding.

1859
01:34:47,560 --> 01:34:48,440
Just got there.

1860
01:34:48,440 --> 01:34:49,640
Just got to where you answered.

1861
01:34:51,160 --> 01:34:56,040
But someone else pointed out that we didn't really answer because while we did a freeze

1862
01:34:56,040 --> 01:35:03,240
frame and paragraph for every animal that was in there that talked, we did not do one for Bean.

1863
01:35:04,360 --> 01:35:08,280
I didn't realize that, that's great.

1864
01:35:08,280 --> 01:35:17,000
So the whole point of the episode was to figure out where Bean had been and we still don't know.

1865
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:21,720
We have the peace of mind that he's not like rotting in the hotel room.

1866
01:35:21,720 --> 01:35:22,220
Yeah.

1867
01:35:22,680 --> 01:35:25,480
He's out on his own eating trash and licking ass.

1868
01:35:25,480 --> 01:35:27,880
Just like we all aim to do.

1869
01:35:27,880 --> 01:35:29,640
All right, well, this has been long.

1870
01:35:31,640 --> 01:35:32,280
I'm hungry.

1871
01:35:32,280 --> 01:35:35,640
Quantity over quality, baby.

1872
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:39,160
Thanks for all the questions.

1873
01:35:39,160 --> 01:35:40,520
They were all really good, I thought.

1874
01:35:40,520 --> 01:35:42,760
I'm glad you guys are interested enough to ask.

1875
01:35:42,760 --> 01:35:44,040
Very insightful.

1876
01:35:44,040 --> 01:35:46,440
