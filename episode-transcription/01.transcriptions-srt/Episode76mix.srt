1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,880
Hey, hey, hey my babies, it's episode

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:10,240
76 and you know, that means that dr. J would be proud of all the slamming and jamming

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,240
We have been doing on this here radio show as always

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:19,520
I'm dunking on fools all day here at six nine four point two

5
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:26,480
PTBP I'm grinding up fools in the post doing a dipsy do dunkaroo on their heads

6
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,440
I'm the hoop god that you never knew

7
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,840
Hello one hello all

8
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:43,900
Hello y'all it's your best friend with a trash-eating problem wolf the dog

9
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,760
It is December 6th, and the time is 3 o'clock y'all hmm

10
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:55,080
Sounds like it's about garbage bin o'clock for you old wolfie boy now speaking of trash earlier

11
00:00:55,080 --> 00:01:02,420
I took my dog wolf the dog to go find him something to feel his big old belly up with but upon

12
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:09,160
Venturing outside the sky suddenly darkened all around us for a little bit y'all ever seen an eclipse

13
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,560
It was like that but uh different

14
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,360
It was real spooky y'all wolf nearly shit his big-ass britches

15
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:23,200
Which wolf did that I'll let y'all figure that one out when I came back down to the studio

16
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,280
I found a note attached with a thumb tacked to the inside of my door

17
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,200
It is emblazoned with a solid green triangle and says for wolf at the top

18
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:39,000
I guess it's this week's howlin with wolf it comes from user chuckling boy over on the subreddit

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,840
He's an Android user but logged into iTunes on his computer to leave a review this boy sure knows how to make old

20
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:51,080
Wolfie blush and make sure y'all go and also leave us a good review

21
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:57,240
Chuckling boy writes the cowboy years introduced a turn of phrase for dealing with a shitstorm

22
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:02,520
We called it a night at the Opera you boys have taken care of a few off-screen

23
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,240
But damned if your debut isn't like the Mets own debut

24
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:12,720
Faust something fitting isn't that and remember the mission is over when the world ends

25
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:17,480
For all of you out there listening be sure to stop by the subreddit

26
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:25,440
We're starting to see more discussion around the greater delta green cannon as well as game running tips and general show stuff and whatnot

27
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:31,040
And while I'm telling y'all to stop by things check out our discord and twitch

28
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,040
You can find a link to the discord on our subreddit and some other places

29
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:43,400
I think and on that twitch you can see some guy there every now and then who sounds like me

30
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,480
but with a higher pitched voice

31
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,200
Suspicious to keep tabs on these

32
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:55,200
Suspicious happenings with those suspicious pretending pod people go to twitch.tv

33
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,620
Slash pretending pod streams wolf bless you chuckling boy

34
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:07,840

42

43
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:00,600
Whatever fuck whoever this guy is now fuck a whole lot of people but especially Jeff Bezos

44
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,800
It's time for the news a tall gaunt

45
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,320
humanoid figure

46
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,320
a

47
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,640
Older version of himself just stood

48
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,600
None of that made a lick of sense to me

49
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:22,040
But that doesn't mean I'm not hungry filling me up as always is kudzu with no

50
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,200
back-bone

51
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,320
Oh

52
00:04:55,640 --> 00:05:02,120
We're back baby, this isn't a Q&A back, baby, you're not playing animals. We've real people man

53
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,960
Kind of we're pretending to be

54
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:13,920
76 the good people. Oh, yeah, you guys are the people people like you guys are great people

55
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,440
So I did tell you last time that we played that the next time that we played

56
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,600
You would be back as

57
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:31,280
Who you are? So I want you to get into the consciousness of your characters. John Lee Pettymore

58
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,960
Clark Bishop Keith Vigna

59
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,120
Remember

60
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,120
What it feels like?

61
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,920
inside the skin of these

62
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,080
Trash people. Oh boy. It's me clock

63
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,800
And it's me oh, I'm I'm back baby

64
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,040
Paul Lee Pettymore if that part makes the podcast I quit

65
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,520
You are now

66
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:05,600
John Lee Pettymore Keith Vigna and Clark Bishop John John Lee Kevin Moore. Is that what you view yourself as?

67
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,480
I feel like it's the best portmanteau to describe

68
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,560
portmanteau

69
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,120
The best portmanteau

70
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:24,460
To describe his current situation. Yeah, also since he's made of since he's made of metal and is basically a robo cop

71
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,080
Will you beef up my stats? Can I get cool stats?

72
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,480
Well you cool stats, please

73
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:36,120
Okay, yeah, that's fine give yourself a plus 10 to strength and

74
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:44,080
Constitution and a negative 10 to dexterity and Keith Vigna do the same plus 10 to the base, right so that

75
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,560
20 strength 20 Constitution 3 dexterity

76
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,560
Oh

77
00:06:54,840 --> 00:07:01,280
Thomas when you see your character in a dream in the mirror what version is it? What does he look like?

78
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,720
John og the fourth correct

79
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,360
canonically the og yes from

80
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,560
Not like the from the first episode of pretending to be people a new hope

81
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:17,980
So that is the version that you all see when you see yourselves

82
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,120
existing in

83
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:27,280
An infinite darkness and you feel eyes on you all over you out of your own bodies

84
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:32,920
floating in this vast nothingness you see Keith Vigna open a door and

85
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:39,480
Tildy be Mitchell is there on the other side curled up in the fetal position and her body begins

86
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:44,340
Deteriorating hastily like she has leprosy but in time-lapse

87
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,320
However, she grows larger and larger with each passing moment

88
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:54,560
Clark Bishop is seen handing an old piece of parchment to a young boy

89
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,640
with a balloon shaped head and eyes so dark that the irises look black and

90
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:08,420
immediately the boys feet catch fire and the fire grows and grows to consume the young black eyed boy and

91
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,080
You hear three voices cry out in pain

92
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,440
John Lee Pettymore

93
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,320
Is crouched down crouched down

94
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:24,140
He's crouched down staring at a television. That is a blank white screen

95
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:27,960
He reaches out and touches the screen like Vanna White

96
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:35,680
But instead of a letter popping up Clark Bishop's parents Eunice and Jerry the size of action figures

97
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:40,960
Jump out of the television screen and run up John Lee Pettymore the fourth arm

98
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:45,960
Climbing his shoulder and flinging themselves into John's head

99
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:50,940
No, the bishops are going to disappear right into petty Moore's brain

100
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:57,600
But they both get stuck halfway in their legs writhing about and flailing in this never-ending

101
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,560
dreamscape

102
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:06,040
Oily viscous sludge begins dripping and then spraying out of John Lee Pettymore the force head

103
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,680
Where the bishops have lodged themselves and the ooze begins

104
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:17,100
Collecting on a ground below now made of light and the ooze drip strips drips and then pours

105
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,400
until a laminar flow

106
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:26,600
Connects the head of John Lee Pettymore the fourth to a pool of this inky substance that begins shaping itself

107
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:32,140
Into a large saucer, but as the pool grows the walls begin rising outward

108
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:34,620
Creating an imposingly colossal

109
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:42,100
Bowl and our view must back up leagues as this shape continues to form a mirror of what is now below

110
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:46,640
the minuscule body of John Lee Pettymore in the far distance

111
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:50,500
continues to fill this thing's final form an

112
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,820
incomprehensibly

113
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:59,660
massive sphere and it continues to grow and grow and grow and

114
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,660
Then

115
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,100
The three of you wake up

116
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:11,140
you feel like you're in shock your stomach feels weirdly full and

117
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:18,900
Your ears are ringing and you feel content, but it's dark and it's cold and it smells smells like

118
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:23,340
Almost sweet like like there's meat maybe

119
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,340
Your

120
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:33,180
Eyes begin to adjust and there's a pool of blood on the floor next to it is a coffin on the ground and this

121
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,420
mausoleum

122
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:36,420
And you look at each other

123
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:43,180
Blood splatters speckled all over each one of you John Lee Kevin Moore and all black tactical gear

124
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:47,060
Keith vigna and his brightly colored polo and boat shoes

125
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:54,660
Clark Bishop in an old contention PD uniform currently holding a thick black cloak

126
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,940
and the shock

127
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:00,660
Begins to wear off and you feel the searing pain you felt before

128
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:06,340
on your chest on your back on the bottom of your left foot and inside your dominant palm and

129
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:11,860
This time when you guys look around at each other and check each other's

130
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:15,700
Skin, not only is the word Marvin crossed out

131
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:22,580
But the word Maggie on each of your left feet is also crossed out. Hello again, boys

132
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:31,980
Are we is this we're back we're back this is this is where we woke up last time we made it

133
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:39,780
Again, how many times is this now? This would be the 30s. How many times are we gonna do this?

134
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:43,160
This is the third time that we've woken up in here

135
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:49,280
But this is the second time after we've died right where was Maggie written on our bodies our feet

136
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:55,000
I take my shoe off because my foot is super itchy and I start scratching it and then realize that it's

137
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:59,520
Exed out the only two names left her Drew and Tilly

138
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:04,920
What do you guys think we did that made the Maggie get crossed off? I mean the last thing I remember is is

139
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,640
Just piles of cash at the University

140
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,640
What

141
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:17,960
Does Clark remember of like the feeling that he had before he did what he did like this

142
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:22,120
He how does that feel to him thinking about that? Oh, not good. Not good at all

143
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:29,940
Because basically you were under a compulsion and you had no control over your body that you now have control over but

144
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:36,760
That has to make you wonder how long do you have control over your body? And how easy was it for it to be taken over?

145
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:41,440
However, you guys are all back up to full hit points

146
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:49,820
And your luck will start where it was last time except for we discussed luck

147
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:55,620
That was awarded that was not used which is plus five for me and plus ten for Joe. I believe so

148
00:12:55,620 --> 00:13:00,860
Yeah, so I think I have 35. Does that sound right? It does have we ever canonically described

149
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,660
John Lee Kevin Moore's

150
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:10,820
Appearance I mean not a whole lot. I think you have full reigns in episode 76 here to

151
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,740
Tell us what he looks like going into this arc

152
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,500
Sam Elliott and Roadhouse. Oh

153
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,740
That's it that's I thought you were gonna

154
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:28,740
Hell yeah, what a man. Oh, yeah Taylor and I watched Roadhouse like a month ago

155
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:34,580
I still have never seen either one of us had ever seen it. I also watched it for the first time like last fall

156
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,500
It's wild

157
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:43,740
Was it good? It's really fucking good. It's a watch. It is extremely entertaining. So absurd. I've only ever seen bits and pieces

158
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,300
I don't think I've ever said and watch the whole thing through an

159
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:54,060
Insanely like psychotic mob boss for no reason tries to take over this small, Missouri town. Oh, it's in Missouri Patrick

160
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:56,060
So, yep, Patrick Swayze

161
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:04,040
Who is like a world-famous bouncer within the world's like the John wick of bouncers

162
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:13,620
So he he gets a job like at a bar in the town to clean it up and he moves into

163
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:16,340
this loft above

164
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:21,220
Is he above the mechanic shop or on like a farm or something?

165
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:28,780
Anyway for whatever reason he rents this loft that ends up being directly across this like small river from

166
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,660
villains mansion

167
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:36,580
Villains just out there like watching him while he does fucking Tai Chi in the yard and shit

168
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:41,220
There's a lot of shots of him doing Tai Chi in the yard. It's great. What about our

169
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:44,620
sanity so your sanity is going to

170
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,780
Start

171
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:49,820
Wherever it was when you woke up last time

172
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:55,700
Which is where it was when you went into the mausoleum the first time I was afraid you were gonna say that

173
00:14:56,340 --> 00:15:00,980
What are you at? I'm at 19 with a breaking point of 18. I'm always like destined to

174
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,740
Snap every time we wake up in here

175
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:10,160
So I'm gonna give you 2d 20 unnatural for what you learned in the last go-around

176
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:13,420
About the unnatural dope dope dope. So roll them up

177
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:17,460
Luke what'd you get a 15 and a 7 ooh?

178
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:20,340
22 on top of what did you have before?

179
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:28,860
28 so I'm at 50. That's it's a lot maybe yeah. All right. I've done what I did. So here we are

180
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:31,740
I mean I can reroll

181
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:38,300
No, I like it wouldn't work. I said things and now they're they're happening Joe. What do we get?

182
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:44,340
I got a 13 and a 6 that gives me 19 added on to a 30 makes it 49, right?

183
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:48,300
Right there with you, bud. Oh and Thomas took his webcam off

184
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:56,580
To show us his role because 17 and 11. Is that an 11 making up for last time?

185
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,900
Yeah, it's a 77

186
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:04,180
17 and 11 so 28 on top of what did you have last time?

187
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:12,100
16 16 so coming in hot with 44 well done. So a reminder. We're all very unnatural now reminder

188
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:14,740
You can use that skill at any time

189
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:20,460
But if you fail on the roll, you're gonna take a 1d6 sanity check not a check a hit

190
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:26,640
But you still get good stuff even from a fail. That is true. That is my favorite mechanic of the unnatural

191
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:32,700
Okay, I want to peek out of the mausoleum. Do I see that old lady still?

192
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:37,860
No, when you peek out you do not see the old lady there but

193
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:42,940
Jumping back into the character sheet and the mechanics for one quick second

194
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:50,140
Basically in Delta green and rules is written when you go on a mission and you finish the mission

195
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:52,420
There are these like qualifiers

196
00:16:52,780 --> 00:17:00,980
that basically say like you gain this much sanity if you complete this task and so I'm gonna give you guys a

197
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,860
D10 of sanity

198
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:06,420
shit for

199
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,660
killing

200
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:12,580
Marvin glass hell, yeah, the knowledge that that entity is

201
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:15,420
No longer is

202
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,860
worth 10 sanity

203
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:25,540
You got one I roll the fucking one

204
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:26,980
I

205
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,980
Need so bad

206
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,180
Thomas

207
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:37,580
The webcam and roll the 10 Wowzers live. Yeah, I got a 60 so right in the mid there

208
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:42,940
So we're getting this for having killed Marvin glass. Are we is there nothing for the last arc?

209
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:50,180
So that was just his first you lose whatever you just rolled. Yeah last one. Well, we killed we killed

210
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:54,700
Um, well, no, he killed himself didn't he Bruce Robin like that was our

211
00:17:55,860 --> 00:18:00,200
Ostensibly our mission our actions caused him to die. So that should be worth

212
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:09,540
So if you guys could argue that like why would killing Bruce Robin like why would that help you mentally? Oh

213
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,860
Yeah

214
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:14,500
Yeah, cuz you gave you gave us this cuz killing Marvin

215
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:20,380
Felt like a way right or as maybe killing Bruce Bruce killing himself in front of you. Did that feel like a win?

216
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:25,220
No, I was that didn't mean to sound like such a dick

217
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:32,060
Did you guys like that

218
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:44,260
Sorry, but yeah, no if nothing about that entire arc made you feel like better about the situation

219
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,500
Then probably not

220
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,700
Yeah

221
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,740
But the Marvin thing was cool

222
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,940
Hey, you got one at least better than what you had

223
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:59,940
Yeah, Bruce Robin was a ruthless

224
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:08,700
Capitalist who prayed on on the lower half of society to to harvest as well

225
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:15,420
However, he had just recently made a pretty big statement by giving all of his employees

226
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:20,820
Vacation time while he worked diligently to make all of his companies

227
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:28,020
Better for the employees. So with with higher pay and some people were saying that yeah, I don't know

228
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:33,660
He reminded me of my brother and I hated my brother. So him dying made me feel even better

229
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,140
I

230
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:40,220
Was just like every lost human soul makes me gain sanity

231
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:45,020
Yeah, is that still a thing though? I thought we were done with all our so

232
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:50,060
Yeah, we are gonna pull a clean slate on any phobias or manias

233
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:58,380
Starting up into this. However, when you hit those breaking points, you will be receiving new manias and phobias and I just

234
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,740
It's gonna happen and I don't want you to stack them

235
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:08,460
So, how about that and we back and we back and we back so Keith goes and looks out the out the mausoleum

236
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:13,740
And does not see the woman in the wheelchair and when you see the placement of the Sun

237
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:18,460
It is later than it was last time. What's your watch say Clark?

238
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:24,940
It says three three, it says 3 p.m. Which if you remember, I believe last time we woke up in here

239
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:30,100
It was one I think. Yeah, Zach's holding up a one finger

240
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:35,660
Yeah, it was one o'clock didn't we want to do something that I want to say for previously we thought about

241
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:38,980
Hunkering down and just waiting for us to see

242
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:45,940
Planet juggernaut pop out of the ground and then we would go into Marvin's lair so that we could retrieve the gun

243
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:51,660
Back from him and maybe the camera also is the camera with Marvin right now, right?

244
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:52,140
Yeah

245
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:59,540
so I look in the direction where I think the pit is is there any kind of chaos on the city skyline from that direction when

246
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:01,980
you guys walk out you walk into a

247
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:06,500
Pretty chilly December 6th at 3 p.m

248
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:12,380
The Sun is lower in the sky than it was the last time you're out here with these three dead men

249
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,700
quote-unquote men in black tactical gear

250
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:22,180
At your feet and a crawfish boil still going still pretty hot hot fire

251
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:29,100
It hasn't gone out yet looking out you notice that there maybe should be an old woman in a wheelchair

252
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:33,220
But it is quite a bit later. She was moving slow, but maybe not that slow

253
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:37,460
She's had time to scoot away by now at least out of this area for sure

254
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:37,780
Yeah

255
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:45,260
Or it's hopefully someone's come to help her one would assume unless her family abandoned her at the funeral of Ari

256
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,660
Manstein that'd be sad

257
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:53,220
Only you have the power to decide if this world gets that sad Zach

258
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,260
It's really not a choice

259
00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:02,540
It's just what happens it happens every day open your

260
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:11,700
If you're not angry you're not paying attention Thomas guys what what time did we fight planet juggernaut?

261
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:17,540
Okay, if we if we popped out of the mausoleum at like one o'clock well

262
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:22,580
It was one o'clock the last one or the one before that it's three o'clock right now. It was one o'clock

263
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:28,700
Both times previously 11 a.m.. Then 1 o'clock then 3 o'clock. Oh, I see a pattern here

264
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,380
so if we popped out at

265
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:33,300
11 for our

266
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:38,140
Excursion into Marvin's base. I don't know how long were we there were we there for I mean

267
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:42,640
We did quite a bit you went to Jim Cook's house, then you went to get weapons

268
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:48,120
Maybe and then you went to the glass compound we fought the fish men

269
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:53,480
We were knocked unconscious for a certain amount of time while we waited and there was like a waiting room

270
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,240
Before we fought planet juggernaut, so we don't exactly know how long we were out for either

271
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:05,680
So I guess the best guess is that it's like late tonight is when planet juggernaut would pop

272
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:11,220
That's what I would say or early tomorrow morning even I don't know we would we would remember if it was if the Sun was

273
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:15,640
Up when we popped out. Can you tell us that oh the Sun was not up so it was within

274
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:20,320
24 hours from now hopefully unless we were knocked out for days before we

275
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:27,560
But that would be hopefully not don't you guys know everything in this show happens like very quickly no

276
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:35,640
So as I'm looking out for the old lady and scratching my foot. I realized that Maggie is exed out

277
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:42,460
Guys that just leaves true until D. Do you do you think we should go back to contention?

278
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:48,060
That's the last place that we know that we saw drew right anybody see him

279
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:50,880
I haven't seen him since contention and then Tildy is uh

280
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:55,500
Well, I think we're gonna need the gun for that one. Oh, you're right

281
00:23:55,500 --> 00:24:00,940
So we need to wait around until we can get our hands on that gun and camera if our luck holds out

282
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:04,060
We could do drew now and then

283
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:08,940
Next time we wake up in the mausoleum. It'll be later. It should be five o'clock

284
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:13,100
I don't know that opens up the possibility that we'll have to kill ourselves to reset ourselves

285
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:18,380
And I don't know if I want to live with that on my mind for a while if the time comes

286
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:22,620
I will kill you both. There we go. What happens if we don't reset this time?

287
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:27,940
What have you got to live for now besides saving the world

288
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:35,060
I mean dying just isn't always like the first thing I want to do just don't die then but then we won't reset

289
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:37,020
It's like Douglas

290
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:41,860
Adams or Shel Silverstein said flying is just

291
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:54,180
Fine is just well what Tim McGraw said all day. I hope you get the chance to live like you were dying

292
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:03,240
So, let's go do it eight seconds later, I need you to roll alertness someone I got 60

293
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,460
I got a 70 I also have 60

294
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,060
I

295
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:09,540
rolled a

296
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:11,540
16 I pass

297
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:17,580
out of the corner of your eye you hear a smell and it's familiar and

298
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,780
What color is it bright yellow and?

299
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,260
You get the feeling

300
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:27,740
That creature that visited you asking about the book

301
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:33,480
Is nearby or will be here in a second and you need to act right now?

302
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:37,280
What do you do I tell the guy I tell the guys

303
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,880
Do you remember that thing that thing that the thing that screamed at me and it was asking for a book

304
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,960
I think it's coming back. I think it's coming back. We got it. We got to get out of here. Let's go

305
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,120
Let's sprint to our car. Oh shit. Do we have cars?

306
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:51,120
We might not have cars our old selves might have taken our car

307
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:55,760
We took the cruiser last time I think or did we take the Accord?

308
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,040
No, we took the car that Maggie brought us, right?

309
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:03,760
So there should still be a cruiser here right or my car we can steal a car if needs be

310
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:10,540
We had two cars here last time and we only took one of them. Who's got the lowest. Hold on. Let me call Enterprise

311
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,920
Am I wrong?

312
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,040
Yeah, there were three cars in total one that Maggie brought one that I drove there and one that you drew

313
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:22,760
Yeah, and last time we all took one together Maggie went somewhere else

314
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:26,320
So last time you left zero cars in the parking lot

315
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:31,040
Well, how many cars are there now? That's that is to be decided when you get to the parking lot

316
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,240
I suppose so you're saying that we took two cars

317
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:40,080
I think we all took one car the first time you left the cemetery you took the cruiser and the second time you left the

318
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,440
Cemetery you took the car that Clark came in

319
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:50,280
Okay, so okay and that makes John Road with Rosemary, right? Okay, so if we go to the parking lot, what do we see?

320
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,720
Well

321
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:56,520
Were you guys all trying to decide in that moment if you should go to the parking lot?

322
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:02,080
Because you didn't know whether there was a car there. Unfortunately due to our dithering. I think we I

323
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:07,120
Guess we could say it was in character, but I told you guys like we needed to go so I figured we were going

324
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:12,000
Yeah, yeah, but then we just sat around on our asses talking about whether or not there were cars there

325
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,740
I feel like Joe Luke and Thomas did that. I don't know if we would have done that in character

326
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:21,420
We would I said run so I feel like we would have run for Keith and character who says run I start running towards I

327
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:24,020
Think that there's still a car there. So sure. Yeah

328
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:31,660
As you guys are running through these tombs these above-ground

329
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,740
mausoleums

330
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:39,540
You need to make a couple quick turns to get out in the fastest way to the parking lot that you know

331
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:42,460
And as you're running you see right in front of you

332
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,300
There's an old woman in a wheelchair

333
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:50,740
and she looks at you with massive eyes and she's just like

334
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:01,340
And she starts crying out for help

335
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:13,740
I take her with I get behind her wheelchair and start running her towards the parking lot. You gotta come with us, ma'am

336
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:20,900
We'll get you out of here amazing and right behind you as you guys are nearing the turn for the parking lot

337
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:23,260
you hear this like

338
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:30,380
And if you look back while you're running you see that

339
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:34,860
materializing behind you and not in your way is this

340
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:41,660
Massive gaunt creature wearing a black suit and it has no snow hair whatsoever

341
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:43,980
On its head

342
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:47,480
If you could see its knuckles, there's no hair on its knuckles

343
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:53,860
Certainly, no eyebrows. How about down there any down there? You can't see the down there, but you

344
00:28:54,420 --> 00:29:00,180
Looking at the rest of this from the rest of it might assume that it is both hairless and that

345
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:04,980
You would be unaware of what its genitalia could look like

346
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,260
Kendall

347
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:10,580
It could be anything. I mean it's got a Ken doll down there

348
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:19,980
Like just the smooth taint. Oh, I thought you meant like it's smooth, but there's a kindle attached to the front

349
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:30,820
Just like stuck on there that would that would be dope and you guys are running but then this thing's behind you and it cries

350
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:32,820
Out what do its eyes look like?

351
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,260
Its eyes are slits

352
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:43,180
That when they open they open from the bottom instead of from the top and

353
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:47,700
when they like slap down onto its cheeks

354
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:51,980
You see big big eyes that are

355
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:59,260
The pupils are red and the part that is white on humans is also white

356
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:01,260
I

357
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:13,140
Hand the old lady my gun and I'm like you ever used one of these boy howdy she's gonna roll sanity

358
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,920
She rolled a 77 oh

359
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:27,880
Hell yes. Oh, that's bad properly. No, this old lady's got it together. She she has 85 sanity

360
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:33,120
Oh sweet, so it's a critical success. So she cocks the gun. Yeah. Oh

361
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:38,360
Interesting, so she cut I was using these before you were born

362
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,480
She's instantly on board with this

363
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:49,520
Justin come on in we just got our new tank ladies and gentlemen. Yeah, let's call it

364
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,600
Hey tell Justin get in here and play an old lady

365
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,880
She

366
00:30:54,800 --> 00:31:00,680
Cocks the gun immediately and I just wanted to provide cover fire over our shoulders

367
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:07,920
And when you make it out into the parking lot you see that there are

368
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:11,960
No cars here in this parking lot

369
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,200
Until a red

370
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,000
2001 Mitsubishi Eclipse comes flying

371
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:26,360
Across all the designated parking spots in this parking lot toward you

372
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:33,600
Who's in it? Is it baby driver and behind the wheel you can see drew Andrews

373
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,080
Now

374
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:48,360
Unfortunately, I've never been so excited. I need you all the real power

375
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:56,620
Shit

376
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:05,220
That's gonna be a no from me dog, I rolled over my power same 79 on a 50 67 on a 60

377
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,080
87 on a six. I rolled the 22

378
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,040
Fuck you

379
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:16,280
Unless that's good then. Hell yeah drew had an 11 sanity. So he also critically feels

380
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:24,920
You all here. Hello subject Clark Theodore Bishop and you all

381
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,480
Freeze

382
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:37,880
You all turn around even all of John Lee Kevin Moore with all of the wheelchair just spins you around like you're standing on a

383
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,200
Platform I am here to offer apologies and to put your minds to rest

384
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:48,360
Order has not been lost, but we ran into a glitch

385
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:54,200
Surrounding a vector with the same genetic code as Clark Theodore Bishop

386
00:32:54,360 --> 00:33:00,680
But Clark Theodore Bishop does not have a twin. This is the glitch. I am here to

387
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,320
investigate

388
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,320
subject Clark Theodore Bishop

389
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:09,600
Subject John Lee petty more the third subject Ashley Keith beans

390
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,400
What can you tell me about this vector?

391
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:24,520
Your name is Ashley my face gets super red I'm like this guy doesn't know what he's talking about

392
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,520
Oh

393
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:35,600
That's something I shoot I shoot at him I get super mad super flustered and I shoot at him that's in line

394
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,600
That's what you did last time

395
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:44,440
All right, yeah, I go ahead and roll power again because you'll have to win a contest of power

396
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:52,840
Fucking hell dude, what'd you get? I'm rolling rocks. I rolled a 33 Oh

397
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:59,880
I got an eight. I'm sorry Keith Vigna as you pull the gun out

398
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:07,560
You hold it like you're aimed ready to fire and your finger will not pull the trigger. I

399
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:10,240
Need you to roll sanity. I

400
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,600
Got a 99

401
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,600
Oh

402
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:27,960
So, yeah days over my power, yes, I believe it is oh dang it looks like I wasn't recording I guess we got to start

403
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,120
Dang

404
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,560
Restart checkpoint

405
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:41,840
You guys all just pull guns on each other. See come back at five. Thanks

406
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:50,880
Thanks for clueing us into our strategy my finger won't move when I try to fire it and I look at

407
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,440
I look at the old lady

408
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,280
Why are you doing this to me?

409
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:07,760
She won't let me shoot him and I look panicked at my two friends, but also

410
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,980
Suspiciously, you've got to respect your elders and I'm sure she has her reasons

411
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:15,400
But also have you considered that it's the weird

412
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:23,740
Future man doing it. Yeah, I'm with John on this one Keith. I think that it's the tall guy over there. That's making us

413
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:25,380
Maybe you don't want me to shoot him

414
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:32,600
I mean I that's also true at this moment you realize that none of your mouths have been moving and you've been having this

415
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,900
conversation

416
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,900
Mentally, I

417
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:41,300
Need you guys to roll. I'm sorry tall guy. Did you just hear all that?

418
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,980
Oh

419
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:48,740
94

420
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:56,580
97 oh boy. What are we rolling? I need Joe and Thomas Clark and John both lose one sanity

421
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:00,420
However, Keith Vigna with that critical failure

422
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:03,220
You're also gonna lose one sanity

423
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:09,020
Cool, because you lose the maximum sanity, which is one for that

424
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:15,940
Well, okay, so I had that buffer of one so I don't break right now. Oh nice

425
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:26,620
Yeah, and hold on for just one scene longer and as you guys realize that you were having this conversation mentally oh wait

426
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:32,180
That was a sanity roll and I rolled over my yes, you did same

427
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:34,540
I don't know if okay

428
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:39,740
You'll have to explain how what kind of hold this creature has on me because I might not be able to do it's got a hold

429
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:41,380
Enough to where you won't be able to do anything

430
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:44,840
So just describe what it looks like when you try to do what you want to do

431
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:48,780
But you can't do what you want to do. I feel like this happened before

432
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:53,680
Discribed it as yeah, I just kind of boil from the inside

433
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:57,980
You see my face turn red and like sheer rage over my face

434
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:01,940
It's physically hurting me from the inside out that I can't do anything

435
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:07,980
Meanwhile Kevin is freaking out picks his can he move his body just like minutely

436
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:12,200
Well, then you can tell that if he could move his body

437
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,780
He would be freaking out

438
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:21,900
But every part of him is like twitching super tense muscles and the most concerned look comes across his face

439
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:27,560
And you hear him thinking this ain't right. This ain't me

440
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:32,160
This ain't me, I ain't no fortunate son. It ain't me

441
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:37,920
As you're all essentially just like in suspended motion

442
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:43,000
This thing thinks toward you and you feel

443
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,600
release and relief in

444
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:54,240
Your bones you can feel it reverberate. Do not do not be afraid

445
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,960
Do not be afraid

446
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:01,240
Hey, hey, I'm not a family on the shore

447
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:10,680
I'm giving you relief here. Welcome to fucking welcome to fucking welcome to the fucking show kids

448
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:16,960
And as you're all calm you see this woman for the first time maybe

449
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:23,180
Ever that you've seen this woman because every single time you've come across her she is looked so worried

450
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:29,500
So afraid almost like on the verge of death with how stressed out she is and you see her

451
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:32,620
immediately come to peace and

452
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:35,140
in that moment

453
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:38,140
she just exhales and

454
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:45,060
Freezes I try to take the gun from her hand. Her hand is kind of stuck to it a little bit. I

455
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,300
pry her

456
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:49,780
Frozen fingers off just because the bad circulation

457
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:51,780
I

458
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:55,300
Snap

459
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:00,580
No, but yeah, so I

460
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:05,260
Struggle with the gun for a little bit that rested from her frozen hand and and you have it

461
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:11,100
I don't know why you would need a gun in your hand with how relaxed and chill you are right now as this thing's

462
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:17,540
Like what? Can you tell me about this vector and you hear a screech behind you as

463
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:20,680
Drew whips this red

464
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:26,380
2001 Mitsubishi Eclipse right up behind you guys and drew looks

465
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:31,820
And he sees this creature looking at you and he slowly starts

466
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:35,060
Driving in reverse, but just really slowly

467
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:39,860
He goes about 20 yards and then he just stops and he's just watching

468
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:43,160
I try to beam the thought to drew run him down

469
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:47,000
Run them over you need not have those

470
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:50,080
Aggressions we are in time of peace

471
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:57,200
I will tell you what will help you if you will help me Clark's ears perk up at that for sure

472
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:00,520
What what do you need and what can you offer?

473
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:07,420
I am looking for information about a glitch in regards to subject Clark Theodore Bishop

474
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:11,720
This glitch is not a twin but has the same genetic makeup

475
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:16,360
I can't help but notice that you've abandoned the numbers format that you were using last time

476
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:21,800
We saw you are you are you the same thing that we saw last time? I am four three six two nine

477
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:26,200
I wanted to make sure that you are more comfortable

478
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,880
DC FBI is what it was

479
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:35,320
I've been I've been through some stuff. I know those numbers now you does that does that mean your DC FBI?

480
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,840
Is that is that what those numbers mean? We are

481
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,560
We are I thought you were going to continue

482
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:50,520
We are blah blah blah blah

483
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:58,340
D DC FBI does that is is that the kind of like is that

484
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:05,480
District of Columbia Federal Bureau of Investigation. Is that what that stands for? So here's a thing

485
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,520
I need you all the real power

486
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,320
Three

487
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:20,200
Ooh a 25 I pass I got a 40 on a 50. Holy shit. We all passed

488
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:25,040
God, okay. Yeah, and I failed. Yeah, look how the

489
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,920
table and so

490
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:30,360
That will be important here in a second

491
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:36,200
District of Columbia your nation's capital. What's up with your voice?

492
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:40,040
This is the voice that I have to communicate with

493
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:44,960
What a different voice make you more comfortable. I guess

494
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:53,800
Physically, what are you? I am NOT like you that is apparent and you know that I'm not trying to other eyes you in any

495
00:41:53,800 --> 00:42:00,440
Way, but are you like a future man, or are you some kind of space creature? I am simply better

496
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:09,200
That's an opinion it is not it is fact I am here to begin. Oh

497
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,560
I thought there was more again

498
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:22,080
Again begin what we are myriad and we are here to advance. Oh

499
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,640
You stuff in there again. Okay. Gotcha

500
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,240
Clark says to the fellas

501
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:35,400
Myriad you you remember myriad it's that's the we saw that symbol. It's the double helices and we saw the

502
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:40,600
robot man at James the mill workers house had that on his crotch and

503
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:46,040
There was a ring that Keith are you do you still have that ring around my neck?

504
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:52,080
I have the ring on a my shoestring show him that ring. I guess yeah, I hold it up

505
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:57,680
Actually, I want to put it on. Can I can I move? Yes. Okay, I put it on my right ring finger

506
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:02,680
And hold it out to him. We are a myriad as well

507
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:08,560
And this thing looks at you and holds out its hand toward you subject Jim

508
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:12,280
James cook you are not you are

509
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:16,960
Subject Ashley Keith beans. What is you do? Why?

510
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:27,880
Hello subject Ashley Keith beans

511
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,400
Why do you have this?

512
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:33,600
Ring

513
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:36,720
I've always had it roll power

514
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:42,520
25 on a 50

515
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:51,640
Failed you have always had it for a while. Obviously, that's just Jim cook in the body of Keith beans

516
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:57,480
Yeah subject Jim James cook you are still alive. This is excellent news

517
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:01,240
I

518
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:10,280
Whisper in Keith's ear. Why don't you tell him that we're your friends and you need him to restate your primary mission

519
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:18,000
To brief us on what's going on. I look at the thing. Did you catch that? I am sorry what he said

520
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,320
can you I

521
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:26,280
Need you to restate my mission to make sure that you're who you say you are

522
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,240
I

523
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:37,360
Bubble gum tree

524
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,200
Does that work

525
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:48,080
Subject Jim James cook before your death you were working on

526
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,540
operation stapler Android program

527
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:58,500
Respect to cut down on cost and sell to private companies like the city asylum

528
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:05,380
Are you still working on this? I approach the creature and get really close to it

529
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:07,820
I don't know if these guys

530
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:10,580
Know about that yet. So

531
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:13,180
But yeah

532
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:20,260
Then why did you ask me to state your brief loudly

533
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:25,480
I didn't say loudly. I only talk in one volume

534
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:30,580
Well, as long as they can know we're good to go. They're they're helping me out here

535
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:35,740
I assumed when you asked that they were not our enemy. Yeah, I'm still working on it

536
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:40,780
Just to make sure I can trust you. What is project stapler again?

537
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:44,140
Well, I just told you just told us

538
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:51,340
It was a merely operation to cut costs on Android creations and sell them to companies

539
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:53,620
including the contention orphanage

540
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:55,860
asylum

541
00:45:55,860 --> 00:46:02,220
Contention asylum which one city asylum the city asylum. Hey Keith. I'm I mean a

542
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:09,460
Jim will you ask this thing if it's a robot? Is this a robot? You're not a robot

543
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:13,100
Are you I am NOT a robot, but you're an Android

544
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:18,240
Why would you assume that I am either robot or Android I am neither

545
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:24,360
So you're an alien I am from where I am from which is I do not know

546
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:28,160
So, how do you know you're neither robot nor Android nor alien? I am

547
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,120
alone

548
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:37,400
Technically in your definitions an alien, that's awesome, man

549
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:42,400
That's really cool. Well, so yeah, Jim Jim's just plugging away there

550
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:45,960
At that at that project stapler

551
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:50,120
Yeah, I ran into a little bit of a mix-up with my old body in this one

552
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:52,700
But uh, tell me more about the vector

553
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:59,040
We are on the same team and you are working with subject Clark Theodore Bishop

554
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:05,580
Please tell me more about the vector. What do you want to know? It just seems to be a little time-traveling thing

555
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:07,620
Yes. Yeah, nothing too big

556
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:13,700
Hey, maybe we'll tell you a little bit more about the vector if you can tell us about operation three ring binder and

557
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:16,500
hole puncher and hole puncher

558
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:27,800
Little whisper thing that he does every now and then does that sound like speech it sounds like yeah

559
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:31,320
He's communicating with some sort of speech some sort of uplink

560
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:36,500
Okay, when I showed him the ring did it like glow or do anything? No, I

561
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:43,220
Am unfamiliar with operation hole puncher or operation three ring binder

562
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:46,860
And I he meant that or is he know and that yeah, can I he meant it as well?

563
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:49,420
Oh, yeah, absolutely. Go ahead and roll him it

564
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:54,060
Fail 76 on a 50. I got a 75 on a 80

565
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:59,660
75 on an 80 would tell you you are not exactly

566
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:02,300
familiar with

567
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:04,300
non-human intelligence, however

568
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:07,100
If you were guessing

569
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:10,660
You would say that it didn't talk differently

570
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:14,420
So it's either been lying the whole time or telling the truth the whole time

571
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:18,740
Probably sounds like a real straight shooter Clark is gonna address the creature

572
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:23,940
Can you can you tell us how you how you and Jim are related? What how do you guys know each other?

573
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:29,480
Jim here works for myriad. How long has he been doing that? How long has he been with myriad?

574
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:34,840
Why do you do not know things about him he is right here

575
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:41,440
I'm Jim is just a real hard guy to get to open up and we've been working with him for a while and we you know

576
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:48,640
One of subject Jim James Cook's best qualities is his inability to open up. So you understand

577
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:52,360
so we just you know, we we really come to appreciate the feller and

578
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:57,800
Well, we just want to know a little bit more about him. So maybe on his birthday we can do something special

579
00:48:58,460 --> 00:49:03,160
You know with with a personal touch what have you done on his previous birthdays?

580
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:06,760
Well, he hasn't told us when it is so we'd like to do something at all

581
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:22,960
Jim cook I gotta make that shorter some I'll speed it up in post just replace it with modem sounds

582
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,960
Hahahaha

583
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:30,000
Subject Jim James Cook does the same thing on his birthday

584
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:34,960
Every birthday for the past decade on his birthday

585
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:42,920
December 1st, he always goes to his favorite pie shop in the city called

586
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,800
Prairie pie, but it's like

587
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,760
Prairie pie. Yes

588
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,760
And

589
00:49:52,160 --> 00:50:00,560
It's yeah, it's two folded hands on the outside in a triangle making that's like a pie slice

590
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:11,320
We have a local pie maker in Springfield called Prairie pie like on the Prairie like home and

591
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:18,720
It's the best pie. Anyway, I have a piece of the honey sea salt in my fridge right now every December 1st

592
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:21,560
Subject Jim James Cook's birthday

593
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:27,240
He goes to Prairie pie in the city before walking back home

594
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:31,240
I walk back home to contention. No Jim lives in the city

595
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:32,160
Oh, yeah

596
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:39,640
What do you know in exchange for this information to make subject Jim James Cook's birthday better now?

597
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:43,000
We know to get him pie. What do you know about the vector? Oh

598
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:49,840
Nothing really during my mishap when I had to switch bodies I a lot of info got kind of a

599
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:54,840
Jar-bolt around my head. I there's some things I just don't remember

600
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:57,280
Subject Jim James Cook

601
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:05,320
Are you in the body of subject Ashley Keith beans in order to repair the relationship regarding?

602
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:07,880
operation San Ferra blum

603
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:10,920
Yes

604
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:13,800
Precisely

605
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:17,320
Clark nudges Keith

606
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:23,640
Like I don't I can't do it without him hearing so I just nudge you after you say just yes

607
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:30,200
And you stop talking. I nudge you well, how do you suggest we move forward Jim?

608
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:34,840
You don't you don't remember very much about that mission. Do you you should have him remind you what it is? Yeah

609
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:38,640
Yeah, no, I mean Jim obviously remembers it pretty well

610
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:43,640
But what he did say is before he made a move he wanted to consult with us tactically

611
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:48,320
But yeah, you did want you to fill us in on that right? Yeah that way they know

612
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:56,360
So we yeah really if subject just James is taken care of I suppose

613
00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:00,660
We can move forward in what way sorry we're playing catch-up

614
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:06,640
Will you describe who subject just James is to us? I mean out of character. Do you know yeah?

615
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:13,320
It's James the mill worker that's why we've called him James the mill worker forever cuz he's just James I am curious

616
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:16,440
I will give you information about

617
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:23,580
Operation San Ferra blum if you will first give me information about the vector

618
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:29,520
Clark Clark's gonna step forward toward it. Do you do you know you called it a glitch earlier?

619
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:33,200
Do you would you have a running theory on what this new vector is?

620
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:38,440
I'm gonna be straight with you a scary man that we don't exactly know for sure

621
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:44,880
We've got our own theories. Do you have a theory our working theory is a clone?

622
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:51,280
Yeah, I mean I guess that the clones old though, so wouldn't this one be the clone we've seen

623
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:55,320
We've seen this vector that I believe you're speaking of and it looks like me

624
00:52:55,520 --> 00:53:00,600
But it seems like an older version of me is it helping or hurting I?

625
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:09,200
Like to think it's helping it seems it seems helpful so far seems more healthy than hurting does it seem to have an agenda

626
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:11,240
Yeah

627
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:18,460
Yes, yes, it does. What is this agenda? It's cryptic to say the to say the least yeah that remains unclear

628
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:25,160
Where was this vector seen last from your perspective? I point behind it

629
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:27,460
Yeah, I point at the mausoleum. It was

630
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:29,900
You get he I was in there

631
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:33,580
Oh, we're calling him Clark old Clark old was in in there

632
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:37,760
And then and then he wasn't he he doesn't he disappeared on us. What time?

633
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:42,940
11 or that's when we woke up so like 9 or 10, maybe yeah, thank you

634
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:46,660
I have decided many things during our

635
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:49,020
conversation one

636
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:55,440
Subject Ashley Keith beans you are not subject Jim James cook number two

637
00:53:55,720 --> 00:54:02,340
Just wait a minute there you all are clearly working in a way that you do not understand

638
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:06,860
What your causalities are creating in this time?

639
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:11,960
I need for this reason too, and I am sorry wipe your memories

640
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:19,760
And it reaches out its hand I pull my gun out and try to shoot it so here

641
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:25,060
Let's think about what happens this thing reaches out its arm as Keith Vigna pulls out his gun

642
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:28,680
you see it like struggling as

643
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:31,480
We rolled the power check earlier

644
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:37,440
And you all succeeded it thinks that it succeeded and leaves it has

645
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:41,040
Completed its task and it disappears out of existence

646
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:49,200
But you all remember everything tight holy shit, and it went in a way different way than I expected it to

647
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:57,480
Yeah, we pumped that alien all his information and as you guys turn around and I'm singing like a canary

648
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:03,600
Let's go kill Tildy does Sam Farah bloom mean anything to you guys I?

649
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:07,520
Don't think it. No. I don't have no idea

650
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:12,540
If I google it does anything come up go ahead and roll computer

651
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:17,040
87 on a 20

652
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:21,500
No when you google Sam Farah bomb nothing comes up. I spell it wrong

653
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,520
I'd like to try as well

654
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:29,520
Fuck 60 other

655
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:36,200
Clark doesn't have any computer skill zero percent zero percent that makes sense yep. That was my design

656
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:43,380
Clark only uses his phone to text and just barely gets through it

657
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:44,860
You

658
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:49,460
Hear the car pull up right behind you it scares me, so I aim my gun at Drew

659
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:54,420
For just a second until I realize who it is Clark tries to like no no no

660
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:59,060
Throw a hand onto the gun to put it down to the ground. No. It's it's Keith. It's true. It's true

661
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:04,180
Look, it's true is the old lady still here in the wheelchair. There is a woman's body

662
00:56:04,540 --> 00:56:08,420
Is it alive body? Why why did you say that Zach?

663
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:11,780
Is it is she dead?

664
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:14,500
When she

665
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:15,720
finally

666
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:22,340
Finally for the first time in over a decade had no pain and no fear in her heart and in her mind

667
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:25,100
She felt ready to go

668
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:32,300
Did she die fuck we killed her December 6 we have no way of knowing that so we're

669
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:38,660
Holy shit that that alien must have scared her death

670
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:46,820
Oh, maybe he did something terrible to her mind drew pulls up in the 2001 red Mitsubishi Eclipse

671
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:48,980
rolls down the window

672
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:55,860
Hello contention police officers, please get in the car and come with me. Oh boy. It is good to see you drew

673
00:56:55,860 --> 00:57:01,240
What's contention like true? I'm so happy you're still around we were calling you

674
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:06,100
We weren't the fastest were calling you earlier, but not now

675
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:09,100
Good to see you drew

676
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:38,100
Oh

677
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:08,100
You
