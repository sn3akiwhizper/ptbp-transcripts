1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,800
Welcome to the cream zone, my lactose-filled babies.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06,780
I'm here to whip you up into a frothy beverage

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:08,800
for all to consume.

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,720
It's me, your warm milk-filled uncle Wolf the dog.

5
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,480
And as always, we are fermenting y'all

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,600
into some kind of weird sour milk cream

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,720
live from 694.2 PTBP.

8
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:27,240
So far, all of you beautiful, generous folks

9
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:33,440
have raised $6,372 for the bail project.

10
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,480
Wowza.

11
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,020
Remember, screenshot your donations

12
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,560
and send them to pretendinpod at gmail.com.

13
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:45,280
And for every $5 donated, you'll receive an entry for a chance

14
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,080
to win one of the first ever PTBP t-shirts.

15
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:53,960
This week's winner is Marie Lupin.

16
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:58,480
Congratulations, Marie, and keep on donating, y'all.

17
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,120
We have three more shirts to give away

18
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,920
to you charitable motherfuckers.

19
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,040
The link to donate is in the show notes.

20
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,680
This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from a very sweet listener

21
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,120
called Chris.

22
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:16,480
He writes, a buddy of mine recommended PTBP to me

23
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,000
a while back, but I didn't think I would ever

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,240
be into an actual play podcast, let alone one

25
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,800
that features a game I've never heard of.

26
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,320
He kept nagging me, though, and I finally

27
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,120
gave in and listened to episode one a couple of months ago,

28
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,520
just so I could get it over with.

29
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,600
Since then, I've binged every episode,

30
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,600
became a patron, convinced two other friends and my brother

31
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,680
not only to start listening to PTBP,

32
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,080
but also to start playing Delta Green.

33
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,400
I've converted my wife as well, and we are now

34
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:56,880
relistening to old episodes in between new episodes

35
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,680
just to get our fix.

36
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,120
Then contention boys, the gravelly baritone

37
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:06,800
of the Mighty Wolf, and the manic brilliance of Zack

38
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,040
have been a source of so much joy during what has been

39
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,680
an incredibly hectic couple of months.

40
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,080
I cannot thank you guys enough.

41
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:19,840
Shout outs to my friends, Ruben, Alex, and Jesse,

42
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,040
my brother Michael, and my wife Maria,

43
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,360
all of whom are loyal listeners.

44
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,120
Lots of love from the Netherlands, Chris.

45
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,920
Wow, Chris, I know you said a bunch of other shit,

46
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:36,160
but acknowledging my baritone tones,

47
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,360
the gravel in my gullet, that's enough

48
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,160
to bring tears to my eyes, baby.

49
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,240
Maybe I'll take a little interdimensional trip

50
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,760
to the Netherlands you speak of.

51
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,480
Pay you and yours a little visit, you'll never see me,

52
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,760
but I'll definitely see and smell y'all.

53
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,440
Have you ever thought to yourself, wow,

54
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,720
I like this pretending to be people show very much.

55
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,120
I wonder if there's something easy I could do to help him.

56
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,320
The answer is very fucking much a yes.

57
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,040
Write a five star review on Apple Podcasts,

The links are in the show notes.

64
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,640
Is there an echo in here, or is it just the news?

65
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,200
News, news, news, news, news.

66
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,080
Last time, our valiant heroes forced Terrence Liquor

67
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,240
into the home of Randy Angst,

68
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,000
where the old man was on the ground

69
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,720
in desperate need of medical attention.

70
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,040
Seeing they were about to get boxed in

71
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,480
on this residential street by a truck

72
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,160
with a hot tub instead of a truck bed,

73
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:02,120
as well as a Chevy Impala with a doorless refrigerator

74
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,600
on its side strapped to the roof.

75
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,120
They stole T Liquor's truck and hoofed it back

76
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:13,120
to the hidden Mitsubishi Eclipse to grab Drew Carey

77
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,040
without first losing their tail.

78
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,000
Clark grabbed Drew's body and tossed him

79
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,240
into the stolen truck's waterbed

80
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,880
as the refrigerator Impala and hot tub truck

81
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,720
pulled up to the scene.

82
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,440
There wasn't much of a standoff though,

83
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,240
due to hot tub truck immediately losing

84
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,240
its three team members to a massive wave of ooze.

85
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,520
The refrigerator Impala, owned and operated

86
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:45,040
by Asher and Avery Little, nope the fuck outta there,

87
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,640
leaving our waterbed truck crew

88
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:52,600
as this oozy upsurges only a remaining target.

89
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,920
John Lee Pettymore the 3rd,

90
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,840
perhaps still wet from his time in the bed of his truck,

91
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,840
critically failed a drive check,

92
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,640
taking us now to the aftermath.

93
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,440
It's a brand new track that rocks,

94
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,440
like sedimentary, metamorphic, and igneous,

95
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,760
and rolls like a stolen truck

96
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,800
into a sign for a local tire shop.

97
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,320
It's kudzu with no backbone.

98
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,160
And now.

99
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:43,120
If a little rat dick left his seed in you,

100
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,120
wouldn't you fucking demand every goddamn cent

101
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,320
he had for that child? Welcome to Pretending to Be People.

102
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:55,920
That was the perfect introduction to episode.

103
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:59,240
No, I don't want to make an enemy of David Spade.

104
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,600
Welcome to Pretending to Be People.

105
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,600
That was a really good introduction to episode 82.

106
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,080
It works if you just blink out,

107
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:12,440
if you beep out the name of the celebrity.

108
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,040
Only the first time though.

109
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:26,920
She was discovered by radio superstar Howard Stern.

110
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,640
Her mother sent Stern pictures

111
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,880
and a letter about her daughter.

112
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,720
Stern had her in and sent her pictures to Playboy

113
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,040
and she was accepted.

114
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:37,480
Oh, that's an American like, thanks mom, dream.

115
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,880
I believe in you, honey.

116
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,480
Here, send your nude pictures to Howard Stern.

117
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,600
Her mom got to tell her

118
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,440
as soon as she got off the school bus.

119
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,280
Yeah.

120
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,360
Would you rather have to have sex

121
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,480
with a Howard Stern or David Spade?

122
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,720
Oh my God.

123
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,000
What a terrible, would you rather?

124
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,360
I guess both.

125
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,200
I'd probably go with David Spade.

126
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,560
I don't know enough about either of them.

127
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,200
So the romance wouldn't be there.

128
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,040
Either way.

129
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,400
Now I'm looking up ugly David Spade

130
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,800
and ugly Howard Stern

131
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,040
to see who has a worst picture on the internet.

132
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,040
Probably David Spade.

133
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,080
You can go to at pretending pod

134
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,560
to get a side by side of those on Instagram

135
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,440
or on Twitter.

136
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,560
We'll be tagging David Spade's family members.

137
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,960
He's cute when he's younger.

138
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,160
Yeah, if we're talking like Tommy boy years,

139
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,680
then it's David Spade all day.

140
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,080
But if we're talking about old, both of them,

141
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,000
then I think I have to go for Stern.

142
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,840
Stern's not bad looking.

143
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,000
Well, it would just be a freaky

144
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,080
kind of like Bourdain-ish experience.

145
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,600
We could probably get more viewers

146
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,520
if we were on Stern's show

147
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,920
than anything David Spade did.

148
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,400
Well, that's not happening after this.

149
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,320
After what?

150
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,800
After we said we want to fuck him?

151
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,520
Sounds to me like we're playing all our cards right.

152
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,480
I don't know anything about him,

153
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,200
but I think that's kind of his whole show, right?

154
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,480
Howard Stern kind of looks like if I was a dinosaur.

155
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,920
Like a raptor.

156
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,320
He's got the same hair.

157
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,120
You should grow yours out long like his.

158
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,440
Have it go down your back.

159
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:30,320
I mean, I don't plan on getting it cut anytime soon.

160
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,880
It's getting long, baby.

161
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,200
So last time John was driving the truck,

162
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,160
Crit failed to avoid the crane

163
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,080
and flipped it, freeze frame.

164
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,960
The truck is turned sideways,

165
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,480
hits a little rock or something.

166
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:45,040
Tires are bald as fuck and begins turning over.

167
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,640
In this moment, I have you guys all roll for constitution.

168
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,920
John critically succeeds.

169
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,440
Keith passes.

170
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,320
Clark critically succeeds.

171
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,520
As the truck is flying over, everyone is fine.

172
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:01,160
Seemingly, except for Keith lands on top of Jimmy Sanders.

173
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,600
Gonna roll for him right now.

174
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,560
Rolled to 98.

175
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,760
He's not doing great.

176
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:11,520
He's gonna lose four hit points and stays conscious

177
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,440
as Keith lands on top of him.

178
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,520
Critically succeeding his constitution check

179
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,040
to stay conscious because he's low on hit points

180
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,960
leading up to this point.

181
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,440
And Clark literally crits with a 69.

182
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,560
So as the truck rolls, the water's flying out behind him

183
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,680
as he just keeps his legs moving and keeps running

184
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,160
and the truck just avoids

185
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,080
and the truck moves, rolls, rolls, rolls

186
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,200
and explodes into a sign for owls, tires and tigers.

187
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,640
Oh yeah.

188
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:49,560
The issue being Drew's body with Kerry pages inside

189
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:54,360
lays motionless in an extremely shallow puddle

190
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,800
of stinky, stinky water.

191
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:01,800
And Gary Bailey from hanging halfway up out of a sewage drain

192
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,080
What are those called?

193
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,480
Just the like long thin ones

194
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,960
that the Kleinfella comes out of?

195
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,800
Sorry, storm drain?

196
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,640
Yes.

197
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,240
So what's a culvert?

198
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,440
Okay, can you actually not mention it?

199
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,080
Cause I was gonna make a dope it joke.

200
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,800
Okay, but I'm leaving that in for sure.

201
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,760
Cause that's funny.

202
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,760
So a storm drain, like a cauldron.

203
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,840
Is a cauldron like a witch?

204
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:33,320
I said culvert, which I think is an open drain.

205
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,880
Or maybe a culvert, right?

206
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,160
Is a big round one maybe

207
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,320
that comes out of like the side of a hill.

208
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,240
Joe's right.

209
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,400
Yeah, so we're all right.

210
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:46,400
And so it's a storm train on the side of the road

211
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,000
and Gary Daley is like half out of it.

212
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,920
Hands, elbows on the concrete and he's hollering at you.

213
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,320
Officer Bishop, Officer Vigna.

214
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,380
Oh, Keith, you need to get down here.

215
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,220
What are y'all doing?

216
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:02,960
And looking behind you, you see this ooze,

217
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:06,800
this massive grouping of ooze.

218
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,640
You've never seen this much all in one place before.

219
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:12,040
It is coming toward you slowly.

220
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,760
The back end of it coming up over the top

221
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,200
like waves breaking.

222
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,620
And as I'm doing this with my arms,

223
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,100
you can see my pit stains.

224
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,600
They are deep, wide.

225
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,680
Like the Lord's love.

226
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,800
And it is just flowing, flowing toward you.

227
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,120
And we are in combat order.

228
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,200
Clark Bishop, what do you do?

229
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,520
I want to try and run.

230
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,920
Am I near Drew's body?

231
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,200
If I'm still standing and running,

232
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,280
I would keep running toward it if I am.

233
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,520
Yeah, absolutely.

234
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,900
I want to run toward it and grab it and pick it up

235
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,060
and carry it with me toward Gary.

236
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:46,200
Okay, done.

237
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,280
You're definitely strong enough to pick up

238
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,720
a little Drew Andrews.

239
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:53,480
He's, you know, I believe he's got a fair amount of pudge,

240
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,360
but you can definitely throw him up over.

241
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,360
How are you carrying him as you're in?

242
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,440
Remember, as you pick him up,

243
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,720
you're picking up a wet Drew Andrews who's unconscious,

244
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,120
but you know it's not Drew inside.

245
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:07,960
Sure.

246
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,400
I just want to, if he's laying on the ground,

247
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:14,200
I want to grab his arms and like drape them over my back.

248
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,120
So his whole body's on my shoulders,

249
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,600
behind my neck on my shoulders.

250
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,480
So I think, is that a fireman's carry?

251
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,600
I think that's a fireman's carry.

252
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,720
I'm doing that.

253
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,820
And not only are you saving him from the fires

254
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,160
of wherever he might, no, there's no.

255
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,640
Hell.

256
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,040
You don't need a fire to have a fireman's carry.

257
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,560
Oh shit, Thomas, thank you so much.

258
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,040
I think legally you do.

259
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,120
I think that this might be an illegal maneuver

260
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,000
performing here.

261
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,280
Well, it's yeah, and it's not like a big thing.

262
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:46,080
It's just like a, you can't call it champagne thing.

263
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,560
Right, right.

264
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,400
Unjust laws should not be laws.

265
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,760
Keith Vigno, what are you doing?

266
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,560
Well, now hold on, hold on, hold on.

267
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,020
That protects the valor, like the growers

268
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,740
of the champagne region.

269
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:01,900
Yeah.

270
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,780
No, it's unjust, it's bullshit.

271
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:04,620
I don't think so.

272
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,440
Shouldn't exist.

273
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,660
I'm with the farmers.

274
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,060
I stand with the farmers of Champagne, France.

275
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,060
I don't think we've looked into it at all.

276
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:12,020
They're probably like huge landowners

277
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:12,940
who don't give a fuck.

278
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,780
Yeah, actually fuck them, you're right.

279
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,020
Yeah, fuck champagne.

280
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,620
Also, it makes my tummy hurt.

281
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:20,020
Keith Vigno, what are you doing?

282
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:22,060
Keith is kind of disoriented,

283
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:26,940
but just is running away from the explosion of the truck.

284
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,660
Well, you landed directly on Jimmy Sanders.

285
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:30,500
Oh, yeah.

286
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,420
Landed directly on him, and he's like,

287
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:34,700
number four, just get on top of me with the,

288
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:35,700
yeah, it's not even.

289
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,700
I stand up and I look at him,

290
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,600
and since I know he's conscious or whatever,

291
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,300
I kind of help him up,

292
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,780
and then I start running towards Gary.

293
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:47,300
Okay, so as you reach for his hand,

294
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:50,140
he's only looking past you and behind you

295
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:52,380
at the ooze that is chasing you.

296
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,340
So you can't run if you want to help him up.

297
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,580
You can only help him up.

298
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,260
Okay, I help him up then.

299
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,680
Oh, well that's very kind of you.

300
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,060
Can all three of us see the ooze currently?

301
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:01,940
Currently.

302
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:02,780
Okay.

303
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,540
If Keith is helping Jimmy up

304
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,980
and trying to get him to Gary,

305
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,660
I would like to do the same thing

306
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,480
and aid him and help that be quicker.

307
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,520
Oh, absolutely, then it is done,

308
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:16,540
and Tyler is immediately just following Clark Bishop.

309
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,420
Tyler is right on the heels of Clark Bishop,

310
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:24,940
and you are all running toward Gary Daley,

311
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:27,860
who has popped his head up out of this storm drain

312
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:30,820
with a beautiful bright yellow shirt

313
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,400
underneath a denim jacket,

314
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:36,860
which you can only see him from right above the nips up,

315
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,140
because he's hanging up out of here.

316
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:40,100
I put my arms out in front of the other two,

317
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,620
and I'm like, hold on, fellas,

318
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,920
we ain't got no way of knowing he ain't an it.

319
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:50,260
An it, an it, an it, it, from the movie It.

320
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,620
Oh, yeah.

321
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,980
Well, he doesn't look like a clown to me.

322
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:56,980
Are you Gary Daley, or are you an it?

323
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,460
Hurry up and get on down here.

324
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:01,440
We got me and Gary, and we got some others,

325
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,460
but we're hiding, and we need to save you.

326
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,980
Obviously, Keith, I mean,

327
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,340
Keith needs to get down here, especially.

328
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,180
Why me?

329
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,580
Everybody wants Keith.

330
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:12,340
Oh, well, yeah, because he, yeah, they're after you.

331
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,780
Gary, tell us something only Gary would know.

332
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:18,420
I did a magic spell on you to give you luck.

333
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,620
Come on, hurry up.

334
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,980
Yeah, good, that's what I was looking for, all right.

335
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,740
I run towards it, and I kind of like.

336
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,700
Wait, Keith, even if it is Gary,

337
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,780
we don't know what his intentions are anymore.

338
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:28,620
We've been gone for a while.

339
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:31,100
It sounds like everybody in town's with this daddy guy.

340
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,660
As he's saying that, I'm slide tackling

341
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:36,940
like you would on a soccer field down into the storm train.

342
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:39,860
Oh, hell yeah, do your shorts like balloon up out,

343
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:42,900
like give you some drag to slow you down

344
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,260
so you can slip in easy?

345
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,100
Yep.

346
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,180
So you can slip in easy.

347
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:49,660
And as soon as I'm in, I process what Clark just said,

348
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,820
and I look at Gary, I'm like, ugh.

349
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:56,140
No, it's cool, we're hiding from the FCFC,

350
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,900
they're scary fuckers.

351
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,820
That cane he's just taking over town,

352
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,340
we gotta hide down here, otherwise they'll find us.

353
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:04,540
And then immediately is like, oh shit,

354
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,860
and closes his eyes with his hand.

355
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,220
Gary, could you see it?

356
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,100
Well, I didn't wanna see it,

357
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,900
because then it'll come.

358
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,420
It comes to those who have seen it?

359
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,940
If you're looking at it, hold on,

360
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,020
get the fuck down here, get on down.

361
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,820
I'm helping Drew down there, I'm getting down in there,

362
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:21,140
and when I get down in there, I'm picking Drew back up,

363
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,260
getting him just back on my shoulder so that we're mobile.

364
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:25,860
And Tyler does that adorable thing that dogs do

365
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,260
when they crawl, because it's so cute.

366
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,900
Their paws just kind of move,

367
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,900
and then just jumps down into it.

368
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,180
And once you guys are all down there,

369
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:37,180
you got Jimmy Sanders down there as well,

370
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:40,780
and he's just not paying attention to anything.

371
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:43,900
He immediately just starts stepping into the sewage water.

372
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:47,780
Basically, I'm seeing it as this tunnel that you're now in.

373
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,140
You gotta walk away on the right,

374
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,940
you gotta walk away on the far left,

375
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:56,140
you've got a sewage waterway moving slowly

376
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,720
in between the two pathways,

377
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:02,180
and then we've got an arched tunnel roof made out of stone

378
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:04,560
that leads off into the darkness ahead,

379
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,300
and you can't see where it leads to.

380
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:11,540
And Gary looks at John Lee Pettymore the third,

381
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:16,300
and he's like, you, you're, hi Gary,

382
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:19,500
this is actually John Lee Pettymore the fourth

383
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,680
in the body of my daddy.

384
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:26,060
Obviously, that's a lot to take in and a lot to believe,

385
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,340
but I feel like you're seeing the goo monster out there,

386
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,420
and you know what's going on,

387
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:33,820
so you can probably just move past this, right?

388
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,380
And accept that it's happening.

389
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:38,220
I don't like that at all,

390
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:41,700
and I especially don't like that you've, you're dripping.

391
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,060
You know you're dripping, right?

392
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:45,580
Well, I was in, yeah, dripping water.

393
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:47,140
No siree.

394
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:51,420
Your nose, your eyes, your ears, your mouth.

395
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,940
You got the goo coming out of you,

396
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,420
but it doesn't seem to be,

397
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:57,740
it's like small enough to not be at,

398
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:00,180
and he like, he wants to poke at it,

399
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,980
but he's not quite poking at it,

400
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:04,260
and he's like, honestly, if I could just not look at you,

401
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,780
that would be for the best for me personally,

402
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:09,640
because I am, and he's rubbing his fingers

403
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,340
against his other fingers,

404
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,380
and he starts looking at his hands,

405
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,660
and he's like, yep.

406
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,220
All right, you're dripping.

407
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,740
Yep, just a little bit, just enough.

408
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:21,500
Yeah, does that allow you to see the goo?

409
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,340
Yep.

410
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:23,220
Oh, interesting.

411
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,300
I was gonna clarify,

412
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,540
when he was talking about the dripping,

413
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:26,540
we didn't see it, right?

414
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:28,900
No, am I the only one you see it coming out of?

415
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,540
And he looks at the rest of you,

416
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:32,860
and he really avoids eye contact

417
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,860
with John Lee Pettymore III from here on out,

418
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,300
and he's like, okay, so,

419
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:39,540
and he kind of puts his hand up over your face,

420
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:43,180
and he's like, okay, so you are the missing

421
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:48,180
John Lee Pettymore III, who inside of you

422
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:51,220
is our John Lee Pettymore, who's been around,

423
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:54,300
and do I have all that right?

424
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,060
I nod at him and confirm.

425
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,980
More or less, yes.

426
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,460
Yeah, Gary, he's telling the truth.

427
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,460
But, Clark Bishop, you're not like

428
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,460
your parents aren't inside of you?

429
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:05,540
Nope, I'm 100% Clark right now.

430
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,740
No, but he does have his own fun thing

431
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:11,080
with vis-a-vis an older, you know,

432
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,440
I'm not gonna spoil it, but it's kooky.

433
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,180
What's his reaction to that?

434
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,480
I have a human of 30.

435
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,800
Can I see if I catch anything in his face?

436
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,040
Yeah, go ahead and roll.

437
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,560
I rolled a six.

438
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,920
Oh, shit, yeah.

439
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,860
No, giving him that much information

440
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:30,640
about old Clark Bishop, you don't notice anything.

441
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,100
Okay.

442
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,880
Gary, I'm still me, I'm still Keith.

443
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,240
And Drew is actually Kerry Pages.

444
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,440
Oh, yeah, when you were asking about that.

445
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,240
Fuck, yeah, we forgot to mention that.

446
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,420
I'm sorry, what?

447
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,600
John Three's actually John Four.

448
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,160
Me and Clark are who we are,

449
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,840
and Drew is Kerry inside of Drew's body.

450
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,080
Yep, he's got it right.

451
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,120
And I don't mean to be rude,

452
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,040
and he starts petting Tyler,

453
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,200
and he's like, who are you, my little fella?

454
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,340
This is Kerry Pages' dog, Tyler.

455
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:06,320
And Tyler is being very attentive

456
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,760
to the body of Drew Andrews,

457
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,200
which is still being held by Clark Bishop.

458
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,160
Yeah, see how it's focused on Drew there?

459
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,440
I think it's because it's,

460
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:20,440
well, Drew has the soul, or the mind, or presence,

461
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,440
however you want to define it,

462
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,040
of Councilwoman Kerry Pages,

463
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,200
because of the church. Or the baguette.

464
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,320
You know, it might be the baguette that he's got,

465
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:30,000
because, you know, it's a long, long baguette,

466
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,500
but you gotta cut it in thirds

467
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,860
in order to make an eight-inch sandwich,

468
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,480
which is what you're gonna wanna get.

469
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:39,080
Yeah, and Jimmy's just, he's not right right now, so.

470
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,440
But he is Jimmy.

471
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,240
What's going on with the pastor and everything in town?

472
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,760
We've just got back to town,

473
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,800
already seen some weird shit

474
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,280
that I can't make complete sense of yet.

475
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,940
What are you doing down here, even?

476
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:54,000
Gary Daley flips a Zippo,

477
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
and you see his very brightly colored yellow button down.

478
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,920
He's got a denim jacket over the top of it,

479
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,800
and he's like,

480
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:07,120
I have been hoping that you guys would come back

481
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,720
ever since yesterday.

482
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,200
What happened yesterday?

483
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,660
Everything went to shit.

484
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:20,160
We're down here hiding because that crazy lunatic

485
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:25,160
put up a wall of water and fish around the church,

486
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:28,280
and has taken to calling himself Daddy,

487
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,420
and he has held them all convinced

488
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:32,440
that he can go back in time

489
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,500
as long as he can get Keith Vick.

490
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,800
You guys are looking at me like you already know all this.

491
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,960
Well, we've seen the wall.

492
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,160
Yeah, we've heard all that.

493
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,560
I mean, as soon as that went up,

494
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,920
he got a lot of followers,

495
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:46,400
and he's been interpreting people's dreams,

496
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,280
and they've just been following him

497
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,880
to the end of the earth, basically,

498
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,320
and they'll do whatever he wants.

499
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,480
Do you know exactly what he wants with me?

500
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,800
I just know that he thinks that he needs you

501
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,760
to go back in time somehow.

502
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,420
Okay.

503
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:03,340
Well, I'm not really trying to help him out.

504
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:04,900
Are you guys on the internet?

505
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,780
Just a crazy question,

506
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,860
but you don't strike me as people

507
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:11,140
who have a lot of points in computer science.

508
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,460
Heh heh heh.

509
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:15,020
Uh, weird way to put it,

510
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:18,480
but I would say I took a class in high school.

511
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,740
I have email.

512
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,340
I have email.

513
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:24,100
I've got a Facebook.

514
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,660
I've got a telephone at the house.

515
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:27,500
I could maybe call somebody.

516
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:32,500
So I found a website, a blog post from Harold Dorsey

517
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,860
that got wiped off the internet.

518
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:35,980
Nobody could've found it

519
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,940
if you just would've Googled around.

520
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:38,820
It got wiped.

521
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,060
Somebody took it off, but...

522
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,380
What'd it say?

523
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:42,820
See for yourself.

524
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:46,340
And Gary Daley holds up a phone.

525
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:50,020
He's got a screenshot of this blog.

526
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:55,020
So you can go to what'sbehinddorsey.blogspot.com.

527
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,060
Okay.

528
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:01,260
Holy shit.

529
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,860
Okay, woo.

530
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:04,200
So for the listeners out there,

531
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,940
you can go to what'sbehinddorsey.blogspot.com.

532
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:09,900
Dorsey is D-O-R-S-E-Y,

533
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:14,900
and Harold is and always was H-A-R-R-E-L-L.

534
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:19,420
People were talking like it was Harold.

535
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,460
It was never Harold.

536
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:21,860
Yeah, cause that's a name

537
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:24,860
that people are familiar with.

538
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:25,700
Yeah.

539
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:30,820
Zach says it was set up in May, 2017.

540
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:33,900
Did you really register a blogger account

541
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,680
three years ago for this campaign?

542
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,540
Yeah.

543
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,380
That's dope.

544
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,220
Wow.

545
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,020
Did you just know you wanted to do something like this

546
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:42,500
or did you actually set one up for Harold Dorsey?

547
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,780
It was for Harold Dorsey.

548
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:45,620
That's dope.

549
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:46,520
This is dope as fuck.

550
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,800
Okay, so for those of you who are driving

551
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,020
or doing the dishes

552
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:53,680
or you're wearing AirPods and you're pooping

553
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,800
and your phone is in the other room,

554
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:59,000
if you go to what'sbehinddorsey.blogspot.com,

555
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,780
you'll find a blog that is entitled

556
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,500
What's Behind Dorsey?

557
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,920
A True Story in a False City.

558
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:11,920
And there is a single blog posted on Monday, December 3rd,

559
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:16,960
and it is entitled Operation San Ferra Blum

560
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,760
and a Rogue Police Chief in Contention.

561
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,960
Followers of my story know I am not afraid

562
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,440
of rocking the boat.

563
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,120
I was fired from the city star

564
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,560
for threatening to self-publish my expose

565
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,040
on the glass crime family

566
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:34,120
after a blasphemous night of depravity

567
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:37,540
undercover at the glass compound's robot-inclusive

568
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:40,760
fight club called the Scrap Pit.

569
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,920
Lots of people know about the Scrap Pit.

570
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:45,680
The real party, for those in the know,

571
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:48,720
is even more indescribably profane,

572
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,360
a room filled with city officials, judges, politicians,

573
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:57,640
celebrities lovingly referred to by its patrons

574
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:00,460
as the Den of Sin.

575
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:04,040
The Den of Sin offers more than just bloodsport.

576
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,960
It is torture.

577
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:09,720
Malnourished preteens are trapped in a hanging cage,

578
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,800
forced to fight to the death

579
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:16,720
as the ceiling lowers to meet the floor slowly but steadily.

580
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,600
In one such match, I witness the two gaunt children

581
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:24,460
hold hands in solidarity with each other,

582
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:27,040
accepting their demise.

583
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,700
The offended roar of the booing crowd

584
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:32,680
was quickly replaced with lustful cheers

585
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:36,720
as the hanging cage performed its singular trick

586
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,240
like a French press or a citrus juicer.

587
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,680
The Den of Sin earned its name

588
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:46,200
as the congregation of monsters flocked

589
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,800
to the metallic smelling dark red waterfall.

590
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:53,200
Well, I've somehow survived that mess.

591
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,380
A target on my back, sure, but that's just business.

592
00:25:56,380 --> 00:26:01,000
However, I feel curiously out of my depth on this new case.

593
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,120
Most of us don't think about the small town of contention

594
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,240
about an hour west of here,

595
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,520
but it is recently proven we should pay attention.

596
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:13,440
By now, you may have heard about some of the disappearances

597
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,720
and the animal-filled creeks,

598
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,440
but what you may not know

599
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:21,440
is the chief of police recently contacted me, quote,

600
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:26,440
to open up the eyes and minds of those who live in the city.

601
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:31,140
She asked if I knew anything about the circle of knowledge,

602
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:33,760
Operation Sanfera Blum,

603
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,680
or the flowers that make their home

604
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,480
all over our downtown here in the city.

605
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,280
She asked if I knew anything about BarCorp,

606
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:44,360
its subsidiaries, or the Shell Corporation,

607
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,920
which owns the company, which owns the company,

608
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:50,480
which owns the company, which owns BarCorp.

609
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,640
She asked if I knew anything about the mill

610
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,720
on the other side of the city,

611
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,520
and she asked if I knew her father, Jim Cook.

612
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,560
So I began digging,

613
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:03,640
and I began following Jim Cook around the city.

614
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,840
That man can spot a tail,

615
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,520
but he couldn't spot whoever it was

616
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,320
that caught him in an alley two nights ago.

617
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,480
I'm worried I am next.

618
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,320
I'm even more worried that Maggie Cook

619
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,680
is now too spooked to speak on the record.

620
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,920
Chief Maggie Cook was passionate,

621
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:23,440
irate, and eager,

622
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,320
and then nothing.

623
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,880
We were supposed to meet in person last night,

624
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,840
December 2nd, no word.

625
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,440
I received a message this morning

626
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,960
changing the time and location of our meeting.

627
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,880
If I don't update the blog by tonight,

628
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:42,360
please begin the search by questioning

629
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:45,720
Contention Chief of Police, Maggie Cook.

630
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,240
So you guys' eyes look back up,

631
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,160
and Gary Daley's just like,

632
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:59,480
what the fuck does that mean?

633
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,480
I read this, and I was like, what?

634
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:05,200
Which part confuses you more,

635
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,240
the Denison stuff or the Maggie stuff?

636
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,400
Well, I assume that the city gets up to some weird stuff,

637
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,200
but here in Contention,

638
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,160
to have her connected to all those things

639
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:19,120
that it was talking about in here, I don't know.

640
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,680
No, we can pretty much tell you that,

641
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:26,560
yeah, that's all basically true.

642
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,920
What Maggie's involved in,

643
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:31,680
it goes way farther than Contention itself.

644
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:35,520
Guys, what is, like with the flowers

645
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,880
and all that in his blog post,

646
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,920
one of those myriad creatures was hollering at us

647
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:45,120
about that Samfaro Blom, I don't...

648
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,680
Keith, you pretended to know what it was,

649
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,880
and we didn't know what it was.

650
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,600
Clark, you've kind of been in touch with Maggie,

651
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,880
haven't you?

652
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,080
Yeah, yeah.

653
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,400
Has she said anything about her dad, or?

654
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,880
I mean, she showed me around her dad's house.

655
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,360
I was holding his book when she found me.

656
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:03,000
She asked why I was searching through her daddy's book.

657
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:03,840
I remember that.

658
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,160
She hasn't said much about Jim himself,

659
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,840
but just the stuff that we found

660
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:12,600
putting dots together in the carkled hole.

661
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,440
Yeah, I mean, I don't know.

662
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:17,240
It's just odd that he was following Jim around

663
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:20,440
and that Maggie said to open up the eyes of the city.

664
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:20,840
It just...

665
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:26,360
You know this bit here about Jim dying in an alley

666
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,560
two nights before?

667
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,060
Yeah.

668
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:32,440
We just found out, I believe it was his birthday,

669
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,360
December 1st, and every birthday,

670
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,680
he goes to that pie hole in the city.

671
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,760
So there's a chance we could figure out

672
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,160
if there's footage in the alley back there,

673
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:44,040
we might be able to see who got him.

674
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:44,760
That's true.

675
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,560
It's a great lead.

676
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:49,240
Well, I mean, what can we do?

677
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,720
Can we do anything with this information right now?

678
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:54,600
So it lines up with everything we've been kind of thinking, right?

679
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:58,200
That Jim Cook, he mentioned in that note

680
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,640
that he knew he had a tail.

681
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:02,200
It was a round face man with glasses or something like that,

682
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,840
which we all kind of at the time thought it was Harold.

683
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:05,880
So we figured that out.

684
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,680
Maggie was turning on Jim.

685
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:11,480
Maggie was spilling secrets to Harold about Jim.

686
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,240
That's what we've gathered from this.

687
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:13,640
Yeah.

688
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:18,600
Oh, and it said that she changed the time and location of their meeting.

689
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,240
They must have changed it to her house.

690
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:24,040
She changed it to her house from somewhere else, correct?

691
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,840
That's where you found Harold, right?

692
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:29,080
Harold was at Maggie's house.

693
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,440
And I couldn't save him.

694
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,600
He got a text that sent him to Maggie's house

695
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,240
instead of some other meeting place that they were going to meet.

696
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,680
I don't know what to do with that information,

697
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,440
but that's what I'm gathering here now.

698
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:41,320
Well, I mean, before we got down here,

699
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,320
we were kind of on our way to Maggie's house.

700
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,520
Yeah, we kind of were.

701
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:47,320
Yeah, Maggie's house is right on Bean's pond.

702
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:50,920
Do you think you could get us to the pond through these tunnels?

703
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,800
Well, yeah.

704
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,280
I can get you anywhere you want, basically.

705
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:58,680
Contingent is a mining town.

706
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:02,760
And they basically, when the mine shored up,

707
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,360
they took all the old tunnels

708
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,200
that they were using to get around,

709
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,720
and they bricked them all up

710
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:11,000
and made a very, very modern sewage system.

711
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:15,320
And so we can get pretty much anywhere we want around here

712
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,080
through them tunnels about there.

713
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:20,520
Well, we've been trying to get to the pond for a little while.

714
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,640
Like Ninja Turtles.

715
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,360
I'm Raphael, obviously.

716
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,680
Of course, of course.

717
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,760
You're whichever turtle you need to be.

718
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:32,520
So you're walking south through this tunnel for about five minutes

719
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:35,160
before you make it to an underground chamber

720
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:40,040
where Gary Daley and Harry Klinker have set up a makeshift campsite.

721
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:43,640
This room is square and roughly 30 yards across,

722
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:48,920
with four concrete columns placed evenly about 10 yards from each other.

723
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,480
The ground is mostly dry,

724
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,240
though there are puddles scattered about

725
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:56,120
where the concrete floor has eroded away a bit.

726
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:59,800
There are two tents on opposite ends of the room

727
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:03,320
and a luminous camping lantern lighting your view

728
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,000
from the very, very center of the room.

729
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:09,880
There is slight commotion by the far tent as you enter this space.

730
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:13,560
Mildred Mitchell, upon seeing your group,

731
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:18,360
is fleeing into the portable canvas shelter and zipping up the flap.

732
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:25,320
As a woman you do not recognize questions her from outside the outdoor domicile.

733
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:30,520
And you would remember Mildred Mitchell is the grandma of Toby B. Mitchell

734
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:33,160
who lived across from John Peters,

735
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:38,440
who I believe called in to say that John Peters' door was swinging open

736
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:41,400
and his mail was piling up in the first episode.

737
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,840
And just to remind listeners,

738
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,920
what is the significance of all that,

739
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:50,440
and could you tie any loose ends together there?

740
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:56,440
So you see her hop into this tent and a woman you don't recognize

741
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,280
is on the outside kind of questioning her,

742
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:04,600
but closer to you you see a man sitting up against one of the concrete columns reading a book.

743
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:11,160
And you recognize him as Casey Kristoff, the janitor of the First Church of Contention.

744
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:15,320
He has a pencil-thin mustache and a mullet.

745
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:18,360
His beer gut is spilling out of his Van Halen t-shirt

746
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,680
and over his cutoff shorts,

747
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:24,840
which has been his outfit of choice for the past 30 years.

748
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:31,080
Thanks to B. Weldon from Salt Lake City for Casey Kristoff.

749
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:35,400
You too can create an NPC in location that might get used in the show

750
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:41,320
if you support us on Patreon at the $10 level of the contention citizens or higher.

751
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:44,600
And then you see Harry Klinker sitting outside the nearest tent.

752
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,560
And as soon as you guys walk in there he stands up.

753
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,000
He's clearly relieved.

754
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,760
He's all over his face when he sees Gary in there with you guys.

755
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:56,520
And you all enter into this underground temporary home.

756
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:59,080
You should disconnect and reconnect.

757
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:02,520
I didn't want to stop your flow, but you're a super robot.

758
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,760
Like right as you started that you went super robot.

759
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,840
I will give it a go.

760
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,600
Okay, so how many tents are there?

761
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,040
Just one?

762
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,880
I think just one that she ran into.

763
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,520
Am I still a robot?

764
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,240
You're back!

765
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:16,200
Keep talking.

766
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:19,000
Am I still a robot with my mouth in my words?

767
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,360
Because when I talk I don't lightly swerve.

768
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,200
I swerve hard to the right.

769
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,960
Then I keep that shit up.

770
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:29,000
And I go in circles till I throw up.

771
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:30,620
Nice.

772
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,080
You ran up with up, but yeah.

773
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,320
Okay, so two tents.

774
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:40,680
One across the room from you where Mildred Mitchell hopped into.

775
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,920
And there was a woman standing outside.

776
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:45,960
And the other tent where Harry Klinker is sitting outside of.

777
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,280
He stood up to greet you as you walked in.

778
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,640
Hey boys, oh my god.

779
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,480
It's been a crazy couple days, no see.

780
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,280
It's good to see you.

781
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,840
Sorry, the other guy's name was Kristoff what?

782
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,040
Casey Kristoff.

783
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,560
Casey Kristoff, okay, sorry.

784
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,240
Oh my god, yes Harry.

785
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,360
I found them.

786
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,480
They were just, they were out there.

787
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:04,040
They'd wrecked and I mean it was coming for them.

788
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,480
Goo was coming for them, you know.

789
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:08,360
And thankfully they're here and we're fine.

790
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:11,000
I showed them the Dorsey block spot.

791
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,640
And yeah, we're just, oh boy.

792
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:17,800
So is this your guys' like home base down here or?

793
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:22,280
Yeah, we've been trying to hide from that old Pastor Adam Kane.

794
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:27,880
Really, really is not being very good to the people, you know.

795
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:33,800
Yeah, how many people do you think he's got on his side up there?

796
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,760
God, I don't know.

797
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:37,400
Maybe, maybe a hundred.

798
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,000
And what about you guys down here?

799
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,600
Is this all of us?

800
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:47,400
And Harry and Gary kind of look back at the three individuals down here,

801
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,760
one of which is hiding in a tent.

802
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,240
Yeah, this is, this is us.

803
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:56,520
I mean for now, we did have, we have a code outside of clinkers, you know.

804
00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:00,680
If people can read it, it says tunnels and they can get down here.

805
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,120
What sort of code?

806
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,280
Well, it's a pretty fun code.

807
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:07,000
I just mean how do you keep bad folks from reading it?

808
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,480
They both look at each other and furrow their brows with like a panicked look.

809
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,760
So I, I recognize most of you down here.

810
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,040
Who, who's that?

811
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:21,880
And I kind of tilt my head at the lady I don't recognize.

812
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,080
Oh, that's Clara.

813
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,120
She's from the city.

814
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:29,000
How, how'd she get hooked up in this mess?

815
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,760
No, I mean you can ask her yourself, but she had some friends in contention.

816
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:36,280
She was hanging out with when all this started and she kind of got stuck here.

817
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,920
Where her, where her friends at?

818
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:43,320
Unfortunately, they, they got lost to, you know, Kane's movement.

819
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,360
Clara, Clara.

820
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:53,000
This attractive woman in her mid-40s looks over at you guys and she's got large tortoiseshell glasses

821
00:36:53,000 --> 00:37:01,080
and as she walks up, you see that she has blood red lipstick and even though it's freezing cold

822
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:07,000
outside, she is wearing a sleeveless shirt and you see a full sleeve tattoo.

823
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:12,680
And the tattoo is of a robed figure holding a ball of light.

824
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:21,000
Clara Blankenship was created by Annie Beat, another citizen of contention over on the Patreon.

825
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:21,560
Super cool.

826
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,840
Annie, you are okay.

827
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:29,960
When I see her tattoo, I kind of look at the other two officers and

828
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,480
like kind of wide-eyed.

829
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,240
I, I wide-eyed back.

830
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,720
Guys, it's the cover of Led Zeppelin IV.

831
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,720
Doesn't that have a guy with sticks on it?

832
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,680
Did you guys just call me over here for-

833
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,320
Uh, yeah.

834
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,560
Hold on, I'm googling that.

835
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,920
What's, what's your deal, Clara?

836
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:56,520
That's a real interesting tattoo you got there.

837
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,360
Is that from any kind of Zeppelin album?

838
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:02,200
You know that Stairway to Heaven poster with the guy on the road with the light?

839
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:06,040
No, this is, this is based off a dream I had a few years ago.

840
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:06,920
About Zeppelin?

841
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,160
You guys have been having these crazy dreams, right?

842
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:13,480
I mean, I've been talking to everyone about him and we all seem to be having these absurd

843
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:13,960
dreams.

844
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:19,480
See, back then, this dream, it was just this, this robed figure with this ball of light

845
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:24,040
and he was walking just a long path and he was carrying this ball of light.

846
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:28,200
But recently, I've been having this dream where he's pulling the ball of light out of

847
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,000
a television?

848
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:34,760
It's, it's so weird because before, it was as if there was, you know, it was like all

849
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:38,840
dirt and stuff, so I didn't really expect technology to be a part of these dreams, but

850
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:42,120
you know, some people are having dreams that are in the modern world, some in the future

851
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:46,440
even, and you know, it's, it's just, have you, what are the dreams you, I assume you

852
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,320
guys have been having dreams.

853
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,520
How long have you been in contingent?

854
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:51,320
Just like out of that, that book, isn't it?

855
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:51,800
The book?

856
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,280
Which book?

857
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,560
I study a lot of occult books.

858
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,080
Is there a specific book you're talking about?

859
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,680
Looking at the two officers.

860
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,200
It's, it's similar for sure.

861
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:02,040
The, the, the thing we saw though, had the light emitting from a mouth.

862
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,120
It wasn't being held like an orb.

863
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:07,160
It's odd, but you've been having dreams about this.

864
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:09,720
I mean, everybody has weird dreams.

865
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:12,520
Harry over there told us you were in town visiting some friends.

866
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,400
Who were you visiting?

867
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,520
The Dudley's?

868
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,720
Just some friends of mine.

869
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,920
They were, unfortunately, they were persuaded.

870
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:24,920
They, see, they, they lost their cat to all this mess and unfortunately when, when they

871
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:30,360
were promised an option to, I don't know if you've heard, the pastor is saying he

872
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,840
can turn back time if you follow him.

873
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:36,680
So, you know, they, they really want their cat back.

874
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,720
They think that's the only way to...

875
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:41,320
Their cat's probably just in the river there with all the other cats and dogs.

876
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,960
Have we encountered the Dudley's before or is this new?

877
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,800
Uh, you would know, there's just some...

878
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,800
But we haven't like ran into them.

879
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,920
Not in the podcast, no.

880
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,760
They're just contention citizens.

881
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,040
Did you tell them to check the river?

882
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,960
That's where a lot of them are ending up.

883
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:59,800
Well, see, the issue is, is that yesterday the, the rivers were all emptied.

884
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:05,960
Uh, both the creek, the pond, everything was emptied by the collectors.

885
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:11,720
So they took all the animals back to the FCFC, which is what they're calling this bullshit

886
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:11,960
now.

887
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,560
Did they get their cat back then?

888
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,040
I don't know.

889
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:14,920
I haven't seen him since.

890
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,440
I'm not going behind that fish wall.

891
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,640
Are you kidding me?

892
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:18,840
Have you seen that shit?

893
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,840
I've got to let Murphy in real quick.

894
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,840
He's got to go behind the fish wall to get Murphy.

895
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:39,720
Gary and Harry, I mean, we were, uh, about to go investigate the pond.

896
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:43,880
Uh, I think there might be something at the bottom of it, but Claire, you said that all

897
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,240
the water got drained out of it.

898
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:45,960
Is that right?

899
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:46,440
Yeah.

900
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,640
I don't know how they did it.

901
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:54,200
I also don't know how there's a floating, like, wall of water surrounding the entire

902
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,080
campus of the church.

903
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:59,720
Well, I'm sure there's a solid explanation for it, and that's kind of what we're trying

904
00:40:59,720 --> 00:40:59,880
to get to the bottom of.

905
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:06,120
I'm the head archivist and director of the City County Historical Commission, and I've

906
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:11,080
worked there for about 18 years, and I don't know if you've studied much history, but I

907
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:13,480
certainly, sorry, this kind of sounds like I'm being a dick.

908
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:18,280
I'm really trying not to be, but historically speaking, I don't remember this ever happening.

909
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:21,640
Yeah, but I mean, like, they do this kind of stuff all the time in Vegas.

910
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:22,200
Oh.

911
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:22,920
Bellagio.

912
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:25,480
It's a Bellagio sort of situation, I'd imagine.

913
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:28,520
Does the water normally stay up the whole time?

914
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,680
With lights and mirrors, yeah.

915
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:31,400
Magnets.

916
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,120
Wow.

917
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,040
I guess I need to go to Las Vegas then.

918
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,600
It's not all it's cracked up to be.

919
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:40,440
Hey, Zach, when you were describing Casey, and you said he was a janitor of the church,

920
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,960
do we know that in character?

921
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:44,120
Yeah, you would know that he's the janitor, yeah.

922
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,640
He's been the janitor for years.

923
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:48,200
I'd like to go over, talk to him too, if you want.

924
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,200
Okay, roll a humant for me right off the bat.

925
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:50,840
Can I help?

926
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,200
Are you all going over?

927
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,080
Yeah, I'm gonna go with him.

928
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:54,920
We'll bring Clara and Harry and Gary.

929
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,920
I mean, you don't have to disengage with Clara, I was just saying.

930
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,520
We'll call him over to us, I guess.

931
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,000
Uh, I failed.

932
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,360
A 92 on a 30.

933
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:04,520
37 on a 80.

934
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:05,960
Yeah, they'll do it.

935
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:08,120
He's not reading right now.

936
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:15,160
He's listening in, and he was very intrigued when this group of people walked in.

937
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:19,000
Also, Clark, what did you do with the body of Drew Carey?

938
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,120
I'm probably still holding it.

939
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,360
He's still over the top?

940
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:27,480
Okay, so Tyler's back paws are just like, his front paws are on your back,

941
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:30,760
and he's just like sniffing at Drew Carey this whole time,

942
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:36,520
and Jimmy Sanders is just like wandering kind of in circles around the room mumbling to himself.

943
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:41,240
I want to set Drew up against a pillar, and I don't know if it's a roll or not,

944
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:42,840
but try and see if I can revive.

945
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:45,000
Yeah, go ahead and roll first aid.

946
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:49,560
I pass.

947
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:51,480
A four on a 30.

948
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:57,400
Oh, yeah, I've got some smelling salts actually here for you there, Clark.

949
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,080
That's exactly what I could use, thank you.

950
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:02,600
Yeah, I was gonna ask, but I thought that that would be odd.

951
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,440
Yeah, just a passed roll.

952
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,600
You know, opens up all sorts of doors.

953
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:15,560
Carey, you with us?

954
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:16,040
You with us?

955
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:16,760
Yeah, hey.

956
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:24,840
And then just staring up at you and staring all around this room, Drew Carey is confused.

957
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:27,480
Carey, we died in the car crash and we're in hell.

958
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:33,000
We dragged you down here with us, and we turned Tyler into a hell dog,

959
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,360
and it's gonna nibble at your feet for all of eternity.

960
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:46,760
Tyler's just like licking Drew Carey's, you know, face and feet back and forth.

961
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:48,440
There's more where that came from.

962
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:49,960
Oh, hey there, Tyler.

963
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,160
Oh my God, it's so good.

964
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:55,240
And Drew starts crying, and it's just like, thank you.

965
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:58,520
Oh my God, thank you so much for keeping him safe.

966
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:00,280
I lead the dog off.

967
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:02,840
If you don't mind, I'd just like to talk to my dog, please.

968
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:03,720
Thank you very much.

969
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:06,280
You can talk to Tyler after you answer some of our questions.

970
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:07,400
Boys, can you help me out here?

971
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:10,120
Tyler, shut up.

972
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:10,520
Tyler!

973
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:24,760
If you're listening, write in an NPC with like special powers and they can help us.

974
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:32,600
This is Bubba Jenkins and he knows everything.

975
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,680
You can ask him anything and he knows the answer.

976
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:43,240
Clara Blankenship, this NPC from Annie B was the first NPC sent in.

977
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:52,200
And I believe in the description, it did say that she owns all of Silas Cole's journals.

978
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:56,360
Okay, so she was trying to help us.

979
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,040
She literally did exactly that.

980
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:02,520
That's great.

981
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:03,320
That's really funny.

982
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:05,080
Was the tattoo written in on there too?

983
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:06,360
The tattoo was on there, yeah.

984
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:06,760
Cool.

985
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:07,240
I love it.

986
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:14,840
Oh, who's a good boy?

987
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:15,640
Who's a good boy?

988
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:16,840
I love you, Tyler.

989
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:18,920
Carrie, you took a big hit back there.

990
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:20,600
Are you feeling all right?

991
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:23,480
No, not at all, but it doesn't even matter.

992
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:24,280
Everything is fine.

993
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:24,760
Thank you.

994
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:29,560
Now that the love of my life is here with me and everything is fine.

995
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:33,080
Your original mission was to bring us back to the church, is that right?

996
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:33,480
Yes.

997
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:37,960
And was that with the explicit purpose of getting Keith back to the church or was it

998
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:39,240
all three of us at that point?

999
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:44,680
Well, I mean, he doesn't want you alive, Clark.

1000
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:50,520
And John, even though you're not technically John, I believe, thank you very much.

1001
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:55,240
I think that, you know, you're John inside of your dad and that's fine.

1002
00:45:55,240 --> 00:46:01,160
But you two, you three technically are responsible for the death of his family.

1003
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:06,680
I don't know if you were aware of that when you just crashed a car and then bailed out

1004
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:07,800
of our town.

1005
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:09,000
That's not what happened.

1006
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:17,160
We told a very reliable canine entity to tell the town people what was going on while we

1007
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:17,640
were gone.

1008
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:21,240
Now, if that didn't get communicated to the town, I'm sorry.

1009
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,480
I'm sorry, but we sent it into the station.

1010
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:25,960
You think I don't listen to 694.2?

1011
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:26,920
Have you heard Kudzu?

1012
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:32,280
That new song is a real banger.

1013
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:36,440
I just played this morning for the first time and it blew me away.

1014
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:41,080
Okay, well, Kerry, we might have you just stay here until we go to the-

1015
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:42,520
Why do you keep calling him Kerry?

1016
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:49,800
That's Councilwoman Kerry Pages who used the magic slash haunted radio to swap bodies

1017
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:53,800
with our good friend, Ru.

1018
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:57,880
I don't know who you guys are all looking at, but all of their eyes are very wide right

1019
00:46:57,880 --> 00:46:58,380
now.

1020
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:06,680
She's been working with a pastor trying to trick us into going back to the church, but

1021
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:08,200
we figured her out.

1022
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:17,640
And if y'all don't still believe us, why would Councilwoman Pages' dog Tyler run up to Drew

1023
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:18,520
Andrews?

1024
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:19,640
Yeah, see, exactly.

1025
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:22,040
It's like dogs only like one person.

1026
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:23,560
I dramatically let the dog go.

1027
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:35,000
In the style of those movies where the young boy and the evil guy of the movie are on opposite

1028
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:40,760
sides of a dog and they're both calling to it, it goes to the, I guess, the evil person

1029
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:43,240
in this situation, technically, from your perspective.

1030
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:49,800
But Tyler runs to the body of Drew Andrews and Kerry Pages grabs it around the neck once

1031
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:50,600
more.

1032
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:52,360
Oh my God, yes, Tyler.

1033
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:52,920
I love you.

1034
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:53,560
I love you.

1035
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:54,760
And it's like, thank you.

1036
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:55,480
Thank you, John.

1037
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:59,480
I know you didn't want to do that, but it's just, this is my everything.

1038
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:03,000
Harry, it's just that everything is fucked.

1039
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,160
You know how we thought that most things were fucked?

1040
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:06,760
It seems that everything is fucked.

1041
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:08,680
Yeah, yeah.

1042
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:14,120
Yeah, Gary, you've always been kind of open to the idea that things were hinky in the

1043
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:14,920
world, weren't you?

1044
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:16,360
Yeah, it's a great word for it.

1045
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:18,520
Is this ticking off any boxes?

1046
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:22,120
Like, oh yeah, I read about when body switching happened in that one book.

1047
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:25,720
Is this ringing any bells in any of your research or anything?

1048
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:26,840
How about goo?

1049
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:28,920
Was goo on your radar before today?

1050
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:32,440
Does this remind you of a certain Lindsay Lohan movie?

1051
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:35,560
Or perhaps have you researched the works of Silas Cole?

1052
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:37,880
That's a lot of questions all at once, fellas.

1053
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:45,000
And you know, I'm into a lot of this here stuff, but you know, I've seen some actual

1054
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,600
magic in my life.

1055
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:51,320
So yeah, I mean, I knew that this was all part of this.

1056
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:56,040
I mean, you'll remember the conversation we had on the phone when you were on the way

1057
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:56,680
to the city.

1058
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:57,480
How could we forget?

1059
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:01,400
It was your grandfather?

1060
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:03,880
Was it grandfather or father gave him the spell?

1061
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:05,480
Well, my grandfather gave me the book.

1062
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:08,200
It had, you know, three pages left in it.

1063
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:11,320
And they were specifically for the three of you.

1064
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:15,720
And boy, those words danced off light like the page and just lit like a fire.

1065
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:18,360
Are there any of those pages left or was...

1066
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:19,960
Well, no.

1067
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:25,080
There were three in there for us and it burnt out in the spell that he did over our heads.

1068
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:26,040
Because there's three of us.

1069
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:26,920
That makes sense.

1070
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:28,920
Hey, why wasn't there a page for Justin?

1071
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:29,800
Who's Justin?

1072
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:31,080
Never mind.

1073
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:34,040
You think there weren't a bunch of pages that created Wolf the dog?

1074
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:39,560
Good point.

1075
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:42,520
No, there were only three when I got it.

1076
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:44,200
It was very thick, very thick.

1077
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:47,000
But when you'd open it up, you could only get to like three pages.

1078
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:49,880
And then once they were gone, it was just empty.

1079
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:53,080
It was just shell on both sides, but it was still full.

1080
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:55,640
It looked like a book, but there's nothing in there.

1081
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:59,160
We found a book that will only open to one page.

1082
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:00,920
Kind of looks like her tattoo.

1083
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:02,040
The page that it opens up to.

1084
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:05,000
The book itself, it was maybe skin bound.

1085
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,960
Was the book you had bound by perhaps skin?

1086
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:09,240
Man skin.

1087
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:13,080
The face of Gary Daley loses blood.

1088
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:16,440
Yeah, I sure didn't like touching that book.

1089
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:18,280
I wanted to get rid of it as fast as I could.

1090
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:21,320
You got it from your grandfather?

1091
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:21,960
Yeah.

1092
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:24,280
Yeah, when the pages were gone, what did you do with it?

1093
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:26,600
Well, I don't.

1094
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:29,320
Did you give it to Clark's parents?

1095
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:33,160
And Gary starts crying.

1096
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:36,920
Clark, we found it in Jim's house.

1097
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:38,600
It would have been Jim, right?

1098
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:41,080
That you gave it to if you give it to anybody.

1099
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:43,560
No, I haven't really mentioned to you in all the hubbub,

1100
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:49,160
what with the dog and the body switching and, you know, the fish magic.

1101
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:53,240
I'm just imagining all the NPCs encircling you while you're having this conversation.

1102
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:55,560
Sorry, what was that?

1103
00:50:55,560 --> 00:51:01,240
When I was having my augury, as it was, and I saw that

1104
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:06,440
the entity before us that pretends to be Drew cannot be trusted.

1105
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:13,960
When I saw that, I also saw a vision of Kacelle searching your parents' home for that book.

1106
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:18,520
And Karen and Jim seemed to want it desperately.

1107
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:23,480
But Kevin found it and he didn't reveal it to the others.

1108
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:26,040
That's all I saw.

1109
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:27,160
Do you know where it is now?

1110
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:29,480
Clark, I'm so sorry.

1111
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:37,000
I knew how much power it had, but I didn't know that people were going to be after it

1112
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,040
the way they were.

1113
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:42,040
And I think they died because I gave it to them.

1114
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:48,760
Clark is staring at Gary with a little bit of anger and a little bit of confusion.

1115
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:52,120
Like this is really hitting some notes.

1116
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:58,040
I didn't, I didn't mean to, I didn't mean to cause their death or nothing.

1117
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:01,080
I just, I knew I needed to get rid of it because I didn't.

1118
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:07,160
I don't remember much about that day, but I do remember I heard, I heard a voice and

1119
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:10,280
they did, they said something about Karen.

1120
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:13,720
Karen, they said Karen did a magic trick and they all had to get out of there.

1121
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:17,880
And that's, that was the last time I,

1122
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:22,760
I don't, I don't understand though.

1123
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:25,400
I don't, why did you, why would you give them a book like that?

1124
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:27,640
Why would you think that they would want a book like that?

1125
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:29,160
They were customers.

1126
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:31,480
They were at the Daily Foam almost daily.

1127
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:35,000
And they always asked about the signs up on the wall.

1128
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:41,320
And we would talk often about, you know, conspiracy theories and occult texts.

1129
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:43,400
And they seem knowledgeable about that.

1130
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:47,240
No, they were just, they just had a passing interest, I think.

1131
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:49,320
Why did you need to give it to them?

1132
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:51,880
It was a book made out of a human.

1133
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:52,760
I didn't want it.

1134
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:55,400
And my parents did, did they take it?

1135
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:57,480
Did, did they, did they take the book?

1136
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:59,400
Like, did they know what they had?

1137
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:05,320
Did they, did they seem, did they seem gleeful in having it or was it just a curiosity for them?

1138
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:07,240
I don't remember seeing it in the house personally.

1139
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:10,120
So they obviously secreted it away or something.

1140
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:12,680
Well, it seemed to be a curiosity.

1141
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:19,480
But when I told them, I mean, I told them what it could do.

1142
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:24,440
So they knew, they knew the power that it had if they actually trusted me.

1143
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:25,320
What could it do?

1144
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:27,880
Yeah, you said the pages were empty, right?

1145
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:29,240
They couldn't do anything anymore, right?

1146
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:34,280
Well, I mean, they knew what it had been capable of doing previous, I suppose.

1147
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:36,120
Can I human Gary here?

1148
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:37,960
Yeah, you both want to roll?

1149
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:38,460
Sure.

1150
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:44,860
I fail 71 on a 30.

1151
00:53:45,580 --> 00:53:47,020
75 on a 50.

1152
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:47,740
Fuck.

1153
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:48,780
Seems genuine to you guys.

1154
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:50,860
Coming across as genuine.

1155
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:52,620
I don't cheat on my rolls, motherfucker.

1156
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:55,260
No, I was talking about Gary.

1157
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:55,760
Oh.

1158
00:53:58,220 --> 00:54:00,700
I knew exactly how to, now I get what you meant.

1159
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:01,900
Also, you said you failed.

1160
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:03,260
Bullshit.

1161
00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:03,760
I know.

1162
00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:07,020
Fucking liar.

1163
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:11,500
I've seen Luke take too long to think about what he writes sometimes.

1164
00:54:15,580 --> 00:54:18,700
Gary, it's your grandfather's book.

1165
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:19,580
Do you know where he got it?

1166
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:21,660
What was your grandfather's name, by the way?

1167
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:23,100
Well, I'd have to look that up.

1168
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:26,140
Can I human that?

1169
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:29,260
That's not in there.

1170
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:30,620
That's not in the podcast.

1171
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:31,120
Fuck.

1172
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:33,340
I don't know if I ever said it.

1173
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:35,100
Oh, you mean in the vision?

1174
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:35,740
Yeah.

1175
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:36,540
You didn't say it.

1176
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:37,820
You just said grandfather.

1177
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:40,700
His name was, um, Gary?

1178
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:42,700
Grant Father.

1179
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:47,740
His name was Grant Father Bailey.

1180
00:54:51,740 --> 00:54:53,980
And you don't know where he got that?

1181
00:54:53,980 --> 00:54:56,380
Where, you know where old Grant got that book?

1182
00:54:57,100 --> 00:55:01,900
Well, uh, we all, I mean, we all thought he was pretty crazy, but.

1183
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:05,020
And he looks over at Clara Blankenship's arm.

1184
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:07,820
You see that figure right there?

1185
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:11,820
That looks to be about what he described that dropped it off at the Daily Fuh.

1186
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:13,100
After closing time.

1187
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:13,980
Can you imagine that?

1188
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:15,020
Didn't even buy anything.

1189
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:17,980
Some people are just rude.

1190
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:22,940
You don't know if it's a bad day, a bad, uh, bad childhood.

1191
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:25,180
It's like, he has no respect for other people's time.

1192
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:31,500
I don't know anybody with the problem with that.

1193
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:32,000
Blind.

1194
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:36,720
So does that, does that tattoo ring a bell for anybody?

1195
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:38,240
Have you ever seen anything like that?

1196
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:38,640
Yeah.

1197
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:44,640
Weird man who I took to be some sort of robot at the time approached me, uh, uh, outside

1198
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:49,680
the hospital after I went to follow up on some, some lead, it seems like years ago now.

1199
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:54,640
I remember that he gave you that note that was in binary, right?

1200
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:55,120
Yeah.

1201
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:58,640
And it said, uh, John, I killed the cheese pops.

1202
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:00,000
He was rogue like that?

1203
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:00,880
He sure was.

1204
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:05,680
I guess it was just cause it was in binary that I assumed it was mechanical.

1205
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:10,640
Uh, and then he, then he said, say hi to me for me.

1206
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:13,200
Do you reckon that might've been old Clark?

1207
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:17,520
We've certainly seen old me in robes.

1208
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:21,520
That's that's when, when he did that thing in the mausoleum, he was wearing a robe.

1209
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:24,480
John like jots down suspect has been seen in robes.

1210
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:35,520
But that would, that would mean that I, when I was, when I was a kid, Gary, Gary, you were

1211
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:36,080
there.

1212
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:36,640
What?

1213
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:38,320
When I was a kid, I came to visit mr.

1214
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:41,920
Fingersen at the library and you were there and you were reading a book.

1215
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:45,200
And when you read from the book, do you remember this?

1216
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:45,600
Okay.

1217
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:47,120
No, it was not my fault.

1218
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:48,720
I stand by that though.

1219
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:50,320
The book of, you know, St.

1220
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:55,440
Oscythe witches or whatever I was reading that day does not have anything to do with

1221
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:57,840
any cloaked figures except for witches.

1222
00:56:57,840 --> 00:57:01,840
You know, obviously sometimes we're cloaks, but either way, Gary, whether you did it or

1223
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:05,200
not, which I think you did, but whether you did it or not, you were there.

1224
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:07,520
And we saw that you remember that there was a cloak.

1225
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:08,480
There was a cloak man.

1226
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:13,440
He, he locked up the doors to the library and he was, he was being chased or chasing

1227
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:13,920
someone.

1228
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:18,160
He goes like, he's going to grab onto Clara Blankenship's arm to look closer at the

1229
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:18,560
tattoo.

1230
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:20,320
And then he's like, Oh my God, I'm so sorry.

1231
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:23,680
I did not mean to touch your arm to look at your tattoo.

1232
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:24,960
That would be extremely rude.

1233
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:26,720
Can I just look at that much closer?

1234
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:28,400
And she's like, yeah, of course, that's fine.

1235
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:31,120
And very closely puts his face right up to her arm.

1236
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:35,680
This motherfucker right here is exactly who was outside the Mary Cole public library

1237
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:36,000
that day.

1238
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,200
I swear to God.

1239
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:40,560
And thankfully that figure locked us in, right?

1240
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:40,880
Yeah.

1241
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:44,560
He used some sort of chains or something because there were these big tall creatures.

1242
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:46,240
Oh my goodness.

1243
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:48,320
I'm having all sorts of flashbacks right now.

1244
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:49,360
Yeah, they were wearing suits.

1245
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:52,560
They were these lanky translucent skin fuckers.

1246
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:56,320
I told John they, they, they were, they were the, they were the, they were those creatures.

1247
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:59,360
I remember now it was the, it was the thing that's been yelling at us.

1248
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:02,560
They were chasing the robed figure.

1249
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:04,800
And now you're saying that that could be old me.

1250
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:06,000
I don't know.

1251
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:08,560
I turned to Clara.

1252
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:09,520
I am so sorry.

1253
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:14,400
I know you guys are having like a whole thing right now and it seems, seems really important.

1254
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:20,800
But I, if I can, since the figure that you're talking about was in my dreams and has been

1255
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:27,680
in my recurring dreams for the past few years and a long time now, I have this video that

1256
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:30,800
I found online from this dude in contention way back when.

1257
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:36,720
And since it's been scrubbed from the internet and I'm pretty sure that like some sort of

1258
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:41,840
black ops special secret service kind of like men in black shit took it off the internet

1259
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:43,680
because I looked him up recently.

1260
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:44,960
I think he disappeared.

1261
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:46,800
Whose video?

1262
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:48,080
His name's John Peters.

1263
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:51,840
It's this YouTube video.

1264
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:56,080
He used to have a channel where he talked about the dreams he had during this coma that

1265
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:58,240
he was in for like a while.

1266
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:00,080
He was in the hospital for an extended time.

1267
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:01,840
Could be any John Peters in a coma.

1268
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:09,840
So for listeners, you can go to any of our social media sites, Instagram at pretending

1269
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:14,800
pod, Twitter at pretending pod, or go to the Facebook page, which is pretending to be people.

1270
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:16,720
And you can find this video.

1271
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:19,200
I'll play the audio of it right now.

1272
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:20,320
If I can make that happen.

1273
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:28,240
Hello everybody.

1274
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:34,480
Welcome back to John Peters channel where I'm talking about my visions that I saw while

1275
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:39,840
having a over a month long coma here in contention.

1276
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:49,760
I believe these visions showed me a world or a land that is parallel to our own simultaneously

1277
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:50,640
existing.

1278
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:59,680
I was led there by a man who only carried a black Nike bag and when he reached out to

1279
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:09,520
shake my hand upon introductions, it smelled of sweet meats like a grill and my hand burned

1280
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:10,480
and burned.

1281
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:13,280
That is all for now.

1282
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:16,400
Like and subscribe and I will update more soon.

1283
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:17,360
Oh, what the fuck?

1284
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:23,040
It's the best fucking thing in the world.

1285
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:26,720
Do y'all remember that motherfucker having such big eyes?

1286
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:03,600
The only one trying to

1287
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:13,600
try

1288
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:31,600
to
