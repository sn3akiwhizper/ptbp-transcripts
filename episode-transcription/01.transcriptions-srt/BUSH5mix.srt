00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,440
Hello and greetings my little wolf babies

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,960
Welcome to my crib

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:14,720
Welcome to your crib that sits safely inside of my crib lay down and get ready to get swaddled

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:22,920
Because auntie wolf is here to present yet another broadcast from the radio station known as six nine four point two

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,680
PTBP

6
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:30,280
Warm up the milk and scream to the heavens because we got a new howling with wolf

7
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,120
This week's howling with wolf is from at

8
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:41,360
LED Lorenzo who tweeted about the show and tagged at pretending pod hear that you can be just like

9
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:49,360
LED Lorenzo if you also tweet about this show in tag at pretending pod, it's easy

10
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,480
Easy

11
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,400
Eleanor writes, so I'm still recovering from a bad flu

12
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,280
So my head's in a fog

13
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:03,700
But I'd like to make a shout out for the state of Missouri and the fine people who seem to live there based on you

14
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:11,380
Guys, and also people should follow me on Twitter for new fun updates on my projects and follow me on

15
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:17,400
Instagram for butt stuff, but not actually butt stuff, but like vanity stuff

16
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,160
IDK whatever you think is best wear a condom

17
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:28,520
The state of Missouri more like the state of misery. Am I right ladies?

18
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:37,200
Make sure y'all follow whom'st ever this human being is now Eleanor

19
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:44,880
I don't know what following means or what the internet is or whom and Instagram is

20
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:52,040
Now my producer usually handles all that stuff because I keep forgetting my AOL login

21
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:58,740
Information if someone could email AOL for me and tell them that wolf is trying to get online

22
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,960
That'd be great. And oh, thanks again

23
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:08,160

Confidential feed is called how to be a bad GM

28
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:35,420
The crew breaks down 10 minutes of audio that was cut from control copy

29
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:41,960
Because Zach was embarrassed by his countless failures found within this is an episode about learning

30
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,460
about growth and

31
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:49,340
Mostly about laughing at Zach poor guy just gets torched in this one

32
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:53,620
Probably has the most laughter of any single episode ever

33
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:59,500
I actually cried a whole wolfy tear from chortling so god dang hard

34
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:03,100
But now is not the time for tears in the blues

35
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:07,140
No doubt it's time for cheers and the news

36
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:14,340
Last time a paranoid. Dr. Rusty hooch tackled Jerome Dyer to the ground

37
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:22,560
After some words the two agreed to join forces to wipe all the camera equipment of any evidence out in the van

38
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,980
agent Doreen Maureen

39
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,220
amputated her own foot to avoid an unspeakable

40
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:36,660
Transformation she bled and bled and almost passed out on the stretcher in the back of the mobile lab while dr

41
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,420
Olivia Miller

42
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:43,000
Continually failed to find the supplies necessary to aid the situation

43
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:47,900
Thankfully the Chuckster was there to throw Doreen's remove foot mid

44
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:55,780
Transformation into the deep freeze rip his shirt off and properly bandage the surely fatal wound

45
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:03,620
Alright dear listener, I'm taking next week off to get ready for another wild time change

46
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:07,580
I won't say much else, but here's a quick hint

47
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,980
Y'all best get excited

48
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:26,980
Now for the last time a brand-new song premiered here on

49
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,600
694.2

50
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,380
PTBP for its coming-out debut. It's an infant of a track

51
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:42,320
It is indeed this bangers first rodeo for the last time. It's Molly Healy with circles

52
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,980
Oh

53
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,980
I

54
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,060
Was seeing how many times I could do

55
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:54,460
Ssippis sssippis sssippis sssippis

56
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:59,460
so Zach and I were talking last night pillow pillow talking pillow talking and

57
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:05,220
We were we were talking about the podcast and like the funny moments of it

58
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:18,580
Yeah, he actually like if sometimes if it's like taking too long and I really try to get it done

59
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,580
I just say like I whisper is here

60
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:37,380
Him laughing in his in his hands right now means that it's kind of true probably

61
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:47,060
But it was funny because never takes too long because I was like we were talking about the funny jokes

62
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:53,500
I was like like when I said piss a sippy and then he was I think I said like piss a sippy and he said

63
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:58,660
Yeah, that was funny when I made that joke and I was like Zach. I made that joke

64
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,820
Like I spelled out

65
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:08,960
Pissississippi and then you said piss a sippy and I'm like I was like we have to roll back the tape

66
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,620
Almost immediately. She was like, let's go to the tape

67
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:18,380
Which we didn't but because I thought Eleanor made that I thought it was Eleanor too

68
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:25,620
She said yeah, she started that she started the joke train talking about pissing in the Mississippi. I just made the word

69
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:32,420
This is the thing my my role is to serve and then you guys smash

70
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:41,760
Just like in high school just like in high school you serve somebody else smashes

71
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:45,140
Volleyball through fifth grade, so I'm really familiar with

72
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:55,060
Similar to your dick

73
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,820
Sorry, I

74
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:01,960
Eleanor thank you for apologizing

75
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:07,720
Well, I hate having this delay because it literally is me saying like similar to your dick and then one two three

76
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:14,880
And I'm like kill me which is funny cuz now it's gonna be a delay of us making the joke of the delay laughs

77
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:20,560
Exactly. That's exactly what I do and I want to right now, but it's fine. Oh

78
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
We really enjoy this too. Yes

79
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I

80
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:41,440
Well, that's great though, I think I think you guys I'm curious to hear more about how you how you talk in bed, but

81
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:49,880
Real question though, but now I forgot about it. Nevermind. All right, we're now out of combat order. Oh my god

82
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,560
Let's start

83
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:58,720
With a quick recap of where we ended maybe just some like nice shots. I'm not gonna lie

84
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:04,520
I thought I just solved all the problems. Yeah, like like I thought the game is over like I fixed it

85
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:09,720
Well, you do have a point that you have to take the Bigfoot corpse to also

86
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,960
I wouldn't leave a boy's corpse or a Bigfoot foot or

87
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:21,920
Technically two civilians who know that the unnatural exists. Oh, it's just cleanup. It's cleanup. This episode is cleanup

88
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,160
Oh, that'll be so fun for everyone to listen to no

89
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:30,520
No, but like I think I think what was a really cool thing that that happened because Chuck like dr. Miller

90
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:35,960
She was fumbling like crazy, but then Chuck steps in Chuck like the most underrated character

91
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,120
Everyone thinks he's a fucking dumbass, right?

92
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,960
Hey

93
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,800
I've gotten like attack emails to me

94
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,160
associated with this monster, but

95
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:59,160
He stepped up and freaking saved a day and I feel like we have to play that out because dr

96
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:04,820
Miller, you know, she thought he was like a buffoon. Maybe I'll get a real purple heart now. Yeah

97
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:08,720
What do you think from who the government giving you shit?

98
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,680
The president it would be so funny if he's like this wasn't hard at all

99
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:19,740
You know like this this this is your job that you needed an education for, you know, and she's just like, yeah

100
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,740
He just like goes to medical school

101
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Dr. Cheese, okay

102
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:37,600
Yeah, could I get like an honorary diploma or something to be a doctor they do that that's who are you asking the government

103
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:45,480
The people with the money, dr. Miller is gonna seriously, dr. Miller is gonna step up and and kneel next to him and

104
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:52,480
Put a hand on his shoulder to be like that was absolutely amazing Chuck or I shall call you Charles

105
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:58,560
Yeah, I turned completely red and have a big smile on my face. Are you jealous during look at this attention?

106
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,560
I'm getting from this other woman

107
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,840
He's not a love interest of mine

108
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:08,360
Yeah, but someone else is scratching behind my whippet ears and I'm liking it don't you

109
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:14,880
Wait, when you said that the only thing that mattered to you is your whippet. I just assumed that that relationship was

110
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,960
Yeah, it's a whippet

111
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,320
We went there, huh

112
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,680
Play with small town folk

113
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,680
You

114
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:36,120
Don't do that in Sweden, I don't I don't

115
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:45,400
It's not a bestiality what's darker than BC we have to do something

116
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,760
Okay, so you're having this moment with

117
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,920
Charles now you've called him. Yeah, but I think also but then I on the target, right?

118
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:59,060
So she's like we need to clean this up though, and we need to figure out what the hell is going on in there in

119
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:04,020
The cabin. Hey Doreen. Are you going to be okay here? Yeah, do you need anything? Do you need anything like

120
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:09,220
But I think I'm gonna I think I'm gonna pull through water medicine

121
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:13,940

Just cuz I think she might be bored

124
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:28,180
Poor Dory might be a little bored. It starts playing through the dope surround sound system in the Sprinter van

125
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:34,880
That's very important for a lab Doreen starts like kind of like dance in just a little bit. Yes as dr

126

127
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:48,780
Zack is very familiar with morphine which also makes me a little nervous for the Zack

128
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:53,080
Yeah, I I like morphine

129
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,080

He was very he was very like oh, oh, yeah, you feel great

131
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:05,840
I'm never okay. You almost piss your pants as the warmth of a taff million thousand tiny angels

132
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:12,040
Just like rushes through your bloodstream and you feel better than you've ever felt about anything in your entire life

133
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,960
And I just like giggle a little bit. Yeah

134
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,480
You're not sure whether you just pissed your pants, but you don't I don't care

135
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:26,800
You're like little angel stop tickling me that's what she says I had surgery one time where I had to have morphine

136
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,800
Oh, I'm not like an addict

137
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:34,840
I fell through a plate glass window and almost died. It's no big deal. Jeez

138
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:41,640
Yeah, I was there I had to call his parents to let them know they were four hours away and I was literally I lost

139
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:47,380
a third of my blood before I made it on the operating table in which they then as they pulled out the 18 inch long piece

140
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:49,380
Of glass that was stuck in my butt

141
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:53,020
They hit another artery and I had to have a second blood transfusion

142
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:58,500
Doctor told me I might not be able to ever walk again, but look at me now motherfuckers not walking not walking

143
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:09,380
Yeah, that was like less than a year into our relationship and I had to help him pee into a bedpan

144
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:16,220
So anyway, I knew that we it was real love. Yeah, it's either that or traveling together

145
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:24,100
It's those two things like uh-huh. Yep bedpans and travel. Yes taking up dump or travel

146
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,620
Yeah, I didn't I didn't help him take a dump. I pressed the nurse button for that

147
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:33,620
Yeah, the nurse got to wipe me and I just remember I was so hopped up on drugs

148
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,620
but I just kept looking at the nurse and being like

149
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:38,060
Your job is so weird

150
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:41,860
She's like I know

151
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:47,500
Yeah, they don't pay nurses enough Allie inside of this cabin, dr

152
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:51,340
Rusty Hooch and Jerome Dyer finishing up wiping all

153
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,460
traces

154
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:56,900
electronic or physical of both the corpse and

155
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:03,540
The corpse so my last move I like opened up the door to look outside, right?

156
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:10,780
Can I see like commotion going on out there? Yeah, you you can you can see the light coming out shining down onto the

157
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:16,340
Freshly powdered ground behind the sprinter van as snow is falling

158
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:21,040
I mean for a second you thought you heard it's the most wonderful time of the year

159
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:24,180
but then it leans pretty hard into a

160
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,420
file and

161
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,740
rap

162
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,740
music, okay

163
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:33,260
So at this point cameras are wiped. I

164
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:36,140
Know there's not much I can do

165
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:38,140
I

166
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:46,980
Was just trying to make the situation realistic that's what you've always been doing

167
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:54,660
Sorry go ahead, okay cameras are wiped but someone needs to do something about the civilians

168
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:59,300
So I decide I'm gonna go out to the van and try to switch places with Chuck

169
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:05,740
Because he needs to take care of these bitches Oh agent dire you watch those two. I run out to the van

170
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:10,420
He literally motions as you run out. He just motions to a sleeping Carl

171
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:16,420
Like shrugs at the camera like fucking Jim Halpert

172
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:26,460
Jack Jack I hop out and then I like give a rice smile and I say notice anything different about what?

173
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:29,320
I noticed that you looked way uglier than last time I saw you

174
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,920
Damn dude, I

175
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:36,280
Take it in stride and I say girl. I know this is just your

176
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,440
Insecurity is trying to come out for a boy

177
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,840
Cuz you know that you want this duck

178
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:52,360
Admit it I turn around and I just like hock a loogie onto the ground because that's the most disgusting thing

179
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:57,140
I've ever slowly melts into the snow who to know you're softening towards me

180
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:05,680
And then I do like I do the thing we're like you squeeze one peck at a time and they kind of bounce oh

181
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,480
I become straight

182
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:16,400
Zero percent in straightness. Sorry

183
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:22,200
Chuck I don't know what the fuck is going on, but we've got two civilians inside

184
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,680
I've destroyed all the evidence but we've got to get rid of them

185
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:28,120
Can I can you go inside and take care of that and while while I'm talking to her?

186
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:31,080
I'm looking over and noticing that Doreen is missing a foot

187
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,480
And I pull a foot out of my

188
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:42,720
What no, I don't think I roll pull foot out of trench coat, nope, sorry have a zero percent and pull for

189
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,800
Oh y'all need a foot

190
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:52,880
Dr. Miller would like to go back into the cabin as well if Doreen is stable enough during how do you feel?

191
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,840
I think I can hop because I feel so good from the morphine. I think hopping is gonna be very doable

192
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:04,960
I can hop. All right, I figured it out girl. I put the foot in the deep freeze

193
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:10,440
Do not touch it unless you want to use or is it in something? It's loose

194
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:16,400
Okay, cool. You put a loose foot in the deep freeze. Wait, I didn't did did you get in contact with it?

195
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,100
Probably. Yeah

196
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:24,240
That bad. Dr. Miller is gonna give dr. Hooch a long meaningful look

197
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,240
Did I do that?

198
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:34,880
Chuck stayed stay right where you are sit on the ground. Don't move a fucking muscle is Chuck still in their hazmat suit

199
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,800
He's hazmat suit. Yeah, I think everybody is well, I ripped my shirt off. Oh, that's right

200
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:44,960
You must have ripped the hazmat. So you've got he's shirtless and has the hazmat tied around his waist

201
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,040
Great, so he's got the pants of the hazmat. I have the head part on how it's

202
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:58,920
Detaches, but let it be known when he grabbed the foot and put it in the deep freeze. He had his hazmat suit

203
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:02,120
Oh, he was wearing gloves. Yeah, we always forget about the hazmat suit

204
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:08,440
And the hazmat suit. Okay, if you didn't touch it with your bare skin, I'm not worried about it

205
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:14,420
Okay, it's in the deep freeze if we try to kill it that little alien bugs gonna come out again

206
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:19,240
So I say we just leave it there forever. I think I've got a fucking get rid of this deep freeze

207
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,480
Isn't there isn't there a delta green

208
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:29,080
Situation here where we can call upon them or something that to extract you literally have a point like a GPS

209
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:35,080
Location in each of your phones for a drop-off warehouse where you're going to bring this body

210
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:38,480
It would be also a great place to bring a foot. Yeah. Yes

211
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,480
It might also be a good place to bring

212
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:45,640
The civilians you think if you don't want to have to deal with that aspect of it

213
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:52,040
Although they might get angry at you at the warehouse if you haven't cleaned up everything before you get there. Yeah

214
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:57,840
Well, I think dr. Miller is gonna I think she's gonna suggest that that's exactly what they do of like cleaning up everything

215
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,920
trying to get the body into a

216
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:07,880
Secure sort of body bag and then she's gonna try to talk to Carl and Ruth as they wake up

217
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,720
Listen, you've been through a lot

218
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:14,360
We understand that this must be extremely traumatic. There are help

219
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,280
I mean and she's gonna lie because she doesn't know if there's help

220
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,400
She's got there's help for you waiting and we're gonna be taking care of you

221
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:28,720
I suggest that you don't tell anyone what you've seen here and what you've done here

222
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:36,120
But before you talk to your legal counsel, and she knows that there's probably nothing waiting for these people. She's lying

223
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Because that's her job

224
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,760
Yeah, no

225
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,000
I think I think

226
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:48,400
Honestly, I'm not gonna have you roll cuz with everything that's happened so far and Jerome is is there and he's known these people for

227
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,400
Three years they trust him

228
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,840
They don't know what the fuck is going on. So they're very confused

229
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:00,460
We could have a quick montage of the cleanup of the site

230
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:08,600
You grab a body bag from the sprinter van kind of fold the tarp over the pool table over this boy's corpse

231
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,960
And gently lift it with all of its blood and everything dripping

232
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:18,880
Into this body bag and you can kind of get it in there seal it up and you can take that out

233
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:23,120
And get it on the stretcher in the back of this this sprinter van

234
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:28,540
I feel like typically there's a song that plays during a montage and I just want for the for the listeners out there to

235
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,200
Kind of have something in mind. Yeah, what do you think?

236
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,960
It is the only song that's popping up in my head right now is the what I want you

237
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:42,080
The candle the candle

238
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,680
I think yeah, it feels appropriate. Yeah

239
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,120
As we as we package away the dead child exactly

240
00:21:54,680 --> 00:22:01,080
Dreams come true plays. Well, it's how it's how Doreen marine feels about Chuck now

241
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,120
it's actually only playing in her head the rest of us are like

242
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:16,000
When it's a montage from her perspective, it's that song playing and for everyone else it's like a fucking funeral dirge

243
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,520
Marina's just like smiling so big the whole time. Everybody's just so distraught and she's just like

244
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:31,640
Bopping to an invisible tune invisible. Yeah

245
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,400
Okay

246
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:40,280
Okay, so I can have Jerome I'm Jerome fuck it's been a long day

247
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:47,320
I can have Carl and in Janus if you guys want to ride with me and then I'll follow you

248
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:50,120
You said there's a place that we can go. Do you have a

249
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,840
Day of location. How about I ride with you Jerome? And then

250
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,320
Yes, we have the coordinates Chuck will drive the other car

251
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:02,620
I got it. Doreen is like so happy and she knows she drove on the way here and still has her right foot

252
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,360
Was it my right foot?

253
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:12,240
It was your left foot. Of course if you drive with your right foot. Yeah. Yeah, and so I like try to fight Chuck on driving

254
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,760
Come on

255
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,760
Well, that wouldn't be my voice

256
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,760
I

257
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:29,400
Messed with this hair. I immediately can see didn't say, okay

258
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:39,880
Amazing like I said, I'm going in the other car like tight tight tight. You got this. I trust you

259
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,240
Rusty who'd you letting this happen? I?

260
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,200
Damn

261
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,200
Yeah, I'm gonna let you drive bitch

262
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,280
Cuz I got him I gotta watch the foot

263
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,960
Guys pack up

264
00:23:56,040 --> 00:24:00,740
Everything any evidence you've cleaned up. I need whoever who has the highest forensics

265
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,560
20 40

266
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,560
50 okay, so

267
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:12,680
You're gonna let the girl and morphine do our forensic check. You would actually have a negative 20 on this much morphine

268
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:17,740
So it's 30. So who had the 40? Okay. So yeah, and that makes sense. She's been cleaning up

269
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:26,060
Anyway, that was like her whole situation inside this this this little cabin shack thing lean to a huge lean to with the toilet

270
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:30,200
Can you can you roll forensics for me?

271
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,960
Just to make sure you don't miss anything

272
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,760
And

273
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:43,440
Do you want I am 91 you nailed it you wait what you are positive that you cleaned it this side up perfectly

274
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,480
And so you guys are going to head on out

275
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,560
It's a lovely

276
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,440
lovely January night

277
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:59,680
wind is whipping up the snow into a bit of a frenzy and

278
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:06,400
It is just biting your noses as you pack up everything into the sprinter van and

279
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:12,880
into one of the trucks that is on this site Jerome's truck is here and

280
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,720
They're gonna hop into that one. You see a

281
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:19,600
Older and like lifted and souped up

282
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:25,800
It says bush on the side of it with a bullet hole for the period after each letter

283
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,080
You're pretty sure that one's Carl's

284
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:35,180
Yeah, Jerome's just got a nice like f-250 or something like that with four doors. So it's got the extended

285
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:39,580
I don't know why I'm getting so into these fucking trucks. It doesn't matter you get into the trucks

286
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,080
You get into the truck. Dr. Miller with

287
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:50,600
Jerome driving and you've got Carl and Janice in the backseat kind of smushed together in the backseat and

288
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,360
And

289
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:57,280
We're gonna leave this fucking horrible mess of a site

290
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,200
Yeah, it's just memes guys. So

291
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:06,520
You drive down the long gravel driveway to get out

292
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:13,860
Jerome hits a like a garage door opener that opens the gate for the sprinter van that's in the lead and

293
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:18,420
Doreen puts her one good foot to the pedal

294
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:26,280
And turns onto the road following the GPS coordinates

295
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:30,320
which is much easier now that Jerome Dyer has

296
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:36,980
Kind of released the cellular grip that he had on this area. And so you all have full bars again

297
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:40,480
obviously, dr. Hooch's phone starts blowing up and

298
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:46,240
Doreen is driving. Is anyone sitting shotgun or the two of you just in the back?

299
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,360
I'm in the back next to the fridge. I'm next to Doreen just cuz I

300
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,800
I'm never gonna say no to her but I do think it's smart to

301
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:57,560
Check out the road as we go. I think that's really smart

302
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:04,280
Yes, and so everything seems to be going smoothly

303
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:11,000
Doreen and the Chuckster are getting along like fucking gangbusters

304
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:16,920
Like y'all are just like especially in Doreen's loosened lucid lucidity

305
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:23,880
especially after the release of all of these endorphins that you've just had Doreen it sort of seems like this is a

306
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:28,920
Party and then I pull out a beer and I'm like, I'm catching up and then I crack it

307
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,400
Cuz I want to be on her level while you're monitoring her driving, that's right

308
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:39,320
I just remember that she has refrigerated pants and I have unrefrigerated

309
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:44,120
Mentos in my pockets and I think about how much I like those nice cold Mentos and I asked I

310
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:50,140
Asked Chuck if he will store my loose Mentos in his refrigerated pockets, please

311
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:54,400
Yeah, we could do that, but it could probably get a lot pulled a lot faster in the deep freeze

312
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:02,580
Just a thought Maureen may feel really nice good, but she's not

313
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,880
at that

314
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,040
Sentence the camera pans back through to see dr

315
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:14,360
Rusty hooch just like staring at this deep freeze and we see this body bag is sitting on the stretcher

316
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:22,840
Okay, I'm in the back. I'm here Doreen and Chuck being idiots up in the front drinking on the way to the drop-off. I

317
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:29,640
Immediately realized that I don't trust them. I don't trust that they inspected this foot. So I open up the freezer

318
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:39,400
The camera pans into the freezer and out through the back of the sprinter van

319
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:44,840
onto the windshield of the truck driving behind and we see Jerome Dyer and

320
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:49,240
Dr. Miller having a conversation in the front

321
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:56,760
Though it is silent for some time. I would assume in this truck before Jerome's finally like

322
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:02,320
That was weird it always tend to be I'd almost forgotten

323
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,840
It's kind of it's been a nice break, right

324
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,480
Where are you from?

325
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:17,880
Fort Worth, how did you get in with these people? Like, you know better. I believed Carl

326
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:26,960
The camera you Jerome reaches for the rearview mirror and adjusts it to see Carl with his head like slung back

327
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:39,520
Still just knocked out cold because Ali hasn't snapped your fingers yet

328
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,520
I

329
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:52,120
Just trusted him I believed his story and I knew that they were onto something and I knew that I needed to be here

330
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,400
for when it happened and

331
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:02,400
Janice is in the backseat. Just like fuck. Are you guys talking about nothing, honey? Nothing you have to worry about

332
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,520
Here have one of these and she picks out

333
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:11,160
Some sort of pill that will make her probably at least try to cool her nerves

334
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:19,000
Not as strong as the whatever potion that pooch made but something that to just have her not listening on us and calm down

335
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,200
Okay, so after a bit longer

336
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,520
silence in the car

337
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:27,360
You look back Janice is like over with her head on

338
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,640
Carl's shoulder

339
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:33,360
Janice Ruth with the most like deviated septum of all time

340
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:39,920
And Carl Lambert's king of the loogie

341
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:50,320
Dr. Miller is gonna continue to talk to Jerome. I mean you weren't that far off

342
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:55,440
It's just that it never is, you know, it's never it's never religion behind it

343
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:01,180
It's never you know, one of these stories. It's just stories that people come up with to explain whatever it is, but

344
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,920
The truth is always darker. I found

345
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:11,960
Yeah, I suppose you wouldn't believe that one day you find out or hear about like a man big fat man

346
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:17,680
We're dressed in red. You wouldn't assume that it's Santa. It's always, you know some alien or some

347
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:22,760
Disgusting pedophile or whatever. I know. Okay, maybe not that but are we saying that Santa's

348
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,760
She's gonna be like

349
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,320
It's always worse

350
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,320
Oh

351
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:38,120
Just looks at you with a confused look and we are gonna have a

352
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:43,120
Drive check from Doreen marine. Oh at a negative 20

353
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,600
For being hopped up on morphine

354
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:57,340
92 wait. Yeah 92. Yeah 92

355
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,320
Oh

356
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,360
No

357
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:11,540
Fucking pigs. Hey, it's good. You're an actual. Okay, wait

358
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:18,960
It's cool. It's cool. It's cool Doreen. Do you have your FBI agent?

359
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:28,320
Doreen puts her hand in the back pocket where she usually keeps her firearms and pulls out her wallet and it's filled with loosement

360
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,320
And identification

361
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:41,080
She grabs a loose mentos and sticks them in Chuck's pocket or in my mouth to make me not talk

362
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:47,760
Dr. Miller you and Jerome Dyer see this as well and

363
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:51,760
This cop car is about to make a move

364
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:56,640
You're on a two-lane country road again these trees

365
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:02,500
Connecting over the top build the canopy to the moonlight to just kind of like

366
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,600
Hit you every once in a while as you're driving just like

367
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:13,320
Almost like the lights was you're driving through a tunnel, but it's the moonlight through this tunnel of trees. Oh

368
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,920
Oh

369
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:25,220
You you are the first to notice and this cop is about to

370
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:30,760
Pass you on this two-lane road to get in between you and the and the sprinter man

371
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:35,760
Shit shit shit shit shit shit. Play it cool. Play it cool

372
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:42,720
We have we have our papers in order, you know the protocol so as Jerome begins to kind of

373
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:48,480
slow down and pull over onto the side of the road the cop car just continues on past and

374
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,960
Is right behind the sprinter van with its lights on siren going?

375
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:58,480
Doreen pulls over we're good. We're ready Chuck. Shut the fuck up

376
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:05,360
Don't say a fucking word as you pull over you see the truck just fucking fly by you as Jerome Dyer continues past

377
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:11,800
Hey, hey Jerome, what the fuck? Well, you said be cool. I know he wasn't pulling me over. Should I pull over now?

378
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:17,960
Yeah, okay. Okay. Sorry. Sorry shit. The mission is back there. Like do you think those three dumbass is gonna be able to

379
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:25,480
So as you're saying that he's like and he pulls over so now the sprinter van is like shining its lights

380
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:31,880
You see the truck that Jerome Dyer's driving pulled over in the distance ahead of you

381
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:34,340
Cop is behind you lights on

382
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:39,000
Sprinter vans pulled over cop gets out of the car as he walks up

383
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,680
Around the back of the sprinter van

384
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:50,100
he gives it a weird like hand tap on the back like they always do it's like they'd have to touch your car as they

385
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:52,100
approach it and

386
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:59,400
He knocks on the window Dorian rolls down the window and she says howdy officer, how's it going tonight on his chest?

387
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,400
It says officer

388
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,400
McGovern

389
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:10,480
Shout out to Jesse Mowry, Jesse Mowry, Jesse Mowry, Mowry, Mowry, Mowry, Mowry, Jesse Mowry

390
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,600
Jesse Mowry Mowry

391
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:20,160
Patron who created Steve McGovern who is basically Dale Gribble with a beard Dale Gribble being the Dale

392
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,160
man from King of the Hill

393
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,960
So this is him with a beard and this is Steve McGovern

394
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:33,240
Thanks, Jesse. Thanks for being a patron at least the $10 level. That's dope. Thanks for making see McGovern

395
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:36,060
Let's dive into Steven government. He is like

396
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,600
licensing registration

397
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:47,600
Doreen pulls out her wallet and shows license registration along with her her federal identification and card. Hmm

398
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,320
I'll be right back

399
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:57,920
And he goes back and sits in the cop car through my mouth of Mentos

400
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,080
I go

401
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:04,240
And then I give her a high-five y'all we need a plan B. I don't I don't feel right about this

402
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:09,200
I think we need to play it cool for now, but I I'm also feeling a little a little shaky about it

403
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:13,920
All right, he opens this back door. I can't promise I won't shoot him in the face. I think that's fair

404
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,440
I think it's fair to I don't know. I don't see another way out of here

405
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,680
after a while

406
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,840
You notice a second

407
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,640
Cop car pulls up behind his

408
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,120
Fuck

409
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:29,080
I'm actually getting a little anxious. He gets out of the car as

410
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,760
does the

411
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:38,700
Backup and they talk for a second the guy who is in backup mode goes and gets back in his car

412
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,760
Car stays put

413
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:48,800
Officer McGovern comes back up to the window. He hands you back your identification. You know anything about

414
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:53,560
Shotgun being fired woods

415
00:36:54,680 --> 00:37:00,640
No, sorry officer. I don't I don't know anything about that. He shines a light in your eyes

416
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:09,680
Ma'am, I I know that you're a federal agent. But are you under the influence right now? I don't believe I understand your question, sir. I

417
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,720
Need you to roll law

418
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,620
She's also bleeding from a leg

419
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:23,660
Yeah, he can't see that yet

420
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:34,020
Lindsay have you passed a single role?

421
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:45,820
That's a 51 on a 30 51 on a 30 is not gonna do it ma'am. Will you step out car real quick?

422
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:47,820
Dorian

423
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:56,100
Turns and gives a shoots a quick look at rusty huge and

424
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:02,420
Slowly with a big smile

425
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,740
Opens the door and swings out

426
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:10,740
That

427
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:13,740
T-shirt tied nub

428
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:16,340
And hops down

429
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,380
to the ground

430
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:25,860
Jesus Christ, what the fuck happened? Did you shoot your foot off? What kind of a stupid-ass question is that?

431
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:27,860
No, I did not shoot

432
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:32,780
Here, I'm here looking for people who may have been oh

433
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:36,960
I don't know firing shotguns in the woods and here you are

434
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:44,320
Missing a foot I got attacked by a bear in the woods if you need to really know you're rusty

435
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,320
You want to make us a potion?

436
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:53,280
Okay, can I climb over the middle console and jump in the driver's seat and grab dr. Miller?

437
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:59,480
You are like turned around looking at this situation and you see dr.

438
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,480
Hooch like climbing over

439
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,480
The

440
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:07,320
Chuckster in the front seat after Doreen has gotten out

441
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:12,400
Would I realize that they're planning on killing the cops? I have no idea

442
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:16,100
I wouldn't have thought they were gonna kill the cop. I don't know

443
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:24,480
No, I'm not saying I'm I'm not saying I'm killing the cop. I jump in the driver's seat and grab Doreen and drive away

444
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,880
Yeah, she's trying

445
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:30,320
So we're escaping the cops instead

446
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:35,920
I don't know if I'm strong enough to do that, but I feel like I could that fucking rules

447
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:39,120
Let's find out what happens with dice rolling

448
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:47,040
You you dr. Hooch, yeah as you climb into the driver's seat of the sprinter van

449
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,680
Also, I've forgotten to close the freezer door

450
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,600
My anxiety

451
00:39:55,600 --> 00:40:01,020
I was in a panic clearly. I need either I think athletics

452
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,160
or

453
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:05,160
strength in order to

454
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:14,360
Grab and hold on to Doreen as you want to like punch it out of here. Okay, I'll roll on athletics or on strength

455
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:20,920
Being the person that she's grabbing. Can I also roll to see how I don't know Lindsey. You're a your track record

456
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:25,400
Okay, you're gonna roll alertness of a negative 20 for being on morphine

457
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:30,800
But if you know if you can sense what's happening, then you're gonna give her a plus 20 nice

458
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,480
Thing he's crossed

459
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:39,160
God damn it. She rolled a fucking 97. I

460
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:46,120
Hate these die. So I'm just rolling on my you're just rolling on athletics or strength. Yeah. Okay, I'm gonna roll on string

461
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:50,720
Three on a 50 that's good you grab

462
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:56,800
Doreen marine and you pull her up to where she can at least get one foot on that like step

463
00:40:56,840 --> 00:41:00,160
Part to get up into the sprinter van. Is it her foot or nub? Oh

464
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:04,760
It would be my foot because it's my right foot is the one I still have nice

465
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:12,220
Your foot plants on to that as she grabs on to you and you fucking punch it immediately that backup cop just

466
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:17,240
Sirens blaring again and you see officer Steve McGovern

467
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:20,880
sprints back to get into his police car and

468
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:28,760
The game is now afoot. Once again, Jerome Dyer is in the car with dr. Olivia Miller and he's like, what do I do?

469
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:33,520
What do I do? What do I do? We have to I guess we're driving we have now

470
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,600
Unbelievable drive just drive. All right, or actually

471
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:44,680
We could block them. We could block the cops give the other team a chance

472
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:50,800
I love that and the sprinter van drives past you on the road and Jerome just like

473
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,360
Sploosh

474
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:57,400
Slams on the gas the wheels start turning on this truck as the back end just whips around

475
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:00,120
grabs hold of the ditch and just

476
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:08,440
Kind of flings itself up onto right in the middle of this two-lane country road as the cops begin to drive up

477
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:14,400
he rolled a 26 on his drive against fail on the cop the cop just

478
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:18,700
Cannot get through on in time and literally just stops in the road

479
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:21,540
You are looking past Jerome Dyer and

480
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:29,320
Through the driver's side window. You can see this cop. It's headlights shining directly in on this truck

481
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:34,280
You have two asleep people in the back and his sirens are going and the other cop is

482
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:39,780
Driving down into the ditch to get around you. Dr. Miller. What do I do? What do I do? Fuck?

483
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:42,580
He rolls down the window and he's just like sorry

484
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:44,740
Sorry, sorry

485
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:50,900
Drive drive block the other one as well and just fumble like we pretend that we're making a mistake here, you know

486
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,900
like continue, okay, so he's

487
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:58,960
Fucking 22. Yes. Okay with it

488
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:05,300
With a 22 he he's like you're brilliant. You're brilliant. I'm an idiot

489
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:11,320
We're fumbling and he's just like doing that like Austin Powers like reverse for

490
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,280
Reverse for sorry

491
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:18,960
I'm not used to a stick shift leaning out the side of the window as he just continues to block one

492
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:23,760
And then the other one starts to go and he blocks that one and then he goes back the other way and he's like, sorry

493
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:26,120
Sorry. Oh my gosh. I'm so sorry

494
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:28,680
Perfect. It's perfect

495
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:38,800
You're right everything up to this point has been really we've been making perfect sense up until now

496
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,640
Oh my god

497
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:53,760
With a critical success, I'm not gonna have them get like super angry or like too upset there they buy the whole

498
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:58,680
They're like honest mistake

499
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:05,480
Well, honestly Jerome Jerome Dyer looks like a nerd and these two Arkansas cops are just like wow

500
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:09,560
This fucking idiot cannot drive this truck

501
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:16,960
He honestly doesn't even deserve to be driving that f-250 that thing is a nice machine and I just don't understand how

502
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:19,500
You know someone like diet

503
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:25,760
They and with that I'm gonna need one more drive check from

504
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:33,360
dr. Hooch, so I've pulled Doreen into my lap at this point. Mm-hmm and

505
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:39,440
Shut the door, so I'm driving with Doreen on my lap as fast as I can

506
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:44,280
Uh-huh. I like the thing Chuck. Do you want to pull the rain off? I

507
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,440
Mean not like that. Do you want to?

508
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:53,220
Do you wanna get Maria I would love to get her off. Yeah

509
00:44:55,040 --> 00:45:01,120
Off of the driver dr. Hooch and dr. Hooch as you're driving on these long winding country roads

510
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:07,600
You're gonna need to make a drive check to get away clean if you can pass a drive

511
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:13,120
I'm gonna say at a plus 20 because of the extreme effort of

512
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:16,960
Jerome Dyer and dr. Miller if you can pass

513
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:22,520
This then you will get away Scott free shit. All right, I'm rolling on a 40

514
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:25,640
Are you so nervous? Yeah

515
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:30,380
Damn it 96. This is not a crit

516
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:33,240
sacletus go

517
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:37,320
Maybe like we still make it we just run over like a rabbit or something

518
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:47,400
It's a rabbit someone has to be something has to be sacrificed. Oh, no, no, no, sorry, that's my bad. You make it

519
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,400
Yeah, of course

520
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:56,840
Excellent, we're we're rabbits. We're any rabbits harmed. No big deal drive. No deal whatsoever. Uh

521
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:04,880
Yeah, for sure no doubt no doubt no doubt no doubt I eventually Jerome Dyer

522
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:15,000
After just apologizing his ass off these cops head past you move on and he looks at dr. Miller and he's like

523
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,760
staples

524
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:23,440
Where are we where we head? Well, hopefully we've given them enough time to get to the coordinates

525
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:30,080
We should head over there as well. Yeah for sure. Okay. So, um, you did well well done Jerome. Oh, thank you

526
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:32,320
Thank you. Your team is

527
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:38,880
Wild. Yeah, have you worked with him before I have not and I never will again

528
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:44,080
Cut to

529
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:50,480
No, it's fine you don't have to work with us it's just cut to Christmas

530
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:54,600
And

531
00:46:54,600 --> 00:47:02,480
Doreen and Chuck and the whippet are all wearing matching Christmas sweaters and zooming with with rusty and dr

532
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:04,200
Miller and

533
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,000
What song was playing?

534
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
white Christmas

535
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:17,600
Over the radio not yet. So you guys are driving to your drop-off point

536
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:21,040
It's like I gave it such a nice little bowtie at the end

537
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:26,920
You're right the sprinter van and the truck with

538
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:31,800
Jerome and dr. Miller Carl Lambert and Janice Ruth

539
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,400
both arrive

540
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:39,360
down in this warehouse district in a small town in Arkansas as

541
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:46,440
a huge warehouse door and the pin that is dropped on each of your clean phones

542
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,740
with cases on them

543
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:54,520
Allie I actually saw dr. Hooch take hers off and throw it out the window

544
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:02,540
You guys arrive at roughly the same time and

545
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:07,260
The pin is inside this one specific warehouse

546
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:15,200
It's got a normal door next to one of those like enormous like corrugated metal doors that can open up for like

547
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:18,560
You know a sprinter van to drive through it or something like that

548
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:21,360
When you guys arrive

549
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:22,480
the

550
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:28,520
Large door begins to roll up and inside you just see like bright lights

551
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:33,800
Shining out so that you can't really see into the darkness inside this warehouse

552
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,360
Sprinter van drives in

553
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:38,360
red truck drives in

554
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:40,760
As

555
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:46,680
The doors close you see a single police car pulling up

556
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:53,460
There are two men in this warehouse that is

557
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:57,920
Blocked off to where you can't really see what's going on in the back of the warehouse

558
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,920
There's some makeshift walls up front

559
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:07,760
Just kind of like dividers and they're the only two people on this side of the dividers. One of them's like ah

560
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:12,980
Man, Jim, we got cops. You wanna go take care of it

561
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:15,180
Oh

562
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:21,620
Okay, yeah, yeah for sure should I go what do you think Santa Claus or Easter Bunny

563
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:33,260
Guy comes back out like two minutes later as you know, the first guy with the high voice he comes around

564
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:37,820
He's talking to you guys. She's like, okay, what's the deal? Give me the rundown?

565
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:43,180
You start talking telling stories like you're trying to be pretty vague

566
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:46,860
But you have to let him know about this fucking foot inside the freezer

567
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:52,260
And as you're about to start describing like the actual gritty details of it

568
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:56,020
the other guy comes out literally in full Santa regalia and

569
00:49:57,020 --> 00:50:00,620
he's putting a silencer on the end of a pistol and

570
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:03,420
He looks at you guys and he's like

571
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:06,420
If anybody sees and they tell

572
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:09,700
What are they gonna fucking believe Santa's out killing cops?

573
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:14,580
So he heads out the front door with the gun behind his back

574
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:18,380
Maybe if he's an alien pedophile Santa

575
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:21,500
Colbeck

576
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:26,140
Okay, so we're gonna want to get everything

577
00:50:27,580 --> 00:50:32,900
There's a lot of you is this one team or two teams what's going on here? We're one big happy team

578
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:36,460
Ain't that right? What about the sleeping couple?

579
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:41,580
What's their deal? Those are civilians civilians that were on the scene

580
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:47,060
you will need to take care of them to she glances at the silencer and she's like

581
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:53,620
The perhaps not that way but yeah, I was gonna say did it do they have any evidence?

582
00:50:54,300 --> 00:51:00,860
No, are they like trusted in society is like people with like they have a YouTube following what kind?

583
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:08,260
Probably like 200 people max. I don't know. Yeah, it's like I think I wrote down. It's a hundred and seventy-nine loyal followers

584
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:13,380
Well, it's like they say the first hundred followers is toughest one

585
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:18,060
But she's like I'm sure that

586
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:26,320
I'm sure that they can be convinced that you know something went down here, but they don't have any evidence and as far as I know

587
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:33,560
Yeah, if they don't if they don't know where this is and they don't have any evidence no one's gonna believe them

588
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:35,560
You said it was a fucking

589
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:40,400
Bigfoot that turned into a boy corpse. So they're gonna be fine. They're gonna go back out in the world

590
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:44,320
I'll tell you exactly what's gonna happen. They're gonna go back out in the world. They're gonna keep making their YouTube thing

591
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:51,000
they're gonna be like this guy who helped us was in on the government conspiracy and then anyone who knows anything is gonna be like

592
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
I

593
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:58,720
Was a really good heart sound I think and when she looks at the sleeping Carl

594
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:01,480
It seems to be his brother

595
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:04,480
Actually, we could also make an argument that

596
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:07,260
He killed his own brother

597
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:14,000
That's cold. Wow, that's a huge age difference between these siblings, right?

598
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:19,700
Actually, yes, let's not play that one then because his brother disappeared a long time ago

599
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:26,900
Damn oh shit. I bet he's done. He opens up the warehouse door and Santa Claus drives the cop car

600
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:33,580
All right, well I've got a clean car for you guys and

601
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:38,380
Make sure to tell Santa what you want for Christmas on your way out

602
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:45,460
I think you all did great. Thank you so much for working with me on this

603
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:49,140
I'm sure I will be seeing you around she says lying and

604
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:51,820
then

605
00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:54,860
Gets into one of the cars and he talks to Jerome

606
00:52:54,860 --> 00:53:01,820
He's like, could you drop me off and then she says like a nondescript station where she can get out get on like a train

607
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:07,060
Or bus or something does not give her Facebook name to these people

608
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:15,980
And sends a text to her daughter expecting to not get a response fucking teenagers I

609
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:17,980

625
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:47,660

627
00:54:53,860 --> 00:55:00,500
Hospital do they have lasagna? I'm sure they do. It's probably not your mama's lasagna, but I'm sure they got it tight

628
00:55:01,420 --> 00:55:02,780
I

629
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:07,020
Love that neither of me or dr. Miller thought to take you to the hospital

630
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:10,020
I'm just like bleeding

631
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:14,020
That was

632
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:24,660
That's the best we can do did you like why would you apologize?

00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:08,560
Yeah, Ellie, thank you so much for coming on and guesting on the show so much fun the first time Delta Green

641
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:14,600
Which is really cool. What a fucked up world. I can't believe yeah, how did you how'd you feel about it?

642
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:17,040
Did make you happy? No, it's it's a great system though

643
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:23,160
I must say that like it's probably one of the most like the system really makes sense. It's easy to get into I

644
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:26,440
Really enjoyed it. It's a lot of fun and I love that

645
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:30,720
It's like the action economy is really cool as well like with just one one

646
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:34,840
You know you do one thing and it's just like alright next up. It's it's really cool. I like it a lot

647
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:40,440
Yeah, I love Delta Green for getting new people into role-playing because that you don't need to know anything

648
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:45,800
Really too much, you know, if your handler is willing to walk you through some stuff

649
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:50,160
You can get new people into role-playing really easily, which is fun, which is super fun. So

650
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:52,480

Oh

666
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:18,680
Oh

667
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:48,680
Oh

668
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:18,680
Oh

669
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:48,680
Oh

670
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:05,200
Carl Lambert and Janice Ruth were dropped off back at Bush HQ where their trucks were parked when they went inside

671
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:11,420
Carl found a thumb drive in the pocket of a jacket. He had worn sometime before

672
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:15,000
Dr. Ann Falsom arrived

673
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:18,680
Oh

674
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:25,320
Officer Steve McGovern was reported missing sometime near the end of that shift

675
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:30,600
His GPS location was tracked to the warehouse district

676
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:34,160
Inside an empty warehouse

677
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:40,200
Sat an elegantly wrapped present in red and green gold

678
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:47,840
And after a special unit opened the gift they received just about the worst thing

679
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:50,160
could ever get a

680
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:52,160
lack of closure

681
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:05,480
However

682
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:07,360
earlier in his shift

683
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:14,400
Officer McGovern called for backup and then failed to get into a high-speed pursuit and

684
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:19,880
After he called in the plates of this fan. He had tried to pull over

685
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:27,840
He called back to get it on the record that the chase involved a sprinter van

686
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:33,200
driven by an intoxicated FBI agent named

687
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:36,280
Doreen

688
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:39,360
Oh

689
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:09,360
Oh

690
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:39,360
Oh

691
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:55,560
For Christmas, I would like some Mentos whip it Christmas is where it's at. Let me tell you we'd be Christmas
