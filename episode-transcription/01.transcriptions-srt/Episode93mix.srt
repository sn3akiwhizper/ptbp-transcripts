24
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,960
which the army declined why on earth would they decline that

25
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,960
there's no way to present what just happened

55
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:43,600
happened so i'm reading this article and it says uh i mean

56
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,040
sometimes i just edit that out

57
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:53,280
thomas were you on the call when i was talking about the product for the commercial shoot i

58
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:59,760
did today no i'm not going to say the name of it but it's a wearable hand sanitizer and lotion

59
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:08,080
dispenser that goes around your wrist cool and it looks like a giant cock ring awesome all of

60
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:16,720
those things are cool the pot it's like pods full of one is full of lotion and the other one is full

61
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:23,680
of hand sanitizer and they're on either side of your wrist it's a two inch long pod so your wrist

62
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:32,160
is now a solid what seven eight inches wide uh-huh but at any time you can just be like

63
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:36,960
so you could be walking through the park and somebody offers you a hot dog and you say oh

64
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:41,840
yeah i could do that because i've got my hand sanitizer right here let me lotion up for this

65
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:50,960
dog real quick it squirts out like one of those like uh gel deodorant sticks that you just kind

66
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:56,400
of like squeeze out through holes on the top of it that's exactly what it looks like as it squeezes

67
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:02,240
out so walk me through okay you you've you've pushed the pouch and it's squirted do you take

68
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:07,760
your other hand and rub is that how it works so the hand that you are squeezing with it just kind

69
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:17,760
of like stays on the product and then you rub off the lotion it was honestly one of the most batshit

70
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:23,040
things i've ever seen i was like this is a joke right you gotta build up your imdb

71
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,360

72
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,480
i should have asked for one instead of getting paid that would have been that would have been

73
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:43,360
fun i could put cool stuff in it mayonnaise and mustard oh my god then you could get a sandwich

74
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:49,520
going anytime anywhere i like where your head's at that's exactly what you'd use it for

75
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:57,120
that's great mine would be sriracha and uh freddy's fry salt into it gooped up in there

77
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:11,280

78
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,480
have a little cheese ranch

79
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,760
i would just turn mine both of them into a chia pet

80
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:28,720
seriously though uh home tip you can buy their fucking uh their burger and fry seasoning at the

81
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,520
at the restaurants you can probably order it online but if you're making burgers at home

82
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:40,000
just toss in some fucking uh freddy's seasoning with your meat and like you're gonna blast

83
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:46,400
everybody's burgers away nice season you're meeting then you're gonna blast is all

84

what comp is this a competition or are is all grilling a competition yes yes no see but that's

85
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,760
just because tom is lost already so yeah uh not according to my girlfriend and mom

86
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,080

88
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:26,720

89
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:32,880
is the name uh all all old western groups have a have a cool name right the magnificent seven

90
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,480
others i'm sure those are usually applied afterwards i think the fucking four

91
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:46,080
fast and the four yes well that's it there are five of us here does he

92
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:54,720
yeah custom i mean not that i do associate with this group yet but hypothetically if there was

93
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:00,800
one would would you count really i feel like i'm the leader honestly he's been with us the whole

94
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:07,520
time that's interesting that's i mean clearly uh clearly the judge is the alpha i think we were all

95
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:13,360
looking at every pace to take control of this group at any point now if if bobby's part of

96
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:20,320
the group we could be the fab five i don't understand the reference it just made it up

97
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:29,760
the fab five it is professor you're gonna have to learn to be more oh i missed the joke fuck

98
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:36,160
i'll hear it when i edit i just i just we're the fab we're the fab five where's the fab five

99
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,040
that's that's not a joke

100
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:48,160
and with that we're back into the reality is the 1880 some things with a burp from judge ephraim

101
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:56,320
courtland the five of you are surveying from a distance the land bobby's from missouri

102
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:02,800
nice i served him once yeah oh he's cool yeah preacher sheriff bobby custard not you

103
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:15,200
uh you see that the gay man from the future new the typically bustling new mine is a ghost town

104
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,240
normally men and women who work for coals contention mining company would be hustling

105
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:26,080
about up and down stairs from platform to platform hauling loads of equipment with

106
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:33,360
the conveyor continuously running a loud humming and the thick stench of sweat in the air today

107
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:42,800
however it's quiet except for those same low barking growls that you heard earlier and there

108
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:51,760
is a swarm i'm talking 12. is that a swarm is that enough for swarm 12 vultures

109
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:56,320
is a lot of vultures observe everyone a small swarm of vultures

110
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:05,280
you see him around here quite a bit lots of death and whatnot is it inherently weird to us that the

111
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:11,920
mine isn't operating today or is it it is is it a known thing always in operation maybe they're

112
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:20,400
installing fans in the mine that'd be awful nice of him i ain't known silas coal to be particularly

113
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:26,400
worried about being nice to folks that's true he did steal my copper wire i don't know he he

114
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:32,000
he does a lot for well even the courthouse you know got electricity before i guess it might have

115
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:38,480
gotten stolen but we don't exactly know by whom except for miss kitty lizzie said it was his wife

116
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:46,000
the little girl she said it was mary cole yeah you were right there didn't you hear i was right

117
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:52,800
there huh let's go get her we can find out about the smashed watermelons or whatever but i need to

118
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:57,440
get my wire i think we should probably stay the course to find the grave robbing miss kitty at

119
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:02,480
this point that's that's kind of top priority we don't want any more graves dug up yeah i think

120
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:10,240
your wire comes a second here afram judge why don't why don't we tie everything up uh later on

121
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:15,280
in the day with your wire yeah well i figured if we were heading down there i'd bring it up but

122
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:22,160
should we follow these horse tracks or the tracks do lead back down through the gate of the mine

123
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:27,840
uh into the property that the coals own i'd like to go down there and touch this goo

124
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:36,960
and you see that at the gate at his daily post is the mining company's security guard becker

125
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:45,440
piston you know becker was a co-worker of silas coal down in the mine but when silas bought the

126
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:51,520
mine he pulled becker up out of the ground sat him at that gate and he's been there ever since

127
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:58,640
becker piston lives on the grounds far on the other side of the mine from the coal residence

128
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:05,360
so basically one far end becker piston lives and you got the mine in the middle and then far on the

129
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:11,920
other side you've got the residents of the coals and over the top of the entrance of the mine

130
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:19,360
silas has built a three-story building with his office are we writing up to him

131
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:27,760
oh that's up to you guys how do you would we know if becker is uh typically a violent person

132
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:32,800
or anything or like unreasonable or do we just not would we not have known him in our day-to-day

133
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:41,360
goings-ons going awnings is going awnings the word uh he is one of the chillest people

134
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:47,440
that has ever existed not a lot bad happens around the mine silas runs a really tight ship

135

00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:49,520
to hit all errors after i do that i light the cigarette up and take a few drags and then kind

169
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:55,360
of like hand it reach over to horace you know i don't agree with you about much but i do agree

183
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:35,280
the cigarette since he's been losing a little sanity he figures something to help calm his

184
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:41,040
nerves a little bit but not a lot because he's not his vices is alky hall and then he takes he

185
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:45,920
takes a big old pull off the flask though but he wipes it first because he thinks it's nasty

186
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:52,160
because it is it is it's nasty every pace go ahead and roll listen for me

you listen and listen and there's nothing

189
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:18,400
except for dumbasses doing drugs making their characters a little bit less effective

190
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,920
every pace you're listening well you're just you're just sitting there but well during this

191
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:40,160
whole conversation about passing the drugs and doing the drugs and everything you hear from the

192
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:49,040
home of the coals some sort of spat two voices being raised back and forth and then with that

193
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:55,040
successful listen check you hear you can just make it out it's just traveling on the wind

194
00:23:55,280 --> 00:24:02,720
just enough to reach your ears are you here silas cole say yeah i said it's it's fine

195
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:12,480
i know how to handle it i know how to handle her she's out just trust me i know how to handle her

196
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:20,640
or it i know how to handle it i know how to handle her okay she's out just trust me

197
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:25,120
just trust me okay that's all

198
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:38,960
hey hey everybody quiet down quiet down let the coals they're they're fighting about something

199
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:43,200
over there's something going on over at the coal house i don't know how the listen check works if

200
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:50,320
i do if i point that out can they all hear it then can he share his with us oh we can

201
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:57,440
we just make checks or uh no however at this exact moment the door of the coal residence

202
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:07,360
opens and you see silas cole roughed up hair huge pants wearing a belt and suspenders

203
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:18,640
carrying a rug over his shoulder and he lugs it into the back of his wagon

204
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:27,280
one of his wagons here on the coal property and he begins unhinging his horses and preparing them

205
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:38,960
for a trip and i'm gonna roll to see and uh he goes about his business slowly and steady-handedly

206
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:43,440
oh shit fellas i think there might be i think there might be somebody in that rug i heard him

207
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:49,120
say i heard him say that he he had handled it and and he knew how to handle her and that she was out

208
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:52,320
and i didn't know what that meant but what if he meant that she was knocked out what if she's in

209
00:25:52,320 --> 00:26:01,360
that rug i believe that that theory is plausible mr pace judge sheriff should we yeah should we

210
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:09,680
i say confront ourselves should we confront him now or i say any excuse to string that

211
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:16,800
boy but judge he is the reason that this town is what it is if we get rid of silas cole

212
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:22,880
contention is nothing you're gonna get him let him get away with murder well we get at least i mean

213
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:28,720
we could talk to him before we're done hanging by a rope well i wasn't gonna hang him before

214
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:33,360
we find out who would kill i didn't say he killed anybody i think she might just be knocked out

215
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:38,480
it's he says she's out custard i think we should ride which way hey becker anybody else come

216
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:56,240
through here recently uh no just the normal stuff no work today so why is that mary and

217
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:07,040
silas had stuff they needed to take care of sounds fishy well i didn't have fish last night but the

218
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:14,800
night before i did oh you said sounds not smells i was worried that maybe shut up i was letting

219
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:21,120
off a stink that you shut up let's go custard i think we should ride towards silas and stop him

220
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:25,600
before he does something he might regret hey on now hang on now there's a chance that silas is

221
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:30,400
the good guy here what if he found miss kitty she was in a tizzy she he knocked her out and he's

222
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:35,680
bringing her back into town as we speak maybe we should go ask about that in a rug i mean if

223
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:42,320
he's doing something that's okay we get to talk to him and feel him out see if he's nervous you

224
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:48,560
know are we like uh hidden behind a rock or something no uh roll stealth actually all of

225
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:56,400
us asking that question no just thomas i just just wanted to make a joke about coughing and saying

226
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,080
keith really loud and seeing if he looks

227

74 on professor horse green super stealthy nope he has the baseline 20

228
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:20,560

231
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:42,000

291
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:31,840
onto his face a big like i haven't drank water only whiskey recently so it's just a thick

292
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:42,240
whiskey chewing tobacco blob just sticks to his forehead uh yeah go ahead and roll a d6

293
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:47,760
and we'll see if it's a one two or three he'll be disabled for one round if it's a four five

294
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:58,800
six he's disabled for two rounds five two rounds uh fucking thick ass glob just covers both his eyes

295
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:07,200
fill him with lead boys and can i just stumble can i jump off my horse backwards

296
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:14,560
and no fuck you no great turn you did stay on your horse i'm telling a story

297
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:24,160
he stumbles backwards and his hand comes off of his holster and he just falls through his knees

298
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:31,280
and begins collecting dirt from the ground and trying to get the the juices out of his

299
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:39,920
eyes and he's just like oh it burns preacher sheriff dr bobby custard hops off of his horse

300
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:50,240
and grabs a pair of shackles from his side bag and begins approaching silas cole and it is everett

301
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:58,000
pace's turn he's gonna he's gonna hold out his hands to bobby custard help me down help me down

302
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:09,600
the reason that preacher sheriff dr bobby custard couldn't get all the way to putting the

303
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:19,920
shackles onto silas cole is because he turned around halfway and helps everett pace off of

304
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:27,680
bucky i put you up there it would be a shame if i didn't help you down it just go quicker is all

306
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:37,920

307
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:46,000

308
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:53,360
of these shoes is something you've never seen before first off they're like kind of white-ish

309
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:59,840

310
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:13,520

science experiments all over town just blending in

337
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:43,840

341
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:04,640
ah henry points it at himself and wants to end it all who does oris

342
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,400

343
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,640
no it's not the end we're not there yet oh if that happened

344
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:21,840
fuck you let me take chorus to the future uh let me go p real quick also there's no

345

349
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:50,880
thomas that thought that green light was lit baby he thought there were tubes on that gun

350
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:58,160
and he was ready to leave but it also would make any sense to uh for his character to shoot himself

351
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:01,440
henry henry would never do something like that

352
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:11,040
so

353
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:15,520
the guy who i prevented from drinking his own throw up one night because he

354
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:20,960
because he's because he threw up into his water glass after drinking games and he was about to

355
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:28,240
drink and i was like no i'd like grab his cup from him it's like you're gonna die you said that

356
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:38,800
at a funeral do what what are you eating there bud hot dog

357
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:46,640
i can't wait to try to cut that into something

358
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:53,760
damn a hot dog every episode just starts with hot dog

359
00:44:54,640 --> 00:45:00,320
it's like our absolute get it cut to the drums of no backbone

360
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:14,800
do you guys want me to make you one yeah please boil some dogs over and leave them on your

361
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:21,040
doorstep for me wait boil you don't like boiled dogs no you gotta put it in the microwave

362
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:26,080
oh boilings no that is all you have to do microwave with water fucking put it in

363
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:29,920
put it in the bun you don't even need water just put it in the bun and microwave it for

364
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:34,240
30 seconds and it tastes exactly like a fucking boiled dog that's true i don't like my buns

365
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:39,520
microwaved you hey man if you want to feed yourself in exactly 30 seconds that's actually

366
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:45,440
a good i never do it cannot be beat do you like a good cold hot dog no you don't know

367
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:49,760
it's different it's different when i will eat a cold hot dog i used to like cold hot

368
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:55,280
dogs and then i had one recently and it was not the thing that i remember like my taste buds had

369
00:45:55,280 --> 00:46:02,000
changed or something i was not into it leaves on your teeth yeah exactly uh positive i'd say no

370
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:08,320
hot dogs are bad the type of dogs they used to use when extinct so for you the cold ones don't

371
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:15,440
taste as good now that's true i like bread pug meat yeah if i'm eating a dick sandwich it's going

372
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:20,320
to be a brat for sure controversial opinion but hot dogs are way better i like both for different

373
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:26,000
reasons but i think i like hot dogs more my dad has been making his own brats lately and they're

374
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:37,280
fucking great my daddy's brats are better than yours oh no he's back he's arrived i love my dad's

375
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:43,920
sausage so what i what i like to do that god if you boil them and you slice them dogs in half

376
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:48,720
lengthwise i think like where and then you fry them in a pan hot dog style yeah that can be good

377
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:52,480
they get a good crust on the bottom and you can throw them on a sandwich instead of eating them

378
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:58,160
on a bun because they come out to like being more of a rectangular square so you got log sandwich

379
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:02,800
yeah it's flat on the bottom and then like round on the top if that makes sense oh no i love it

380
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:08,960
the shape you cut it completely in half or do you leave a little bit so it's all one piece no i don't

381
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:13,680
do that oh you mean like yeah so they splay open right but it's still connected yeah but it's still

382
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:18,800
open like so yeah if this is your hot dog like a hoagie and then you splay it open no like

383
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:26,800
justin's mom when you split my mom in half and fryer or like that fucking dude in bone tomahawk

384
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:33,200
holy shit have you guys seen that movie bone tomahawk bone tomahawk these guys should both

399
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:35,840
this wagon the sun is high in the sky and the rug casts a shadow directly beneath it as sweat drips

400
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:45,280
from each of your brows and this humid summer thick air are you gonna thunk the other side

401
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:50,960
onto the ground or are you going to like slowly place it onto the ground i figured we'd set it

402
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:56,000
down and then give it a fun yank so it all unravels horse green says that to the group

403
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:01,360
i think we should lay it gently on the ground and then give the end a fun uh a fun yank so it

404
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:06,560
unravels quickly and whatever's inside comes whoop just zipping out but i mean it's it's

405
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:10,160
it's a person they they could they could be knocked out they could they could get hurt if

406
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:15,760
we're not careful here whoever is inside sorry yeah i think we should be careful i think we

407
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:22,480
should over ever come on we can we can do this alone there's a little bit of urgency in evert's

408
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:27,040
process here i mean he thinks there's a chance that there's a knocked out unconscious person

409
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:32,560
in here maybe not just a dead body so he's gonna he's gonna try and get her to the ground and

410
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:37,360
start maybe unrolling it maybe get around to the other side so he can make sure the head is there

411
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:44,720
and that not not bashed or anything and he wants to unravel the carpet and jack helps as ever at

419
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:47,360
rug is wearing clothes that you've never seen before and colors of cloth so bright you'd think

420
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:57,920
that this teenage girl might be some sort of royalty and her hair is patchy and thin on top

421
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:07,680
the scalp kind of peeling away holes have formed in the middle of it and all of her skin is the

422
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:15,920
same way at her cheekbones the skin is so thin that there's a slight cut underneath each eye

423
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:23,120
fresh cut and so blood is pouring down like tears from eyes that are right below tear ducts

424
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:27,680
but her eyes are closed until they aren't

425
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:42,400
