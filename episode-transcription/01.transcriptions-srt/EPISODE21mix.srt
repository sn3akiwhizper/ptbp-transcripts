00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,160
Hello friends engulfed in flames, it's your local firefighter Wolf the Dog and I'm here

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:11,960
to spray your burning bodies down with all the hot gossip and news from Contingent at

3
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:15,960
694.2 BTBP my babies.

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:22,400
Now this week on Howlin with Wolf, your firefighter Wolf the Dog read some dope shit on the Glass

5
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:32,780
Canon Podcast subreddit, user BFEvans19 recommended 694.2 BTBP writing, among other lovely things

6
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:38,180
they quote, wanted to bring these guys to everyone's attention because I think they

7
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:44,780
bring the same energy to gaming that the GCP does and I expect that a lot of GCP fans would

8
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:51,300
also enjoy pretending to be people, y'all that shit means so much to your living Lexington

9
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,820
Wolf the Dog.

10
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:56,700
Speaking of tragedy, it's time for the news.

11
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:02,140
Last time was basically combat from the time the Robotman blasted the door from its frame,

12
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:07,780
to when the Robotman almost cut off Officer Bishop's arm, to when the Robotman froze at

13
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:13,260
the command of Officer Pettymore, to when the Robotman's torso flew out the window gripping

14
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,260
the throat of Officer Vigna.

15
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:21,700
Thank beans, he poked that terminator top in the eye just in time to escape before the

16
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,820
metal fella exploded like fireworks.

17
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:30,660
Speaking of fireworks, we got a musical mortar for y'all today and they're here to blow y'all's

18
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:37,060
brains up with their sound, it's kudzu with no backbone.

19
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:55,340
You got shit on your balls?

20
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:58,540
I got shit on my balls, you're exactly right.

21
00:01:58,540 --> 00:01:59,540
I was leaning forward.

22
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:00,540
That's good luck.

23
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,540
Yeah.

24
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:05,300
Well, it took me like three wipes of just my balls to get the poop off of them.

25
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:10,180
Because it like hit full on, I was like, oh, I don't know that that has ever happened to

26
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,180
me before.

27
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:14,500
I think it's because it's a hot day and I'm wearing black jeans, so I had long balls.

28
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:19,860
I got two Cadbury eggs today.

29
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:25,940
At the end of the last episode, the large metal man's torso unattached from its lower

30
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:31,300
half and a small jetpack began shooting flames from the bottom of its torso.

31
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:36,220
It grabbed Keith by the throat and flew through the window of the living room into the front

32
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,220
yard.

33
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:41,580
Keith bit into the mechanical hand and two of his teeth broke off.

34
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,140
Keith then poked its one good eye.

35
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:48,940
The thing dropped Keith onto the front lawn and then flew up into the night sky where

36
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:52,100
it exploded like fireworks.

37
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,100
What do you do?

38
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:58,780
I cheer because I love fireworks.

39
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:02,100
I think I just moan in pain for a while.

40
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,100
Yeah.

41
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,900
I might be real close to passing out from pain.

42
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:12,540
I try to get up off the ground, but having, I assume my ribs broken from that crowbar

43
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:24,580
and then dropped on the ground, I lay down and just kind of like, oh, and just like,

44
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:28,300
if you can in post, just repeat that like eight or nine times.

45
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,580
That's what I do.

46
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,980
You need to role play that.

47
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:33,980
Don't though.

48
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:34,980
Yeah, please don't.

49
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:38,260
I want to make my way to the front window and just look out.

50
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,180
Keith, Keith, you out there?

51
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,180
Hey.

52
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,180
Oh good.

53
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,180
It didn't take you.

54
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,180
I'm okay.

55
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:50,740
As you look out, the window is completely broken open and you know, some wind is hitting

56
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:57,660
the curtains and blowing them about and the cool night air is blowing in on your face

57
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:03,340
and you're now, after all of the adrenaline of the situation, you all are starting to

58
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:09,820
feel the extreme pain this metal man has put you through.

59
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:10,980
Ow!

60
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:13,780
That metal man put me through extreme pain.

61
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:18,300
Would first aid help me at all since I'm not like bleeding or anything, I'm just...

62
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:23,260
You're also just like laying in a yard so you don't really have anything with you.

63
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,260
That's true.

64
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:28,220
I want to pull my shirt off and try and first aid my arm with it.

65
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:31,140
All right, go ahead and roll first aid for me.

66
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,140
Uh, fail.

67
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,540
71 on a 30.

68
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,540
Okay.

69
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:38,140
So I just casually drape it over the blood.

70
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:44,340
I would like to pull off my cell phone and call the EMTs and have them roll first aid

71
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,340
on us.

72
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,780
That makes sense.

73
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:52,260
I'm going to get up on my feet out of the yard and try to, as quickly as I can, get

74
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,700
into the house or close to the house.

75
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:59,060
That way any falling debris doesn't hit me from the beautiful explosion that just happened

76
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,060
above me.

77
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,060
Absolutely.

78
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:09,540
I'm going to go inside and I see Clark attempting to do his arm up and I'm going to go up to

79
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:13,180
him, grab his shirt, and try to finish what he started.

80
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:18,180
I got a 31 on a 60 for first aid.

81
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,180
All right, roll a d4.

82
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,180
Pyramid.

83
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,180
Clark, you get three.

84
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,180
Three hit points back.

85
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,180
It's feeling better already.

86
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,180
Thank you.

87
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,180
Thank you.

88
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,180
You owe me.

89
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,980
That's what any a contention PD officer would do.

90
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:33,980
I would hope.

91
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:36,580
I feel like I'm at about seven health.

92
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:40,620
It's just barely above me, Clark.

93
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:46,180
And I start to laugh and then immediately my ribs just hurt and I lay on the ground.

94
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,180
John!

95
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,620
John, you okay?

96
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,180
He's like five feet away from you.

97
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,180
Oh.

98
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,180
No.

99
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,180
No.

100
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,180
What about you?

101
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,180
Keith, patch me up.

102
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,760
Keith, go see if you can help him.

103
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,760
Help me up.

104
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,180
Grab my left arm.

105
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,180
I use my good arm.

106
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:07,180
Guys, you can just stay there, the EMTs are coming.

107
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:09,280
Wait, what's wrong with you?

108
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,380
I was attacked by a giant metal man.

109
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,900
Yeah, I mean we all were.

110
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:17,100
What happened specifically to you so that I can first aid you and maybe get you a couple

111
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,260
hit points back?

112
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:22,220
He tried to pinch my ribs together, but a lucky surgical screw.

113
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:30,060
I believe there's actually still a hand, a metal hand halfway inside John Lee Pettymore's

114
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,060
side.

115
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:35,460
Yeah, so instead of answering, I just point to the metal hand sticking in on my side.

116
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:38,100
Can I tell, is it like broken the skin or is it like...

117
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,100
Yes.

118
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,100
There's a hand in me.

119
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,100
Okay.

120
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,100
Tried to make me its puppet.

121
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,780
I am going to attempt first aid on him as well.

122
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,820
I would like to wait for the EMTs.

123
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:51,620
Yeah, you should probably wait for the EMTs.

124
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:57,940
Keith, no offense man, but I want the professionals to remove this hand from my side.

125
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:58,940
That's yeah, I agree.

126
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:02,020
Yeah, I'm going to wait for them too because there's nothing.

127
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:05,100
I look down at my side, my just side is bruised.

128
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:11,020
I can walk, but it hurts to move my arms and to laugh, which is something I love doing.

129
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:12,020
Did you guys see a robot?

130
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,020
That was a robot.

131
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:18,680
I mean, I watched him fly up into the sky and explode like a beautiful firework.

132
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,620
So either he was a robot or...

133
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:24,980
I'm pretty good at his job as a firework technician.

134
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:27,340
Can you guys all roll sanity for me?

135
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:30,780
Ooh, I crit pass.

136
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:31,780
I crit pass.

137
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:32,780
Shit.

138
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:37,060
This isn't the first time I've confronted the terrifying truth about robots in our world.

139
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,060
Ooh, pass.

140
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,060
14.

141
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,060
I failed.

142
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,060
Okay.

143
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,060
Because I was first hand.

144
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,060
Saw it.

145
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,060
Clark, you lose.

146
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,060
No sanity.

147
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,060
I get it first hand.

148
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,060
Nice.

149
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,060
Right, John Lee?

150
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,060
First hand.

151
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,060
Yeah, I get it buddy.

152
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,900
I'm gonna lose one sanity.

153
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:56,220
And Keith, if you could roll a D6 and have it for me.

154
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,220
One.

155
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:01,740
I love fireworks, so I was more just stoked than scared.

156
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:07,260
Before the EMTs get over here, I do want to go sit down at that piano, play a little chopsticks.

157
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:13,620
When you walk over and sit down at the piano, you start playing it, but no sound comes out.

158
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:18,940
And when you kind of lean forward and looking inside, there are no strings inside this piano.

159
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,820
Can I do a search to see what I do see?

160
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:22,820
Yeah.

161
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:26,380
What do I see?

162
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,820
You see no strings inside the piano.

163
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,540
He rolled an 80 on his search.

164
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:33,060
You see the inside of a piano.

165
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:34,540
Is this a guitar?

166
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:39,860
So I want to stand up and I want to open the bench that I'm sitting on.

167
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,340
Ooh, nice.

168
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:42,580
As a piano player.

169
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:46,340
Yeah, I know a couple piano songs.

170
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:49,660
I saw Billy Joel and Elton John on tour.

171
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:57,300
There is sheet music for a song entitled The Rise of the End.

172
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:00,380
Can I put the sheet music up and attempt to play it?

173
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:02,180
Yeah, I'd do that.

174
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:07,540
You kind of remember reading music and you can kind of plunk around on this thing, but

175
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:12,660
it's honestly, it's really hard to play music when you can't hear the music.

176
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,820
Is there anything else in the bench?

177
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,500
No, it's just that one piece.

178
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:19,500
I want to hobble over to the coffee table and you mentioned there's a tube.

179
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,500
Yes.

180
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,500
I want to look at that tube.

181
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:26,620
Looking at the plastic tube, you see that there's a cap on one end that screws off.

182
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:29,420
I'm going to do that very slowly.

183
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:30,420
Okay.

184
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,820
Snakes pop out.

185
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:32,820
Exactly.

186
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:37,780
I thought it was peanuts.

187
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:42,100
Inside is just a rolled up paper, a bunch of paper that's all rolled up.

188
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:45,740
I want to unfurl it and glean what I can real quick.

189
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:53,260
When you unfurl it, you see these are blueprints for a place called Calm Comfy Campground.

190
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,260
Blueprints.

191
00:09:54,260 --> 00:10:01,700
It looks like there is a large lake noted that it is called Lake Calm with an island

192
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,700
on it.

193
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,700
It's spelled with C's, right?

194
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,700
Yes.

195
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:13,700
On the island is one large building with six small buildings surrounding it.

196
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:14,700
Ew.

197
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,700
Ew.

198
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,700
Call back.

199
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,700
Comedy, right there.

200
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,700
No, it's mystery.

201
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,700
We're a mystery podcast.

202
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,700
They're very similar.

203
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,700
Yeah, this isn't funny.

204
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:31,900
We're not supposed to be funny, Luke, and many would say we're not.

205
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,660
I want to check on Randy Angst.

206
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:34,660
Okay.

207
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:44,180
As you go to the bathroom, you see an elderly man laying in the bathtub with a beautiful

208
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:52,060
three piece blue suit on his upper body and no clothes on his lower body.

209
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:55,260
Hey, Randy, did you poop those suit pants?

210
00:10:55,260 --> 00:11:04,460
When you speak, he kind of like twitches and it smells vile in here and you can kind of

211
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:07,180
see that the bathtub is a bit dirty.

212
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:15,020
Yeah, Randy, I'd love to give you a hand, but listen, I think it's a good thing you're

213
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,020
in that bathtub, buddy.

214
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,900
We're going to scare you up another change of clothes.

215
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:23,620
Why don't you just get everything on you wet and scrub that all off and we'll talk in a

216
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,620
minute.

217
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:25,620
Okay?

218
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,620
Okay.

219
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:27,620
Does the water still work?

220
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:30,740
Did artillery shells take that out or just give that faucet?

221
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,020
Just try to wash the shit off yourself.

222
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,020
Oh, no.

223
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,020
It doesn't look like it.

224
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,580
It's getting hot very quickly.

225
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,580
Okay.

226
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:37,580
Well, there you go.

227
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,580
Hot shit water.

228
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,580
It smells great now.

229
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:40,580
The aroma.

230
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:41,580
Good luck, Randy.

231
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:42,580
I closed the door.

232
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,580
All right.

233
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,580
Maybe hit that fan on the way out.

234
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:49,940
When we first came in here, we just looked around the living room and then shit kind

235
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:50,940
of hit the fan.

236
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:54,620
I want to explore the house a little more and see if I can find any like specifically

237
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:55,620
an office.

238
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,620
Maybe.

239
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:57,620
Gotcha.

240
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:02,660
Was there a fan in Randy's pants because he shit his pants twice.

241
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:03,820
Oh, man.

242
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:04,820
Wow.

243
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:05,820
Yeah.

244
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:06,820
That was a weaving avenue.

245
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:07,820
Cut that out.

246
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:08,820
Yeah.

247
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:09,820
Whew.

248
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:10,820
Not a joke.

249
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:16,380
That was pretty good, guys.

250
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:20,420
You know, the last session was really good, so this makes sense.

251
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,420
Yeah, it's okay.

252
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:25,500
It's okay if this one sucks.

253
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:31,740
So walking around the rest of the house, it's a really nice house, but it's not that big.

254
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:35,820
It's only one story and there's no basement to it.

255
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,540
It's a two bedroom, two bath.

256
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,700
Everything is fucking immaculate.

257
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,540
This is an extremely clean house.

258
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:50,860
As you're going through stuff, it looks like James, who lived here, lived very minimalistically.

259
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:55,700
Except he's got a statue with a tuxedo and a suit of armor and a giant rose painting

260
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,700
and a piano.

261
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:57,700
Yeah.

262
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,700
He spent all of his money on nice things.

263
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:01,420
He didn't stand out starkly in contrast to his minimalized stuff.

264
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:05,820
He has no furniture, just impressive for us all right.

265
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:06,820
He was a collector.

266
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:10,740
Clark, I don't know if you've ever thought about getting into contention real estate,

267
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:13,580
but this place is now officially a fixer-upper.

268
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:14,580
The owner's dead.

269
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:18,620
We've got the estate agent in the bathtub with shit all over his pants.

270
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:20,620
I think we could negotiate a pretty good deal on this if you ever want to.

271
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:22,620
Yeah, all you got to do is rebuild the entire home.

272
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:25,180
Keith, I'm not trying to get in on ... I'm sorry, man.

273
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,460
I don't want to buy a house with you.

274
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,860
Clark, if you want to buy a house, man, I think we should look in on this.

275
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,020
You want to flip it with me?

276
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,020
I want to flip this, yeah.

277
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:36,620
I don't know how to ... I don't know anything about houses, so I don't find anything that

278
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:38,860
would pertain to maybe his work at the mill?

279
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:39,860
No, nothing.

280
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,860
Okay.

281
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:41,860
Yeah.

282
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:46,780
No, this is ... Honestly, it's pretty weird how bare and spartan the rest of this house

283
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:47,780
is.

284
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,540
I'm going to set fire to this fucking place.

285
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:50,540
You think so?

286
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,660
Not until we own it.

287
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:55,980
I was personally thinking when you guys were talking about flipping this house, John would

288
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,560
probably know how to fix it.

289
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:04,300
My guess is that Clark has a pretty dope savings account because he seems to not spend his

290
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,500
money on anything.

291
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,500
Yeah.

292
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,500
Yeah.

293
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:12,100
I come up, I'm like, guys, is this really what we want to be focusing on right now?

294
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,380
You're all bleeding everywhere.

295
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,300
I put my hands on my head.

296
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:21,600
John, I do distinctly remember you hours ago saying the only way to fix this situation

297
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,600
is to solve.

298
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,740
Hell yeah, man, but look where we are.

299
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,460
You got to keep your mind open to possibilities.

300
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,020
You just got to keep thinking.

301
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:34,380
Who is going to buy a house from two contingent PD officers if we don't solve this case?

302
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,380
Nobody.

303
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,380
All right.

304
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,740
That's the smartest thing you've ever said.

305
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:38,740
I agree.

306
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:39,740
I'm not a smart man.

307
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:43,580
I know what house flipping is.

308
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:47,940
That's where you're not ... You just turn it over, right?

309
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,420
It's like raising a barn.

310
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,940
It's like ... In reverse.

311
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:54,260
You know how you got to get tires rotated?

312
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:57,420
Raising a barn, not in reverse, but in a 90 degree angle.

313
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,420
House flipping, yeah.

314
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,420
You flip that on its own.

315
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:03,380
Actually, house flipping shows would be so much more fucking popular than they are if

316
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:05,100
they actually just flip the house, yeah.

317
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:08,180
Do you guys remember when you were a kid, you saw people move houses?

318
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,180
Did you ever see that?

319
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,180
Yeah, we moved houses.

320
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,180
When they moved it off.

321
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,180
Doing the big, yeah.

322
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,180
That's insane.

323
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,180
Yeah, where they get the foundation or whatever of.

324
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,980
How do they fucking do that, and why don't I see that more often these days?

325
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:17,980
I don't know.

326
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:18,980
I used to see it all the time.

327
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:19,980
I feel like I saw it a lot when I was a kid.

328
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:24,220
I feel like now it's just, I don't know, something about the bubble market, man.

329
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,220
The housing bubble, maybe.

330
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,220
Yeah, the market.

331
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:30,900
Oh, because they had a bubble around the houses, and now the housing bubble bubble popped,

332
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:33,860
and now you can't do that anymore, because if it falls off the trailer, the bubble can't

333
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:34,860
protect it.

334
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:35,860
The bubble can't protect it.

335
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:36,860
You're right.

336
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:37,860
That's it.

337
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:41,060
When I was a kid, I used to always think in any room that I was in, how I would leave

338
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:43,780
that room if the room was upside down.

339
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:44,780
Oh, cool.

340
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:45,780
That's fun.

341
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:48,180
That's dope.

342
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,180
Through the door.

343
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:50,180
Yeah.

344
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,180
Yeah.

345
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:56,900
It's almost always a doorway.

346
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:57,900
It's like-

347
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:01,580
We all stop to look around the room we're in, and it's just like, oh, you just have

348
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:03,100
to reach up a little bit higher for the doorknob.

349
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:06,380
Higher for the doorknob, and then step over the exit of the doorway.

350
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:10,940
If you're like a five or six year old, you could probably reach that.

351
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:11,940
It would be a leap.

352
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:12,940
If you were in a foyer, too.

353
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:13,940
Oh, yeah.

354
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:14,940
Yeah, sure.

355
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:15,940
You've got a taller ceiling going up.

356
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:16,940
You'd be screwing a McMansion.

357
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:17,940
Yeah.

358
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,700
I love to talk about those weird high ceilings in McMansions and how pointless they are.

359
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,700
Love tall ceilings.

360
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:26,380
By the way, the ceilings in this house, very tall.

361
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,380
Yeah, but they-

362
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,380
No, no, no.

363
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:29,380
Not the house we're in.

364
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,380
The house you're in.

365
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,380
Oh.

366
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,380
Ew, gross.

367
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,380
The house you're in.

368
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:35,380
The house always you're in.

369
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:37,380
Oh, that's why the walls are wet.

370
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,380
Okay.

371
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:41,860
Hey, did I show you guys what was in that hole over there that I fell into?

372
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:42,860
No.

373
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:43,860
Oh, yeah.

374
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:44,860
No.

375
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:45,860
What is it?

376
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:46,860
Also, are your legs okay?

377
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:47,860
Did you break your leg or something?

378
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:50,780
No, I actually landed with cat-like agility.

379
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:51,780
Wow.

380
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,060
No, but what was down there?

381
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,060
Was it like-

382
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,060
There's two dead people down there.

383
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,060
Oh.

384
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,060
Oh.

385
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,540
How dead are they?

386
00:16:58,540 --> 00:16:59,540
Yeah.

387
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,540
How dead were they?

388
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:01,540
Were they decayed?

389
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:04,660
They looked to be maybe a week or two old.

390
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,660
They're a little musty.

391
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:09,420
I mean, they're not infants, sorry.

392
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:10,420
No, no.

393
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,420
I know what you mean.

394
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,420
Yeah, we knew what you meant.

395
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:13,420
Okay, cool.

396
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:19,860
The all prevailing and inescapable odor of the dead did pervade throughout the house

397
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:23,140
when you fell through that hole, but I just assumed, you know, it was Randy.

398
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:29,060
Wait, so do you think James kept those people down there or do you think-

399
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:32,260
It looks like they fell into the armor trap, right?

400
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,260
Could they have died from that fall?

401
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,900
You said it was 12 feet, right?

402
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,140
Do you die from a 12 feet drop?

403
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,140
I don't think you die.

404
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,140
Well, you break your legs and if you're down in a pit-

405
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,140
And then you can't get out, sure.

406
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:42,300
But you don't die from falling 12 feet.

407
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,300
Sure.

408
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,180
You could if you were upside down or something.

409
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,180
He just didn't let them out.

410
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,180
Yeah.

411
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:51,940
Well, so that's what I'm thinking is, do you think James could be some kind of crazy H.H.

412
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,180
Holmes killer?

413
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:58,220
Well, so I fell down there and then all hell broke loose, but I used my steely cool to

414
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:01,060
go through the pockets before I tried to get myself out of there.

415
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,060
I do.

416
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:03,060
I really get a more, um-

417
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,060
Hold on.

418
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,060
Can I get Ramona out of here?

419
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:12,060
Ramona, Ramona, let me hold you while you're going in here, baby.

420
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,300
Damn, your house is clean.

421
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,020
Yeah, it is, dude.

422
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,020
Not this room.

423
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:19,260
Fucking my man cave.

424
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,500
More like a man's grave.

425
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,500
Whoa.

426
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:27,000
This man cave is more like a man's grave.

427
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
So I found a subreddit-

428
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I forgot all about that.

429
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,620
I found a subreddit called man caves and every number one post is somebody doing more like

430
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:35,620
a man's grave.

431
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:36,620
Doing more like a man's grave.

432
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:37,620
Yeah.

433
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:38,620
That's incredible.

434
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:39,620
Fuck.

435
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,620
That is shit.

436
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:44,980
So yeah, I went through the pockets down there on those bodies and they had one of those

437
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,360
symbols in their pockets.

438
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,380
It's the circle with the circle surrounding it.

439
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:49,820
The six around them, yeah.

440
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:52,580
Just like these blueprints over here that you also found.

441
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:53,820
You're right.

442
00:18:53,820 --> 00:19:01,620
That lake has an island on it with a building in that same configuration.

443
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:04,300
I think it's a clue, boys.

444
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,780
Smells like a clue.

445
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:10,220
Wait, where was the CCC?

446
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:12,220
I feed Clark a Scooby Sniff.

447
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,220
Where was the CCC?

448
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:15,020
Does anybody know where that is?

449
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,020
Oh.

450
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,020
Randy might.

451
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:19,980
Yeah, I take the blueprints back to the bathroom and like-

452
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:22,980
Hey Randy buddy.

453
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:25,240
You getting cleaned up in there?

454
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:31,860
Warm water is pouring out from underneath the door and it has a slight color to it and

455
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,300
it smells just awful.

456
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,980
Randy, I notice there's a lot of shit water out here.

457
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,540
You doing okay in there, buddy?

458
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:39,540
The drain is clogged.

459
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:44,140
Okay, why don't you just try to rub your hand over it and get some of that shit out of the

460
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,140
holes, you know?

461
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,580
I'm trying to stomp it down.

462
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:48,380
Oh no, that's the opposite.

463
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,180
Do you have any- Okay, listen.

464
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,180
Don't worry about that.

465
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:54,020
Do you know about the- What was it called?

466
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,020
CCC.

467
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,620
Calm Comfy Campgrounds.

468
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:59,780
Do you know where the Calm Comfy Campgrounds are?

469
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:00,780
No.

470
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,460
Okay, well thanks for your help, buddy.

471
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,460
No problem.

472
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,460
Thanks for coming and checking on me.

473
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:06,380
Can I get some pants?

474
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:09,500
Why don't you figure out this- Yeah, we'll get you pants, but it really doesn't seem

475
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:13,460
like you're at pants stage yet if you're still at drain shit stomping stage.

476
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:16,520
The water is no longer- We're definitely not getting you socks.

477
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:20,620
The water is no longer running.

478
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:27,180
And you just hear this like- You just doubling down on that stomping, huh?

479
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:28,180
I'm trying.

480
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:31,900
Okay, well, yeah, just keep that up, I guess.

481
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:35,300
All right, well hey guys, yeah, he didn't know anything about that.

482
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,620
What is that smell?

483
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:40,140
Oh yeah, that's all the shit water Randy got everywhere.

484
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,140
Probably the corpses too.

485
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,500
Oh yeah, that makes sense.

486
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:48,100
You look down in the pit, yeah, these two bodies, very, very super dead, skin is already

487
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,660
turned, you know, whatever color.

488
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:54,500
Hey guys, is there anything else in this house you want to look at, otherwise I'm gonna go

489
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:58,940
outside and wait for the ambulance, because I think I'm gonna throw up, and I feel like

490
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:01,940
if I throw up, the pain from my ribs is gonna make me throw up.

491
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:05,300
Yeah, there's also already a lot of shit water in here, so if you could not throw up on our

492
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:10,380
new house, that would be- I go out in the front yard and just sit down

493
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:11,380
on the ground.

494
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:16,660
The ambulance is coming down the street and pulls into the driveway, which is not where

495
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:20,220
your cruiser is, because your cruiser is in the yard.

496
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,420
Correct, I might know.

497
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,860
The cool way to park.

498
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:25,780
When I see the ambulance pull up, I'm probably heading out too.

499
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,220
I'm in a lot of pain.

500
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:33,380
I stand up and I wave with my left hand, because I assume my right side got hit, yeah, I wave

501
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:37,900
and call the EMT guys over, and I put them in Clark's direction because I feel like he

502
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:40,180
has the biggest injury.

503
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:43,740
I got a sloppy arm, folks, I say to the paramedics as they walk up.

504
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,540
Oh my god, that's incredible.

505
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,780
It hurts real bad too.

506
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,340
What happened tonight, guys?

507
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,340
This is crazy.

508
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:52,220
Are you related to Drew?

509
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:55,820
No, you've asked me that before.

510
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:57,580
This is just what I sound like.

511
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:04,500
I talk to the paramedic, I'm like, pretty good tourniquet on his arm, huh?

512
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,500
No.

513
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:10,020
It made me feel better, Keith, don't worry.

514
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,020
We'll get him next time, buddy.

515
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:15,660
I just look down at the ground and I just wait for my turn to get treated.

516
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:20,620
We'd love to tell you all about the weird robot shenanigans that happened here, but

517
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:21,620
we need help.

518
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,020
What?

519
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,020
We'd love to tell you about him.

520
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:28,940
Yeah, don't listen to him, he's just screwing with you, just help us, just help us.

521
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:34,180
I look at the guy and I kind of eyeball down to the robot hand still stuck in me, and I'm

522
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,180
like, hmm?

523
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:41,620
He looks at it and he's like, uh, yeah, okay, we can definitely take care of all three of

524
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:42,940
you at the same time.

525
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:48,260
Cool, what should we roll to make that happen?

526
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:50,140
I take three healing potions.

527
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:56,460
Yeah, I actually have a Phoenix down, so I kill myself and then put that on me and I'm

528
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,740
back to full health.

529
00:22:58,740 --> 00:22:59,740
Final Fantasy.

530
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:03,660
Hey, folks out there, you ever play Final Fantasy?

531
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,940
That was a Final Fantasy joke.

532
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:09,180
I win 95.

533
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:12,060
Jon is going to regain three hit points.

534
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,060
Yay.

535
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,260
I'm at 12.

536
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,380
Keith regains one hit point.

537
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,580
God dammit.

538
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,740
And Clark regains four hit points.

539
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,740
Nice.

540
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:26,780
Um, can I ask them for some of their hit points since I did give them some, well, I gave you

541
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:27,780
four back, huh?

542
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:28,780
I'm just kidding.

543
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:32,620
Just kidding, I'm good with six hit points.

544
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,620
I'll just be careful.

545
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:35,620
I'm at 11.

546
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:38,620
I'm at, I already said, but I'm at 12.

547
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:43,100
Okay, boys, what are we going to do next?

548
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:45,060
We've explored the tuxedo statue.

549
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:47,180
Did we check out the painting yet?

550
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:48,220
Yeah, we checked out the painting.

551
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:52,020
Remember it had all the, uh, we bonded over the bomb making.

552
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,020
That's right.

553
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:55,940
Oh, do you fellas remember, uh, there was some blood writing in there.

554
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:58,180
It said, stop her.

555
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,580
Who do you guys think her is?

556
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:00,580
Who wrote it even?

557
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:01,900
Do you guys have forensics at all?

558
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:02,900
Yeah, but not much.

559
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:03,900
I have 40.

560
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,000
I got 50.

561
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,620
We should maybe like swab that DNA, the blood and see if it's anybody.

562
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:17,040
If we can like stick it into the database and see if it's DNA that pops up of anybody

563
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,040
that's yeah.

564
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,040
I want to do that.

565
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,440
I want to run in there and take a sample of the blood that says, stop her.

566
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,440
Okay.

567
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,440
Do I need to roll for that?

568
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,560
Cause that just basically, I just want to put it in.

569
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,560
That's very easy.

570
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,560
Yeah.

571
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,760
I'd like to research the piano, I guess.

572
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,680
How 33, what are you doing?

573
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,920
I am, um, re searching, researching that.

574
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:42,120
So I go into the, um, the inside where all the strings would be and I'm just feeling

575
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,520
around for like loose keys.

576
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,740
I run my hands over the keys.

577
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:49,300
I'm just kind of checking everything again thoroughly, but this time I did get a crit

578
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,300
success.

579
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,300
33.

580
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,300
You did indeed.

581
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:59,440
And as you are looking through the empty piano, you would make note of the fact that there

582
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:06,380
were piano strings in here at a certain point in time.

583
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:11,320
However, those strings are no longer here.

584
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,320
By God.

585
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,540
Boys, I don't know what it means, but.

586
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:23,420
And in one small corner now, dammit, uh, were there any other pieces in here?

587
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,520
We got the painting of a Rose.

588
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,540
We looked at, okay, we got tuxedo suit, man.

589
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:29,540
We got suit of armor.

590
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:31,420
Did we search the tuxedo?

591
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:37,060
The tic, the tuxedo statue was the bow tie that moved, that popped up the look at the

592
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,060
pockets though.

593
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:40,020
Might as well run a hand through.

594
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,020
It's a statue.

595
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,020
It was a statue.

596
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,480
I was picturing a tuxedo on a statue.

597
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,260
It was a guy in a tuxedo statue.

598
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:49,260
That's gaudy.

599
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,640
Oh yeah.

600
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,180
All this shit is horrible.

601
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:54,180
He's got the rose paint.

602
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,180
Wait, hold on.

603
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,460
Yeah, let's try his glasses.

604
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:59,740
Bow tie that moved, Rose painting.

605
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:02,980
It was a hard hat on the suit of armor.

606
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:07,460
If you remember what present I acted like I got cook.

607
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:11,380
It had those things and it had a Rose, it had a hard hat and it had a, was it a bow

608
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:12,420
tie in the package?

609
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:13,420
It was indeed.

610
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:15,060
A silk bow tie.

611
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:17,700
Do you think the package came from James?

612
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,820
I'm thinking this.

613
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:22,240
We found James dead with Maggie cook.

614
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,220
She got a gift box with those things in it.

615
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:29,860
We are at James's house with two dead bodies and a 12 foot pit.

616
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:32,380
I forgot that she was with him when she died.

617
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:35,060
Having some kind of foot feast.

618
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:37,100
It's probably just a coincidence.

619
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:42,980
I wonder if there's a connection between Maggie and James other than her dad working

620
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,220
at the mill and him working at the mill.

621
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,220
I wonder if they knew each other before all this.

622
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:52,220
Guys, I think it's pretty clear this is all just one big coincidence.

623
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,540
So I mean, what do you think?

624
00:26:53,540 --> 00:27:01,140
I mean, that is the mysterious present that I took credit for, which you know was a lie,

625
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:02,140
right?

626
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:03,140
You know, by this time.

627
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,140
My eyes narrow.

628
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,140
It's like a key.

629
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:07,060
I go to my gun.

630
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:12,140
By this time, you know that I'm an incompetent fool, which I would never say if it didn't

631
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,140
benefit me.

632
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:16,580
It's the perfect cover, though, for a criminal mastermind.

633
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:18,300
Okay, so how?

634
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:22,180
We put together the pieces of a puzzle that we don't know what the puzzle was.

635
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:24,020
Why would he have sent this stuff?

636
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,820
I think we need to go to the mill.

637
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:26,820
I think the mill's a really good place to go.

638
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:29,020
I think we need to go to the mill and interview some people.

639
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:32,300
I feel like we've been trying to go to the mill for half our lives.

640
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,900
I think we need to go to the mill.

641
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:34,900
Mighty Ducks on three.

642
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:35,900
One, two, three.

643
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:36,900
Mighty Ducks.

644
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:37,900
Mighty Ducks.

645
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:38,900
Is it quack?

646
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:39,900
It's quack.

647
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:40,900
It's quack.

648
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:41,900
That's super not what they did in that movie, guys.

649
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:42,900
I know.

650
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:43,900
I used to do that.

651
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:44,900
That's my fault.

652
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:47,500
Mighty Ducks on three.

653
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:52,100
So looking around this house, do you want to make sure that it's, you know, is it a

654
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,100
crime scene?

655
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,100
What are you doing?

656
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:58,140
Well, obviously it's a crime scene, but I don't think that the public needs to know

657
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,140
about a...

658
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:00,580
Two more disappeared bodies.

659
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:04,780
I don't think the public needs to know about an artillery-shelled robot.

660
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:07,540
Yeah, I bet a few people do though.

661
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:11,060
We should get that handbag from those paramedics, run some tests on that bad boy.

662
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,060
The handbag?

663
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:13,060
The handbag.

664
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,060
The handbag, yeah.

665
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:17,260
Hey, a guy who claims he's not related to Drew.

666
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,260
What's your name, buddy?

667
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,260
I'm the EMT.

668
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,260
Sweet.

669
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,980
Hey, can I have that robot hand?

670
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:22,980
Yeah, absolutely.

671
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:23,980
Thanks, man.

672
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,420
Hey, Mr. EMT.

673
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:26,420
There's a...

674
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:27,420
Emmett.

675
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:28,420
I'm Emmett, the EMT.

676
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,420
Hey, Emmett.

677
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:32,860
We've got a crime scene here.

678
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:36,500
We've got a couple bodies at the bottom of a pit that we can't get out of.

679
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:41,780
Could you send some guys with ropes to pull those up for us and get them over to the corner?

680
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:46,300
Yeah, I'll call the rope ambulance and they'll be right over.

681
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,300
You're good people, Emmett.

682
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,940
I'm gonna set up some caution tape all around this scene.

683
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:51,180
You make sure nobody else gets in here.

684
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,180
Yeah, hey, Emmett.

685
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:54,220
Will you just keep an eye on things?

686
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:57,340
Listen, we're deputizing you.

687
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:58,580
Does that sound cool?

688
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:00,300
Actually, I'd like to not be...

689
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:01,300
Too late, buddy.

690
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,540
And I'll pin a little Sheriff's Star sticker.

691
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:05,540
Let's just get Florence over here to...

692
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:06,540
Who?

693
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:07,540
Flo.

694
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:08,540
Florence?

695
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:09,540
Florence.

696
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:10,540
Yeah.

697
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,540
Sure.

698
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:15,700
Let's get Flo over here to patrol until we tell her not to.

699
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:16,700
Sounds good.

700
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:20,020
So you're calling Florence directly or...

701
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:22,580
Bring, bring, bring, bring.

702
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:23,580
She doesn't answer.

703
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:24,580
I'll send her a text.

704
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:25,580
Damn it.

705
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:29,540
Drew, tell them to relay the info to Florence.

706
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:30,540
Sounds good.

707
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:31,540
Yeah, it's not gonna happen.

708
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:36,340
Hey, Drew, what's the deal with your cousin, Emmett?

709
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:39,020
What?

710
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:51,620
Ever since he got gum surgery, he just thinks he's better than me.

711
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:52,660
I know who that goes, man.

712
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,660
I got some cousins.

713
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:55,660
It's like, we get it.

714
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,380
You're pretty now.

715
00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:02,060
I do legitimately want to set up a caution tape over the perimeter of the yard, and then

716
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:03,900
even over the doors and the windows and stuff.

717
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:07,660
And maybe we could set up some kind of scarecrow cop in the window.

718
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:13,340
We'll put the tuxedo statue up in a window and put a little badge.

719
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:19,340
I'm thinking if Florence isn't answering our shit, I would like to have some sort of surveillance

720
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:20,340
here.

721
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,340
I don't know how we could do that.

722
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:22,340
Somebody could leave their cell phone.

723
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:23,340
Oh, no.

724
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:31,340
I do have a GoPro that streams to my phone that I could just tape up on a wall.

725
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:32,340
Do it.

726
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:37,620
I go to my cruiser, and I'm hoping that my other two officers aren't looking at me.

727
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:41,500
And I open up the trunk, and I look around, and I open up.

728
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:46,300
My trunk has a false bottom that the spare tire goes in, but I don't have a spare tire

729
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,300
in there.

730
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,300
I just have a bunch of snacks.

731
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:55,020
And then I have a GoPro in there, and I close it.

732
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:59,420
So I get the GoPro, and I tape it.

733
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:04,100
Where is the statue, the suit of armor?

734
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,100
Is that in the foyer?

735
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,420
Those are both in the foyer.

736
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:10,540
Kind of above and to the right of both of those, I put it up in the corner, and I tape

737
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:14,100
it up there, and I have it feeding to my phone.

738
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,100
Sweet.

739
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,100
Done.

740
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:21,340
And I'm kind of sad, because I was going to do some cool ... I've been trying to learn

741
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:27,660
how to skateboard, so I've been putting it on my helmet while I skateboard, but none

742
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:31,620
of the footage is useful, because I'm not very good at skateboarding, so.

743
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:36,820
I think that footage could be useful.

744
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:38,860
I'm going to go check on Randy again.

745
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:40,860
I'm going to say, hey, buddy.

746
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:41,860
Listen.

747
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:42,860
Splash, splash.

748
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:43,860
I was thinking about you.

749
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:44,860
Hey, man.

750
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:47,580
You know, it's all about keeping that attitude positive.

751
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:52,100
The door flings open, and steam starts just pouring out of this room.

752
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,740
Oh, you're enjoying this now.

753
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:56,460
Well, I guess it's good that I caught you in a good mood, because hey, it does seem

754
00:31:56,460 --> 00:32:01,900
to me like the estate has a real fixer-upper on their hands, and I'd be willing to take

755
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:04,780
this off your hands pretty cheap.

756
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:06,700
We can talk about that later.

757
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,700
Glad you got the shit taken care of.

758
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:09,700
Here's some pants.

759
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,700
Hey, buddy.

760
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:11,700
I need you to do me a big favor.

761
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,340
Why'd you get sweatpants?

762
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:14,820
So you could shit them again easily?

763
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:15,820
Okay, you know what?

764
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:16,820
That all adds up.

765
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:17,820
So, hey.

766
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:21,940
We're going to send an officer over here, but we really got to get going, so please

767
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:27,180
don't sell anything in the next seven hours or whatever, and could you just keep an eye

768
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:34,340
on things for like 30 minutes, and hey, here's my card, and if any robots come back, do let

769
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,340
us know immediately.

770
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:36,340
Any?

771
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:37,340
Oh, God.

772
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:38,340
Okay.

773
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:43,420
Officer of Contingent, the Contingent PD will be here to relieve you, uh, presently, but-

774
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,420
Presently?

775
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,780
Yeah, that means soon.

776
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:49,540
But don't relieve yourself presently again, Randy.

777
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:53,300
All right, well, thank you, Officer Pettymore.

778
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,460
Yeah, uh, no problem, Mr. Anx.

779
00:32:55,460 --> 00:33:03,700
And he walks out and into the living room, and he points at the legs with the pelvic

780
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:06,100
area, standing-

781
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:08,620
What?

782
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:09,620
Standing on the ground.

783
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:10,620
Oh, yeah.

784
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:13,820
And, uh, he just kind of points at them.

785
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:16,900
Yeah, man, we kicked a robot's ass.

786
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,460
That's all the commotion.

787
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:23,420
He just, uh, he just sits down on the couch, all right, and just pulls out his phone.

788
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:27,780
I want to go through the pockets of that robot's legs that I forgot were in the middle of this

789
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:28,780
room.

790
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:33,020
Yeah, I would like to thoroughly examine the robot legs for markings or manufacturers.

791
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:35,820
Maybe even look inside the wiring and sit there in the air.

792
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:37,820
I also want to check out his robot dick.

793
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:38,820
Yeah.

794
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:39,820
What's he got?

795
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:47,060
Okay, when you go through the pockets of his, like, tactical pants, you find a couple knives,

796
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:54,320
a bunch of ammo for the weapon he was using earlier, and that's it.

797
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:57,140
That's all that's in the pants.

798
00:33:57,140 --> 00:34:05,580
John unbuttons those pants, unzips those pants, and starts bringing those trousers

799
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:17,420
to the ground, and there is, hanging between the mechanical legs of this thing, it's a

800
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:18,420
real penis.

801
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:19,420
Look at that, boys.

802
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:21,820
Okay, so hold on.

803
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:22,820
I was not expecting-

804
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:26,620
I was hoping for, like, a key to the end of the game.

805
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:30,340
I thought it was going to be, like, John Peter's face stares back at you.

806
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,340
Yeah, right.

807
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:34,780
You see his dick, and branded on it is, a fool.

808
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:38,620
It's his dick, but there's a green light on it.

809
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:43,580
Weird tubes extend from the shaft.

810
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:50,940
Okay, so when you take his pants down to the ground, he is smooth like a Ken doll.

811
00:34:50,940 --> 00:35:01,300
However, on the penis spot, the spot where a penis and balls would be, there is a little

812
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:09,860
symbol etched into the metal, and it is an M, the letter M, as in Mancy, made of four

813
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:12,300
double helices.

814
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:18,700
I would like to do a reverse image search on that logo.

815
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,060
Okay.

816
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:21,060
Full luck.

817
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:22,060
No dice.

818
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:24,060
76 on a 45.

819
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,060
Okay.

820
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:27,420
If I look at it, do I- does it ring any bells for Clark?

821
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:28,420
Nope.

822
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:32,780
Can we get Drew to come down here and take those legs to evidence?

823
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:34,580
That sounds like a flow job.

824
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:35,580
No, we won't-

825
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:36,580
Flow job.

826
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:37,580
I think we won't-

827
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:38,580
Flow's coming down here, but eventually she'll leave, so she'll take the legs with her.

828
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:40,420
Well, we haven't gotten in contact with Flow.

829
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:42,660
I contacted Drew to get in contact with Flow.

830
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,380
I want Flow to stay here.

831
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:47,900
I think we should have Drew come down here, take the legs back to evidence.

832
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,300
But then they're just sitting in a room.

833
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:51,340
It's not like Drew can do anything with them there.

834
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:53,580
Yeah, but we can do with them at some point.

835
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:54,580
I'm with you.

836
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:55,580
I think we should do that.

837
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:57,940
If they stay here, then they're just going to go by the wayside.

838
00:35:57,940 --> 00:36:01,740
There's three of you and one police cruiser, so you can take them with you if you want.

839
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:02,740
Yeah, we can just take them.

840
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:03,740
Ooh, let's take the robot legs.

841
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:06,620
Yeah, but I feel like if we take the robot legs with us, they're going to attack us

842
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:07,620
at some point.

843
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:08,620
Then we can get them at a jump point.

844
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:09,620
And-

845
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:10,620
No, let's take them.

846
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:11,620
We might be able to figure out a way to ride them.

847
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:12,620
Scarecrow cap.

848
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:18,820
Well, it's two against one, so all in favor of having Drew take them back to evidence,

849
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:19,820
say aye.

850
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:20,820
Aye.

851
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:21,820
Aye.

852
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:25,260
All in favor of taking them with us to the mill.

853
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:26,260
Aye.

854
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:27,260
Aye.

855
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:28,260
Okay, so I-

856
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:31,900
It's cute that you think this is a democracy, Keith.

857
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:32,900
I-

858
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,780
We'll throw them in the trunk there, Keith.

859
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:35,780
That way they can't get to them.

860
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:36,780
We'll take real good care of them, buddy.

861
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,900
Yeah, we'll throw them in the trunk of my cruiser.

862
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:39,900
Great, guys.

863
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:40,900
Okay, well-

864
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:44,060
What, are you afraid they'll ruin your snacks?

865
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:45,900
You don't know that I have snacks in there.

866
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,620
We know about your snacks, buddy.

867
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:51,500
I sit down on the ground, I'm like, you guys can do whatever you want to do.

868
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:55,220
Apparently this isn't a democracy, so I'll just do whatever you guys want to do.

869
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:58,220
Why'd you say it like that?

870
00:36:58,220 --> 00:36:59,220
He's mad.

871
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:00,220
Keith is angry.

872
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:10,700
I will stand up when we go to the mill, but I'm driving my fucking car.

873
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,100
He's got the best drive.

874
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,100
Me.

875
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,660
I have 40 drive.

876
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:15,660
70.

877
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,900
Yeah, well, it's my car, so I'm driving.

878
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:22,620
Actually, I don't sit down on the ground, I go sit in the driver's seat of my car and

879
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:24,020
wait for the other two officers.

880
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:26,860
John, you want to help me lug this into the trunk?

881
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:29,580
No, but sure.

882
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:33,180
Yeah, we lift it and carry it over to the trunk.

883
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:35,820
Oh, that makes the ribs sore.

884
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:36,820
Right before they get-

885
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:37,820
Oh, yeah.

886
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:39,500
Right before they get to my car-

887
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,500
I don't think I can carry it.

888
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,500
Taking one arm.

889
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:42,500
One arm.

890
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:45,440
Yeah, I get to the ankles underneath the armpit there.

891
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:50,920
Right before they get to my car, I do the lock, unlock game with them.

892
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:54,480
I lock the trunk right before they try to open it.

893
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:59,880
I fire my gun into the air several times.

894
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:02,080
Keith, do not play this shit with me today.

895
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:05,800
You hear from inside the house, oh, no.

896
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,840
Sorry, Randy.

897
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:14,080
I hear the gun shoot off, I'm like, ah, I don't want to test it, so I unlock it and

898
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,080
then-

899
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,120
Oh, I put the legs in the trunk.

900
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:19,560
No, I lock it right before they open it.

901
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:22,080
I'm laughing, but it hurts.

902
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:26,840
The first time I do it, it hurts my ribs to laugh, so I just unlock it because I'm like,

903
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,840
I can't keep doing this.

904
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,720
It'll be too funny.

905
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:30,720
So it's unlocked.

906
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,720
I open it.

907
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,720
And then I lock it right before.

908
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:42,360
No, it's unlocked.

909
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:49,240
At this point, I'm just like hurting and tired and mad.

910
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,240
Delta Green.

911
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,360
Why you do?

912
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:26,360
Oh, how can you have enough drowning out of the noise?

913
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:30,360
With no mind at all.

914
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:34,360
No mind at all.

915
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:38,360
No mind at all.

916
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,360
Fight, fight.

917
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,360
Stream it out.
