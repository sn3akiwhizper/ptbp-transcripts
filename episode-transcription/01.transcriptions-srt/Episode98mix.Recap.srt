1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,740
Beep bop, beep boop, beep bop boop.

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:07,100
It's Wolf the Robot here to give y'all the scoop.

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:12,100
PTBP 694.2, y'all know the drill

4
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:15,780
and y'all definitely know what time it is.

5
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:19,420
But wait, do y'all actually know what time it is?

6
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:23,300
Cause I have never once looked at a clock.

7
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,820
I hope we broadcast at a decent time

8
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:29,180
where people can tune in in mass droves.

9
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:33,400
Today's Howlin' with Wolf comes from at SexyBaconStrip,

10
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,140
who tweeted about the show and tagged at PretendingPod,

11
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,620
a delicious, smoky, and salty thing to do

12
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,700
if I do say so myself.

13
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:43,620
They right.

14
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,640
Howdy, Wolf, just a heads up.

15
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,220
Ever since all that weird stuff

16
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:48,780
started here in contention,

17
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,260
the dumpster behind Al's Tires and Tiger Sanctuary

18
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:56,600
has turned into some Grade A quality eats.

19
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,960
Much like this podcast, it's got all the goo and slime

20
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,200
in all the right places.

21
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,120
Really though, this podcast has become

22
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,460
one of the main things I look forward to.

23
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:09,680
It's so great I even got my own slip case for Delta Green

24
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,380
and I can't wait to put my players through hell.

25
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:15,360
Thank y'all and fuck Jeff Bezos.

26
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,960
Thank you for writing SexyBaconStrip.

27
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,800
I ain't never met a bacon strip

28
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,720
that I didn't find at least somewhat erotic.

29
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,600
I appreciate you saying those positive things,

30
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,860
but the way that none of those positive things

31
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,840
were directed at y'alls truly

32
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,880
specifically has me feeling some kind of way.

33
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,800
Time to hit up Al's Tires and Tiger Sanctuary

34
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,720
for some delicious rubber

35
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,920
and possibly endangered mystery meat.

36
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,680
Remember to tag us in some nice things on the social things

37
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,800
if you want us to probably read a thing that you said.

38
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,100
Spread the love, spread the goo,

39
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,020
and remember to spread the word of wolf too.

40
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:55,580
Now prepare a warm spot on the floor

41
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:59,460
to vore even more of this hardcore lore with Gorgolore

42
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,700
and I'll roar and roar for an encore

43
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,140
from the troubadours that I adore.

44
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,140
It's kudzu with no backbone.

45
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,860
In a high school classroom,

46
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:42,140
the analog clock on the wall said 3.30

47
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:45,140
and the chalkboard said detention.

48
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,820
Sat at the only occupied desk in the room

49
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,020
was a boy of 13 or 14.

50
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:54,100
Jeremy Pettymore wore a denim cutoff jacket,

51
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:57,660
a raggedy thin Western shirt, wrangler jeans,

52
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:01,700
some punky boots, and a perpetual scowl.

53
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,940
There was a knock on the door

54
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:06,700
and two more boys of a similar age entered the room.

55
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,100
The first was Ken Krenkelhoff,

56
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,680
wearing a letterman jacket bought for him by his dad.

57
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,180
Ken was tall, fit, had great hair,

58
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:18,280
and walked with his head held high.

59
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,120
The teacher greeted Ken warmly,

60
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,660
then happily acknowledged the second boy, Ash Hornbeam,

61
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:26,520
with his black, messy hair, white t-shirt,

62
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,260
cheetah print vest, acid-washed jeans,

63
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,280
and scuffed tennis shoes.

64
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,240
The teacher administering detention

65
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,760
was confident the new arrivals didn't belong,

66
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,920
but Ken said they wanted

67
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,960
to keep their friend Jeremy company.

68
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,320
The teacher was reluctant, but said,

69
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,180
"'These two boys are allowed to do whatever they want.'"

70
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:47,240
Jeremy said his schoolwork necessitated his friends,

71
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,240
so if he was supposed to get anything done,

72
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,680
he had to go with them.

73
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,600
The teacher was relieved to have an excuse to end detention,

74
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,160
and Jeremy flipped him off on the way out.

75
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,880
The young Pettymore asked the other two

76
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,320
if they were ready for the woods that night,

77
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,440
and Ash opened his jacket

78
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,400
and revealed a bunch of water dynamite.

79
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,920
Ken seemed a bit reluctant, but agreed to go,

80
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,200
since this year was their last hurrah.

81
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,320
Ken would have to meet them in the woods, though,

82
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,940
since his mom would still wanna drive him there herself.

83
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,340
As they walked through the hall,

84
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:22,080
an upperclassman asked them what they were up to that night.

85
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,740
Jeremy said they were going to the woods,

86
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,580
that's their thing.

87
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,080
Once a year, they go into the woods

88
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,640
to look for some folktale legend called Ol' Madge.

89
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,520
They left Silas Cole K through 12,

90
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,200
slapping the banner sporting their mascot,

91
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,060
a minor, on the way out.

92
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,560
That evening, Ash drove Jeremy to the woods

93
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,020
in his older brother's car.

94
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:48,720
A 1991 Firebird painted a weird, ugly gold.

95
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,560
They turned onto a dirt road,

96
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,160
and a squirrel ran into the path of the car.

97
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,320
Ash was able to quickly swerve and miss it.

98
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,140
They pulled into the gravel parking lot

99
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,000
for the contention woods,

100
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,300
and there were two cars in the lot already.

101
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,680
One had a boot on the back left wheel,

102
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,840
and the other had a notice taped on the driver's side window

103
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,840
that threatened to boot if it wasn't moved.

104
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,720
There was also a Ford Bronco with a lift kit on it

105
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,840
over next to the small, usually unoccupied,

106
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,480
park ranger shack at the entrance to the woods.

107
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,780
Ash left a note under his windshield wiper

108
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:26,860
that said, please don't boot my car, signed Ash Hornbeam.

109
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,260
They checked if the two cars were unlocked, both were.

110
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:31,380
In the first car, there was almost nothing,

111
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,820
as if it had already been cleaned out.

112
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:36,580
In the second car, there was a bunch of camping equipment

113
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,060
and a title for the vehicle,

114
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:41,420
which listed a Stuart Feldman as its owner,

115
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:43,580
registered in the city.

116
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,820
Jeremy found some liquor and a pistol.

117
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,660
Ash grabbed some of the camping equipment

118
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:51,540
and headed over to the shack where he saw an elderly man

119
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:54,580
wearing a state issued uniform sitting on a stool,

120
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:56,860
just waking up as Ash approached.

121
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:00,060
The boys realized this wasn't the normal forest ranger

122
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:03,060
of contention, he introduced himself as Woodrow

123
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,980
or Buzz for short.

124
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:08,060
In addition to the normal ranger paraphernalia,

125
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:11,520
there was a big thing, a hand sanitizer and a board

126
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,460
behind Buzz covered in pictures

127
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:15,900
and pieces of paper thumbtack to it.

128
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,720
Buzz took out a Polaroid camera, took their pictures,

129
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,720
took down their information, citing a recent string

130
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,440
of disappearances in the woods as his reason

131
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:28,320
and placed the pictures and information up onto the board.

132
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,920
Ash asked if they could borrow the first aid kit

133
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,720
and Buzz gave it to them.

134
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,920
Ash shot an M80 into the distance with his slingshot

135
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,840
and Buzz about shat his pants.

136
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,600
So he went to the bathroom and Jeremy seized the opportunity

137
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,520
to grab a fire extinguisher, two machetes,

138
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,160
three flashlights and hand sanitizer

139
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,960
and they shoved it all into their bags.

140
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,920
They looked over the missing persons board,

141
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,840
there were 18 missing people,

142
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,280
several of whom the boys recognized.

143
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,280
They saw Stuart Feldman on the board,

144
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,560
he was an older bald British man in incredible shape

145
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,440
with a thick jawline.

146
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:06,020
He had claimed to be in the woods on business.

147
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,680
Jeremy also saw the keys to both the Bronco

148
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,260
and the shack itself and snagged them.

149
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:14,200
Buzz returned and the boys asked if they could take a picture

150
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,080
of the missing persons board so they could have

151
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,560
a reference if they ran into any of the people in the woods.

152
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,880
Buzz agreed and gave them a Polaroid picture

153
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,480
of the board of Polaroid pictures, woof.

154
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,280
The two boys gathered their things and headed off

155
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,520
to their usual camping spot on foot.

156
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,920
As they hiked, Jeremy noticed tracks.

157
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,640
It looked like a car and a smaller vehicle,

158
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,840
like a four-wheeler had driven down the trail.

159
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,160
When they arrived at their spot,

160
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,680
there was unusually no firewood waiting for them.

161
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,680
Ash went to chop at a big log

162
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,160
and Jeremy started looking around,

163
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,160
frustrated at the lack of logs.

164
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,960
Ash heard a rustling nearby and saw a man's head pop up

165
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,000
from behind some bushes.

166
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,320
The man made dead eye contact with Ash

167
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,000
and popped back down into the thicket.

168
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,080
Ken Krinklehoff's mom, Krista Krinklehoff,

169
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,720
drove him to the woods in her minivan

170
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,640
and explained she didn't like the tradition

171
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,800
he and his friends had of going to the woods once a year

172
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,120
for their silly game.

173
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,200
Ken said not to worry,

174
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,960
but a baby fox jumped out trying to cross the road.

175
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:19,920
Ken's mom hid it and crushed the fox without remorse.

176
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,320
They pulled into the parking lot

177
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,760
and saw the same cars Ash and Jeremy saw

178
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,520
plus the 91 Firebird Ash had borrowed.

179
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,400
Ken's mom mentioned how multiple people

180
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,840
who had gone into the woods recently were missing

181
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,440
and she especially wasn't happy

182
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,640
he was going into the woods with Ash and Jeremy.

183
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,560
Ken grabbed his gear, said goodbye,

184
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,280
and headed to the ranger shack.

185
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,640
Buzz introduced himself, took Ken's picture,

186
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:45,040
asked for his information, and posted it on the board.

187
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,440
After talking about the missing people for a few minutes,

188
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,560
Ken headed off into the woods.

189
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,920
A group of three high school girls

190
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,040
walked into the contention public library.

191
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,840
Judy Krinklehoff, a senior at Silas Cole,

192
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,280
and the older sister of Ken Krinklehoff

193
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,440
still wore the same clothes she bought for freshman year.

194
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,920
She was very anxious, never said the right thing,

195
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,800
and wanted to be in a relationship

196
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,680
with the coolest girl at school,

197
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:15,440
a rebel who bullied Judy named Elizabeth Liz Lonklin.

198
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,240
Liz wore a leather jacket and Doc Martens,

199
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,640
she smoked cigarettes,

200
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,920
and she was a self-described bitch.

201
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,960
The final girl, Sharon Shadow Berryman,

202
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,120
formerly a popular cheerleader,

203
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,160
was now obsessed with going to graveyards,

204
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,040
funerals, and hospitals

205
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,280
to engage with all forms and stages of death.

206
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,000
Shadow asked Steven Page for the location

207
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,240
of occult books related to voodoo,

208
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,360
and he led them to a small room in the back

209
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,040
with a small sign that read occult.

210
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,040
Inside, they found a book titled Voodoo.

211
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,520
Shadow said they would find what they were looking for

212
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:57,520
on page 419, and Liz revealed she wanted to torture

213
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,960
someone named Brittany for sleeping with her boyfriend,

214
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:05,280
all while Judy went on about how beautiful Liz was.

215
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:09,140
Page 419 described a ritual that must be performed

216
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:12,380
while surrounded by trees at night.

217
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:15,660
There were a few ingredients necessary for performing it.

218
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,740
The left pinky toe of a dead squirrel,

219
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,020
dirt scraped from the earth

220
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:22,100
after it had been stepped on by a menstruating calf,

221
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,660
the blood from a former cheerleader gone goth

222
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:29,060
who goes to Silas Colquet through 12, and bird pee.

223
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,780
Smash cut to the group leaving the library with the book.

224
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,920
Smash cut to them on the side of the road,

225
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,660
bent over a dead squirrel cutting off its pinky toe.

226
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,420
Smash cut to them in a field,

227
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:41,460
scooping up dirt under a cow bleeding from its lady butt.

228
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,820
Smash cut to them standing in a parking lot

229
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:46,220
waiting for a bird to pee slash poo on them.

230
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:48,740
Smash cut to Shadow scratching herself

231
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,100
with the dead squirrel toe

232
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,340
and dripping her blood into a vial.

233
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:55,220
Smash cut to two days ago when Shadow told Liz

234
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,180
her boyfriend was cheating on her with Brittany

235
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,060
from Spinkbonk High in the city,

236
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:01,060
and Shadow and Judy agreed to help Liz

237
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,440
get back at her boyfriend.

238
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,700
Smash cut back to the present,

239
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:07,020
and the girls were on their way to the woods

240
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:10,140
with all the necessary ingredients.

241
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,940
Shadow turned onto a gravel road

242
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:14,020
and a possum walked out in front of the car.

243
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:18,060
Shadow drove straight for it and crushed it under the car.

244
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,420
She was happy for the possum

245
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,460
since it was in a different place now,

246
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:24,780
but Judy worried it wasn't going to heaven.

247
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,480
They buried the possum real quick

248
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,180
and then arrived at the contention woods parking lot.

249
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:31,460
Already in the parking lot were five cars,

250
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:35,420
the four we expected, plus Krista Krinklehoff's minivan.

251
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,580
Judy freaked out a little

252
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:38,140
because she saw her mom's minivan

253
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:40,680
and she was out past her curfew.

254
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,700
Liz and Shadow promised to shove Judy into a ditch

255
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,320
if they saw Krista Krinklehoff,

256
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,380
which assuaged Judy's worries.

257
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:51,780
An old man wearing a state forest ranger uniform

258
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:53,580
jumped out and scared the girls.

259
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:57,180
He introduced himself as Woodrow or Buzz for short

260
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:00,180
and asked them to fill out some forms in the shack.

261
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:05,180
Shadow whispered to the rest to not use their real names.

262
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:08,180
Ash Hornbeam walked over to investigate the bush

263
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:11,420
after seeing the man's face disappear back behind it,

264
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,140
his ax in hand.

265
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:15,320
He heard rustling and a chattering sound,

266
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,500
so he ran back to find Jeremy Pettymore,

267
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,140
who was standing at their campsite,

268
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:22,260
still frustrated at the lack of pre-prepared firewood.

269
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,660
Ash sprinted back and squawked about a man in a bush

270
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,980
by a log making animal noises.

271
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,040
Jeremy readied the gun he found

272
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,180
and Ash led him to the bush.

273
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,900
It was still rustling with movement

274
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:35,920
and the animal-like noises were still audible.

275
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:40,980
Ash picked up a long stick and poked at the bush.

276
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,780
Stepping back from the bush was a naked human man

277
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,460
covered in scratches and cuts,

278
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:47,180
some of which were still bleeding.

279
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:51,380
He looked at the boys with huge eyes and froze.

280
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:53,740
Jeremy took out the Polaroid of the Polaroids.

281
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,460
They could tell this was one of the people

282
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:56,580
who'd gone missing,

283
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,920
though they couldn't quite read his name.

284
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,000
The boys called out to him,

285
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,280
suggested he put on pants and offered to help

286
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,680
with a first aid kit.

287
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,800
The man scampered up to them hastily.

288
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,580
Jeremy pointed the gun at him to no effect.

289
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,520
The man pushed his fingers together,

290
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:13,840
made sad puppy dog eyes and mewled.

291
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,500
Ash and Jeremy discussed what to do with the animal man

292
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,880
as he sniffed the air and headed to their campsite.

293
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,580
The boys tried to Red Rover him,

294
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:24,080
but the situation finally sunk into Ash.

295
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:27,060
He freaked out, backed away and tripped backwards on a log.

296
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:29,620
Jeremy tried to stop the man alone but wasn't able to.

297
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,760
Both boys had the realization though

298
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:35,640
that this man did not act or run like a normal human man.

299
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,840
He was too fast.

300
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:41,360
He was crouched and he used his front legs or arms

301
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,440
to aid his movement toward their campsite.

302
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,980
The boys ran back to their spot,

303
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,760
still holding their weapons.

304
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,600
When they returned,

305
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,240
they saw the man hunched over their bag with food,

306
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,600
going to town on the snacks they brought.

307
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,160
Jeremy cried out for his little Smokies.

308
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,000
After a small tussle between the boys and the naked man,

309
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,120
Ash kicked away the can of Smokies,

310
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,560
kneed him in the face and full nelsoned him

311
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,280
down into the mud, immobilizing him.

312
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,800
Jeremy took a rope, tied him to a tree

313
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,480
and tried to calm him down with more Smokies.

314
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,320
Ash used some hand sanitizer

315
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,600
and headed back down the trail to get buzz.

316
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,500
As Ash headed back to the shack,

317
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,760
the trees around him began to warp.

318
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,300
The trail became nearly non-existent

319
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,800
and he was suddenly looking at a thicket of woods

320
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,240
instead of the trail in front of him.

321
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,040
The sun was going down

322
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,220
and Ash was all by himself

323
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:36,600
and he had no fucking clue where he was.

324
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,920
Ken Krenkelhoff walked down the trail

325
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,680
and made it to the usual campsite.

326
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,440
When he arrived, he saw Jeremy waving little Smokies

327
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:47,480
in front of the face of a naked, bloody man

328
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,760
tied up to a tree.

329
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,520
Ken shouted as he entered the clearing,

330
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,780
startling Jeremy Pettymore.

331
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,600
Ken asked if the man could hear him

332
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,560
and if he was all right

333
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,040
and the man made some more chattering noises.

334
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,080
Jeremy indicated this was one of the people

335
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,880
who had gone missing in the woods.

336
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:05,440
Ash was on his way back to the ranger station to get buzz.

337
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,540
In the meantime, Jeremy was trying to tame the animal man

338
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,680
with tiny meat fellows.

339
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,560
Ken realized that if Ash was going from the campsite

340
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:18,120
to the ranger shack, they should have crossed paths,

341
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,040
but they didn't.

342
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,960
Ken called out for Ash but stopped

343
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:25,360
when he looked back at the man and no longer saw humanity.

344
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,140
Only animalistic intent behind the eyes

345
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:31,500
of this bloody, muddy, tied up naked human body.

346
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,300
Ken freaked out and backed away,

347
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,260
claiming the man wasn't a person.

348
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:38,460
Jeremy tried to convince him the man was still a man,

349
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:40,180
but Ken wasn't convinced.

350
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:43,340
He went back to calling out for Ash's panic rising.

351
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,900
Jeremy wasn't sure why Ken was scared of this man,

352
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:48,120
whom he had named Rusty.

353
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,860
Shadow, Liz, and Judy were in the contention woods

354
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,780
parking lot talking to Buzz.

355
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,360
Judy worried about her mom

356
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,740
and wondered if she'd also gone missing.

357
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:01,240
Shadow and Liz calmed her down by suggesting

358
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,200
that perhaps Chris's car was stolen

359
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,600
and so it wasn't actually her that drove it to the woods.

360
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,160
Now back in the shack, Buzz asked the young ladies

361
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,160
to come over and take care of business

362
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,560
so they can be on their way.

363
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,620
They wondered if they should trust the man,

364
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:17,020
but decided to have their pictures taken anyway.

365
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,160
Glancing around the shack,

366
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,920
they saw various ranger equipment

367
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,720
and the bulletin board of missing people,

368
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:25,600
as well as a massive jug of hand sanitizer on the windowsill.

369
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,840
Judy furiously pumped hand sanitizer into her hand,

370
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:32,320
so much so that it overflowed onto the floor.

371
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,520
Liz looked at Judy appalled

372
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,520
and asked Buzz if they could have a machete

373
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:39,240
to protect themselves from something killing people,

374
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,040
like maybe Judy's mom.

375
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,880
Judy freaked out and started licking the hand sanitizer

376
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,880
from her hands.

377
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,720
Buzz offered the hand sanitizer to the other two girls.

378
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,160
Shadow refused, but Liz put her hand out

379
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,840
and as Buzz started to pump out the hand sanitizer,

380
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,260
she tried to pull her hand away,

381
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,060
but plenty still landed on her,

382
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:58,420
so she unhappily rubbed it in.

383
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:01,120
As Buzz pinned all their information and pictures

384
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,200
on the not missing side of the board,

385
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,220
the girls noticed a slight trickle of blood

386
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:10,340
going down the back of his neck, staining his uniform.

387
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,740
Ash looked around at the ever darkening tree

388
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:20,940
surrounding him as the sun went down.

389
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:23,500
He heard a noise and saw a tree

390
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,860
emitting a bright light from a hollow point.

391
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:28,500
He looked around suspiciously,

392
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,860
saw a trip wire between him and the tree

393
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,780
and carefully avoided it

394
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:35,880
as he walked up to the light emanating knot.

395
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,360
It was so bright, Ash couldn't see what was inside,

396
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,020
but he knew something was deep in there.

397
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:44,340
Ash pushed his arm into the arm shaped hole

398
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:48,720
up to his elbow, felt around, found nothing,

399
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,060
pushed in deeper and when he attempted to pull his arm out,

400
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:55,200
he felt a great pain on his skin,

401
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,860
like he was noodling a razor sharp catfish

402
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:00,500
all the way from elbow to fingertip.

403
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,460
Ash pulled out about a centimeter

404
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:07,000
and the bit of arm revealed only raw muscle and tendons.

405
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,220
It lacked skin completely.

406
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,760
He realized he was trapped

407
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,480
and for the first time in his life,

408
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,980
Ash Hornbeam had no idea what to do.

409
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:22,340
Shadow told Buzz he was bleeding from his head.

410
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:24,740
She offered to trade her first aid kit for his machete

411
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,420
and he gladly accepted.

412
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:28,680
She grabbed the kit in a vial and patched him up

413
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,740
while discreetly taking a sample of his blood.

414
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,760
The group then took stock of their possessions

415
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,020
and headed to their designated camping spot

416
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:38,020
to perform the ritual.

417
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,740
Upon arrival, there were no rocks

418
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,380
around the designated fire pit

419
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:43,380
in order to keep the fire contained.

420
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,620
This was very concerning to Judy.

421
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,900
Liz went to find some rocks

422
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:50,540
and Shadow swayed in the wind to attune with nature.

423
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,180
Judy, worried about her mom

424
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:54,740
and the pond water she just used to brush her teeth,

425
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:56,460
suffered a bout of insanity.

426
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,220
She saw reality warp.

427
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:02,560
Shadow blended into the trees and the ground became the sky.

428
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:06,240
Judy promptly ran into the woods in her footy pajamas.

429
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,300
Shadow sighed and followed with her machete,

430
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,500
leaping and dancing as she went.

431
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:15,180
Liz's reality glitched

432
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:17,140
and she suddenly found herself lost

433
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:19,760
in an unrecognizable part of the woods.

434
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,300
Behind some rocks, she saw a fit looking bald man

435
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:25,540
in his forties walking in circles, waving his hands

436
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,060
and talking to himself.

437
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:30,900
All on the other side of a thick line of white powder.

438
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:35,700
A branch like sigil was carved into every tree in sight.

439
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:38,780
Liz tried to get away quietly, but she stepped on a stick

440
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:40,980
and he beckoned her over to his little camp

441
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,900
with some semi-intelligible,

442
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,780
mostly English accented instructions.

443
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:48,660
She went over partly because she found him attractive.

444
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:52,320
He was concerned about two things, the sky turning

445
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:56,220
and keeping the lady in the wood away.

446
00:19:56,220 --> 00:20:00,100
A tattoo of a stylized H was slightly hidden

447
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,700
on the back of his neck.

448
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,180
After a little more discussion,

449
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:05,540
Liz decided she was too worried by the situation

450
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:06,820
and didn't trust him.

451
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:08,740
She ran away as he shouted,

452
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:11,680
she was definitely going to get go.

453
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:17,620
Lost in the woods, Liz Lonklin stumbled upon Ash Hornbeam

454
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:21,740
stuck in a tree with tears streaming down his face.

455
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:24,460
They were understandably surprised to see each other.

456
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:27,140
Ash warned her about the trip wire just in time,

457
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:29,500
but the helpless situation caused him to lose it

458
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,360
and pull his arm out a little bit more.

459
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:35,020
The loss of skin was staggering.

460
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,820
He threw up at a sheer panic.

461
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,660
Liz dipped out, shouting for help.

462
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,340
She was leaving Ash alone with the tree once again,

463
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:45,580
staring at his lacerated, dripping arm.

464
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:47,700
Judy ran haphazardly through the woods,

465
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,860
but thankfully stopped just before

466
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:52,700
a suspicious looking pile of leaves.

467
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:56,260
Shadow almost danced directly into the dubious detritus,

468
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,780
but Judy pulled her out of the way,

469
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:01,460
revealing the 10 foot deep pit underneath the leaf pile.

470
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,060
Shaken, but not yet broken,

471
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,940
the two headed back to their campsite.

472
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:07,220
They didn't see Liz, but they did see a raccoon

473
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:10,460
sitting there eating just like a person would.

474
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:13,220
The little trash panda indicated that hand sanitizer

475
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:15,920
should not be used, might be deadly.

476
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,860
Judy looked into the raccoon's eyes,

477
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:21,220
saw the soul of a human and decided to trust it.

478
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:24,120
Shadow tottered along with T-Rex arms,

479
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:27,620
imitating the raccoon as the trio headed back

480
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,860
to the entrance of the woods.

481
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,780
After searching through the woods

482
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:36,500
in the dwindling twilight, Liz finally found the trail

483
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,820
along with Jeremy Pettymore and Ken Krinkelhoff

484
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:40,060
at their campsite.

485
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:42,620
She saw them talking to a feral man,

486
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:44,420
feeding him little winkies.

487
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:46,660
She told them Ash was in trouble with a tree

488
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:49,180
while Jeremy fed Rusty more smokes.

489
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:51,540
They debated whether or not to take Rusty along

490
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:52,380
for the search.

491
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:56,960
Ken finally agreed to it and Liz Lonklin led the party.

492
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,560
Shadow, Judy and the raccoon made their way

493
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,620
back to the parking lot and were confronted

494
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:04,960
by Judy's mom's voice coming out of the shack.

495
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,040
Judy instinctively ran to get more hand sanitizer

496
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,080
from her mom and succeeded in doing so

497
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,340
despite the raccoon physically trying to stop her.

498
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:15,480
Krista told the girls that Buzz had asked her

499
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:19,360
to watch the shack while he went to investigate an argument.

500
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,320
The raccoon indicated they should get the fuck out of Dodge

501
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,720
but Shadow wanted to go back and get Liz.

502
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,840
She persuaded Krista to help her find Liz.

503
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,320
Judy could stay in the shack with the raccoon.

504
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,600
When Shadow and Krista skipped into the forest together,

505
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,480
Judy hit the restroom.

506
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:40,480
There she saw the limp, neatly folded body

507
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:44,040
of Ranger Buzz on the floor.

508
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:50,160
Ken Krinklehoff, Jeremy Pettymore, Liz Lonklin and Rusty

509
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,980
walked through the woods looking for Ash Hornbeam

510
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:55,520
whose arm was stuck in a tree.

511
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,800
The sun had now gone down and they were in total darkness.

512
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,880
Too far off the trail, the group began to realize

513
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,960
none of them knew where they were.

514
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,780
They walked deeper into the woods

515
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:09,600
and eventually saw through the moonlight

516
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,000
a picture frame hanging on a tree.

517
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:18,400
Flashback to Ken Krinklehoff a couple years ago.

518
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,160
He and his friends were out in the woods

519
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:23,320
on their annual outing to look for Ol' Madge.

520
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,100
He popped away to pee behind a tree

521
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,520
and as he looked up from his stream of urine,

522
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,880
he saw a frame like of a painting

523
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:33,000
hanging there in the woods.

524
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,620
It looked like nothing was in the frame.

525
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:38,680
Ken approached and noticed that somewhere along

526
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:42,220
the edge of this frame, something didn't line up

527
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:45,680
as if what was behind the frame wasn't the same

528
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,880
as what he could see through it.

529
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,560
He strafed to the side to get a better look

530
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:52,320
and saw that beyond the frame was a cabin.

531
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,640
Ken walked up to this frame to put his hand through it

532
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:58,200
but at the last second noticed a trip wire

533
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,160
he was about to step on.

534
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,240
Ken jumped back, grabbed a rock

535
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,960
and threw it at the trip wire.

536
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:07,400
A giant wooden spear came flying through the canvas

537
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,720
of the painting and stabbed directly into a tree

538
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,440
just missing Ken.

539
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:15,800
He rushed back to the camp while convincing himself

540
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,320
it wasn't real.

541
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:20,880
Flashback forward to Jeremy, Liz, Ken and Rusty

542
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,600
standing in the clearing looking at the weird frame.

543
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,280
Ken yelled out for everyone to stop and not go any closer.

544
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:30,360
He pointed at the ground and next to the frame

545
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,880
there was a trip wire.

546
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,240
He tossed a small log onto the trip wire

547
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,720
and a massive spear shot through the frame

548
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,400
directly into a nearby tree.

549
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,680
Ken shared his memory with the rest of the party

550
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,400
and as they all looked at this frame

551
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,480
they could see a cabin in the woods

552
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,300
through the spear made hole.

553
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:52,120
Ken snapped, grabbed the spear and raced toward the cabin.

554
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,760
As Jeremy yelled at him to stop,

555
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,960
Ken stepped on a pile of leaves covering a hole

556
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,480
and disappeared into the ground.

557
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,400
Ash Hornbeam stood in the woods terrified.

558
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,240
His arm stuck halfway into the hollow of a tree.

559
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,520
Part of his arm that he could see had been stripped

560
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:13,160
of every layer of flesh.

561
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:16,440
The sun finished going down and Ash stood alone

562
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,320
in the moonlight.

563
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,600
He heard the snap of a branch nearby

564
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,180
and out of the trees approached a man

565
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:26,360
in a black suit, white shirt and bolo tie.

566
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,400
He was a fit man in his late 20s or early 30s

567
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,920
with a glorious mustache and pants

568
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,840
that were a bit too tight.

569
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,720
He flashed an FBI badge and introduced himself

570
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,360
as Agent Kevin.

571
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,760
He asked Ash why he was out in the woods.

572
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,880
Ash said he and some friends come out to the woods

573
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,140
every year to camp and look for old Madge,

574
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:47,800
a woman in the woods from local legend.

575
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:51,640
Kevin cursed, thanked him and with a trembling hand

576
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:54,940
pressed a gun to the back of Ash's head.

577
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:57,860
Acting on pure instinct, Ash reached into his pocket,

578
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:00,460
pulled out a lighter and some firecrackers,

579
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:04,740
lit them with one hand and held them against Kevin's head.

580
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,800
Kevin lowered his gun, grabbed the fireworks

581
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,540
and threw them away.

582
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:12,340
On closer inspection, Kevin recognized Ash as a local kid

583
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:14,100
who was celebrated in the community

584
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:17,380
after he defended his home from a couple burglars.

585
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,860
Flashback!

586
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:22,000
To a younger Ash Hornbeam sitting on his front porch

587
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,800
wrapped in a crisis blanket,

588
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,880
talking to a contention police officer.

589
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,520
Ash had heard noises in his basement

590
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,700
and it sounded like two men's voices,

591
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:35,320
one tall and skinny, the other short and fat.

592
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:38,440
Ash thought they were after his dad's coin collection.

593
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,560
Flashback!

594
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:44,380
To a few hours before this to Ash home alone watching TV.

595
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:46,900
On the screen is a commercial for a CD player

596
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:49,840
Ash desperately wanted but couldn't afford.

597
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,760
So he hatched a plan to steal

598
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,880
some of his dad's rare coin collection.

599
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,100
He tried typing in birthdays into the lock box

600
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:01,920
that contained the coins and his birthday worked.

601
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:06,360
Ash took a handful, roughly $600 worth of coins.

602
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,720
Flashback forward!

603
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:11,080
To the officer asking Ash about the paint cans

604
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,000
hanging from strings.

605
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,260
Ash said he set up traps and tripwires

606
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:18,880
and told an epic story of utilizing these common objects

607
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,240
to hassle the robbers until they gave up and left.

608
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,080
Flash a bit more forward!

609
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:27,800
To Ash carrying his new CD player with him

610
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,760
everywhere he went.

611
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,720
Flash fully back forward!

612
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:36,080
To Kevin returning to the trapped Ash

613
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,640
along with a woman wearing a black suit,

614
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,040
white shirt and a black tie.

615
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,440
She held a machete and she chanted

616
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,600
while she rubbed a hand on the blade.

617
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,580
The woman smiled a cold, vacant smile

618
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:53,500
behind asymmetrical bangs covering one of her eyes.

619
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:57,400
Agent Kevin introduced her as Agent Karen

620
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,440
and she immediately lifted the machete above her head

621
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:03,440
and brought it down through Ash's elbow.

622
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,840
Out of shock, Ash stepped back, looked down

623
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,000
and saw his arm had been cut off.

624
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,040
The end of it was completely cauterized

625
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:15,400
and the skin around the stump began to grow back

626
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,040
as he watched.

627
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,840
Agent Karen said nothing, just smiled,

628
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,520
turned around and walked away.

629
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,360
Agent Kevin put his arm around Ash

630
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:28,540
and led him to a black sedan sitting next to a four wheeler

631
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:31,000
in the middle of the woods.

632
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,760
Through some brush and trees, they could see a cabin.

633
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:41,080
Shadow and Krista Krinklehoff walked down the trail

634
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:44,380
and Shadow sang a song about death.

635
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:47,260
The sun finished setting and they continued to walk

636
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:49,420
lit only by a flashlight.

637
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:52,420
Krista said she saw Liz and shot off with the flashlight

638
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:56,260
into the woods followed by a giggling Shadow.

639
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:59,360
But then Shadow watched the flashlight go completely dark

640
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,940
and felt a rope tighten around her ankle.

641
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:04,320
She was hoisted into the air upside down

642
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,960
hanging by one foot.

643
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:09,700
Krista turned on the flashlight under her chin

644
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:13,280
like it was spooky story time.

645
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:18,280
She said, my darling, it is certifiably unfortunate

646
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,520
that your demise is seemingly necessary

647
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:25,600
despite my finding your demeanor so appropriate

648
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,840
for your kind.

649
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,640
From your personal hymns, I can assume and do hope

650
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,980
that a lack of existence is your preference?

651
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:40,720
Shadow whispered to herself, finally.

652
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:46,720
And she watched a long silver tendril grow from the back

653
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,880
of Krista Krinklehoff's neck and then another

654
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,280
and another and another.

655
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:56,920
The limbs extended towards Shadow's pinoted body

656
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:01,200
and the camera panned down to show the long shadows

657
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,760
play out the grizzly scene.

658
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,840
One of the shiny tentacles sliced into the soft tissue

659
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,240
on the back of her neck.

660
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:12,920
Another snapped her head forward and a third reached in

661
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:17,360
and gripped her spinal cord and ripped it out of her body

662
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:22,180
delivering Shadow to her finish line, her goal,

663
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:27,180
her lack of a destination and finally she felt nothing.

664
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:32,520
The sun had set and as it began to rain outside

665
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:35,920
Judy Krinklehoff stood at the doorway to the bathroom

666
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,000
and stared at the lifeless folded crumpled body of Buzz.

667
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,720
She could tell by looking around there'd been a tussle

668
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,080
and she found a stick of her mom's favorite brand

669
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,920
of chapstick behind the toilet.

670
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,280
The raccoons stood in the doorway motioning

671
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,160
to get the fuck out of there.

672
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:58,880
Judy followed the raccoon into the rain into the darkness

673
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,100
and a lightning bolt flashed in the distance.

674
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:07,100
It was just bright enough to illuminate a blood covered

675
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:12,620
Krista Krinklehoff walking directly toward her.

676
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,420
The raccoon at Judy's side shivered

677
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:18,300
and tried to communicate tugging at Judy's arm

678
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:22,940
but eventually ran away when Judy went to help her mother.

679
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:25,480
Judy guided her back to the shack to clean up

680
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:29,260
her blood drenched mother but when she closed the door

681
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:32,380
Judy felt a pinch on the back of her neck.

682
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:37,060
She turned and saw her mom's body had crumpled to the ground

683
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:40,500
and standing in front of her was a small one inch

684
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:44,460
silver sphere with metallic arms grounding itself

685
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:47,060
in the walls and ceiling of the shack.

686
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:50,900
Shiny tendrils reached out, snapped Judy's neck forward

687
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:54,320
and ripped out her spine shoving itself

688
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,140
into her spinal column.

689
00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:01,720
Judy Krinklehoff was no longer Judy Krinklehoff.

690
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,960
She was an objective based entity

691
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:08,400
and its current objective was to collect

692
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:11,540
as many bodies as possible.

693
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:15,660
After falling into the hidden hole under the pile of leaves

694
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:20,100
Ken Krinklehoff slid on his back down an earthy viscous slide

695
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:23,180
for some time until he finally landed in a pit

696
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:25,980
of cold dirt and perfect darkness.

697
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:29,220
He was in a small crawl space with what looked like

698
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:32,860
floor supports though they were translucent tubes

699
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:36,500
filled with a squamous black ooze that traveled down

700
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:40,140
from the cabin into the ground below.

701
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:43,460
Ken also saw a door above him and he cautiously listened

702
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:45,800
for any sound on the other side.

703
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:50,060
Ash Hornbeam followed agents Kevin and Karen

704
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:53,580
to the black sedan and four wheeler hidden in the brush.

705
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:55,580
There was another agent in the backseat wearing

706
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:57,580
the same black suit with a white shirt.

707
00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:01,660
The man in his early 30s had buzzed blonde hair

708
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:04,820
and introduced himself as Agent Kyle.

709
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:07,700
As Ash looked out ahead of him he saw the cabin

710
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,380
in a small clearing.

711
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:12,020
Next to the cabin sat a small shipping container

712
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:14,460
and a large yellow excavator.

713
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:17,140
A moat surrounded the clearing.

714
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:19,680
Ash saw movement just outside the moat.

715
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:22,980
Liz, Jeremy and Ken stopped to talk.

716
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:25,380
Ken picked up a small log, threw it

717
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:28,460
and a long wooden spear flew in their direction

718
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:29,580
and hit a tree.

719
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:32,300
Ken grabbed the spear, took off running, fell into the

720
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,600
ground and disappeared.

721
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,560
Kevin turned back to Ash and broke his mind

722
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,760
with two sentences.

723
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:43,340
The woods are full of traps and Ol' Madge,

724
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:48,000
the local legend the boys searched for annually was real.

725
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,940
Ash couldn't handle it, something snapped,

726
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:52,520
he bailed out of the car, ran and disappeared

727
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,540
into the night.

728
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:57,480
Jeremy and Liz stood in the dark of the woods

729
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:00,620
when they saw Ken disappear into the ground

730
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:02,100
and it began to rain.

731
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,600
They looked forward, the cabin lights turned on

732
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:07,620
and they noticed a storage container and a big yellow

733
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:11,620
excavator next to the cabin all encircled by a moat.

734
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:13,500
The pair moved forward to investigate the cabin

735
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,300
and found the moat was about five feet across.

736
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:18,980
Jeremy threw some smokies onto the other side

737
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:22,820
and held Rusty's feet as he lunged across to grab

738
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:24,960
the small sausage boys.

739
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,700
Liz crossed Rusty's back without issue but Jeremy

740
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:30,720
and Rusty fell into the fish filled moat.

741
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:33,780
They crawled out near Liz, a wet mess.

742
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,740
The trio approached the cabin slowly.

743
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:39,720
Liz stumbled up the stairs to look through the window

744
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:43,640
and she saw strange lab equipment and translucent tubes

745
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:46,880
that ran down into the floorboards filled with a

746
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:50,400
squamous black viscous goo.

747
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:53,240
Papers were scattered across tables and a desk

748
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:57,560
and in the corner sat a large wooden trunk.

749
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:01,080
Jeremy edged toward the storage unit, opened the door

750
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:05,320
and saw on one side a closet full of clothes

751
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,960
and on the other side lined up against the wall

752
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:12,960
the bodies of roughly 15 people hung limply on hooks

753
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,880
from a pole in the back of each neck.

754
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:19,040
Jeremy turned and screamed at Liz they needed to get

755
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:22,880
the fuck out of there and the pair bolted across the moat.

756
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,300
As they ran Liz heard a click under her foot.

757
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:29,840
She tried to stop in time but a giant metal cloth

758
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:34,240
swung down from the branch above and removed her head

759
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,240
from her shoulders.

760
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:40,680
Jeremy knew she was dead, he kept running.

761
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:44,720
Ash Hornbeam also ran through the dark rainy night.

762
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,080
He found the trail and in the distance he saw

763
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,600
Judy Krinklehoff walking toward him.

764
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:52,460
Ash grabbed her arm and kept running, pulling her with him.

765
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:54,360
They arrived at his usual campsite.

766
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:57,840
Ash fell to his knees, gasped for air and told Judy

767
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:01,200
her brother disappeared into a hole in the ground.

768
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:05,360
Judy seemed unworried by this news and suggested finding

769
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,140
some large rocks.

770
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:10,040
Ash continued to panic and freak out and Judy went to go

771
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,560
find some rocks.

772
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:14,960
Ash considered his options but decided to stay with Judy

773
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,000
for now since he did have a crush on her.

774
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Judy found a huge rock, walked up behind Ash and crushed

775
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,520
his head in.

776
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:29,220
Ken Krinklehoff crouched in the crawl space under the cabin

777
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,840
lit only by his flashlight.

778
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,840
He gently put his ear to the door above him and heard

779
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:37,160
a muffled yell in the distance.

780
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:41,960
It was Jeremy screaming for Liz to get the fuck out of here.

781
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:44,160
Ken poked his head up through the door.

782
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:47,140
This was not a cabin, it was a lab.

783
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:51,040
The same translucent tubes full of black ooze were all

784
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:54,840
around the room going into the floor and Ken saw the tubes

785
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:59,040
were coming from small coffin shaped boxes.

786
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:02,160
There was a desk littered with papers, a bulletin board

787
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,580
and a large wooden trunk.

788
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:07,620
Ken heard a guttural scream cut short and looked out the

789
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:11,360
window at the exact moment Liz Lonklin was stopped dead

790
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:16,360
in her tracks by the decapitation from a massive metal claw.

791
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:21,140
Having convinced himself that what he just saw could not

792
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:24,200
have been real, Ken turned back around and investigated

793
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,400
the scene.

794
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:29,880
He found articles of organization for a new business called

795
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:34,880
Cole's Orphanage, New School Under Modern Etiquette.

796
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:39,720
All the other papers were blueprints for an odd looking gun

797
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:43,040
which seemed to have been recently completed.

798
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:47,160
There were also plans for small metal spheres one inch

799
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:52,160
in diameter which were being placed into small human bodies.

800
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,760
Ken took a wary glance at the little coffins.

801
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,200
He opened one and a black viscous goo began pouring out of it

802
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,000
onto the table and floor.

803
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,960
Inside the coffin there sat the body of a two year old

804
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:09,200
that was not quite fully human looking as if it was being

805
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:13,720
3D printed and was not yet finished like a face with a

806
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,560
plastic bag over it.

807
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:19,760
Ken freaked the fuck out and ran for the front door

808
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,720
of the cabin.

809
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:24,480
Jeremy Pettymore ran desperately through the woods

810
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,720
and eventually found Judy Krinkelhoff walking toward him.

811
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:30,200
Judy said she didn't know what to do since the other girls

812
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,840
had left her alone.

813
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:34,480
The two decided to head back to the ranger shack.

814
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,040
Jeremy took the lead.

815
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:39,240
Judy pulled out the machete she was hiding and lunged

816
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:42,600
at the Pettymore boy but she slipped on the muddy rocks

817
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:47,600
below, fell face first onto the machete and split her skull

818
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:52,600
wide open enough for Jeremy to see a small one inch

819
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:57,160
in diameter silver sphere in the middle of her head.

820
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:02,160
Black ooze began to leak onto the trail and Jeremy ran.

821
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:07,040
Ken stumbled out of the cabin and saw three figures

822
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,200
approaching.

823
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:11,040
Through the rain and darkness a lightning strike in the

824
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,440
distance revealed the trio.

825
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,560
All wearing black suits with white shirts, two with black

826
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:19,440
ties and one with a bolo tie.

827
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,520
The tall one had buzz blonde hair, the man with the bolo

828
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:26,160
tie was shorter, sported tight pants and a thick mustache

829
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:30,800
and the last was a woman smiling a cold, vacant smile

830
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:35,480
behind asymmetrical bangs covering one of her eyes.

831
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:39,040
They saw Ken and the woman began chanting.

832
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:42,920
Ken turned to rush back into the cabin, his arm reached out

833
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:47,920
for the door and his hand phased into and through the wood.

834
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:52,040
He felt an aberrant push in the back and his body too

835
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,960
was forced into the door.

836
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:59,960
Ken Krinklehoff was trapped halfway in and halfway out

837
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:02,880
the entrance and exit of this cabin.

838
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,600
His mind worked just long enough to watch the suits

839
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,520
ransack the lab.

840
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:12,200
One grabbed a bucket of water filled with fish to splash

841
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,640
and repel the ooze.

842
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:18,200
The other two took some papers in the trunk and they left

843
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:22,080
but not before the woman chanted once more and ignited

844
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:25,720
the cabin in unnatural flames.

845
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:29,560
Ken Krinklehoff died burning part of the cabin

846
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,280
in the contention woods.

847
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:38,360
Jeremy Pettymore now all alone ran back to the ranger shack

848
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,160
in the parking lot.

849
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:43,040
He got to the Bronco with the keys he had nabbed earlier

850
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,600
but the car wouldn't start.

851
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:47,720
He got out and then the heavy rain and darkness of night

852
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:51,060
he ran down the road toward town.

853
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:55,160
Behind Jeremy, the black sedan drove furiously into view

854
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:57,240
and behind it the four wheeler.

855
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:00,720
As they approached, the four wheeler overtook the sedan

856
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:04,760
and pulled up next to Jeremy as he desperately sprinted.

857
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:07,880
Jeremy looked over and the man who drove this ATV

858
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:11,120
was pretty fit for his early 40s and he wore a black suit

859
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:13,880
with a white shirt and a bolo tie below a face

860
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:16,120
with a badass mustache.

861
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:20,000
He recognized the man as John Lee Pettymore III,

862
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,840
his second cousin.

863
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:26,240
The two came to a stop and Jeremy waved and tried to hop

864
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,640
on the four wheeler.

865
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:31,040
John, John, Uncle John, Uncle John.

866
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:35,920
John stopped, saw Jeremy and his heart sank.

867
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,780
Uncle John, thank God you're here.

868
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:40,100
What's wrong, Uncle John?

869
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:43,980
John Lee Pettymore III lifted a pistol

870
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:47,040
and put it to his second cousin's head.

871
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:51,440
Jeremy Pettymore, 14 years old, closed his eyes tight,

872
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:55,880
shaking, he felt the gun against his head trembling.

873
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,440
And then there was nothing.

874
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,800
Now, back to the contention boys.

875
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:06,920
Clark Bishop, Keith Vigna and John Lee Pettymore IV

876
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:09,560
and the body of John Lee Pettymore III

877
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:13,360
woke up, bodies fully in shock, ears ringing,

878
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:18,360
bellies weirdly satisfied and an uncomfortably savory smell

879
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:23,300
in their nostrils as their eyes adjusted to see

880
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:27,580
the inside of a mausoleum splattered in blood.

881
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:30,560
They remembered everything that had happened to them before

882
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:33,280
but they seemed to be back in the same physical

883
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,280
and mental state they were in just after meeting

884
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:39,640
the chanting cloaked old Clark.

885
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:43,280
According to Clark's watch, it was the day of the funeral

886
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:46,160
at 1 p.m. again.

887
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:50,280
Keith ripped his shirt off and found the word Marvin

888
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:54,000
that had been burned into his chest had been crossed out.

889
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,560
The other names, Tildy on their dominant palms,

890
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:59,520
Drew on their backs and Maggie on the bottom

891
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,920
of their left feet were still branded

892
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,040
on each of their bodies the same as before.

893
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,960
They wondered whether Marvin would still be dead

894
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:10,440
and theorized that they'd have to work their way

895
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:12,040
through the other names as well.

896
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:15,520
Would they have to kill Maggie and Drew?

897
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:17,960
And how would they find Tildy?

898
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:20,680
John called Rosemary, she picked up

899
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:22,820
and he immediately hung up.

900
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:25,780
John recalled the vision he'd had the last time

901
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:27,640
they were at the cemetery.

902
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:30,360
Keith told the others about the visions he had

903
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:32,740
while wearing his father's watch.

904
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:35,360
Clark suggested calling Maggie and reporting

905
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:38,500
that he'd successfully killed Stan Manstein

906
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:42,920
but first he tried to summon old Clark.

907
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:46,920
He only succeeded in driving himself into a rage

908
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:49,080
and he charged John.

909
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:51,160
When they finally sorted themselves out,

910
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:55,440
the CPD-3 exited the mausoleum and again

911
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,960
encountered the old lady who freaked out.

912
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:01,640
She'd already seen them leave the tomb earlier.

913
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:04,880
The gang of risen ex-cops scared her off

914
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:07,940
and discussed the implications of this news.

915
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:09,720
They considered just waiting around

916
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:12,460
for their next iterations to come out of the mausoleum

917
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:15,680
but decided instead to call Maggie.

918
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:21,180
The vision Clark received when he tried to summon himself

919
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:24,260
became instantly clear in his mind.

920
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:28,180
A candlelit stone room contained a hooded figure

921
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:33,180
scribbling furiously into an ornately decorated book

922
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:37,300
made of strange leather.

923
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:42,220
This figure was an elderly decrepit Clark Bishop.

924
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:44,940
There was a knock on the door and a voice called,

925
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:49,940
my Lord, my Lord, as the door opened up.

926
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:54,500
Cut to a silver accord flying down the highway

927
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:57,340
driven by a frantic Maggie Cook.

928
00:44:57,340 --> 00:45:00,880
He saw her call him on her phone.

929
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:04,460
Clark blinked away this unnatural vision

930
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:09,420
and suddenly the phone in his pocket began to buzz.

931
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:11,420
Clark answered and Maggie told him

932
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:14,700
to get to the parking lot immediately to meet her.

933
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:17,060
John and Keith joined even though they disagreed

934
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:19,100
with Clark about trusting her.

935
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:22,620
Maggie sped into the parking lot and pulled up next to them.

936
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:27,620
She tasked them with taking out a man named Bruce Robin

937
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:31,100
as he had gone fully insane

938
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:35,180
and was a danger to the world at large.

939
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:39,460
She was shook by the appearance of John Lee Pettymore III

940
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:42,820
and they quickly explained that whole situation.

941
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:47,180
She did not take it well and they had to calm her down.

942
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:49,700
Clark grabbed the burner phone from his car

943
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:52,220
and saw a text that read,

944
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:56,720
your parents owned an artifact of immense power,

945
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:00,300
too much power for them to be trusted with.

946
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:02,920
He responded, what artifact?

947
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:08,340
Maggie asked her former coworkers to murder Bruce Robin,

948
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:11,500
owner of Bar Corp and former business partner

949
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:14,700
of Keith's brother, Ferguson Beans.

950
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:18,560
John began to question Maggie on how she was still alive,

951
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:22,740
but the ringing of her cell phone cut off Maggie's reply.

952
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:24,180
As Clark rejoined the group,

953
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:27,280
he noted a second cell phone vibrating

954
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:29,420
from within the chief's car.

955
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:32,420
On the call, Maggie berated Leon,

956
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:34,820
told him to do his fucking job.

957
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:37,220
He needed to knock the dust off his knuckles

958
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:40,660
because he knew what needed to be done.

959
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:42,660
She hung up and explained,

960
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:45,020
she never died, just had to disappear.

961
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:46,760
She implied the body they'd found

962
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:49,400
in the remains of her house was a decoy.

963
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:52,300
Maggie tossed the officers a manila envelope,

964
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:56,740
reminded them she was counting on this and drove away.

965
00:46:56,740 --> 00:46:59,680
The manila envelope had a manila folder inside

966
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:03,620
labeled Operation Hole Puncher, Bar Corp.

967
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:05,960
It contained information on Bar Corp,

968
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:10,400
including its three subsidiaries, Jesus Christ Ministries,

969
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:13,040
Health and Rehabilitation Unlimited,

970
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:15,220
and The Learning Center.

971
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:18,480
It also showed finances for the last five years

972
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:21,680
and profits had been steadily rising.

973
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:25,800
The previous year, they made over $850 million

974
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:28,400
and paid zero in taxes,

975
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:32,080
and they were projected to make over $2 billion

976
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:33,540
in the current year.

977
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:37,420
It was also noted that after being declared deceased,

978
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:40,960
Ferguson Beans' majority share was split

979
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:44,740
between his wife Stacy, daughter Frances,

980
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:48,140
and the mill on the other side of the city,

981
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:52,620
which secured Bruce Robin as the majority owner.

982
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:55,580
John mentioned he recently sold that cocaine

983
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:57,420
they'd found in the storage units

984
00:47:57,420 --> 00:48:00,140
to Jesus Christ Ministries,

985
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:03,060
a church camp just outside the city.

986
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:08,060
Clark told John they saw Marvin Glass split his body in half

987
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:11,700
to reveal a silver ball inside his head.

988
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:13,500
John explained his working theory

989
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:16,820
was that all the officers might be bald.

990
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:20,060
He explained that upon the death of his original body,

991
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:23,860
he burst out and went into John Lee Kevinmore's body.

992
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:25,180
He believed this was possible

993
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:28,660
because he was just a little silver ball.

994
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:31,260
Clark described the actions of Rosemary

995
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:35,300
in her final moments inside the flooded Glass office.

996
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:37,340
John asserted her turn on Marvin

997
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:39,700
may have been due to her infatuation

998
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:42,420
with Marvin's son, Jermaine Glass,

999
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:47,420
the man who disappeared when he used the odd-looking gun.

1000
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:50,820
After a quick confession from Keith

1001
00:48:50,820 --> 00:48:54,340
detailing the murder of his own brother by proxy

1002
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:58,120
as well as the firsthand murder of Bruce Robin's mother,

1003
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:00,140
the former contention police officers

1004
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:03,660
traveled to Robin's home address downtown in the city,

1005
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:08,660
hoping to find personal files and or Bruce Robin himself.

1006
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:10,900
However, when they arrived,

1007
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:12,980
they found police tape across the door

1008
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:14,820
of Robin's brownstone.

1009
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:16,340
The residence was wrecked

1010
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:19,220
and human excrement was strewn throughout.

1011
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:21,940
The stench was overwhelming.

1012
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:23,780
Spray paint covered the walls.

1013
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:28,020
It repeated the same number pattern over and over.

1014
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:33,020
8118189520131181119.

1015
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:36,780
John checked upstairs.

1016
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:41,780
His hair stood on end with the feeling of a heavy presence.

1017
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:44,820
In a room deemed to be a former office,

1018
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:48,740
the same set of numbers was carved into the walls

1019
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:53,740
again and again and again on every surface in the room.

1020
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:55,380
Clark investigated what he thought

1021
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:58,260
might once have been the master bedroom

1022
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:01,140
and found various sleeping pallets.

1023
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:03,660
It was clear as many as 20 people

1024
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:06,460
had been sleeping in this room at one time.

1025
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:08,820
John called the city PD

1026
00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:12,860
under the cover of having tracked a drifter to this home.

1027
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:16,340
He requested any information they'd uncovered at the scene.

1028
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:17,860
The city officer shared

1029
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:20,820
that Bruce Robin went missing two days ago.

1030
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:24,700
His neighbors spoke about how crazy Bruce had been recently.

1031
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:27,340
He'd had all kinds of people coming in and out

1032
00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:29,300
at all times of the day and night.

1033
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:32,340
The steep decline of Bruce Robin

1034
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:35,580
had been a rapid transformation.

1035
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:36,980
On their way out to the car,

1036
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:39,660
they noted again the sickly green hue

1037
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:41,900
of the city around them.

1038
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:45,220
The putrid smell, the oppressive grays,

1039
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:49,380
the bloated and lifeless faces of the people on the streets.

1040
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:51,380
And in contrast to all this,

1041
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:54,980
the beautiful blooming flowers on every corner

1042
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:57,580
and from every crack in the sidewalk.

1043
00:50:57,580 --> 00:51:02,220
John asked a passerby why he was so pallid and corpse-like.

1044
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:04,140
The man explained that work at Bar Corp

1045
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:05,580
had been hard as of late,

1046
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:09,260
though they'd just been given some days off.

1047
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:11,620
He felt the color was actually probably better now

1048
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:13,060
than it had been recently.

1049
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:16,860
Bar Corp was surprisingly paying all employees

1050
00:51:16,860 --> 00:51:19,420
time and a half to take two weeks off.

1051
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:21,420
John asked why a big corporation like that

1052
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:24,060
would pay its staff to take time off.

1053
00:51:24,060 --> 00:51:24,980
The man wasn't sure,

1054
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:28,420
but it might have to do with the new CEO.

1055
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:32,860
Bruce Robin announced he would renovate every building

1056
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:36,020
and provide everyone a livable wage,

1057
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:39,060
benefits and better working hours.

1058
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:41,500
Clark asked what exactly Bar Corp does.

1059
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:42,940
Do they sell something?

1060
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:46,260
The man asked Clark to pull anything out of his pockets.

1061
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:48,020
Clark produced a pin

1062
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:49,700
and the man said Bar Corp made it.

1063
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:54,100
Sure enough, the pin read Bar Corp there along the side.

1064
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:55,660
The party hatched a plan.

1065
00:51:55,660 --> 00:51:58,180
Keith would call Bruce Robin directly

1066
00:51:58,180 --> 00:52:00,100
under the guise of commiseration

1067
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:02,740
over the death of Ferguson Beans.

1068
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:04,900
But a woman named Winifred Worth

1069
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:07,180
answered for Bruce Robin's office.

1070
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:09,540
Keith explained Ferguson Beans was his brother

1071
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:12,340
to which Winifred expressed condolences.

1072
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:14,420
Keith requested to speak to Bruce

1073
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:16,500
to ask him some questions.

1074
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:19,620
Winifred promised she would pass along the questions

1075
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:21,500
to Bruce for him.

1076
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:22,420
Keith pressed her.

1077
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:23,980
He'd hoped to have a conversation

1078
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:26,100
with his late brother's business partner.

1079
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:27,340
She insisted.

1080
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:29,780
While Bruce was currently in the office,

1081
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:32,460
he was currently unavailable.

1082
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:34,180
Keith found out Bruce's office

1083
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:36,860
was on the 17th floor and hung up.

1084
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:39,380
He then called the number for Ferguson's office,

1085
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:42,620
but he was greeted again by Winifred.

1086
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:46,460
Keith tried to disguise his identity as Ferguson,

1087
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:49,380
but Keith, caught in the act, just hung up.

1088
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:52,540
The group decided since they knew where Bruce Robin was,

1089
00:52:52,540 --> 00:52:54,540
they would head that way and barge in

1090
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:57,380
as officers of the law to question him.

1091
00:52:58,300 --> 00:52:59,500
On the way to Bar Corp,

1092
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:04,060
the fellas noticed both flowers and sickness everywhere.

1093
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:07,020
After a diversion to acquire blue windbreakers,

1094
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:09,100
coveralls, and fancy hats,

1095
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:12,020
they pulled up to the 17-story building

1096
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:14,380
and walked through the revolving doors

1097
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:18,300
into a massive foyer with marble columns.

1098
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:20,220
A security guard and a receptionist

1099
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:23,100
stood at a large marble desk,

1100
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:26,060
behind which hung a giant mural

1101
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:29,060
of Washington crossing the Delaware,

1102
00:53:29,060 --> 00:53:33,580
but all the guns were replaced by flowers.

1103
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:38,140
The building directory showed only 12 of the 17 floors.

1104
00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:40,220
John fast-talked the security guard

1105
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:42,900
and the group found their way into the only elevator

1106
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:46,860
that actually went all the way to the 17th floor.

1107
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:48,940
On 17, they were met straight away

1108
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:52,980
by a small older woman with a shock of white hair.

1109
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:56,460
Winifred Worth wore a white satin blouse

1110
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:59,660
with black vertical stripes on the left-hand side,

1111
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:02,420
high-waisted pants with horizontal stripes

1112
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:04,180
on the right-hand side,

1113
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:07,580
white platform shoes with studded soles,

1114
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:12,300
and interconnected silver rings across her right hand.

1115
00:54:12,340 --> 00:54:15,020
She knew they were the disgraced police officers

1116
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:18,900
from contention and she demanded to know their business.

1117
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:20,620
John attempted to persuade her

1118
00:54:20,620 --> 00:54:23,260
to let them into Bruce Robin's office.

1119
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:24,900
She was not convinced.

1120
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:28,460
John's solution was to push this 71-year-old lady

1121
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:31,980
to the ground and holler for the others to run past.

1122
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:33,940
John called an ambulance for her

1123
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:37,300
and gave Keith's name as the caller.

1124
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:40,460
Keith picked the lock to get into Bruce's office,

1125
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:43,500
which was in a state of disarray.

1126
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:46,100
A large bookcase had been ransacked.

1127
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:48,900
A conference table was absolutely covered

1128
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:51,380
in binders, files, and papers.

1129
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:54,300
Behind an equally cluttered desk,

1130
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:57,420
a panicked Bruce Robin paced back and forth

1131
00:54:57,420 --> 00:55:00,140
and muttered numbers to himself.

1132
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:03,260
He wore a disheveled but well-tailored suit

1133
00:55:03,260 --> 00:55:05,820
and his hair was a disaster.

1134
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:07,020
Bruce greeted them

1135
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:09,860
and the officers asked him about the numbers.

1136
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:11,860
He denied he was even saying numbers

1137
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:14,380
and became aggravated when pushed.

1138
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:16,780
They asked if he knew who Keith was.

1139
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:18,100
While Bruce considered this,

1140
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:20,460
they noticed his bleeding knuckles

1141
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:23,700
and the silver ring with a flat blank top

1142
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:25,220
on his middle finger,

1143
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:28,900
exactly like the one they found at Jim Cook's house.

1144
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:32,060
Keith revealed the ring he had tied around his neck

1145
00:55:32,060 --> 00:55:35,860
with a shoestring and Bruce's eyes went wide

1146
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:38,540
with fear and excitement.

1147
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:41,380
He asked if they were with Myriad.

1148
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:45,100
Keith said yes and put the ring on.

1149
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:48,860
Bruce stared off above their heads

1150
00:55:48,860 --> 00:55:52,140
through a curtain of unwashed hair

1151
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:54,220
and began chanting,

1152
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:56,820
Tawil Alakol.

1153
00:55:56,820 --> 00:56:00,100
Clark leapt across the desk, tackle punched him,

1154
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:02,660
and knocked a hidden pistol out of his hand,

1155
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:04,820
but Bruce kept chanting.

1156
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:07,500
Keith tried to stomp on his arm to take the ring,

1157
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:10,940
but Robin used the momentum to pull Keith to the ground.

1158
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:13,740
John tried and failed to gag the chanting man

1159
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:15,940
with his own tie.

1160
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:17,540
Bruce threw Clark off of him

1161
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:20,620
and reached the fallen gun chanting the whole time.

1162
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:24,180
Keith instinctively shot the once again armed CEO

1163
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:27,820
to protect Clark, but it only wounded the businessman.

1164
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:30,140
John demanded Bruce stop chanting

1165
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:32,780
and went to check on Winifred.

1166
00:56:32,780 --> 00:56:35,740
However, Bruce Robin completed the chant

1167
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:39,860
and promptly shot himself in the head.

1168
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:43,340
Keith took the ring off Bruce's limp finger.

1169
00:56:43,340 --> 00:56:44,380
When he stood back up,

1170
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:49,380
he noticed John was writing numbers on the desk in blood.

1171
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:52,140
Clark stopped him, but John strangely wasn't aware

1172
00:56:52,140 --> 00:56:54,220
he'd been writing any numbers.

1173
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:57,700
Suddenly, the doors to the office burst open

1174
00:56:57,700 --> 00:57:00,180
and the trio realized they no longer stood

1175
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:03,500
in the places they'd had just been standing.

1176
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:06,020
They were stark naked and drenched

1177
00:57:06,020 --> 00:57:08,300
in Bruce Robin's blood.

1178
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:13,300
The numbers 218213518152914 were scrawled

1179
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:20,140
in dark red fluid on every surface of the office

1180
00:57:20,580 --> 00:57:25,580
and the gang had no recollection of their actions.

1181
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:29,660
When the doors to the office busted open,

1182
00:57:29,660 --> 00:57:31,860
three police officers barged in

1183
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:34,540
as John, Clark, and Keith became aware

1184
00:57:34,540 --> 00:57:37,860
of their abruptly changed surroundings.

1185
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:40,180
Clark recognized the officer at the back,

1186
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:45,180
an attractive older man with gray hair as Leon Simpson.

1187
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:48,260
Leon dropped two duffel bags on the ground

1188
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:52,580
and expeditiously executed the other two officers

1189
00:57:52,580 --> 00:57:53,580
from behind.

1190
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:56,700
He then marched back out into the hallway

1191
00:57:56,700 --> 00:58:00,900
and fired a single additional shot.

1192
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:03,060
Clark told the other two this newcomer

1193
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:06,100
was from the circle of knowledge.

1194
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:08,980
Leon came back, donned headphones and gloves,

1195
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:13,940
turned up some outlaw country and began to clean the scene.

1196
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:15,460
Inside one of the duffel bags,

1197
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:17,500
Clark found cleaning supplies

1198
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:20,900
and three clean city PD uniforms.

1199
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:24,620
Clark, John, and Keith cleaned themselves and suited up.

1200
00:58:24,620 --> 00:58:27,500
Leon pulled papers from Bruce's desk

1201
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:31,860
and stamped them with a copy of Bruce's signature.

1202
00:58:31,860 --> 00:58:35,460
These papers signed Bruce's share of bar corp

1203
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:39,180
over to the mill on the other side of the city.

1204
00:58:39,180 --> 00:58:42,380
Among Bruce's things, John found a note.

1205
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:46,820
It read, she broke me open and all new things

1206
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:50,740
have the power to escort change in the future of good

1207
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:54,020
in order to break the cycle and find fulfillment

1208
00:58:54,020 --> 00:58:56,060
in an unquestioning goodness

1209
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:58,140
that breaks the relentless tether

1210
00:58:58,140 --> 00:59:02,500
holding this lie of a world withstanding itself.

1211
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:04,540
I can smell my past.

1212
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:06,420
I can hear my future.

1213
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:07,980
I am joy.

1214
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:09,780
I am destruction.

1215
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:11,540
I am pure.

1216
00:59:11,540 --> 00:59:14,300
Death to Myriad.

1217
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:16,300
811-818-9520-131181119.

1218
00:59:22,020 --> 00:59:24,380
They recognized the number from Bruce's house

1219
00:59:24,380 --> 00:59:26,980
and finally broke the cipher.

1220
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:30,460
They found the numbers spelled Harriet Marks,

1221
00:59:30,460 --> 00:59:33,340
a name they hadn't come across.

1222
00:59:33,340 --> 00:59:36,740
Clark received a text on the mysterious burner phone

1223
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:40,220
that read, the book your parents died for

1224
00:59:40,220 --> 00:59:44,980
is still hidden in an undisclosed location.

1225
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:47,540
He texted back, what book?

1226
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:48,620
Where?

1227
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:51,060
A quick search for Harriet Marks revealed

1228
00:59:51,060 --> 00:59:53,500
she was a pro-union activist

1229
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:56,380
studying at City State University

1230
00:59:56,380 --> 00:59:58,500
who committed suicide in her dorm room

1231
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:01,980
just four days before on December 2nd.

1232
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:04,340
Leon said they would go investigate her

1233
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:05,980
after they cleaned up.

1234
01:00:05,980 --> 01:00:09,740
The group heard sirens and made a run for Leon's car.

1235
01:00:09,740 --> 01:00:13,380
After a destructive chase and a lethal getaway,

1236
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:16,700
Keith noticed Clark and John zoning out

1237
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:19,140
muttering the number sequence.

1238
01:00:19,140 --> 01:00:21,100
Keith described to Leon what happened

1239
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:22,380
in Bruce Robin's office

1240
01:00:22,380 --> 01:00:24,980
and what they'd worked out about the cipher.

1241
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:28,220
Leon showed Keith a picture of the inside

1242
01:00:28,220 --> 01:00:30,420
of Harriet Marks's dorm room.

1243
01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:34,540
Spray painted all over the walls was a third sequence.

1244
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:39,540
1522518195518, the code for overseer.

1245
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:44,820
Leon evangelized.

1246
01:00:44,820 --> 01:00:47,500
Clark is more than a man.

1247
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:49,020
He's a God.

1248
01:00:49,860 --> 01:00:51,740
He's the savior.

1249
01:00:51,740 --> 01:00:55,740
A prophecy maintains Clark will go back in time

1250
01:00:55,740 --> 01:00:59,180
and found the circle of knowledge.

1251
01:00:59,180 --> 01:01:02,860
John and Clark came to in a parking lot on CSU campus

1252
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:05,700
with Leon and Keith staring at them.

1253
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:08,500
Keith informed them they had just been chanting

1254
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:10,300
Bruce Robin's numbers.

1255
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:13,620
Then he handed them the folder Leon had given him.

1256
01:01:13,620 --> 01:01:17,060
Inside were pictures of a crime scene in a dorm room.

1257
01:01:17,060 --> 01:01:20,180
Numbers were spray painted on every surface.

1258
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:23,860
In the cipher, it read overseer.

1259
01:01:23,860 --> 01:01:26,660
Clark bluntly asked Leon if he believed

1260
01:01:26,660 --> 01:01:29,060
Clark was the overseer and was met

1261
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:31,380
with an equally blunt yes.

1262
01:01:31,380 --> 01:01:32,900
Leon went on.

1263
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:36,620
He believed Clark would eventually go back in time

1264
01:01:36,620 --> 01:01:39,500
and found the circle of knowledge.

1265
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:41,820
The contention officers informed Leon

1266
01:01:41,820 --> 01:01:45,260
that an old Clark had been poking and prodding

1267
01:01:45,260 --> 01:01:46,820
at their lives recently.

1268
01:01:46,820 --> 01:01:51,060
Leon seemed curious and asked them to explain further.

1269
01:01:51,060 --> 01:01:54,260
They recalled the time old Clark warned Drew

1270
01:01:54,260 --> 01:01:55,700
something terrible would happen

1271
01:01:55,700 --> 01:01:57,980
before the chief's house exploded

1272
01:01:57,980 --> 01:02:00,620
and how old Clark had branded names

1273
01:02:00,620 --> 01:02:03,460
into their skin with magic.

1274
01:02:03,460 --> 01:02:05,660
Leon proposed the group split up.

1275
01:02:05,660 --> 01:02:07,820
John and Keith could head to the dorm room.

1276
01:02:07,820 --> 01:02:10,860
He and Clark would go to the administration building.

1277
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:14,340
Leon explained while they're not sure what it is,

1278
01:02:14,380 --> 01:02:17,780
it seemed to transfer from person to person.

1279
01:02:17,780 --> 01:02:20,740
Bruce Robin got it from Harriet Marks

1280
01:02:20,740 --> 01:02:24,300
and Harriet Marks got it from the overseer

1281
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:26,460
based on the numbers in her dorm room.

1282
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:29,500
They needed to know why Clark had done this.

1283
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:31,300
Clark reminded them it's not him

1284
01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:32,660
they're talking about exactly,

1285
01:02:32,660 --> 01:02:35,140
so maybe they could call old Clark Clarkold

1286
01:02:35,140 --> 01:02:36,980
to avoid confusion.

1287
01:02:36,980 --> 01:02:40,100
With that, the groups split off.

1288
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:43,620
Leon began to drive away with Clark in the back seat

1289
01:02:43,660 --> 01:02:46,220
and Clark noticed Leon reached for a gun

1290
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:47,900
that looked like the tranquilizer gun

1291
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:50,980
he'd given Clark to coerce agent Trent Chad.

1292
01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:53,940
Before Leon could fire, Clark kicked the back of his seat

1293
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:57,260
and a tranq dart stuck in the ceiling of the car.

1294
01:02:57,260 --> 01:02:58,600
After a short struggle,

1295
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:01,260
Clark wrestled the gun away from Leon.

1296
01:03:01,260 --> 01:03:06,100
He held the gun to the back of Leon's head with a strong,

1297
01:03:06,100 --> 01:03:08,620
what the fuck?

1298
01:03:08,620 --> 01:03:11,580
Leon explained he had hoped to knock Clark out.

1299
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:13,480
He was terrified something would happen to Clark

1300
01:03:14,300 --> 01:03:15,140
like a stray bullet.

1301
01:03:15,140 --> 01:03:19,480
If Clark died, that could mean the world ends.

1302
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:22,960
Leon felt he needed to protect Clark at all costs,

1303
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:26,520
but Clark argued if he really was the overseer

1304
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:29,600
and he did go back to found the circle of knowledge,

1305
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:31,560
then this must all work out.

1306
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:34,200
In fact, he might be bulletproof now.

1307
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:36,640
In a pretty threatening tone,

1308
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:40,080
Clark reminded Leon he might be the one needing protection

1309
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:43,240
as he didn't recall an old Leon

1310
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:46,600
running around as Clark Old's right-hand man.

1311
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:48,740
Leon replied with a sigh.

1312
01:03:48,740 --> 01:03:50,460
He said it was time.

1313
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:53,900
They really needed to go to calm, comfy campground,

1314
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:56,720
but Leon had been coerced.

1315
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:59,860
First, they could put Clark's invincibility theory

1316
01:03:59,860 --> 01:04:03,600
to the test and finish out the investigation at CSU.

1317
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:06,460
So Leon Simpson swung the car back around

1318
01:04:06,460 --> 01:04:08,580
and headed to the administration building

1319
01:04:08,580 --> 01:04:10,500
they'd first set out for

1320
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:13,860
before the failed kidnapping attempt.

1321
01:04:13,860 --> 01:04:16,620
John and Keith walked through the holiday decoration

1322
01:04:16,620 --> 01:04:21,620
riddled CSU campus to gifts house, Harriet Marks dormitory.

1323
01:04:22,140 --> 01:04:24,860
The lobby was dark and vacant.

1324
01:04:24,860 --> 01:04:27,380
John hopped on the computer behind the front desk

1325
01:04:27,380 --> 01:04:30,320
and the desktop background was a promotional flyer

1326
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:33,940
for the Jingle Ball scheduled for that evening,

1327
01:04:33,940 --> 01:04:36,500
December 6th at CSU.

1328
01:04:36,540 --> 01:04:39,500
The poster read, follow the scavenger hunt

1329
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:42,980
to make your way to the Jingle Ball.

1330
01:04:42,980 --> 01:04:45,300
On the computer, John found the directory

1331
01:04:45,300 --> 01:04:49,300
and discovered Harriet Marks and her roommate, Amelia Locke

1332
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:53,660
lived in 328 across the hall from a show dorm

1333
01:04:53,660 --> 01:04:56,600
for tours to prospective students.

1334
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:58,340
They called the elevator and the light

1335
01:04:58,340 --> 01:05:01,060
that emanated from the open doors

1336
01:05:01,060 --> 01:05:04,140
revealed countless unique number sequences

1337
01:05:04,140 --> 01:05:08,300
scribbled all over the walls and floor of this building

1338
01:05:08,300 --> 01:05:13,300
in materials ranging from spray paint to bodily fluids.

1339
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:18,140
And inside the elevator, the limp corpse of a student

1340
01:05:18,140 --> 01:05:20,380
was slumped over itself.

1341
01:05:20,380 --> 01:05:25,020
Her face was amorphous, smashed repeatedly

1342
01:05:25,020 --> 01:05:27,800
until she was unrecognizable.

1343
01:05:29,100 --> 01:05:30,780
Back in the administration building

1344
01:05:30,780 --> 01:05:33,500
the campus seemed absolutely empty.

1345
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:35,940
It looked like Christmas itself had thrown up

1346
01:05:35,940 --> 01:05:39,460
the decorations that adorned everything in sight.

1347
01:05:39,460 --> 01:05:41,980
The lights of the administration building were off

1348
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:45,380
but down the hall stood two figures.

1349
01:05:45,380 --> 01:05:49,140
One mumbled a sequence of letters and numbers interrupted

1350
01:05:49,140 --> 01:05:53,780
by desperate appeals requesting physical violence.

1351
01:05:53,780 --> 01:05:57,060
In their city PD uniforms, the pair approached

1352
01:05:57,060 --> 01:06:00,840
under the guise of officers looking for the records office.

1353
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:05,320
In the elevator, John Lee Pettymore began to mumble

1354
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:07,560
and pulled a Sharpie from his pocket.

1355
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:09,720
He put the marker to the elevator wall

1356
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:13,440
and wrote the familiar cipher of Bruce Robin.

1357
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:17,000
The third floor was similarly dark and silent

1358
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:20,280
and the doors to both 328 gifts house

1359
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:23,840
and the show dorm room across the hall were open.

1360
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:26,660
The show dorm room was covered in numbers

1361
01:06:26,660 --> 01:06:29,360
like every other surface in this building.

1362
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:32,360
And there was an out of place Casio keyboard

1363
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:34,900
in the middle of the room with a sheet of music

1364
01:06:34,900 --> 01:06:35,940
on the stand.

1365
01:06:35,940 --> 01:06:38,040
However, instead of notes on the staff

1366
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:41,240
the sheet music is made of little cartoon pictures,

1367
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:46,000
seven eggs, a golf ball, a cat, a demon and another egg.

1368
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,960
Keith pushed on a few of the keys

1369
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:49,800
and the electronic piano was set

1370
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:52,520
to make the sound of jingle bells.

1371
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:55,160
Keith put the silly sheet music in his pocket

1372
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:58,320
and continued investigating the display dorm.

1373
01:06:58,320 --> 01:07:02,520
A window looked out on the overly festive campus.

1374
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:07,080
In the middle of the quad was a large old bell tower.

1375
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:10,760
Keith ignored that and found a flyer for the jingle ball

1376
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:13,320
and written on the back was a math equation.

1377
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:17,040
The solution to this problem was 330,

1378
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:19,040
the number of the room in which he stood.

1379
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:21,380
Keith ignored that and headed across the hall

1380
01:07:21,380 --> 01:07:25,040
to Harriet Marks's room with the mumbling John in tow.

1381
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:28,520
In 328 Gift's house, Keith found trophies

1382
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:33,240
for riddle solving competitions on the desk of Amelia Locke,

1383
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:37,320
a desk which clearly lacked a laptop.

1384
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:40,440
The charging cord and various USB accoutrement

1385
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:45,440
wreathed a rectangular negative space on its surface.

1386
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:49,640
On scrap paper, Keith found a handwritten note from Amelia

1387
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:53,420
that outlined her views on the suicide of her roommate.

1388
01:07:53,420 --> 01:07:56,860
She clearly did not believe Harriet was suicidal

1389
01:07:56,860 --> 01:07:59,180
and she wrote she had a plan to figure out

1390
01:07:59,180 --> 01:08:00,820
what actually happened.

1391
01:08:00,820 --> 01:08:02,580
Keith went through Harriet's things

1392
01:08:02,580 --> 01:08:05,700
and found a tucked away sticky note

1393
01:08:05,700 --> 01:08:08,440
with a two point to do list.

1394
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:13,440
The first, research most unethical corporation in the city.

1395
01:08:14,580 --> 01:08:18,580
The second, who is the overseer?

1396
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:21,620
Clark and Leon approached the two figures

1397
01:08:21,620 --> 01:08:23,860
in the hall outside the admin office.

1398
01:08:23,860 --> 01:08:25,780
A short and slight freshman jumped up

1399
01:08:25,780 --> 01:08:28,940
and poked a tall, well-dressed student with perfect hair.

1400
01:08:28,940 --> 01:08:31,420
The little one begged to be hit

1401
01:08:31,420 --> 01:08:33,980
and the tall one calmly declined.

1402
01:08:33,980 --> 01:08:36,620
Defeated, the short dude ran to a wall,

1403
01:08:36,620 --> 01:08:39,180
slammed his head against it and yelled

1404
01:08:39,180 --> 01:08:42,860
that doing it himself just wasn't the same.

1405
01:08:42,860 --> 01:08:44,880
Clark and Leon approached and the tall student

1406
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:47,980
calmly asked for a moment as he stared up

1407
01:08:47,980 --> 01:08:51,580
at a banner above the office window that read,

1408
01:08:52,420 --> 01:08:54,380
at the end of the 10th day,

1409
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:58,740
my true love had given me blank gifts.

1410
01:08:58,740 --> 01:09:00,600
Leon ignored the scene entirely

1411
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:03,260
and entered the unlocked administration office.

1412
01:09:03,260 --> 01:09:07,820
The crazed, small student requested pain from Clark

1413
01:09:07,820 --> 01:09:10,420
who asked why the kid would wanna be hit so badly.

1414
01:09:10,420 --> 01:09:12,620
The student said he would love it

1415
01:09:12,620 --> 01:09:16,420
and then suddenly started to spout some numbers off.

1416
01:09:16,420 --> 01:09:18,120
Clark asked about the numbers.

1417
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:22,000
The student didn't recall saying any numbers.

1418
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:25,680
Clark hit him and he crumpled the floor in delight

1419
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:29,120
before scampering off into the darkness.

1420
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:31,320
Clark asked if the tall, calm student

1421
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:33,920
was thinking of numbers at all.

1422
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:34,840
He said no.

1423
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:38,120
Leon reiterated the question and flipped on the lights

1424
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:40,440
which revealed countless numbers

1425
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:43,220
covering the walls of the hall.

1426
01:09:43,220 --> 01:09:45,800
The tall student affirmed he didn't even know

1427
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:47,240
the numbers were there

1428
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:51,860
and he introduced himself as Donovan West Haven.

1429
01:09:51,860 --> 01:09:53,760
Donovan West something explained

1430
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:56,680
he was just trying to work out the riddle on the banner.

1431
01:09:56,680 --> 01:09:59,280
After some debate about how to solve

1432
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:00,920
the gift counting riddle,

1433
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:05,140
Clark and Leon agreed to investigate the office instead.

1434
01:10:05,140 --> 01:10:08,180
The single computer was password protected.

1435
01:10:08,180 --> 01:10:11,880
On the desk sat pictures of a woman in her early 20s

1436
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:14,440
holding trophies for scavenger hunts.

1437
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:17,760
The name on the trophies, Amelia Locke.

1438
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:20,560
There was also a photo of a group of students

1439
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:25,480
holding up a banner that said Best R.A. Gifts House.

1440
01:10:25,480 --> 01:10:27,600
Clark suggested their best bet

1441
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:29,820
would be to head to Locke's dorm.

1442
01:10:29,820 --> 01:10:31,540
Donovan asked if he could tag along.

1443
01:10:31,540 --> 01:10:35,560
He would, after all, need help solving the other riddles.

1444
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:36,720
On the way to Gifts House,

1445
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:39,840
they could hear strange whoops and hollers

1446
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:43,400
from unseen people all over campus.

1447
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:46,280
Inside Gifts House, the lights were out.

1448
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:48,520
Clark motioned for Leon to investigate

1449
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:50,000
the receptionist's computer

1450
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:54,920
while Clark hollered a hello down the empty hall.

1451
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:57,400
Donovan wandered into a smaller hallway

1452
01:10:57,400 --> 01:10:59,560
and lights suddenly came on.

1453
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:02,880
Numbers covered everything and from behind a door

1454
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:06,880
at the end of this hall came a desperate no, no, no,

1455
01:11:08,460 --> 01:11:11,800
followed by a sequence of numbers.

1456
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:14,520
The door cracked slightly

1457
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:18,480
and a voice very creepily reached out.

1458
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:22,840
Please turn out the lights.

1459
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:26,920
Donovan obliged and slowly backed out of the hallway

1460
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:31,920
and a genuine thank you oozed from the room.

1461
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:36,760
Clark warned Donovan that if he heard numbers like that,

1462
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:39,360
he might want to close his ears.

1463
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:41,360
But Clark still wasn't sure how exactly

1464
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:43,800
this thing spread so he went to ask Leon,

1465
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:46,220
who'd already put on noise canceling headphones.

1466
01:11:46,220 --> 01:11:47,880
Clark tapped him on the shoulder

1467
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:49,840
and Leon tapped the computer screen

1468
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:52,760
that showed the room number of Amelia Locke

1469
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:56,380
and her roommate, Harriet Marks.

1470
01:11:56,380 --> 01:11:58,800
When asked, Donovan said people

1471
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:01,880
had been shouting numbers at him constantly.

1472
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:04,220
Clark wondered if he'd had any blackouts

1473
01:12:04,220 --> 01:12:06,840
or gabs in his memory but Donovan replied no,

1474
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:08,800
he felt pretty good actually.

1475
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:11,120
Clark pondered aloud whether Donovan

1476
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:14,120
might be the thing they were looking for.

1477
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:17,760
It seemed like he could be immune.

1478
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:20,960
The trio headed up to Amelia and Harriet's room

1479
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:22,800
on the third floor.

1480
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:27,200
Clark Bishop, Leon Simpson and Donovan Westerfuck

1481
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:29,240
approached 328 Giff's house

1482
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:31,260
and found John and Keith already there.

1483
01:12:31,260 --> 01:12:33,320
John snapped out of a haze as they entered

1484
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:37,880
and mumbled something about being able to do anything.

1485
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:40,800
Keith explained they'd come across a dead body

1486
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:42,740
in the elevator when John went blank

1487
01:12:42,740 --> 01:12:45,400
and started writing the Bruce Robin numbers.

1488
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:47,780
Clark asked John if he remembered writing the numbers

1489
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:52,780
and John asked Clark if he had ever felt quote, immense.

1490
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:55,440
Clark introduced Donovan to John and Keith

1491
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:58,060
and revealed there was a chance Donovan was the key

1492
01:12:58,060 --> 01:13:01,800
to all this, that he might be immune to the numbers.

1493
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:03,960
John walked directly into a wall

1494
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:08,400
and confessed he was still working out the kinks.

1495
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:10,980
The reconvened team put their heads together

1496
01:13:10,980 --> 01:13:15,400
on the riddle from the banner and came up with 330.

1497
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:17,960
The room across the hall where Keith already found

1498
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:20,840
a piece of paper that depicted illustrations

1499
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:24,360
of seven eggs, a golf ball, a cat, a demon

1500
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:27,680
and another egg set upon a music staff

1501
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:29,800
atop a Casio keyboard.

1502
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:34,000
Keith then presented the to-do list from Harriet's desk.

1503
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:38,160
One, research the most unethical corporation in the city.

1504
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:41,040
Two, who is the overseer?

1505
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:43,760
He also had a note from Amelia's desk

1506
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:45,640
where she wrote she didn't believe Harriet

1507
01:13:45,640 --> 01:13:48,400
would commit suicide and she was going to get

1508
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:50,080
to the bottom of it.

1509
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:53,160
They hit the first letters of each cartoon

1510
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:55,900
as notes on the Casio keyboard.

1511
01:13:55,900 --> 01:13:58,120
It's the melody of Jingle Bells

1512
01:13:58,120 --> 01:14:01,520
and out the window of 330 Gift's house

1513
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:04,320
they watched the bell tower in the center

1514
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:09,320
of the CSU campus light up in all its holiday glory.

1515
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:14,160
This not so subtle clue led the party

1516
01:14:14,160 --> 01:14:16,500
to a pleasant stroll through campus,

1517
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:21,040
admiring the crisp white snow, festive decorations

1518
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:23,560
and constant screaming on their way

1519
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:26,160
to the lit old bell tower.

1520
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:29,760
They climbed the spiral staircase behind Keith

1521
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:32,000
who warned them to close their eyes

1522
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:36,260
to not look at the corpse of an almost retired security guard

1523
01:14:36,260 --> 01:14:37,900
some of them listened.

1524
01:14:37,900 --> 01:14:40,540
The interior of the bell tower and the corpse

1525
01:14:40,540 --> 01:14:42,900
were also covered in numbers.

1526
01:14:42,900 --> 01:14:45,800
At the top of the tower they met an attractive young woman

1527
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:49,260
named ShamWow Chameleon who recited the numbers

1528
01:14:49,260 --> 01:14:52,840
for Harriet Marks as she desperately tried

1529
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:55,480
to get onto the roof of the tower.

1530
01:14:55,480 --> 01:14:59,400
Keith saw a sleigh lit up across the way

1531
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:01,520
which indicated the Jingle Ball

1532
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:04,800
was in the Accord Student Center.

1533
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:06,840
John accidentally let slip to Leon

1534
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:11,320
that at least some of them might possibly also be ball.

1535
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:14,440
Keith and John helped ShamWow out of the bell tower

1536
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:18,280
and onto the roof and the group headed off across campus

1537
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:20,920
to go to the Jingle Ball.

1538
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:24,800
On the journey a path of colorful string lights

1539
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:29,240
led to a sitting area which contained a ripe corpse

1540
01:15:29,240 --> 01:15:33,800
and a frantic dancer who pointed to the student union.

1541
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:36,000
They entered the Accord Student Center

1542
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:39,320
on the middle floor of a three story atrium

1543
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:41,880
filled with the pure chaos

1544
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:45,440
of wholly obsessive students and faculty.

1545
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:49,880
On their level a girl shaved a team of live reindeer

1546
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:54,520
with a blunt knife and glued the fur to herself.

1547
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:58,200
On the floor below a pair of muscular young men

1548
01:15:58,200 --> 01:16:01,480
in Santa outfits diligently wrapped a student

1549
01:16:01,480 --> 01:16:05,320
in wrapping paper with duct tape and force.

1550
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:08,200
Above an older woman in a bathrobe

1551
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:12,560
and an aviator hat climbed a garland to the top floor.

1552
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:15,480
A huge disco ball and a Santa hat

1553
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:18,440
hung from the middle of the domed ceiling.

1554
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:21,440
On the lower level a naked man used a mop

1555
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:25,080
and bucket full of paint to write out numbers.

1556
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:29,480
An ice skating rink contained three people dressed as elves.

1557
01:16:29,480 --> 01:16:32,440
They placed carrots in various locations

1558
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:36,760
on a life size snowman model and laughed hysterically.

1559
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:40,600
A young woman in a t-shirt that identified her

1560
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:45,240
as a gifts house RA threw a laptop in the air

1561
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:48,680
over and over again while spinning around.

1562
01:16:48,680 --> 01:16:52,200
A man doing squats on top of Santa's throne

1563
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:54,280
suddenly stopped.

1564
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:57,800
He looked out, wild eyed and screamed,

1565
01:16:57,800 --> 01:17:02,000
Tawil alagool, Tawil alagool.

1566
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,920
John with the power in his mind

1567
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:07,680
commanded the chanting man to stop.

1568
01:17:07,680 --> 01:17:09,680
Unfortunately to no avail.

1569
01:17:09,680 --> 01:17:11,600
Keith shot the guy and he collapsed

1570
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:13,240
into the Santa Claus throne.

1571
01:17:13,240 --> 01:17:16,760
However, he was not dead and continued to chant.

1572
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:19,360
The gunshot grabbed the attention of the assembly

1573
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:23,000
in the atrium and they changed their behaviors.

1574
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:26,840
The woman with the fur sharpened the reindeer's antlers.

1575
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:29,040
The Santa twins wrapped each other

1576
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:30,800
instead of the other students.

1577
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:33,200
The ascending woman climbed faster.

1578
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:35,360
The elves took off their skates

1579
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:37,560
and the girl with the laptop threw it

1580
01:17:37,560 --> 01:17:39,800
even higher than before.

1581
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:42,520
John accidentally shot two reindeer.

1582
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:45,040
Clark ran toward the laptop girl.

1583
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:48,440
Keith shot one of the Santa twins to death.

1584
01:17:48,440 --> 01:17:52,760
Leon gave Donovan a gun and escorted him to a safe spot.

1585
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:56,840
Suddenly, the frenzied throng froze

1586
01:17:56,840 --> 01:17:59,320
and began the chants.

1587
01:17:59,320 --> 01:18:01,960
The man in Santa's chair jumped

1588
01:18:01,960 --> 01:18:06,080
and impaled himself on the post of the throne.

1589
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:10,240
The laptop landed on the side of the spinning woman's head

1590
01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:12,200
and knocked her out cold.

1591
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:13,640
Clark grabbed the laptop

1592
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:17,160
and checked the unconscious RA's vitals.

1593
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:21,040
As the rest of the deranged chanting party

1594
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:25,840
executed their elaborate and festive suicides,

1595
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:30,840
Emilia Locke took her last breath in Clark's arms.

1596
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:34,800
The atrium of the Accord Student Center

1597
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:38,960
was a suddenly still disgusting mess.

1598
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:42,480
The PA crossfaded out of the classic mashup

1599
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:46,040
of Wonderful Christmastime by Sir Paul McCartney

1600
01:18:46,040 --> 01:18:48,520
and Grown Up by Danny Brown,

1601
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:52,400
replaced by a horrifying rendition of Santa Baby

1602
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:54,480
by Tyler the Creator.

1603
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:58,520
John and Clark fell back into their unnatural malaise

1604
01:18:58,520 --> 01:19:01,360
and scrawled the numbers for Bruce Robin

1605
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:04,720
all over whatever mess they sat in.

1606
01:19:04,720 --> 01:19:07,040
Leon Simpson, for the first time,

1607
01:19:07,080 --> 01:19:10,760
fell to the ground to write out a sequence of numbers.

1608
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:12,800
Donovan was still conscious and present,

1609
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:14,800
but absolutely shook.

1610
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:18,240
Keith solved Leon Simpson's new cipher,

1611
01:19:18,240 --> 01:19:20,520
the solve Ben Smith,

1612
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:23,840
who Keith recognized after a quick Google search

1613
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:26,560
happened to be the corpse nearest,

1614
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:30,960
the now dazed member of the circle of knowledge.

1615
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:33,120
Still the only team member up in Adam,

1616
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:35,600
Keith opened Emilia Locke's laptop.

1617
01:19:35,680 --> 01:19:37,120
He found screenshots

1618
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:40,400
from the CSU Biology Department Twitter account.

1619
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:41,920
The first read,

1620
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:44,080
a few of us who are not infected

1621
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:45,760
are quarantined in the lab.

1622
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:47,520
Please call 911.

1623
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:49,760
Our calls are not going through.

1624
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:51,880
The second was in all caps.

1625
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:55,680
Call 911, CSU campus infected with a virus.

1626
01:19:55,680 --> 01:19:57,320
Please help, we are trapped.

1627
01:19:57,320 --> 01:19:59,520
Call 911.

1628
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:02,080
And the final tweet pleaded.

1629
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:04,720
We're still quarantined in the lab.

1630
01:20:04,720 --> 01:20:08,760
If you are the person or entity scrubbing this page,

1631
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:10,480
please have a heart.

1632
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:13,240
We are running low on supplies.

1633
01:20:13,240 --> 01:20:14,920
There were also two videos

1634
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:17,720
and small windows open on the desktop.

1635
01:20:17,720 --> 01:20:21,360
One showed Harriet Marks sitting in her dorm room.

1636
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:24,600
The other was a dark and distorted picture

1637
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:28,480
with only a lit candle in frame.

1638
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:30,920
Clark and John snapped back to reality,

1639
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:32,920
but Leon Simpson began dancing

1640
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:35,200
like his life depended on it.

1641
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:37,000
Keith showed Clark the laptop,

1642
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,800
but Clark was far more interested

1643
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:41,000
in the glow than the content.

1644
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:44,040
Leon's phone went off and he continued to boogie down

1645
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:46,280
with no concern for his surroundings.

1646
01:20:46,280 --> 01:20:47,240
Due to his groove,

1647
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:50,600
the buzzing flip phone popped out of Simpson's trousers.

1648
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:52,400
Clark grabbed it for the glow,

1649
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:54,720
but noticed 25 missed calls

1650
01:20:54,720 --> 01:20:57,240
and an interesting text thread.

1651
01:20:57,240 --> 01:20:59,840
Responding to, how's it going?

1652
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:03,360
Leon sent, the secretary is stubborn,

1653
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:05,760
looking for another option.

1654
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:08,080
That was the last outgoing message,

1655
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:11,560
but there was a barrage of words from the other side.

1656
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:15,840
In short stabs, they wrote, I don't want excuses, pick up.

1657
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:17,280
Okay, I sent them.

1658
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:20,200
T.O. will be ready for extraction.

1659
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:23,440
Don't forget to get the signatures.

1660
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:28,440
E.T.A., question mark, Jesus Christ, what is going on?

1661
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:31,320
Question mark, question mark, question mark,

1662
01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:34,080
before the longer final message.

1663
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:38,240
If he doesn't get here in time, this is all over.

1664
01:21:38,240 --> 01:21:41,800
Everything we've worked for, everything that exists,

1665
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:43,880
just gone, for what?

1666
01:21:43,880 --> 01:21:45,840
Your fucking conscience?

1667
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:49,440
Morality won't save us.

1668
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:52,400
They all assumed it was Maggie on the other end,

1669
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:56,320
so Clark responded, hey, it's Clark.

1670
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:58,720
Donovan led the group to Glass Hall,

1671
01:21:58,720 --> 01:22:00,960
which housed the biology lab.

1672
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:04,600
Clark received a text on his mysterious burner.

1673
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:06,840
He had asked, what book, where?

1674
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:09,800
And this message read, your book.

1675
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:12,280
Calm, comfy campground.

1676
01:22:12,280 --> 01:22:14,960
Leon's phone also received a text.

1677
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:18,000
It said, fuck, what did you do?

1678
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:21,040
From both phones, Clark Bishop sent the question,

1679
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:22,560
who is this?

1680
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:26,680
And on both phones, he got the same response.

1681
01:22:26,680 --> 01:22:28,160
Destiny.

1682
01:22:28,160 --> 01:22:30,440
The walk across campus was soundtracked

1683
01:22:30,440 --> 01:22:33,000
by a cacophony of guttural moans,

1684
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:36,480
which danced on the cold December winds.

1685
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:39,440
In the quad, they saw ShamWow Chameleon

1686
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:43,440
as she steadied herself on the sanctified minion blow up

1687
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:48,240
atop the bell tower and screamed about getting even higher.

1688
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:51,680
In the far distance, the chopping of helicopter blades

1689
01:22:51,680 --> 01:22:55,360
slowly but surely grew louder and louder.

1690
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:58,360
Given the option between a longer lit path

1691
01:22:58,360 --> 01:23:00,360
and a shorter one in darkness,

1692
01:23:00,360 --> 01:23:03,320
Clark persuaded the group to stay in the light.

1693
01:23:03,320 --> 01:23:07,040
Around a well-lit corner, an old man moaned

1694
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:10,560
and took a citrus peeler to his frail fingers.

1695
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:13,760
Keith saw this horror and lost it again.

1696
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:15,360
The group, sans vigna,

1697
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:17,880
deciphered this old man's number sequence

1698
01:23:17,880 --> 01:23:20,720
and learned the name belonged to a coworker

1699
01:23:20,720 --> 01:23:24,840
who hanged himself in front of this bloody mad old-timer.

1700
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:27,960
They continued on to Glass Hall Keith came to

1701
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:32,960
and they found a child meticulously sticking syringes

1702
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:38,560
into a somehow unmoving student's eyeballs.

1703
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:40,080
With that, John and Keith

1704
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:42,440
were lost in their numbers once again.

1705
01:23:42,440 --> 01:23:45,760
Inside Glass Hall, the sounds of a few deranged folk

1706
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:48,200
bounced and echoed through the halls.

1707
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:52,040
A trail of blood slowly dripped down the stairwell

1708
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:55,600
which had a few bloody screwdrivers scattered about.

1709
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:59,680
On their way down the wet, sticky stairs to the biology lab,

1710
01:23:59,680 --> 01:24:01,840
Keith Vigna tripped, fell,

1711
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:04,720
and knocked something loose in his head.

1712
01:24:04,720 --> 01:24:06,440
He popped up ecstatic

1713
01:24:06,440 --> 01:24:09,720
and grabbed what he thought were handfuls of cash

1714
01:24:09,720 --> 01:24:14,320
but were, in reality, handfuls of bloody screwdrivers.

1715
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:16,880
He stuffed them into all of his pockets

1716
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:20,120
and, for good measure, pulled a few out of a woman's corpse

1717
01:24:20,120 --> 01:24:23,880
while he smiled and yelled they were rich.

1718
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:27,800
Keith Vigna then crammed his finger deep into his nose

1719
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:30,960
and sniffed with all of his lungs.

1720
01:24:33,480 --> 01:24:37,960
Eyes wide, he shoved his finger into Clark Bishop's nose

1721
01:24:37,960 --> 01:24:42,960
who did not expect a heaping bump of pure cocaine.

1722
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:45,360
Clark immediately went blank,

1723
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:48,720
but instead of numbers, he chanted,

1724
01:24:48,720 --> 01:24:51,360
Ta will alico.

1725
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:53,640
In the basement of Glass Hall,

1726
01:24:53,640 --> 01:24:57,720
the team stood just outside of the biology lab.

1727
01:24:57,720 --> 01:25:00,440
Keith Vigna collected bloody screwdrivers

1728
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:02,400
he thought were cash.

1729
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:05,320
John Lee Pettymore talked down to everyone

1730
01:25:05,320 --> 01:25:07,280
like a god might.

1731
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:10,360
Donovan Wester-something-or-other panicked.

1732
01:25:10,360 --> 01:25:15,240
Leon Simpson boogied and Clark Bishop chanted.

1733
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:18,840
The lights went out and the red emergency lights activated.

1734
01:25:18,840 --> 01:25:21,600
An ominous glow illuminated the party

1735
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:25,240
as the entrance of Glass Hall burst open.

1736
01:25:25,240 --> 01:25:26,600
Orders were shouted.

1737
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:28,960
Crazed voices were silenced.

1738
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:33,080
Clark grabbed one of Keith's dripping screwdrivers.

1739
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:36,480
A small canister was tossed down the stairs

1740
01:25:36,480 --> 01:25:40,320
and a thick gas came pouring out of it.

1741
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:43,440
Clark sharpened his screwdriver.

1742
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:45,680
Keith and Donovan rushed into the lab.

1743
01:25:45,680 --> 01:25:47,240
Leon danced.

1744
01:25:47,240 --> 01:25:51,200
Down the stairs stormed a squad in tactical gear.

1745
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:54,240
They shouted and tossed more gas canisters.

1746
01:25:54,240 --> 01:25:58,360
Clark jammed the sharpened screwdriver into his eye

1747
01:25:58,360 --> 01:26:02,320
until the handle was flush with his socket.

1748
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:05,240
Blood dripped down his face

1749
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:09,120
and Clark Bishop crumpled to the ground,

1750
01:26:09,160 --> 01:26:11,400
limp and lifeless.

1751
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:17,080
John stared at the scene, began chanting

1752
01:26:17,080 --> 01:26:19,560
and ran into the lab.

1753
01:26:20,640 --> 01:26:23,400
Inside, a man and a woman in lab coats

1754
01:26:23,400 --> 01:26:26,000
sat turned away at a desk.

1755
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:27,840
The woman greeted the group and asked

1756
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:30,360
if they knew how to fix the situation.

1757
01:26:30,360 --> 01:26:32,800
Back in the hallway, Leon started chanting

1758
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:36,600
and fell to the ground, surrounded by the tactical squad.

1759
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:39,240
John aimed his gun at the door

1760
01:26:39,240 --> 01:26:41,760
and waited for the incursion.

1761
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:43,960
Barbara, the woman in the lab coat,

1762
01:26:43,960 --> 01:26:47,160
insisted that she and Phillip were just fine,

1763
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:49,560
much like Donovan Whateverhaven.

1764
01:26:49,560 --> 01:26:54,480
She asked Phillip to explain, but he didn't move.

1765
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:57,640
Donovan, worried he might be the only sane person

1766
01:26:57,640 --> 01:27:00,920
left on Earth, looked to John for help,

1767
01:27:00,920 --> 01:27:04,880
but John was turning his firearm on himself.

1768
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:07,920
So, Jonathan fired at John to try to disable him

1769
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:10,120
from committing suicide, but he missed

1770
01:27:10,120 --> 01:27:14,800
and sent a bullet right into the CSU biology department's

1771
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:18,920
prized anti-virus machine.

1772
01:27:18,920 --> 01:27:21,360
Barbara turned Phillip's chair around

1773
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:23,640
so he could see this madness,

1774
01:27:23,640 --> 01:27:28,280
but Phillip held his own eyeballs in his hands

1775
01:27:28,280 --> 01:27:32,200
and dried blood covered his face below

1776
01:27:32,200 --> 01:27:34,800
his empty eye sockets.

1777
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:37,480
The raid from the tactical squad began.

1778
01:27:37,480 --> 01:27:38,960
Smoke filled the lab.

1779
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:41,800
John looked around the room and smiled.

1780
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:45,440
Finally at peace, John Lee Pettymore the third

1781
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:47,680
shot himself in the head.

1782
01:27:47,680 --> 01:27:51,320
Keith prepared for a showdown and Donovan went to his knees,

1783
01:27:51,320 --> 01:27:53,360
submitted and asked for help.

1784
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:55,480
One of the infiltrating squad members

1785
01:27:55,480 --> 01:27:57,800
placed an oxygen mask on Donovan

1786
01:27:57,800 --> 01:27:59,840
and he immediately fell asleep,

1787
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:03,160
but high on disillusion and cocaine,

1788
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:05,960
Keith Vigna murdered two of the troops

1789
01:28:05,960 --> 01:28:08,080
with bloody screwdrivers

1790
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:11,600
before they eventually ended his life.

1791
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:17,160
Through the haze and red emergency lights,

1792
01:28:17,160 --> 01:28:21,960
we see the two casualties of Keith's screwdrivers,

1793
01:28:21,960 --> 01:28:25,360
lifeless in pools of their own blood.

1794
01:28:25,360 --> 01:28:27,240
The camera leaves the lab,

1795
01:28:27,240 --> 01:28:31,360
passes the elderly pile of a corpse in the hallway,

1796
01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:34,440
moves up the stairs and out of glass hall.

1797
01:28:34,440 --> 01:28:37,600
The CSU campus is humming.

1798
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:39,480
Sirens are constant.

1799
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:43,600
Limp bodies are being transported by teams of two

1800
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:45,480
in full tactical gear

1801
01:28:45,480 --> 01:28:49,720
and dragged into prison transport buses.

1802
01:28:49,720 --> 01:28:54,040
The sky is littered with unmarked black helicopters.

1803
01:28:54,040 --> 01:28:58,320
We see one hovering above the minion atop the bell tower,

1804
01:28:58,320 --> 01:29:03,320
a rope ladder allowing ShamWow Chameleon to get even higher.

1805
01:29:03,360 --> 01:29:05,440
As we leave the CSU campus,

1806
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:08,400
we see a confluence of black SUVs

1807
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:10,800
heading toward one of the taller buildings

1808
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:12,520
of the city skyline,

1809
01:29:12,520 --> 01:29:15,720
a building that is being climbed

1810
01:29:15,720 --> 01:29:20,040
by something massive and spherical.

1811
01:29:20,040 --> 01:29:22,440
We continue past the business district

1812
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:25,320
and swoop down into the back of a van

1813
01:29:25,320 --> 01:29:27,480
heading out toward the pier.

1814
01:29:27,480 --> 01:29:32,480
The broken and upgraded and dead and metal corpses

1815
01:29:32,840 --> 01:29:35,480
of John Lee Pettymore and Keith Vigna

1816
01:29:35,480 --> 01:29:39,040
are jostling around the posterior of this van

1817
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:42,760
that pulls up to a grand old edifice,

1818
01:29:42,760 --> 01:29:45,320
alone on the edge of the water

1819
01:29:45,320 --> 01:29:48,520
with a well-lit sign outside that reads,

1820
01:29:48,520 --> 01:29:50,720
The City Asylum.

1821
01:29:50,720 --> 01:29:53,840
Inside the front doors are two familiar guards,

1822
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:56,440
tall and overweight and all black

1823
01:29:56,440 --> 01:29:59,120
with prominent facial scarring.

1824
01:29:59,120 --> 01:30:01,360
After we move down through the floor,

1825
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:03,760
we are immediately looking through

1826
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:07,400
a long line of the bottoms of feet.

1827
01:30:07,400 --> 01:30:10,320
Body after body has been laid out in a row

1828
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:13,400
covered in sheets, feet sticking out.

1829
01:30:13,400 --> 01:30:16,920
We stop on the final four soles.

1830
01:30:16,920 --> 01:30:18,880
Both right feet are blank.

1831
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:21,480
Both left feet have dead skin

1832
01:30:21,480 --> 01:30:23,960
in the shape of the circle of knowledge,

1833
01:30:23,960 --> 01:30:27,520
but one left foot has the name Maggie

1834
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:30,920
burned on top of the seven circles.

1835
01:30:30,920 --> 01:30:34,040
Our vision moves up through the ceiling

1836
01:30:34,040 --> 01:30:37,360
and into a small dark room.

1837
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:42,160
Donovan Westhaven wakes up to the sounds of beeps

1838
01:30:42,160 --> 01:30:47,160
and bloops of a machine that you feel yourself connected to

1839
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:52,160
and you're laying in a hospital bed

1840
01:30:52,200 --> 01:30:56,000
in a room that is completely dark

1841
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:59,120
except for the lights coming from the machine

1842
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:01,200
on either side of you.

1843
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:04,080
You see that your blood is being drawn

1844
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:06,880
and there is an IV in your other arm

1845
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:09,160
and then a screen turns on,

1846
01:31:09,160 --> 01:31:12,560
a freeze frame of like a webcam video

1847
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:17,560
and it's Harriet Marks and she is mid-chant.

1848
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:22,800
Allacle, towel, allacle, towel, allacle, towel, allacle.

1849
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:27,800
Towel, allacle, towel, allacle, towel, allacle.

1850
01:31:28,920 --> 01:31:33,920
Towel, allacle, towel, allacle, towel, allacle, towel.

1851
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:39,040
And then you see at the bottom of the screen,

1852
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:44,040
the barrel of a gun comes up and she squeezes the trigger

1853
01:31:45,040 --> 01:31:49,000
and then she with a splatter of blood behind her

1854
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,760
falls back and out of frame of the camera

1855
01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:53,960
and you're just looking at her dorm room

1856
01:31:53,960 --> 01:31:56,880
with a paint of blood behind her

1857
01:31:56,880 --> 01:32:00,680
on the wall and on the ceiling and then the video stops.

1858
01:32:01,680 --> 01:32:04,360
And a man comes out of the darkness

1859
01:32:04,360 --> 01:32:06,280
in the back corner of the room

1860
01:32:06,280 --> 01:32:09,680
and you can see that he's lit by your machines

1861
01:32:09,680 --> 01:32:13,160
and he's wearing a black suit with a black tie

1862
01:32:13,480 --> 01:32:14,440
and a white shirt.

1863
01:32:15,560 --> 01:32:19,680
I need you to tell me everything that happened.

1864
01:32:24,160 --> 01:32:25,280
Okay.

1865
01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:30,280
What's up everybody?

1866
01:32:40,760 --> 01:32:42,360
I just wanna drop in here real quick

1867
01:32:42,360 --> 01:32:45,760
to shout out two absolutely indispensable folks

1868
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:49,640
from over on the Discord who have made this tiresome task

1869
01:32:49,640 --> 01:32:52,560
about 10 times less interminable feeling.

1870
01:32:52,560 --> 01:32:54,320
First, I Shot Marvin.

1871
01:32:54,320 --> 01:32:58,400
I Shot Marvin wrote up recaps for six episodes.

1872
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:00,800
They have earned a shirt.

1873
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:02,880
And second, Here Be Tigers.

1874
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:05,080
Here Be Tigers got a name check last time

1875
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:07,680
because they not only wrote four recaps

1876
01:33:07,680 --> 01:33:10,640
but their recaps were super well done.

1877
01:33:10,640 --> 01:33:13,920
Well, they added five more episodes this time around

1878
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:17,480
bringing their total to nine fucking recaps.

1879
01:33:17,480 --> 01:33:20,560
Thank you so, so, so much.

1880
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:23,480
You have so clearly and obviously earned yourself

1881
01:33:23,480 --> 01:33:26,320
an elusive PTBP T-shirt.

1882
01:33:26,320 --> 01:33:28,240
As for the fourth and final part

1883
01:33:28,240 --> 01:33:30,920
of this Here season one recap project,

1884
01:33:30,920 --> 01:33:32,480
I still need your help

1885
01:33:32,480 --> 01:33:36,080
and I'm still willing to send you clothes in return.

1886
01:33:36,080 --> 01:33:38,080
There's a link in the show notes and on Twitter,

1887
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:41,000
fuck Jack Dorsey and Facebook, fuck Mark Zuckerberg

1888
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,160
to a Google doc we can all share.

1889
01:33:43,160 --> 01:33:46,560
If you write up a few succinct but thorough paragraphs

1890
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:48,880
recapping an episode of this show,

1891
01:33:48,880 --> 01:33:52,440
you will be entered to win a PTBP T-shirt.

1892
01:33:52,440 --> 01:33:55,200
If you write up a few succinct but thorough paragraphs

1893
01:33:55,200 --> 01:33:58,120
recapping three or more episodes,

1894
01:33:58,120 --> 01:34:02,920
you will be entered to win one of five PTBP T-shirts.

1895
01:34:02,920 --> 01:34:07,920
And if you really go wolf to the slap, wolf to the slap,

1896
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:11,360
if you write up a few succinct but thorough paragraphs

1897
01:34:11,360 --> 01:34:14,480
recapping five or more episodes,

1898
01:34:14,480 --> 01:34:18,000
I will guarantee you a PTBP T-shirt.

1899
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:19,840
Leave your handle or email address

1900
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:21,600
commented on the episode numbers

1901
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:24,040
so we know who wrote what and how to contact you

1902
01:34:24,040 --> 01:34:26,240
in case we get to ship you a shirt.

1903
01:34:26,240 --> 01:34:29,280
Join us, earn a shirt and help finish

1904
01:34:29,280 --> 01:34:32,320
this last recap episode so we can deliver you

1905
01:34:32,320 --> 01:34:36,200
the final arc of season one of pretending to be people.

1906
01:34:36,200 --> 01:34:38,960
I'm so stupid stoked.

1907
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:42,400
We are dumb grateful for all of you sharing

1908
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:44,360
in our absurd story.

1909
01:34:44,360 --> 01:34:49,120
In the delicious words of John Raymond Ray Arnold,

1910
01:34:49,120 --> 01:34:52,040
chief engineer of Jurassic Park,

1911
01:34:52,040 --> 01:34:53,520
hold on to your butts.

1912
01:34:53,520 --> 01:35:16,840
How am I the only one trying to pull off

1913
01:35:16,840 --> 01:35:23,080
how can you have enough drowning out

1914
01:35:23,080 --> 01:35:27,840
of all who knows?

1915
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:31,840
There's no one home.

1916
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:35,840
No one home.

1917
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:39,840
No one home.

1918
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:44,200
Fly, fly, to the stream you know.
