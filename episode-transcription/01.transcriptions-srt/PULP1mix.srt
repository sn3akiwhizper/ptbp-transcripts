1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
Well, here we are once again, folks.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,800
For the first time.

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,960
Again, it's your favorite radio DJ

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:12,080
from inner and outer space, Wolf the Dog.

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,580
And where and when the fuck am I?

6
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:17,120
Hold on.

7
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,800
It smells like East Coast.

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,700
Let me check my local dimension time.

9
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:28,180
It's 1937 and New Year's Eve.

10
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:33,020
It's as if I have no control over what happens to me.

11
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:37,520
Like someone is forcing me to play into the sick fantasy

12
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,460
that's broadcast to all the world.

13
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:45,060
But yeah, I guess we got a new Howlin' with Wolf or whatever.

14
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:47,280
If these are even real.

15
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,860
This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Jeff in Seattle,

16
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:54,180
who tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending part.

17
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:58,040
A simple and worthwhile use of any person's time.

18
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,280
Jeff in Seattle writes,

19
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,940
a shout out to my wonderful and adorable little brother,

20
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:05,640
Chalky Boberson.

21
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,360
May your D100s roll low and your D20s roll high.

22
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,180
And a warning to Matias Black.

23
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:16,680
Temporal manipulation never ends well.

24
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,940
Don't gaze into dimensions that are not your own

25
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:22,920
unless you want eyes looking back.

26
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,920
Well, Jeff in Seattle, I have to say that temporal

27
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,480
whatever you said seems pretty cool to me.

28
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,840
Sometimes you gotta gaze into another dimension

29
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,280
as a little treat.

30
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,260
And sometimes you have to consume another dimension

31
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:41,580
as a big ol' meal.

32
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:44,740
If you wanna write up something for your Wolfie to how,

33
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:47,280
tag at pretending part on the internet

34
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,760
or write up a five star review on Apple podcasts.

35
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,020
If you holler and let us know,

36
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:57,160
you're sure to get the message that's deep in your soul

37
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:00,220
to come out of this dirty old mouth hole.

38
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:03,740
And if you're interested in doling out some dough

39
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,800
to keep this show afloat,

40
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:10,800
head on over to patreon.com slash pretending pod

41
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:14,740
for 29 bonus episodes.

42
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:18,540
From Call of Cthulhu's classic scenario, The Haunting,

43
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:21,700
to silly one page RPG sessions

44
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,500
from our first season session zero

45
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:28,920
to a currently 13 episode long mostly homebrew

46
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:33,540
Delta Green campaign called The Creature Crew.

47
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:38,540
All the links are in the show notes.

48
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:42,080
Sound the alarm, but don't hit the snooze.

49
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,980
Like a beast mode stiff arm, I'm quaking for the news.

50
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,520
The first season of pretending to be people

51
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,620
was a well-loved affair.

52
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,980
So much so that it reached one million downloads.

53
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,580
Thank you to everyone who contributed

54
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:03,460
to this chunky number being so unbelievably large.

55
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:06,420
Also, this episode right here kicks off

56
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:11,420
the five episode guest run featuring Scott Dorward

57
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:14,880
running a pulp Cthulhu scenario he wrote,

58
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,520
which is called A New Age of Wonders.

59
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,180
And call me Mrs. Liam Neeson

60
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:26,700
if I am mistaken, but a new story deserves a new theme song

61
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:29,840
and A New Age of Wonders deserves something

62
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,980
full of pain and sorrow.

63
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:35,300
It's Isabelle Crane with Hollow.

64
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:42,060
I didn't know a body could be hollow

65
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:47,980
before its blood ran cold.

66
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:53,820
I didn't know that the wind could sew

67
00:03:55,820 --> 00:04:00,820
through tissue and faggot bones.

68
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:08,220
You were hollow when you spoke to me.

69
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:15,820
Hollow when you said you were hollow.

70
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:22,980
I thought you might be starving,

71
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:31,780
so I gave you everything.

72
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:37,660
Oh, actually I'm peaking a bit.

73
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:38,980
Let me just drop my gain.

74
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:42,260
Drop your gain to the floor, drop your gain to the floor.

75
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:46,260
If your name is Scott Dorward, drop your gain to the floor.

76
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,100
Nice.

77
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,020
I've never had a hype man before.

78
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,060
How'd you feel?

79
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,140
I feel warm inside.

80
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,140
I feel special.

81
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:02,820
Welcome everyone to Pretending to Be People.

82
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,420
We are here with a special guest today

83
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:10,420
who is not only one of the good friends of Jackson Elias,

84
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:14,380
not only the man at the helm of multiple games

85
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,500
throughout the internet,

86
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,340
but currently including running

87
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:21,540
the Pulp Cthulhu campaign two-headed serpent

88
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:24,060
for the podcast How We Roll,

89
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:27,500
and just the all around incredible writer,

90
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,540
tabletop master, wizard extraordinaire on the internet.

91
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,380
Man with the golden voice.

92
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:35,140
And the guy who I kind of wish was my grandpa,

93
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,740
but haven't told him that to his face,

94
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,020
it's Scott Dorward!

95
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,500
Thank you very much.

96
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,140
I'm never going to live up to that now.

97
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:45,580
You know that.

98
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,100
Well, Scott, you've already lived up to it

99
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,060
because we had you on a while ago.

100
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,260
Was it last year?

101
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,100
Oh, maybe even longer than that.

102
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,100
It was over a year ago at this point.

103
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:55,940
Wow.

104
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:56,780
Was it really?

105
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:57,900
It was at the end of 2020, I think.

106
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,100
Oh my God.

107
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,980
And you ran Bleak Prospect for us,

108
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,980
which is a Call of Cthulhu scenario

109
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:07,740
that was written by a very talented writer

110
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,660
for Call of Cthulhu.

111
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,500
Who was that?

112
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,340
Who was that?

113
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,180
Oh, I forget.

114
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,580
They're all the same, really.

115
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:19,500
Well, you silly goose, it was written by you.

116
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,340
Okay.

117
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,500
I don't know why I've been so weird.

118
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,340
Are you okay, man?

119
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,980
It was, you wrote it.

120
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:31,780
I wrote it a long time ago.

121
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,100
I can't remember doing that.

122
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,540
It might as well have been someone else.

123
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,940
I've written so many things over the years.

124
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:43,540
And honestly, it was one of my favorite

125
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:46,300
role-playing experiences of my life.

126
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,020
It's still some of the stuff I go back

127
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:51,020
and listen to repeatedly just to hear it all again.

128
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,940
I'll keep that in mind when I'm getting excited

129
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,980
about the numbers, that it's just Joe.

130
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:55,820
Yeah.

131
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,140
So if you're listening to this

132
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,380
and you haven't listened to that,

133
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:02,260
Scott does an incredible job running Bleak Prospect

134
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,620
for the four of us.

135
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:06,460
And that was actually, that was a really wild time

136
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:11,500
because Scott is in Europe and we are in North America,

137
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,820
but at the time I was in Asia,

138
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:17,460
so we were recording across three continents.

139
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,300
Yeah.

140
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,980
Yeah, that was like five minutes a day

141
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,940
when we were all in sync, wasn't it?

142
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,700
It really was.

143
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:28,060
It took a long time to get on the same schedule.

144
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:30,060
We really are a global podcast.

145
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:33,780
Yeah, well, we're the international role-playing podcast.

146
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,660
That's what everyone knows that.

147
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:40,420
The Springfield, Missouri podcast is the international.

148
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:43,180
We have a pretty big blip on the map of listeners

149
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,340
in like South America.

150
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,300
So recording in Asia, North America and Europe,

151
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,900
having people in South America listen to it.

152
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,700
We just got to get some of those researchers.

153
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,580
Exactly, we got to get hit Antarctica.

154
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:59,140
But today we're not playing Call of Cthulhu

155
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:01,540
and today we are not playing Delta Green.

156
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:05,100
And today we are playing.

157
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,460
D&D first edition.

158
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:10,300
Firewall.

159
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,420
That was fun when Dungeons and Daddies did it.

160
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,260
Oh, that was tight.

161
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:16,500
But we're not doing that and we probably never will.

162
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,740
Sorry, I haven't been talking much.

163
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:18,860
I've just been trying to pretend

164
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:21,460
like I wasn't working on my character sheet.

165
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,380
Which is a different character sheet

166
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,620
than we are used to using.

167
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,740
I believe it's the first time

168
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:32,540
that I personally have filled out a PC character sheet

169
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:34,100
for Pulp Cthulhu.

170
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,500
Pulp Cthulhu.

171
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,060
Pulp Cthulhu.

172
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:41,180
I've done a couple, mostly with you, Zach.

173
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,780
You ran us through some back in the day.

174
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,100
I've run it, I've never gotten to play it.

175
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,060
I'm super fucking excited.

176
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,100
I was able to run Waiting for the Hurricane

177
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,900
from the back of the book,

178
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,380
which was written by another good friend

179
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:55,340
of Jackson Elias, Matt Sanderson.

180
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,180
Yes.

181
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,000
Is that right?

182
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,840
He did.

183
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:01,900
And of course we are wishing a speedy recovery to Matt.

184
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:02,740
Yeah, thanks.

185
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,500
It's been a scary month with Matt,

186
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:08,180
but happily he's back home and on the road to recovery now.

187
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,900
That's fantastic news, yeah.

188
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,040
How's your, the last time we recorded

189
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,820
you had like a tooth issue.

190
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:14,940
Oh fuck, yeah.

191
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,320
I ended up in hospital with that.

192
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,160
Yeah.

193
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:18,980
Oh my God.

194
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:21,860
Yeah, I ended up having to have emergency surgery

195
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,820
in part of my jaw removed.

196
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:24,980
Oh man.

197
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:25,820
Yikes.

198
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,620
Yeah, I can't say I recommend it.

199
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:28,460
No.

200
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,660
Has it been a relatively smooth sailing

201
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,500
after the surgery and stuff though?

202
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,620
Yeah, I mean, the shape of my mouth still feels wrong,

203
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,940
but apart from that, yes.

204
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:39,760
Yeah.

205
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,820
Oh, interesting.

206
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,980
Did they let you keep the part that they pulled?

207
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:46,340
I stupidly didn't think to ask because otherwise, yeah,

208
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:49,260
I absolutely would have kept it in a jar at my desk.

209
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,020
Scott, let's dive in.

210
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:54,860
Let's do it.

211
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:55,700
Okay.

212
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:59,260
So this scenario is called A New Age of Wonders

213
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:03,660
and it's published in issue three of the Blasphemous Tome,

214
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:06,820
which is the fanzine that we do for the Patreon backers

215
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,500
of the Good Friends of Jackson Elias.

216
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:12,180
Which you should all become because I personally

217
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:15,020
am a patron of the Good Friends of Jackson Elias

218
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:20,020
and the rewards that I reap are worth every fucking penny.

219
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,180
Well, thank you, Zach.

220
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,820
Yeah, I'll slip the check in the mail.

221
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,200
Eight bucks.

222
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,540
Every eight dollars counts.

223
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:37,660
Oh God, eight dollars is big money in the RPG field.

224
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:44,660
So this scenario takes place in 1937,

225
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:48,100
particularly New Year's Eve, 1937.

226
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,300
The player characters have all been invited,

227
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,340
or at least they have managed to get themselves

228
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:54,820
on the invitation list too,

229
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:59,140
what promises to be the New Year's Eve party of the year.

230
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:03,140
Or at least that's the way that the host has pitched it.

231
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:06,900
The host is a man called Cicero Mordant.

232
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,780
He comes from a moneyed background

233
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:12,940
and his family is incredibly wealthy,

234
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:15,740
but he himself has gone off

235
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,180
in a somewhat different direction.

236
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:21,380
He is an inventor, or at least a would be inventor.

237
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:24,380
I mean, those of you who've kept up with his career

238
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:27,580
know that he's enthusiastic,

239
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:32,580
he's good at self-promotion, perhaps,

240
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,340
and he certainly has the money

241
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:37,540
to bring his inventions to the market.

242
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:40,540
But really, fundamentally, he's a bit shit.

243
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:43,020
I mean, some of the inventions

244
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,300
that he's put out over the years

245
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:47,220
are things like this self-playing violin,

246
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:51,100
which promises to bring chamber music to every household,

247
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,100
but it really just plays the same four bars

248
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,420
over and over again,

249
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,940
and goes out of tune in about five minutes.

250
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,500
There was the electric hairnet,

251
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:04,220
which promised to revolutionize home hairstyling.

252
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:07,500
And there've been a number of unfortunate fires

253
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:11,060
and the lawsuits are still in the courts at the moment.

254
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,980
The less said of his radiant dentifries, the better.

255
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,540
But this time he promises

256
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:21,780
that he has got a magnificent new invention

257
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:24,300
that he wants to show off to the world.

258
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,540
And the launch of this invention

259
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:29,460
is going to be this New Year's party

260
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:33,500
at his family estate, The Mount, in rural Vermont.

261
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,900
So let's, I'd say, introduce the player characters

262
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:41,460
at this stage, and then we can just, I think,

263
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:44,180
get you on the road to The Mount.

264
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,940
So do you want to go round one by one

265
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,620
to say who you're playing,

266
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:53,660
and I think also why you're going to the party?

267
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:57,980
My character, oh, give me that voice, baby, is Checkers.

268
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,660
How old is Checkers?

269
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:04,820
I'm a 19-year-old cult leader.

270
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:08,980
I'm here, I'm going to the party

271
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:12,140
to recruit some movie stars

272
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:17,140
and high profile people for my cult, The Last Branch.

273
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:22,820
And I'm Elden Ring, and fuck's sake.

274
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,580
It's not my birth name.

275
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:32,220
Elden Ring is my given name by myself.

276
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,300
My given name for my family

277
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:37,860
is none of my business, nor anyone else's.

278
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:41,660
And I'm just very happy to be accompanying

279
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:46,660
my dear Checkers to this wonderful New Year's Eve party

280
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:51,100
and just helping him bring people to The Last Branch.

281
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:55,500
Our goal is to get as many of the rich and powerful

282
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:59,020
on our side today through the powers of persuasion

283
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:02,300
and Checkers' deep and utter charisma.

284
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,980
There are things at work in this world,

285
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,220
forces beyond our control,

286
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:11,820
and we look to control those forces.

287
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:15,740
With money that we make from the cult.

288
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,820
And Checkers, remember, the forces.

289
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,820
Yeah, they are real.

290
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,020
They certainly are.

291
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,860
Are there really any stronger forces

292
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,060
in the world than money?

293
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:28,700
True love.

294
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:30,740
Aww.

295
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:36,700
That is a question that the Lafayette J. Honeycutt

296
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:37,740
would like to get to know.

297
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:40,340
Are there any more forces in the universe

298
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:42,540
more powerful than love or money?

299
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,180
And he studies that in depth.

300
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,100
He's a scientist.

301
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,940
Does he sound like that when he studies it?

302
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:47,780
He doesn't.

303
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:49,340
You'll hear his voice when he speaks.

304
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,460
God damn it, Thomas.

305
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,060
You're such a tease.

306
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:52,900
Yep.

307
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,620
He's gonna be showing up to this party in disguise.

308
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,540
Why? Dressed as a turtle?

309
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:00,420
Because he is a professional,

310
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:03,220
yeah, he's gonna be dressed as a turtle.

311
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:06,980
No, he's a professional rival of Cicero Mordent,

312
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:09,220
and he wants to get a look at this invention,

313
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:12,540
but he was not invited because he's on Mordent's shit list.

314
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:15,300
Mordent has a very, very long shit list.

315
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,780
And I'm playing Harvey Brewer.

316
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:22,180
I'm here to make sure nobody gets too close

317
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:25,380
to Mr. Lafayette J. Honeycutt here.

318
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:26,380
He hired me.

319
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,300
I'm gonna protect him.

320
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,700
I told you, Harvey, tonight, it's,

321
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:33,580
it's, oh shit, what was the cover name?

322
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,180
You were gonna go with Harvey Brewer,

323
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,780
but that's my name, so we can't use that one.

324
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:43,620
That's correct.

325
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:46,500
Is this your fumbling your disguise role in real life?

326
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:49,900
More or less.

327
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,380
What is your actual name?

328
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:54,620
Lafayette J. Honeycutt.

329
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:58,100
But tonight you are Honeyfette J. Lafayette.

330
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:02,380
James Dean.

331
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:06,980
No one famous has been named James Dean in 1937.

332
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,940
I was gonna try to go for a mid-Atlantic,

333
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:11,460
and I think I'm gonna go too much

334
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:14,060
into copying your accent, Scott.

335
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:18,060
Oh, can you please try?

336
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,580
No, I'm not gonna.

337
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,180
Do it.

338
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:24,180
Do it, Scott, at Scott.

339
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,620
Maybe after a couple sessions.

340
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:29,780
Sessions.

341
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,060
Session IPA.

342
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:37,060
Oh, could we go puff some all this?

343
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,100
After this episode.

344
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,020
We gotta get the first episode down.

345
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:44,900
So, like I say, you have all managed

346
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:47,340
to somehow get hold of invitations

347
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,180
to this New Year's Eve party,

348
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:53,100
and you know that there has been transportation played on.

349
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,660
All you have to do is get yourself

350
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:57,860
to Montpellier in Vermont.

351
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:58,700
There is a station there.

352
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,060
Scott, sorry to interrupt.

353
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,060
I'm so sorry.

354
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:01,900
It's Montpelier.

355
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,300
It's Montpelier, yeah.

356
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,900
Montpelier, sorry, I went for the French pronunciation.

357
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:09,180
We said it with such, like, a plum,

358
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:11,860
and when I learned how to pronounce it,

359
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:16,100
it was in Missouri, and we said Montpelier, Vermont.

360
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,300
Well, that is how they say it.

361
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,700
Montpelier, Montpelier.

362
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:20,540
Montpelier, yeah.

363
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:23,300
Montpelier, I shall say that again, then.

364
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:26,340
Montpelier, Montpelier, right.

365
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:28,740
It sounds like wrong when you say it.

366
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:31,900
I bet Honeycutt does say Montpelier.

367
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:35,180
Montpelier, Montpelier.

368
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:38,860
I've got a beautiful 1932 bottle of Montpelier.

369
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:43,060
Oh, God.

370
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:45,780
Right, so yes, you know all you have to do

371
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:49,220
is get yourself to Montpelier in rural Vermont,

372
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:52,180
and then there will be transportation at the station

373
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:54,540
that is laid on for you.

374
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:58,900
And sure enough, when the train pulls in at the station,

375
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:02,660
you can see that there are any number

376
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,940
of well-dressed people

377
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:07,980
who are obviously dressed up for this party.

378
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:12,980
Men in full evening dress with heavy overcoats on,

379
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,700
women in gowns, again, with furs over them

380
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:20,140
to keep themselves warm, because it is cold.

381
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,700
It's been snowing fairly heavily.

382
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:25,060
There's storm clouds up in the sky,

383
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:28,980
and you can see that the snow is falling already.

384
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:32,300
But you can also see that outside the station,

385
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:36,860
there are a number of vehicles lined up

386
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:40,500
with uniformed chauffeurs who are there,

387
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,100
a few of them holding up signs

388
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:45,980
announcing that they're to take people to the mount.

389
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:49,820
And after the usual moment's hesitation,

390
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:53,540
people start flocking towards those vehicles.

391
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:58,900
Shall we say, I mean, if you're happy with this,

392
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:01,540
shall we say that the group of the four of you

393
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:04,020
end up sharing the same car together?

394
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:07,700
Because, you know, each car happily seats

395
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,940
four passengers in the back.

396
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,700
And there are enough people,

397
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,740
guests who have arrived to the party,

398
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:17,820
that they're pretty much filling up all the cars.

399
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,740
One of the chauffeurs ushers the four of you

400
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:22,340
into the back of one of these

401
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:25,420
really quite fancy-looking limousines.

402
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:29,860
Gentlemen, you are going to the mount, right?

403
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:33,860
Yes, is this the correct way to go?

404
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,460
Yes, yes, yes.

405
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:38,580
Mr. Mordant has arranged for transportation

406
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,460
for all his guests, please, please.

407
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:42,380
How are you guys dressed?

408
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:45,060
Harvey Brewer is a giant hulk of a man.

409
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:48,300
He's like 6'8 and like 300 pounds, but it's like muscle.

410
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,580
He's a big, strong, strong dude.

411
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,300
And so he's wearing a tuxedo,

412
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:55,220
but it's a little tight in all the right places.

413
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,940
It's a little bit stretched almost,

414
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:00,660
but he's pulling it off pretty okay.

415
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,500
I imagine the suspension on the car

416
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,380
just creaks as you get in.

417
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,820
Yeah, exactly.

418
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:09,380
Checkers is wearing like a cashmere three-piece suit.

419
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,500
He's got like a full beard.

420
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,580
Definitely trying to look older than he is,

421
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,880
but he's dressed very fancifully.

422
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:21,980
And Elden Ring is just wearing a very simple

423
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:26,080
black pair of trousers and a white cotton shirt

424
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,640
that is buttoned down, buttoned all the way to the top.

425
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,160
And it has like a granddad collar,

426
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,400
like an old school non-collar.

427
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:39,400
Is that all you're wearing even in New Year's Eve in Vermont?

428
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:44,520
Yes, and if anyone, if like the coach driver or whatever,

429
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:48,400
like asks if I'm cold or need a fur or whatever, you know,

430
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,720
he just kind of says like,

431
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,400
no, the warmth is within me.

432
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,240
Nice.

433
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,080
I guess we'll find out how long that's going to last.

434
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:04,040
So Lafayette is wearing a tuxedo

435
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:07,540
that is as tailored as Harvey's is not.

436
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,800
He, I mean, he looks fantastic.

437
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:14,240
He looks like a 30s or 40s movie star

438
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,080
and he's got this perfect like pencil thin mustache

439
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,660
and a really dashing long tail coat, not a tail coat,

440
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:26,020
but a long coat, it's winter in Vermont

441
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:28,860
as Scott just tipped us off to.

442
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:34,860
Quickly improvise a coat,

443
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,660
which is the art of what we do here.

444
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:41,240
He's carrying a very, very bulky briefcase.

445
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,740
It's almost like a suitcase.

446
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:45,860
It's way too large to be bringing

447
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:47,700
to a New Year's Eve party,

448
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,740
but he's got it tucked tightly under his arm

449
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:52,980
and he's kind of looking suspiciously

450
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,980
at the two people we've been paired up with.

451
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:58,540
And he's like, Harvey, I don't like the look of these chaps.

452
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:01,900
Upon hearing that Harvey is going to just mean mug

453
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,140
these other two guys in the car with us.

454
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:08,340
Yeah, I look at, you forgot my name?

455
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:09,460
Elden Ring, yeah.

456
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:14,460
I think we're all trying to forget your name, yeah.

457
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:18,580
Checkers looks at Elden.

458
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,940
Did he really just say that out loud?

459
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:21,780
Looking-

460
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,380
I said it so you couldn't hear.

461
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:25,060
We're all in a car together.

462
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:25,900
You have to get in a car.

463
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,100
Thomas, I can hear you.

464
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,540
I'm sitting right here.

465
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,380
You've got headphones on.

466
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,460
I have headphones on.

467
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:34,540
These guys look nice.

468
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:36,940
Do you think they'd be interested in our pitch?

469
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:39,540
Yeah, I don't understand why anyone wouldn't be.

470
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:43,740
As he's slowly just parting his super long black hair

471
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:46,580
that is now like completely covering his face,

472
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:48,380
he goes in with both hands

473
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:51,780
and kind of makes a window for his eyes in between

474
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:54,740
with a full middle part of this super long hair

475
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:58,940
and just lets off the most unattractive smile

476
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,980
at these two gentlemen.

477
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:03,780
I'm imagining like the girl from the ring.

478
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:04,620
Yeah.

479
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:05,460
I'm imagining cousin Elden Ring.

480
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,460
Elden Ring from the Addams family.

481
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,740
Yeah, there you go.

482
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:12,300
Lafayette is like sitting across from Elden

483
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:15,980
and he's got his like very long, like elegant legs,

484
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,740
like one folded over the other

485
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:19,700
and you can see his foot is tapping

486
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:22,980
just very, very anxiously and annoyedly,

487
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:27,260
sort of half glaring, half just studying this creature

488
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,580
that just sat down in front of him

489
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:31,100
and parted its weird, greasy hair.

490
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:34,940
Maybe ask him what his name is, Checkers.

491
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,980
You're supposed to be our charisma person.

492
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,380
Yeah, sorry.

493
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,580
It's early in the morning here.

494
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:45,900
Yeah, let's start that again.

495
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:53,260
Hello, Checkers, this is Elden, gentlemen.

496
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:54,900
It's nice to meet you.

497
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:58,660
Have you two heard the kind and good news of Checkers?

498
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:02,660
Yes, I think I have heard of what you lot get up to.

499
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:05,540
I pull like a little pamphlet out of my coat

500
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:07,100
and hand it over to Harley.

501
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,580
I don't like your presence in my town.

502
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:12,700
Well, this is not starting on a good foot.

503
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:13,980
None savory element.

504
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:16,860
Well, maybe we'll just leave each other

505
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:21,140
to what we like to do and we won't discuss this in the car.

506
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:23,620
As a man of science, yes, I'd prefer

507
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:26,100
if we left your hokum here at the station.

508
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,660
Checkers takes no offense to that

509
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:31,460
because he does not believe in what he's selling at all.

510
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:33,900
So he's just kind of like, fair enough.

511
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:39,780
And this is why your cult only has two people in it.

512
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:44,780
I'm just so sorry to say that I don't think

513
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,820
I can leave it there.

514
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:50,740
The world is bigger than your mind can comprehend, sir.

515
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:51,580
Hey.

516
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:52,780
He gets a kind of ride.

517
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:55,820
Hey, shut up.

518
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:57,180
He said he didn't want to hear about it.

519
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:59,140
Now Harvey, now Harvey.

520
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:02,100
He's beginning to speak on things of which he doesn't know.

521
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:05,260
Yes, it is quite a big world.

522
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:06,820
Elden, did you say your name was?

523
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:09,780
Yeah, sir Elden Ring, I gave my name to myself.

524
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:12,980
I explore some of those mysteries myself

525
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:15,420
in ways I don't think either of you two would comprehend.

526
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:17,420
What is it that you do, sir?

527
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,700
All manner of things.

528
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:22,180
Oh, right.

529
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:28,700
Nothing, I'm a lazy socialite dilettante.

530
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:33,340
Where is this accent going?

531
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:35,900
I like it, I like it, it feels right.

532
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,100
It feels right.

533
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,700
If that's the case, then you really should read this.

534
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:42,780
And I offer the pamphlet for my cult again.

535
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:44,980
Right.

536
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:48,300
He's suddenly like got a panic look and he's like,

537
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:52,300
okay, yes, that is what I would do

538
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:56,220
because I am a lazy gadabout.

539
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:00,780
Right, you're exactly what we're looking for.

540
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:01,620
Right.

541
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:02,460
Are you rich?

542
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,900
Yeah, yeah.

543
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,020
Good, okay.

544
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:06,820
It's a small fee to join,

545
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:08,780
but we'll talk about it when we get to the point.

546
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:10,500
The money is of no consequence

547
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,220
when you're dealing in eternity.

548
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:13,820
Give me your literature.

549
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:18,700
He hands it over to him.

550
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:23,500
He like reaches out with a handkerchief and grabs it.

551
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:26,220
It's like a handwritten like pamphlet.

552
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:28,860
What is this stain on?

553
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:32,180
What is this stain?

554
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:34,740
Thank you.

555
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:39,820
Just read the pamphlet and you'll understand.

556
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:42,380
It's magic.

557
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:44,020
Lafayette leans over like,

558
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,700
boy, that was a close one, Harvey.

559
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:49,340
We're to, you know, one up old Mordent

560
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:52,700
and unveil my invention and he pats the big box.

561
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,460
Nice.

562
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:56,340
Upstage him tonight.

563
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,740
We can't reveal my identity.

564
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:00,620
Did you, we're saying this to each other in confidence.

565
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,700
Did you come up with a cover name yet?

566
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:05,780
Oh God, I can't think of any name.

567
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:10,060
Like when Billy actor's like,

568
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:13,540
Billy actor's like, name a woman.

569
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:19,780
Just like, Janine Garofalo.

570
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,740
I also like to think that

571
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:25,580
while you're having this conversation,

572
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:29,300
supposedly in private, I mean, it's a small cab

573
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,500
and I'd like to think the other two can just overhear

574
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:34,300
every single fucking thing you're saying.

575
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,580
So do you guys know Mr. Mordaunt?

576
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:39,500
No, I'm lazy socialite, David Ellington.

577
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:44,740
And I've never met Mr. Mordaunt.

578
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:45,980
How'd you get invited?

579
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:48,220
I'm a prominent socialite.

580
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:49,420
And I'm his friend.

581
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,260
Fair enough.

582
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,220
This is my man.

583
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,100
Yes.

584
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,580
David and Harvey.

585
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:55,420
Goliath.

586
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:57,420
You said David and Goliath.

587
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:02,420
Easy, you know what, that's really easy to remember.

588
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,380
While you're having this conversation,

589
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:10,060
the car is passing, first of all, through the town itself,

590
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,380
which doesn't take very long.

591
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:13,380
It's not a big town.

592
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:17,780
And then heads off into, first of all, some country roads.

593
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:22,020
You're moving through some fairly light woodland

594
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:23,780
and then slightly thicker forest.

595
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:28,100
And you can see that you're moving towards

596
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:30,500
one of the big peaks around here.

597
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,140
Those of you who know the area

598
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:33,860
or who've looked at a map beforehand

599
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:36,300
might realize that it's Mount Ellen.

600
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:40,620
And you do seem to be moving towards the base of it.

601
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:44,180
And at some point you move off onto a private road,

602
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:47,260
which is much, much smaller.

603
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:50,420
And the driver's having to slow down a fair bit

604
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:53,620
at this stage because the snow's getting quite heavy.

605
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:56,540
Not heavy enough that he's losing control of the vehicle,

606
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:59,700
but visibility's suffering a little bit.

607
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,940
But more importantly, he's obviously fighting a bit

608
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,940
with traction on the road.

609
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:07,900
But as you get closer, you can start to see...

610
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:12,420
Well, first of all, have any of you been to the mount before

611
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:14,220
or is this your first visit?

612
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,020
For checkers, it's definitely the first visit.

613
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:16,860
Same.

614
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,820
I think it'd be Harvey's first visit for sure.

615
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:22,380
Yeah, probably before Harvey started working for Lafayette.

616
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:24,980
Lafayette had been and was kicked out.

617
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:25,820
Oh yeah.

618
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:26,660
Of course.

619
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:27,500
Yeah.

620
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:30,340
After he saw the debut of the self-playing violin

621
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,860
at New Year's Eve, like 1933.

622
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:34,340
Wait, did you unleash one of your own concepts

623
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,180
that same night?

624
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,660
I did.

625
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:38,060
And what was that?

626
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:41,180
What kind of jacket are you wearing?

627
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:43,380
He just picked up a violin and started playing it

628
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:44,220
and that was his invention.

629
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,940
That would be exactly, yeah.

630
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:48,700
What was that when you debuted the self-throwing tomato?

631
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:54,220
No, I just fucked Borden's wife that night.

632
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,460
He does not like me.

633
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:01,660
When you were kicked out, you're like,

634
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:03,780
you should invent a self-fucking you.

635
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:08,340
My God.

636
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,940
So that's what you've been working on ever since?

637
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:14,980
That's what he's got in the suitcase.

638
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:17,660
You don't know what he's been working on

639
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:18,500
and then he packed the box again.

640
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:21,300
I'm now horrified to find out what's in that suitcase.

641
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:24,620
What's in the box is super rad.

642
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:27,020
What's in the suitcase is going to carry

643
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:29,020
a D6, D20 sand loss, I think.

644
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:33,860
Yeah, for Morden, when he sees how fucking cool it is.

645
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:39,140
What do you got in there?

646
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:40,740
Yeah, that's a big box.

647
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:41,820
Party supplies.

648
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:43,140
Yeah, party supplies.

649
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:44,780
What kind of party supplies?

650
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:47,140
The kind that supply a party.

651
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:48,900
That's what the rich do.

652
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:49,740
Glassware?

653
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:51,700
Probably silverware.

654
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,060
You brought your own goblet?

655
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,660
There's some silver in it, yes.

656
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:58,940
I hope we're almost there.

657
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:01,620
You are almost there.

658
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:04,300
You've come over the ridge of a hill

659
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:08,900
and onto a little plateau towards the base of the mountain.

660
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:13,900
And yeah, there is the two-story colonial revival

661
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,980
style mansion that is the mount

662
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:18,380
with all its outbuildings around here.

663
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:19,580
Before you get to it, though,

664
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:23,620
you do pass by an odd-looking structure,

665
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:26,740
which Nathaiad doesn't recognize

666
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:29,580
as having been here the last time

667
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,300
that you visited the mount.

668
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:33,700
And it looks fairly incongruous.

669
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:36,980
It's just built on the edge of the property.

670
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:40,700
It looks initially like, you know,

671
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,460
maybe the kind of lookout tower

672
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:46,100
that you might get in the forest.

673
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,820
Like on the forest moon of Indor?

674
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:51,660
Yeah, like that maybe.

675
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:55,700
Sorry, am I lagging again?

676
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,140
It lagged pretty hard.

677
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:59,340
We missed a little bit of the description of the tower.

678
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:01,820
Sorry, I'll back up a bit then.

679
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:04,380
So you notice this weird structure

680
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:08,500
on the edge of the property that looks a bit like a tower,

681
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:11,500
maybe a lookout tower that, you know,

682
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:13,060
firefighters might use in a forest

683
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:14,660
or forest rangers, rather.

684
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,900
Like on the forest moon of Indor?

685
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,220
Oh, fuck's sake.

686
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:24,780
So you can see up atop the tower,

687
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:28,140
there is what looks like a glass structure.

688
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:30,140
I mean, I guess anyone who wants,

689
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:31,700
if you want to give me a spot,

690
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:34,100
hit and roll just to see what they can make out anymore.

691
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:34,940
Oh boy.

692
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:41,340
I passed a 10 on a base 25.

693
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:43,300
That is a hard success.

694
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,140
Nice.

695
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:46,980
I failed my roll, an 82 on a 70.

696
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:49,020
I got a 96.

697
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:49,860
On a?

698
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:53,180
On a 40.

699
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,780
So that is actually a fumble.

700
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:56,220
We'll get to you in a moment.

701
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:58,700
I love that rule.

702
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:02,620
So if it's over double your skill, it's a fumble?

703
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:05,860
If you roll 96 to 100 and your skill's under 50,

704
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:06,940
then it's a fumble.

705
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:08,100
If your skill is over 50,

706
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:10,420
you have to roll a double zero for it to be a fumble.

707
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:11,620
Okay, sick.

708
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:13,420
But what did Lafayette get?

709
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:14,460
87.

710
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:17,220
Okay, so I assume that's a failure.

711
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,540
Do you have a 90 spot hidden?

712
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:19,620
This is poor Cthulhu after all.

713
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:21,260
No, I have a 51.

714
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:24,420
So yeah, you do notice that there are some things

715
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:26,740
sticking out of the top as well

716
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:30,140
that look maybe like radio aerials.

717
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,820
Yeah, I mean, there are all sorts

718
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:34,380
of spiky protrusions coming out.

719
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:37,040
Master Checkers, do you see those spiky guys

720
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,300
coming out the top of that lookout tower?

721
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:42,820
Checkers is like writing another pamphlet real quick

722
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:45,940
and doesn't even pay attention to your question.

723
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:48,260
Well, I think then on the fumble,

724
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:50,660
then that's the point at which the car goes

725
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:53,460
over a big bump in the road and you just end up scoring

726
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:55,620
through all the magnificent pros that you've just written.

727
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:56,460
Oh, man.

728
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:03,140
Oh, another parchment down for the count, huh?

729
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:06,580
Yeah, my pencil I was using pokes me in the eye

730
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:09,620
and I'm like, just completely thrown off.

731
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:10,900
Are you okay, Master?

732
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:13,620
Just leave me alone for right now until we get to the party.

733
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:18,620
He's like trying to be as like gentle and fixie as he can

734
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:23,720
while still giving personal space to his favorite Checkers.

735
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:28,620
Well, the car pulls up in the courtyard

736
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:31,900
outside the main building and you can see

737
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,420
that there were a number of other cars now

738
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:35,980
that are parked there already.

739
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:39,460
A few guests have got out and some of them

740
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:42,260
are just going into the main entrance,

741
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:44,580
a few are making their way over there.

742
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:47,740
The house itself is largely lit up at the moment,

743
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:50,180
there are lights on in most of the rooms,

744
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:54,020
but the main activity seems to be coming

745
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:57,260
from a room over on the left-hand side

746
00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:00,380
where you can see that there's a lot of bright light

747
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:03,300
coming out from the windows, there's the sound

748
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:06,420
of swing music playing rather loudly in there

749
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:10,420
and through the windows, you can see activity going on.

750
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:13,500
The other thing you can see is on the edifice

751
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:18,500
of the building, just above the window,

752
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:20,380
the front window of that room

753
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:22,140
where all the activity is going on,

754
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:26,100
there is what looks like another huge antenna

755
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:28,220
just sticking out of the wall

756
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:30,780
and some fairly thick cables coming down from it.

757
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:33,740
Checkers, there's another one right there.

758
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:37,140
He is writing another pamphlet and I'm paying attention.

759
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:41,580
Checkers, oh, okay, yeah, no, okay.

760
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:43,300
Antenna, sure, uh-huh.

761
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:44,740
I'll tell you what, I mean,

762
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:48,660
as Lafayette is actually a scientist,

763
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:50,980
what is your scientific specialization?

764
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:53,700
What scientific skills does Lafayette have?

765
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,100
Engineering is his focus

766
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:57,740
and mechanical, electrical, and computers.

767
00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:00,180
Yep, then engineering is perfect for this.

768
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:02,180
If you want to give me an engineering role

769
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:05,900
to see whether you can make sense of this at all.

770
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:10,420
Yep, he passes 40 on a 90.

771
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:12,540
Yeah, you look at this aerial

772
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:15,060
and I mean, there's something weird about it.

773
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:17,620
It's not a design you've encountered before.

774
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:21,060
It doesn't look like an old radio aerial.

775
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:22,700
There's a bit of a dish behind it

776
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:25,540
and it looks like, I don't know,

777
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:28,780
maybe it's designed to focus something,

778
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:32,980
but yeah, there's something about it

779
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:37,980
that looks really strange and maybe novel.

780
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:42,660
Yeah, it's nothing like you've seen before.

781
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:45,660
He kind of plays with his little pencil-thin mustache

782
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:49,100
and he's like, what are you scheming at, Moldent?

783
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:52,420
Right behind you is Elden Ring

784
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,380
and he just like whispers in your ear

785
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:56,580
and he's like, what do you think it is?

786
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:59,460
He reflexively like elbows back.

787
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:04,900
I have a size 40, so I think you like elbow back

788
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:07,260
and I'm like a foot shorter

789
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:09,060
than you would have elbowed towards.

790
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,060
Yeah, he's a tall wisp.

791
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:15,540
I'm like an absolute waif of a man.

792
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:18,460
The sudden jerking of his elbow

793
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:20,180
to sneak up on the gentleman sends Harvey

794
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:22,420
into like protect mode and he grabs you

795
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:23,540
and just moves you away.

796
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:25,860
Oh, you can pick me up off the ground, yeah.

797
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,660
And as you do, he's just like,

798
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:30,540
oh, the strength of physicality is mighty,

799
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,420
but it's nothing compared to the mind.

800
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:33,780
I just want you to keep your distance

801
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:35,220
from here on out, you understand?

802
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:37,860
Hey, don't be touching, don't be touching me,

803
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:38,700
don't be touching him.

804
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,180
Why are you talking to my man like that?

805
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:41,060
Because he's touching him.

806
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:42,900
My man is having a conversation with your man

807
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,220
because your man was touching me.

808
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:46,420
Conversation doesn't have to involve hands

809
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:47,580
or picking people up.

810
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:49,140
Keep your man away from my man.

811
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:49,980
Deal.

812
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:54,060
Harvey's still holding Elden up in the air

813
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:56,900
and Elden's feet are twiddling back and forth

814
00:37:56,900 --> 00:38:01,060
and he is staring directly into Harvey's eyes

815
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:02,980
and making a choice.

816
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:06,420
And then his eyes kind of soften.

817
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,760
I don't wanna hurt you.

818
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:13,340
Harvey laughs as he sets him back down on the ground.

819
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:15,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm sure you don't.

820
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:17,100
I certainly do not.

821
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:19,460
There's a little bit in Harvey that's like,

822
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:20,940
what, what, what, what?

823
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:25,020
So Elden Ring has a 90 in Intimidate.

824
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:29,660
Also probably people don't talk back to Harvey much at all.

825
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:31,060
I was gonna say I have an 80.

826
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:37,960
Just two very strong-willed minds staring at each other.

827
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:39,780
That's cool.

828
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:42,260
Elden, do you have our invitations?

829
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:47,260
He kind of pats at his chest softly and slowly

830
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:52,380
before grabbing the invitations out of his trouser pocket.

831
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:56,900
Yeah, I mean, you can scurry in out of the cold.

832
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:59,580
The snow is getting a bit heavier at this stage.

833
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:02,980
You can see that the chauffeurs, having dropped people off,

834
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:05,060
are running over to one of the outbuildings

835
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:08,080
where it looks like they've got their own party in progress,

836
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,300
just on the other side of the courtyard.

837
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:15,300
But the main doors of the manor house are open

838
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:18,060
and there's a maid there.

839
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:19,620
Oh, in fact, there are a few maids there

840
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:22,100
who seem to be ushering guests in in shifts

841
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,460
and taking their coats.

842
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:26,780
And yeah, there's a uniformed maid who comes up

843
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:30,140
and looks around at the bunch of you and says,

844
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:32,500
can I take your coats?

845
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,720
Looks at Elden and blinks.

846
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:39,260
And on cue, I could pull the drawstring

847
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,660
coming out of his butt.

848
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:42,120
The warmth is inside me.

849
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:46,480
Very good, sir.

850
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,280
Checkers hands his coat over

851
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:52,720
and then grabs a bunch of pamphlets out of the pocket

852
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,680
as he's handing it over, puts them in his pocket.

853
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,440
Elden Ring gets really serious

854
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,680
as Checkers hands over his coat and is like,

855
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:05,360
do not misplace the master's coat.

856
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:07,120
Yeah, I just bought it.

857
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:10,880
It was expensive, so put it in a special place.

858
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,960
The maid now carrying those, the three coats,

859
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,280
is standing there looking at the bunch of you

860
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,840
wishing to get a word in edgeways.

861
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:20,040
She eventually says, if you make your way

862
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,840
over to the ballroom, and she points out

863
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:24,320
from under all the coats, a set of double doors

864
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,760
that are open just over on your left.

865
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:31,120
The hallway that you're in is fairly large.

866
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,040
There's a chandelier overhead

867
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,840
because of course the fuck he is.

868
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:39,840
And I mean, certainly Lafayette knows

869
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:42,280
from his previous visits to the mount

870
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:47,280
that while Mordent has money, money doesn't buy taste

871
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:53,160
and the furnishings, some of them are quite nice pieces,

872
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:57,400
but he has no eye for how things go together.

873
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:02,040
The decor is generally tacky

874
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:04,880
for people who've got genuine taste.

875
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,800
My God, Harvey, look at that chandelier.

876
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,400
I know, it's gorgeous, isn't it?

877
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:14,840
Oh, Harvey, he's a simple man.

878
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,560
No, it's quite hideous, actually.

879
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,600
I tell you what, if I ever got this kind of money,

880
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,560
I'd do it up like this.

881
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,800
Look at this, this is the lap of luxury here.

882
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,360
You're a kind man, Harvey.

883
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,720
Thank you for watching after me.

884
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,200
If you think this is luxurious,

885
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,680
you should see our joint.

886
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:35,240
No, we are not spending time together this evening.

887
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:39,480
We are moving, why are you still right next to us?

888
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,560
It's a party, it's a party.

889
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:45,280
Yes, Eldon, so please, please go mingle.

890
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,320
Eldon, the suitcase guy, he's off the list,

891
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:51,400
but his friend, he seems like somebody we could get.

892
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:57,360
Spend tonight pestering and harassing my man.

893
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:00,400
Correct, we will be having pleasant conversation

894
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,720
about the last branch and all the good that we're doing.

895
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:06,400
You seem like a guy that wants to do big things.

896
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,600
Come now, Harvey, come along, come, Harvey.

897
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,880
Well, we'll have chandeliers like this eventually.

898
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,960
Harvey dutifully just follows Lafayette.

899
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,040
Remember the chandeliers.

900
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:14,880
Chandeliers.

901
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:21,880
Eldon, the famous actress that we're looking for,

902
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:24,360
I know her name, but do you remember it?

903
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,240
I love Test's master.

904
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,600
Yes, her name is Candace Germain.

905
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,320
Correct, let's find her.

906
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:35,320
And he motions his head forward for some sort of physical.

907
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:40,200
Before we start splitting, are we in party town now?

908
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,040
Is there?

909
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,680
Are we in party town?

910
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,520
Yes, Harvey, you may have one drink.

911
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:52,160
So yes, you've come in through this rather grand hallway

912
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,160
and there are corridors branching off

913
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,280
in a few different directions.

914
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:58,040
You can see that there are other sets of double doors

915
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:01,240
around here that are obviously going into other rooms

916
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:03,480
that may be off limits to you.

917
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:08,320
There's a staircase going up to the upstairs, obviously,

918
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:13,320
but all the action seems to be in the ballroom.

919
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:17,440
You're ushered through the double doors there

920
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:21,960
to this fairly grand looking room.

921
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:24,160
Doesn't really have much in the way of furniture

922
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,960
in it at the moment because it is a ballroom.

923
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:30,000
It's got a few side tables set up with snacks and drinks

924
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,000
and there are uniform staff wandering around with trays,

925
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,840
again, with refreshments on them.

926
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:41,640
There are a few dozen people in attendance.

927
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:45,120
It's quite a large ballroom and maybe the guest list

928
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:47,240
is very exclusive or maybe a number of people

929
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:49,760
just plain haven't turned up.

930
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:53,160
But I mean, the party is relatively lively,

931
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:56,160
but it's not exactly jumping, it's not packed.

932
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:59,000
There is a stage that is set up

933
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,120
over in front of the front window.

934
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:03,400
And you can see a few things there.

935
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:06,440
One, the most obvious thing is there is a live band

936
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:09,840
that is playing there, a live swing band.

937
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:13,760
And there is just off to the side of the stage as well

938
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:16,760
and some bulky shapes, boxy shapes

939
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:20,560
that are covered by sheets or a tarpaulin.

940
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:23,000
What kind of size is that covered thing?

941
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:26,880
Fairly large, maybe about the size of a car.

942
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,920
I mean, it probably doesn't take much to work out

943
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:34,440
that it roughly corresponds to where you saw the cable

944
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:37,160
come down from the aerial outside.

945
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:39,480
But yeah, as I said, there are a few dozen people

946
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:42,840
mingling around, a few of them dancing.

947
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:46,640
A number of them not dancing, but certainly having drinks

948
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:49,640
and talking or shouting at each other over the music.

949
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:53,240
Harvey wants to do his job as a bodyguard to Lafayette.

950
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:54,880
When we walk in the room, just kind of clock it,

951
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:56,200
see if there's anything that could maybe

952
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:57,320
pose a threat to him.

953
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:00,920
Okay, I'll tell you what, give me a psychology roll

954
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:03,000
to get a general read of the crowd.

955
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:08,600
Oh shoot, it's a fail, a 67 on a 50.

956
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:11,400
Well, I mean, you could either spend 17 points of luck

957
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:14,600
or if you want, you could find some way of pushing it.

958
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:17,760
I mean, if you can think of a way of escalating

959
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:20,040
the situation and potentially putting yourself at risk

960
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:22,920
while assessing threats, I'd be open to that.

961
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:25,880
You could probably get a better vantage point

962
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:27,520
if you're on the chandelier.

963
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:28,360
Yeah.

964
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:34,560
Actually, could I maybe go and put myself up on stage

965
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,240
to look down from the stage?

966
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,360
Oh, okay, yeah, I mean, you could try.

967
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:41,600
Yeah, I mean, there is a little set of wooden stairs

968
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:43,640
up to the side that you could go on.

969
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:45,760
Like I say, there is a full swing band up there

970
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:49,200
who are very much in the midst of a song, but...

971
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:53,200
Yep, so Harvey's gonna bumble his way up there.

972
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:56,720
Okay, yeah, I think if you fail the push here,

973
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:00,440
you'll get to attract all sorts of the wrong attention.

974
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,680
I pass, a 21 on a 50.

975
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:09,800
Fantastic, so you get a rough read

976
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:13,000
of the kinds of people who are in the room.

977
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:17,640
There are a few people who are obviously moneyed.

978
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:20,600
You can tell from their clothes, from their mannerisms

979
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:22,560
that, yeah, there are definitely

980
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,440
a few movers and shakers here.

981
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:26,360
Lafayette has like snuck up behind,

982
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:30,280
like he followed Harvey very poorly,

983
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:31,920
kind of like crouched down behind him,

984
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,680
and he's like, tell me what you see.

985
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:35,640
He pokes out behind him on the stage and he's like,

986
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:38,240
oh, I see some of my cousins here, this is...

987
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:41,080
I didn't wanna see.

988
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:42,280
You can see a few other people

989
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:44,920
who don't necessarily fit the same mold,

990
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:49,560
and there's something about the slightly more worn

991
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:54,560
looking clothing and general introvertedness

992
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:57,840
that makes you think that they're probably academics.

993
00:46:57,840 --> 00:46:59,880
Then there are a few other people

994
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:01,240
who just don't seem to fit in.

995
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:05,280
You do spot, I don't know whether you heard

996
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,400
the others mentioning Candace Germaine earlier,

997
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,920
but I mean, you certainly do spot her in the crowd

998
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:13,040
and you may have seen some of her films.

999
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:16,080
She seems to be in deep conversation at the moment

1000
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:21,080
with a fairly good looking man in clerical garb

1001
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:24,840
wearing a black shirt and a dog collar,

1002
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:27,880
who, you know, the two of them

1003
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:30,120
are in very animated conversation.

1004
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:32,120
Do I clock Mordant in the room?

1005
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:36,040
No, looking around, Mordant isn't there.

1006
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:36,880
Okay.

1007
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:39,040
Which may strike you as being a bit odd.

1008
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:41,680
You know, we got the usual sword here, boss.

1009
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:43,040
We got the real money,

1010
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:45,920
we got the guys who are more like you, the thinkers,

1011
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,160
and it looks like there's a,

1012
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:51,480
you seen that picture show, Last Train to Clarksville?

1013
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:53,640
That's Candace Germaine right there.

1014
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:55,720
Good God, Candace Germaine is in here.

1015
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:57,680
A true beauty.

1016
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:58,720
Where'd you say you saw her?

1017
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,440
Well, we're not there, but.

1018
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:01,800
Yeah, when we look behind

1019
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:03,440
and you're crouched down behind me.

1020
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:08,440
I turn around and Eldon parts his hair.

1021
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:12,600
I'd love to think as well that you're kind of

1022
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:16,160
in between the guitarist and the bassist of the swing band

1023
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,280
and the two of them are just stepping around you

1024
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:20,920
as they're doing their act, trying not to tread on you.

1025
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,960
We're becoming real quick pals here, huh?

1026
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:26,680
Don't step on any wires.

1027
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:28,520
No, that is do not step on any wires

1028
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:29,880
because there's something very strange

1029
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:34,720
going on here tonight with all of his wires.

1030
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:38,560
I haven't noticed anything, but.

1031
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,720
Cicero is up to something.

1032
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:44,600
Master Checkers, that's Candace Germaine right there

1033
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:46,760
that they were pointing and talking about,

1034
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:48,160
talking to the cleric man.

1035
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,560
I pull out a pamphlet and look at Eldon

1036
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:52,680
and I just kind of nod at him.

1037
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:53,720
Bring her to me.

1038
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,320
Well, yeah, as he's saying that,

1039
00:48:57,320 --> 00:49:00,400
she breaks off conversation with the vicar or the priest

1040
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:04,200
or whatever he is and she walks over

1041
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:06,200
and starts talking to someone else.

1042
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:10,360
So was Eldon going over to join the conversation?

1043
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:13,160
I was trying to get the more charismatic

1044
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:15,280
or good looking one to start the conversation.

1045
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:18,520
We kind of have a thing where if we can isolate someone,

1046
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:22,480
we can slowly work them down into joining us.

1047
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,200
So is it Checkers who's going over?

1048
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:26,840
Checkers heads on over to Ms. Germaine.

1049
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:30,600
Yeah, she's there talking to an older man,

1050
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:33,120
looks like he's probably in his late 50s,

1051
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:35,840
dressed in a three piece suit.

1052
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:37,680
He's fairly jowdy.

1053
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,640
He's got red features,

1054
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:45,480
a few broken veins across his face and ruby eyes

1055
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,880
and the two of them seem to be

1056
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:50,440
just making small talk as you come up.

1057
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:53,080
Or you could give me an education roll

1058
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:55,320
to see what they can recognize who the man is.

1059
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:58,560
That's a pass, 43 on a 70.

1060
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:00,120
Okay, yeah, you recognize the man

1061
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:01,400
from some newspaper articles

1062
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:03,840
who's seen as Charlton Billings.

1063
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:05,840
He's a Senator from Vermont.

1064
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:09,400
I go to him first, Senator, nice to see you.

1065
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:12,760
My name is, you can just call me Checkers.

1066
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:16,160
And I reach my hand out to shake his hand.

1067
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,200
Well, he gives you a warm handshake

1068
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:23,200
and says Checkers, just the one name then.

1069
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:26,040
Right, it's what my friends call me in.

1070
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:27,240
We're all friends here.

1071
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:29,080
Oh, I hope so, I hope so.

1072
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:32,200
I hope I can count on your vote next year.

1073
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:34,840
Absolutely, I actually have a friend here with me

1074
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:38,400
who may not be so inclined to vote for you,

1075
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:41,040
but maybe you could go convince him.

1076
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:43,400
And I gesture at Eldon.

1077
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:47,120
Eldon is in an enclave of this room already,

1078
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:48,920
like away from the crowd.

1079
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:52,000
And he's just staring through his parted hair

1080
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,480
across the party.

1081
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:57,760
He has some very serious feelings about

1082
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:59,440
Senator things.

1083
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:05,640
The Senator looks over at Eldon,

1084
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:09,400
kind of looks him up and down and looks back at you.

1085
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,400
Fucking Oren from Parks and Rec.

1086
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:16,400
That's exactly who it is.

1087
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:19,120
He says, are you sure he votes?

1088
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:24,120
Only when he really loves or hates something.

1089
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,920
And he's got strong feelings.

1090
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:34,320
And then I wink at him and I want to roll charm.

1091
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:35,280
Okay, yeah.

1092
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:37,520
That's a three.

1093
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,840
Oh, it's a really good wink.

1094
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:42,960
He says, well, a voter's a voter, I suppose.

1095
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:47,400
And he turns and marches over towards Eldon.

1096
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:48,680
God help him.

1097
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:49,840
Candace.

1098
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:53,480
And I do like the European kiss the cheeks greeting.

1099
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:55,200
Ah, checkers, you made it.

1100
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:57,080
I'm here, thank you for the invite.

1101
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:59,960
You can see that she's looking a bit ruddy

1102
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:01,320
and swaying a bit.

1103
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:04,440
The party hasn't been going for that long,

1104
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:06,640
but it looks like she's quite drunk already.

1105
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:07,840
Does she have a drink in her hand?

1106
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:09,000
Oh, absolutely, yeah.

1107
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,760
Oh, let me take that from you.

1108
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:12,640
It's, I'll hold it for you.

1109
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,400
And I grab the like martini

1110
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:16,000
and I just like drink the rest of it

1111
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,400
and hand her back an empty glass.

1112
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:20,520
She looks at you and pats you on the shoulder.

1113
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:21,680
That's what I do with Luke sometimes.

1114
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:24,400
Oh, it's all right, I can get another.

1115
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,520
Oh, that's probably good.

1116
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:27,400
You're probably good.

1117
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:30,720
No, no, no, she says, it's all right, it's all right.

1118
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:34,920
Give me a moment.

1119
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:36,760
I'll pay a visit to the ladies room

1120
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:40,400
and powder my nose if you know what I mean.

1121
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,640
And I'm sure I'll be fine after that.

1122
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:43,480
Cocaine.

1123
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:45,680
I sure do know what you mean.

1124
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:46,880
Perfect, well.

1125
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:48,840
You're welcome to join me if you want.

1126
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:50,760
Sure.

1127
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:51,600
Yay.

1128
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,920
We got cocaine into this campaign.

1129
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:01,080
Our perfect record is untouched.

1130
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:06,280
If Eldon or Checkers had looked up

1131
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:07,360
at any point in that time,

1132
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:10,680
they would have seen Lafayette and Harvey slipping out

1133
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:12,480
of the main ballroom,

1134
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,840
trying to follow some of these wires

1135
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:17,800
and some of the weird mechanical things

1136
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:18,800
that he's seeing here.

1137
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:21,320
Okay, so basically you're heading out the front

1138
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:22,920
to where that aerial was.

1139
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:23,760
Yeah.

1140
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:26,120
As you see Checkers and Candace walk into the bathroom,

1141
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:29,200
he's like grabbing like champagne off the waiters,

1142
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,120
like things and just like downing it

1143
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:33,320
because he's actually never done drugs

1144
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:34,480
and he's very nervous.

1145
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,560
This is a big get for your cult.

1146
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:39,680
Oh yeah, huge.

1147
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:40,960
Also you're 19.

1148
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:43,280
I'm underage drinking.

1149
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:45,160
The movie star just asked you to go to the bathroom

1150
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:47,840
to get cocaine, which is pretty cool.

1151
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:49,880
I assume she's probably,

1152
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:51,960
is she like a late twenties actress

1153
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:53,160
or is she like established?

1154
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:54,160
It's 1937.

1155
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:56,320
Yeah, no, she's a few years older than you

1156
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:57,360
but not a lot older.

1157
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:58,600
Okay, cool.

1158
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:03,600
You find a bathroom and she cuts a few lines for you

1159
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:08,920
and just makes a bit of small talk and says,

1160
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:10,360
do you manage to get here all right?

1161
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:12,040
Well, of course you managed to get here all right

1162
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:13,640
because you're here, aren't you?

1163
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:17,240
Sorry, I don't know where my head is today

1164
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:18,520
and snorts another line.

1165
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:24,120
You know, sometimes parties can be a little overwhelming

1166
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:26,640
and then he looks at the lines of coke

1167
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:28,160
on the bathroom counter

1168
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:30,840
and not knowing the protocol for this,

1169
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:33,680
he does all the rest of the lines of cocaine.

1170
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:37,440
We're gonna need you to roll a con check

1171
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,880
to make sure you don't die.

1172
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:40,120
This is a new one that we're trying out

1173
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:42,000
where when you actually do drugs in the game,

1174
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,600
you have to do drugs as the player.

1175
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:44,720
We're method playing.

1176
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:47,680
So give us about two and a half hours

1177
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:52,680
while we go find some cocaine and we'll be right back.

1178
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:56,280
Candace smiles at checkers as he does

1179
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:58,560
the last three lines single-handedly

1180
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:01,760
and says, oh my, aren't you a hungry little boy?

1181
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:08,200
I'm not that little, he says with his 40 size.

1182
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:13,280
Oh my God, I didn't realize where my tiny was.

1183
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:14,920
I've got a big personality.

1184
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:17,160
If 40 size is good enough for Charlie Manson,

1185
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:18,600
it's good enough for you.

1186
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:19,440
Exactly.

1187
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:26,320
Candace, have you thought any more

1188
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:29,360
about our last conversation about last branch

1189
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:31,560
and maybe be in the face of it?

1190
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:33,200
Yes, yes.

1191
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:34,560
Though, I don't know.

1192
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:37,480
I think I may have other commitments now.

1193
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:39,880
I think I'm going to be employed

1194
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:43,000
to help promote Cicero's new invention.

1195
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,880
Our deal wouldn't necessarily be exclusive.

1196
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:48,280
You know, you could, it could just be something

1197
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:50,440
you mentioned when you do everything else that you do.

1198
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:54,040
Oh, maybe, but this has got to take up all my time.

1199
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:55,720
It's got to change the world, you know.

1200
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:57,720
What is his invention?

1201
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:59,960
She looks confused for a moment.

1202
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:03,040
It's got to change the world.

1203
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:05,840
Well, you know, maybe we could go talk to him.

1204
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:07,520
Maybe you could introduce me to him.

1205
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:08,880
I haven't met him yet either.

1206
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:10,880
I don't know where he is.

1207
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:15,120
Oh, she roots through her purse a bit and says,

1208
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:17,320
and that was the last of the cocaine.

1209
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:20,480
Oh, but I suppose someone else here must have some.

1210
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:22,280
Do you think you could find some more for me?

1211
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:23,800
I'm sure I could, yeah.

1212
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:25,080
I'll look around.

1213
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:28,840
In the meantime, he pulls out a piece of paper

1214
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:32,360
and you can tell it's like a crudely drawn up contract.

1215
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:34,720
And he...

1216
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:37,160
It's like stick figures and it's like,

1217
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:38,680
just him giving her the paper

1218
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:40,280
and the paper says your soul.

1219
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:44,080
No, basically it's like a contract he's written up

1220
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:46,720
to have her be kind of like the spokesperson

1221
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:48,440
for the last branch.

1222
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:50,000
And he hands it to her, he's like,

1223
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:54,040
real quick while I go look for more fun,

1224
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:55,960
just sign this at the bottom here.

1225
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:58,560
Well, I'll get my lawyer to look at it

1226
00:56:58,560 --> 00:56:59,520
and send it back to you.

1227
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:02,040
Oh, we don't need, I studied,

1228
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:03,640
I took a couple law classes.

1229
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:04,480
She laughs.

1230
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:05,800
It's a pretty good contract.

1231
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:08,400
She laughs and playfully punches you in the shoulder

1232
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:11,720
and says, after all the things that happened with the MGM,

1233
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:14,160
my lawyer told me never to sign anything again

1234
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:15,280
without talking to him.

1235
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:16,120
Yeah.

1236
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:19,400
Checkers figured that this was coming,

1237
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:21,720
but he had to take his chance anyway.

1238
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:24,360
So he grabs the contract back, folds it up

1239
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:25,920
and he's like, okay, well,

1240
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:28,480
I'll talk to you when I find more.

1241
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:29,320
Yes, yes, yes.

1242
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:31,480
But don't forget cocaine.

1243
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:33,880
Right, right, I'm on it.

1244
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:36,320
And he leaves the bathroom and it's in his mind,

1245
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:39,240
but it really, he isn't gonna actively be looking

1246
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:41,080
for drugs.

1247
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:44,120
Oh, she's got to be so disbunched in you.

1248
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:49,440
He's also like experiencing cocaine for the first time ever

1249
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:53,160
and he's stoked and scared to death.

1250
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:54,480
And in like 20 minutes,

1251
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:56,120
he's gonna be looking for more cocaine.

1252
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:57,440
Yes, absolutely.

1253
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:03,760
Okay, well, let's cut back to Lafayette

1254
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:08,160
and Harvey as they're heading outside in the snow.

1255
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:09,960
And now without your coats,

1256
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:12,280
you can appreciate just how cold it is out there.

1257
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:15,280
The snow's coming down quite heavily now.

1258
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:18,560
But you can see, yeah, there is this thick wire

1259
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:20,640
that's coming through the wall.

1260
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:23,560
In fact, it's like a bunch of cables

1261
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:25,200
that have been bound together

1262
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:28,240
that are going up to this aerial.

1263
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:32,440
Lafayette gives that wire an expert and knowledgeable lick.

1264
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:38,240
I'm giving the cold temperature out here.

1265
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,800
A little Christmas story going on.

1266
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:44,200
Oh, God.

1267
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:45,800
Do you want to give me a luck roll

1268
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:48,600
to see whether your tongue ends up frozen to the cables?

1269
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:52,360
My name is David Ellington.

1270
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:54,880
My God, Harvey, I've made quite a bit thick.

1271
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,400
Pass, 17 on a 55.

1272
00:58:58,400 --> 00:58:59,400
Okay, yeah.

1273
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:01,360
I mean, you pull it away just in time

1274
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:04,080
so you can feel the ice crystals falling across.

1275
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:06,800
The main thing the cable tastes of is cold.

1276
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:09,560
He makes a note of that.

1277
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:13,640
I actually said that at a wine tasting one time.

1278
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:15,200
Everyone's looking at me weird.

1279
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:19,320
But looking at it,

1280
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:22,240
yeah, I mean, you passed your engineering role earlier,

1281
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:24,280
so I won't ask you to roll again.

1282
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:25,320
So looking at this,

1283
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:30,080
you're fairly certain that this is a power cable.

1284
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:32,480
In fact, it looks like it's designed

1285
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:35,520
to carry quite a lot of power,

1286
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:38,600
but it's just going up to this aerial contraption,

1287
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:41,480
which doesn't really make a lot of sense to you.

1288
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:43,120
And you can see as well

1289
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:45,560
that the aerial is pointing in the direction

1290
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:48,040
of that wooden tower

1291
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:52,800
that you saw across on the outskirts of the compound.

1292
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:59,120
Is there anywhere I can unplug it, this power source?

1293
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:02,200
Not without tools, not easily.

1294
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:05,160
I mean, you could try just ripping it out,

1295
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:08,880
but this is like industrial cabling.

1296
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:11,240
If you're going to try to sabotage it like that,

1297
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:15,680
it would require, yeah, for a start, tools, a bit of time.

1298
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:18,360
You probably need a ladder to get up there.

1299
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:19,360
I mean, it's not impossible.

1300
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:21,880
It's just under the circumstances a bit tricky.

1301
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:24,680
So he gives it a few very honest tugs.

1302
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:27,440
He's honestly trying to unplug it.

1303
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:29,200
But when he realizes it's going nowhere,

1304
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:30,800
he sets it down and he's like,

1305
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:33,400
only joking, Harvey, we don't want to win that way.

1306
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:40,000
Do I have a sense of what any of this could be for?

1307
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,240
Do you have the weird science, pulp talent?

1308
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:44,080
I do.

1309
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:47,680
Okay, you made your engineering role earlier.

1310
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:50,920
Yeah, you don't know entirely for sure.

1311
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:55,000
You'd have to go and take a look at what's in that tower

1312
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,680
to tell for sure.

1313
01:00:56,680 --> 01:00:58,840
But there's something nagging your way

1314
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:00,880
at the back of your brain.

1315
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:03,840
You're thinking of some of the wilder designs

1316
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:06,760
that Nikola Tesla came up with.

1317
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:11,760
And this looks maybe like it's designed

1318
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:14,880
for the wireless transmission of electricity.

1319
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:19,400
Harvey, this isn't normal science.

1320
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:21,600
You turn and Harvey's licking the wire that you...

1321
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:24,360
Harvey, you fool.

1322
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:26,120
There's nothing to learn from that,

1323
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:27,480
but that it tastes of cold.

1324
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:30,000
That's exactly what I was going to say.

1325
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,000
It tastes like cold.

1326
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:33,120
Harvey, please listen.

1327
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:34,480
This is terribly important.

1328
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:38,040
Again, this is not normal science.

1329
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:40,160
How are we talking?

1330
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:48,040
I didn't know a body could be hollow

1331
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:53,040
before its blood ran cold.

1332
01:01:55,680 --> 01:02:00,680
I didn't know that the wind could sew

1333
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:07,400
the tissue and fagged bone.

1334
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:14,600
You were hollow when you spoke to me.

1335
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:20,600
Hollow when you sang.

1336
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:27,720
I thought you might be starving.

1337
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:34,200
So I gave you everything.

1338
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:41,960
Thought you were hollow.

1339
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:47,960
Thorns and rocks and devils' clothes

1340
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:52,960
and briars and dry-baked clay.

1341
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:56,960
Crocus blossoms in February

1342
01:02:56,960 --> 01:03:01,960
and Dalian in May.

1343
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:06,960
Time between a mother's fingers

1344
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:10,960
and spit off a bridge.

1345
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:16,960
Restless legs at 3 p.m.

1346
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:20,960
while waiting for a fix.

1347
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:46,960
So come back here

1348
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:08,960
and see what's left of me.

1349
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:14,960
Is this the wholesome girl you left in Missouri?

1350
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:23,960
My voice is nothing now

1351
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:28,960
but the howl of the wind

1352
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:33,960
come closer to my teeth

1353
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:38,960
rattling my jaw.

1354
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:42,960
Come closer dear

1355
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:46,960
you might see

1356
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:51,960
rattling my jaw.
