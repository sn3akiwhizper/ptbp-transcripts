1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,540
Hey all you cool dogs and puppas, it's your best friend Oh Wharf the dog, and I am here

2
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:14,940
to receive all the belly rubs live on 694.2 PTBP.

3
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:21,700
If you rub my tummy, make sure you wear some kind of gloves that you can dispose of, because

4
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:29,500
otherwise you will obtain a scent on you that you will never get rid of, and a stickiness

5
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:30,500
and ooze.

6
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:35,900
I've been told I have a superglue-like secretion.

7
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:41,280
This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from at Mike Fardy, who tweeted about the show and tagged

8
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:49,400
that pretending pod they write, to Wolf the dog, from Mike Fardy and the Wonders and Blunders

9
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,060
podcast.

10
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:56,060
Dearest Wolf the dog, I can't hold back my feelings any longer.

11
00:00:56,060 --> 00:01:04,860
Your gravely tones, your otherworldly fluting echoes, your got-dang thickness, may the light

12
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:10,820
of the blood moon guide you to me like I'm a dumpster full of night meat.

13
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:17,420
Much love from Wonders and Blunders, a fellow horror comedy actual play podcast, and good

14
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:20,100
luck to those contention boys.

15
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,780
End transmission.

16
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:28,860
Well, thanks Mike Fardy and the Wonders and Blunders podcast, but I am spoken for at the

17
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:29,860
moment.

18
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:35,980
There's a trash can named Teresa that I spend a lot of my time with these days.

19
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:42,100
She never asks for nothing, yet provides endless bounty for me and my loins.

20
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:48,820
But if me and Teresa ever break things off, which we never will, I will definitely keep

21
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:51,180
you in mind.

22
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,900
Maybe, but probably not.

23
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:58,020
There's a long list of suitors out there for little old Wolfie.

24
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:02,580
Remember, if you want to holla at your old wolf, use the screen you're already staring

25
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:07,300
at half the day and put something nasty out in the world with a tag for your dirtiest

26
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:14,740
dog at pretending pod, or write a review on Apple podcasts and tag us in the proof.

27
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:20,340
That's the goodest, and speaking of having nice things, you can find more tasty content

28
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:27,500
to devour in these less than delicious times over at patreon.com slash pretending pod.

29
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,820
And one more thing.

30
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:35,100
If you've listened this far, you very likely know about the subreddit and discord communities,

31
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:40,300
but I just want to say from the bottom of my stinky, greasy heart, it's a joy to watch

32
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:47,540
these internet nooks and crannies blossom into havens of silly and supportive solidarity.

33
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:56,700
Now time to get serious, because this episode is so, so very serious, seriously.

34
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:02,540
Now listen here you, I can't speak too loudly about this, but I heard this episode is not

35
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,140
very serious.

36
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:09,260
Seems like the producer was worried about becoming accustomed to remote playing before

37
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:13,140
jumping back into the main story.

38
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:19,100
Now remember to sit in those questions on the subreddit named episode 74, which it will

39
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:24,080
clearly not be, as this right here is episode 74.

40
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,060
Now let's get serious, my dear sweet innocent pups.

41
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:33,660
By the time you hear the intro to this song for the second time ever, you will know the

42
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:37,300
fate of the golden retriever called Bean.

43
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:46,100
It's kudzu with no backbow.

44
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:23,220
Howdy folks, I just wanted to drop in real quick to say we recorded this episode to give

45
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:29,540
us more time to field questions for next week's plot talk, and also to give me more time to

46
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:32,260
prep for this upcoming story arc.

47
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:36,420
Now on top of that, I figured it wouldn't hurt to get some more practice in with this

48
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:42,060
whole remote recording thing before we jump back into the nitty gritty good stuff, especially

49
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:45,300
with the mishap last week with Thomas' gain controls.

50
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,760
Well don't worry, we fucked it up again.

51
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:54,440
This time Luke and Thomas had their audio sent crisp and clear to the zoom call, however

52
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:59,460
they accidentally recorded their tracks with their laptop microphones instead.

53
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:05,660
I have edited this session, and I believe it is quite listenable and even, dare I say,

54
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:11,980
enjoyable, but it is not up to our standards for audio quality, and so we are using this

55
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:18,580
as a learning opportunity, and we are adding another clearly overlooked but important task

56
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:22,060
to our pre-recording checklists.

57
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:27,820
Thank you, each of you, for listening and supporting this show, it means so, so much

58
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:28,820
to me.

59
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,460
Boy howdy, we'll get it next week I bet.

60
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,380
Everybody clap on four and eight.

61
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:41,520
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, wonderful.

62
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,820
Thank you all so much for coming here today.

63
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:44,820
You're welcome.

64
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:49,700
I miss our finest of eves, here on Pretending to be People.

65
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:52,460
How's everybody doing out there?

66
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:55,100
Doing about as good as you can hope, you know?

67
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,620
I'm doing alright.

68
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:02,580
Luke said he was hitting negative six, so he probably needs to turn his gain down.

69
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:03,580
Uh, hold on.

70
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:04,580
Tattle.

71
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:07,980
If I'm talking normal, I'm hitting like around 18 to 12.

72
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:11,980
That's where I was last, well yeah, that's where I am now I guess.

73
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,220
Where's your gain turned to?

74
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:19,100
Hey, if the gain was an island, what time is your gain turned to?

75
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,100
About one o'clock.

76
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,660
If your gain was an island, which was the face of the clock.

77
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,140
I think you're probably good, man.

78
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:27,260
If you have a sundial.

79
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:30,460
If you have a sundial.

80
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:34,780
Now if you have a sundial, brother.

81
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,580
This is my character, by the way.

82
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:37,580
Oh good.

83
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:43,080
You might not be able to tell time on a foggy day.

84
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:47,580
So let's get right into this, because it's already nighttime.

85
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:51,220
The sun has been down for a minute at this point.

86
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:55,180
The premise that I sent you all.

87
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,620
I think we got it this time.

88
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,620
I hope so.

89
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,620
Maybe.

90
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:04,620
I'll go ahead and hit record now.

91
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:05,620
Is this recording?

92
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:06,620
Speed.

93
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:07,620
Fuck.

94
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:15,380
Um, the premise that I sent you all for tonight's recording session is as follows.

95
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:19,620
You all choose an animal you'd like to be.

96
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:23,860
Bean was a revered member of the Contention Critter Coalition.

97
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:29,020
The leader, a wise squirrel, is calling out to those who have survived by joining the

98
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:33,140
newly founded Contention Creek Critter Coalition.

99
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:38,100
They need the most highly trained, well-balanced strike team ever assembled to go on a near

100
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:45,980
suicide mission to save Bean, the most thoughtful and caring creature in the whole coalition.

101
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:53,260
And to pull off this rescue, you'll have to avoid the black goo and some humans too.

102
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,980
First thoughts when you read that.

103
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:56,980
And don't be mean.

104
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:57,980
Ooh, boy!

105
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:01,580
No, Zach, but what's the real scenario we're doing?

106
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,420
Yeah, be serious.

107
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:07,260
Oh, there's like dead kids or something?

108
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,260
Good.

109
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,260
That's bad.

110
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:12,340
Oh, their bodies are filled with maggots and shit?

111
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,340
No, no, I do want to-

112
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,340
No, actual shit.

113
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,700
I do want to say everybody's body is filled with actual shit.

114
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,620
That's where shit comes from.

115
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:26,020
Have you read the famous book, Everybody Shits?

116
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,260
Near suicide mission.

117
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:32,140
It better be a near suicide mission because like we talked about on the Q&A episode, if

118
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:37,860
any of these animals die, we will hold you personally responsible.

119
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:41,460
If my character dies, I will destroy the podcast.

120
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,800
Yeah, I quit.

121
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,660
I quit if any of these animals die.

122
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:49,620
On your character sheet, under equipment, does it say plot armor?

123
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:50,620
Yes.

124
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:51,620
Yeah.

125
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:52,940
You told us all that.

126
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:56,500
It says I'm a cute animal and it would fucking suck.

127
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,340
It would be bad podcast.

128
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:02,980
It would be bad radio if you killed a bunch of animals.

129
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:03,980
You can do anything to-

130
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:08,940
I'm going to report you to PETA right now.

131
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,940
What if you do, though, die?

132
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,940
Let's just try not to die.

133
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:20,780
I think as soon as you start thinking about how you're going to describe an animal dying

134
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:28,420
violently, you'll realize that you shouldn't be doing that on air and you will-

135
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,300
Well, we'll see.

136
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:34,700
We will see how my opinions of children versus animals-

137
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,700
Oh my gosh.

138
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,420
Okay, I'm changing my character.

139
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:39,420
It's a cat named Ramona.

140
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,340
If I were crazy, then would you still-

141
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:47,340
That's my kryptonite.

142
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:53,740
I didn't want to keep singing.

143
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:54,740
Thank you.

144
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:59,740
All right, I'm going to hit record now.

145
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:03,420
Went ahead and backspaced on this recording.

146
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:11,620
It is a brisk December 5th here in contention, made all the more bleak by the necessity

147
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,220
of the water.

148
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:19,540
Numbed by the frigid waters or the cutting winds, this brutally arctic reality was far

149
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:22,140
greater than the alternative.

150
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:27,260
The contention critter coalition has made their home here in Coles Creek, the survivors

151
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:31,340
rebranding themselves as the contention critter- fuck.

152
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:34,300
The contention creek critter coalition.

153
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:40,660
Now are these animals who spell adorably wrong with Ks because then the first name is fucked

154
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,740
No, they're Cs.

155
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,180
It's always Cs, Thomas.

156
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:47,300
When there's three Cs in a row, it's Cs.

157
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:50,580
All my Cs are hard, dude.

158
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:57,860
They rebranded themselves as the contention creek critter coalition for accuracy and additional

159
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,380
alliteration.

160
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:03,860
The contention creek critter coalition has gathered to hear an announcement from its

161
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:11,860
esteemed leader and wisest member, the old grey squirrel called Stallone.

162
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,900
We are in an unprecedented time.

163
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:20,180
Look around, look at what's left of us.

164
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:24,340
Tired, empty, shivering, the enemy.

165
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:32,100
And they point to both banks of Coles Creek where masses of writhing black ooze sloppily

166
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:38,660
spill back and forth, attempting to nip at any animals near to the shore, but consistently

167
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:42,100
careful enough to avoid falling into the water.

168
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:50,580
The enemy is unknown, but its effect has a lasting effect on the memory.

169
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:56,420
Few here have survived without witnessing at least one close companion consumed by this

170
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:58,100
unspeakable foe.

171
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:06,180
But I hold high hopeful hearsay, our admirable, admirable and astonishingly astute ally, the

172
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:12,980
golden retriever called Bean is still alive, though he is trapped.

173
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:17,940
His person has continued to leave him locked in isolation.

174
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:21,940
The wish should be clear to everyone now that water is life.

175
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:27,380
Who among you are brave enough to take on this task?

176
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:34,820
To liberate Bean from his prison of a pin at Hotel Motel.

177
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:42,180
I volunteer and you see an old dog named Rusty.

178
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:49,620
He's not as fast or strong as he used to be, but he's still a big, good boy.

179
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:54,660
And I think he's probably been something of like a community organizer in these trying

180
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:55,380
times.

181
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,140
I will go find Beans.

182
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:58,420
Who is with me?

183
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:01,220
Well, if he's in, then I'm gonna be in.

184
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:06,900
And a woodpecker comes and lands on him and raises a wing up.

185
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:11,620
What do people know about this woodpecker?

186
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:18,180
Wilson the woodpecker, just a friendly guy about the coalition, almost like a like a

187
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:26,580
pigeon because he can carry messages between the creators of the coalition and he can understand

188
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:29,220
humans so he can feed them info.

189
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:34,820
So right off the bat, Stallone is like, Rusty and Wilson.

190
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,740
Yes, yes, of course.

191
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,500
Two of our finest.

192
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,020
And who else?

193
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:43,860
Who is willing to join these two brave souls?

194
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:45,700
Did you say Beans?

195
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,020
It's Bean that we're going after?

196
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:51,140
I'm in, I'm in.

197
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,580
I know Beans.

198
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,660
He's an old friend of mine.

199
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:55,940
Oh boy.

200
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,260
That characterization was great, but we were getting a lot of...

201
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,820
So what do we know about this character?

202
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,660
What do the other animals know?

203
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,940
And what is this name?

204
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:14,820
This is Tyler, and he's a black lab.

205
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:20,660
And he recently escaped his master, and he's on the run.

206
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:26,020
I don't want to interrupt our flow, but Joe, you're breaking up like crazy.

207
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:27,460
At least for me.

208
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,140
I don't know what to do about that.

209
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:31,540
Yeah, as long as it's not recording that way.

210
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:34,100
Okay, so that's our second dog.

211
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,780
Thomas, what kind of dog were you?

212
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:36,980
I didn't catch that.

213
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,020
Rusty is a mutt.

214
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:42,740
He's based off a dog I used to live with.

215
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:47,860
One of my roommate's dogs that she had fostered and then adopted.

216
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,780
He was a sweet, big old boy named Dracula.

217
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,700
Excellent name for a dog.

218
00:14:56,260 --> 00:15:02,580
And he was just a big gray, maybe like a shepherd lab mix.

219
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:03,460
A big gray.

220
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:05,700
A very old boy, a very sweet boy.

221
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:09,060
Inky bones, but a lot of heart.

222
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,980
My achy, breaky heart.

223
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,300
Tyler's a black lab, is that what you said?

224
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,500
Yep, that is correct.

225
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,700
And who is Tyler's owner?

226
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:22,180
I'll just say it.

227
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:25,060
It's Kerry pages from like our second episode.

228
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,900
Clark was tasked with finding this dog.

229
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,540
We thought it was fitting that Joe would play said dog.

230
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:36,660
And Justin, a coward or are you taking this for spot?

231
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:40,180
I'm taking this for a spot out of the shadows.

232
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,620
Yeah, I'm just like, no, I'm not playing.

233
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:42,900
I'm just going to hang out with you guys.

234
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:44,820
I'm just watching.

235
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,580
Kind of undermine Zach.

236
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:51,940
I just go back to Justin every 15 minutes to describe how cold the water is.

237
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:56,260
Yeah, he is an animal, but he just stays behind.

238
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,380
Yeah, I'm playing a character.

239
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,820
He's comfortable.

240
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,180
He's hanging out.

241
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:08,260
Uh, no, out of, out of the shadows steps, uh, a very small, but proud creature.

242
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,180
It's a little chipmunk.

243
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:15,060
Hey, I think y'all are going to need some leadership for this today.

244
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,820
I'm chip Montgomery.

245
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:17,620
Y'all know me.

246
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,460
Y'all know me really well.

247
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,100
Should have been president, but that's okay.

248
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,020
Some peoples ain't meant for leadership.

249
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:29,860
You may have gotten the majority vote, but I won in the electoral college.

250
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:31,060
Yeah, we know.

251
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:33,620
We know it's bullshit, but I'm here.

252
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:38,180
Cause y'all seem like you could use an old hand besides old rusty here.

253
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,220
My days are numbered.

254
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:42,340
Anyway, I don't think chipmunks are long for this world.

255
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:47,700
I did assume rusty might take some sort of leadership role, but he could also be more

256
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:52,900
of a spiritual, uh, counsel, uh, chip.

257
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:55,140
Montgomery has obviously seen some shit.

258
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,740
He's quite fat.

259
00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:04,340
Now his, uh, chipmunk for his grade over time, quite elderly, but still spry and full

260
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:04,980
of sass.

261
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:07,540
You're just rusty, but a chipmunk.

262
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:09,380
Maybe.

263
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:19,860
And as the four of you joined together, um, you try to figure out what differentiates

264
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:27,540
chip from rusty as looming in the background is this ooze that just kind of like follows

265
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:33,060
you, like mirrors your movements as, as you've grouped together up front near this, uh, this

266
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,580
elderly gray squirrel.

267
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:42,580
And he says to you, the first thing that you must do in front of everyone is figure out

268
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:44,260
how to get out of this Creek.

269
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:50,180
The black goo is everywhere and he watches, he watches our movements and he wants us.

270
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:52,100
Does the black goo have a smell?

271
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:56,180
Like what a dog who's, okay.

272
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:58,660
Well, I think we, we gotta get water on it, right?

273
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,780
How would animals do that?

274
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,420
Let's talk like we're animals.

275
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,020
You could get wet and shake it all.

276
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:05,380
Yeah.

277
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:12,660
Rusty, uh, rusty rolls around in the Creek, uh, and then stands right by the bed and gives

278
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:17,460
it a big old dog shake and just flashes water everywhere.

279
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,860
And does the, does the goo flee from the water?

280
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:20,660
Oh, absolutely.

281
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:21,140
It does.

282
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,900
Then Tyler's going to follow suit.

283
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,180
That looks like it works.

284
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:29,140
Chip Montgomery gets a little tiny like cap off of like a little nut and fills it with

285
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:35,460
water and tries to like fireman bucket on top of chip.

286
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,940
What I think you should do is hop on.

287
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:42,260
I think you shouldn't tell me what I'm supposed to be doing or not doing brother.

288
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:48,100
I, um, or at the end, I'm just, I'm just a spiritual counsel.

289
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:53,860
So this is just some sage advice, but, uh, perhaps you should hop on my back.

290
00:18:53,860 --> 00:19:01,220
And because, because I'm, I'm pretty old and weak, perhaps if Tyler, who is spry and I

291
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,900
believe very good at jumping.

292
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:03,060
Yeah.

293
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:03,300
Yeah.

294
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,180
Come on, come on, get on the back.

295
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:04,660
Get on my back.

296
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:05,460
Come on, get on my back.

297
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,060
You can use my collar as a, as a brains.

298
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:07,460
Come on.

299
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,740
No, no, here's, here's what's up.

300
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:12,980
You shake, you shake and clear a path.

301
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:17,140
So these old bones can take me and me and chip.

302
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:17,780
Oh, okay.

303
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:18,180
Sure.

304
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,500
And then you leap over the goo.

305
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:20,980
You got it.

306
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:21,860
And I do it.

307
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,300
I like take off.

308
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:28,020
I got my, I got my mission and I'm, I'm soaking down, wiggling out some water.

309
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:32,660
And if I can get to a point, is there a path out of this goo or is it, does it cover the

310
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:33,060
land?

311
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:36,020
I mean, is there, is there a space that this, oh yeah.

312
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:41,700
So it's just, it is formed lines near the land just far enough, like a far apart from

313
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:42,340
each other.

314
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:47,460
Like the lines, like at the, like, if you're like heading to the paint in basketball, you

315
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,580
got those lines.

316
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:49,860
Did that make any sense?

317
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,140
Am I making any sense?

318
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:56,420
So like six feet in between chunks of black goo and then past that.

319
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,700
Yeah, no, it's free land.

320
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:04,020
They are clearly, they want to consume, but they cannot get into the water.

321
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:04,580
Gotcha.

322
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:07,140
But an athletic dog could definitely clear the gap.

323
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:08,740
Oh, Tyler?

324
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:13,380
Are we talking about Tyler right now?

325
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:17,940
Also, Luke's just a bird, so he kind of put the screws to your whole game, Zach.

326
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,420
I fly over.

327
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:20,920
Yeah.

328
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:27,220
I actually had this idea in my mind when I was coming up with this, that the birds would

329
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:33,460
be like in a different group, like in a different gang that's not affected, like the privileged.

330
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:37,460
They still could be, but like Willie's just cool enough that he transcends clicks.

331
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:43,780
Yeah, I think Willie should let me ride on him because the imagery is very cool.

332
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,020
What is the Wilson, the woodpecker doing?

333
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:56,260
I fly over the goo and I'm like, okay, I'll be waiting over here for you guys.

334
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,220
Tyler's running.

335
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:01,620
If he can, if he can clear the path with one swoop, he would just run out there, shaggy,

336
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:04,980
shaggy dog it, and then there'd be a little path there that they can follow.

337
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:07,940
Otherwise he's running back and forth, getting more water on his body,

338
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:10,740
clearing a little bit more, coming back, clearing a little bit more.

339
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:15,940
Let's see if you need to be saved while you're being the hero by having you roll here.

340
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:22,900
So basically in order to fully get out of this mess, you're going to have to roll either

341
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:27,060
one of your special skills or dexterity, probably.

342
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,900
I've got a special skill of jumping.

343
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,180
He's a really good jumper.

344
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,380
He can leap over fences.

345
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,380
That's how he got out of his last yard.

346
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:33,620
Yeah.

347
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:39,860
So real quick explanation for how we're doing mechanics for this little one shot here.

348
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:46,660
We're using the six stats from Delta Green, which are somebody else, please.

349
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:52,500
There's strength, constitution, power, intelligence, dexterity, and charisma.

350
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:58,100
And I gave them the points of 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70.

351
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:58,420
Yep.

352
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:00,980
For those six, they got to put those wherever they wanted.

353
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:07,700
And then I said you guys could have two special abilities that would both be at 75%.

354
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:12,500
And I guess we'll figure out what those are as we play the game.

355
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,460
One of Joe's for Tyler is jumping.

356
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,620
So go ahead and roll, baby.

357
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,620
I pass a 40 on a 75.

358
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:26,180
40 on a 75 success.

359
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:32,260
So as you fully pushed through this barricade of black goo,

360
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:36,020
you can get rusty and chip up and through.

361
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:41,540
Like if this was red Rover, you know, you would have came all over past.

362
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,060
Jesus.

363
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,260
That's how that game is played.

364
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:51,060
And you broke the barricade.

365
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,740
You were red rocket.

366
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:59,700
Red rocket, red rocket.

367
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,580
I'm coming on.

368
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,260
And no one can stop me.

369
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:06,820
Oh boy.

370
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:07,780
We're in the Creek now.

371
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:14,260
And bounding over you've hit the main, uh, the main roadway

372
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,660
and contention that leads from the highway down.

373
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:21,860
You might not know this, uh, depending on how, uh, well-versed you guys are,

374
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:24,660
but you do know where hotel motel is.

375
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:28,820
As you have hung out with being a fair few times in the parking lot,

376
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:33,060
where he hosts, uh, anyone and everyone who just wants to come and chill

377
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:34,580
and have like a great time.

378
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:40,580
As long as his person remembers to leave the door unlocked for him.

379
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:45,460
So as you guys are crossing, I need, uh, let's see, how about I roll?

380
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:51,140
Um, I'm going to roll a D4 to see, uh, which one of you this affects.

381
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,660
And hopefully it's not Thomas.

382
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:56,660
Uh, let's see.

383
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:58,820
We'll do one is Luke.

384
00:23:58,820 --> 00:23:59,700
Two is Justin.

385
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,100
I'm here.

386
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,140
I'm just grabbing my guys.

387
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,860
Three is Thomas.

388
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,940
And four is Joe.

389
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,300
And this D4 says.

390
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:14,500
One Wilson, the woodpecker.

391
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,500
It's not a good thing as the four of you.

392
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:20,020
As the four of you.

393
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:22,820
I was deciding which one of your characters is really racist.

394
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,980
I would never make that kind of choice for you.

395
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:29,620
First off.

396
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,420
I would let you dig your own grip.

397
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:33,620
It's ironic.

398
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:36,500
And then promptly knock you straight off the podcast.

399
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:42,340
Luke, uh, you've got, uh, as Wilson, the woodpecker.

400
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:46,180
Are you flying or are you, uh, how, what is your mode of transport here?

401
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:48,020
Uh, am I in the group with them?

402
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,380
Like we're all together now?

403
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:55,300
Yeah, you've made it past the goo and the, uh, as you guys, as you guys rush through

404
00:24:55,300 --> 00:25:03,140
this line and make it through with the intense, uh, bouts of jumping and dexterity and just

405
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:08,900
really a lot of, um, a lot of flair as you guys jump through this area.

406
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:14,580
It's almost like, uh, like a horse, uh, jumping through a hoop made of fire is

407
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:20,020
essentially what everyone else sees who is in the CCCC who's in this Creek.

408
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:24,740
And they all start cheering and chanting with lots of hurrahs and yippees.

409
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:26,580
And I knew they could do it.

410
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:29,140
Um, from the animals in the.

411
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:32,820
Essentially crowd at this point, watching you guys work your magic.

412
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:35,860
Rusty waxes down while they're doing that.

413
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:39,780
I'm on the other side of the goo and I'm eating a worm that I found on the ground.

414
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:45,380
Does the goo have sentience enough that it is chasing after us now that we've broken

415
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:47,860
its ranks or does it just chill by the Creek?

416
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:52,340
Still the goo is sticking behind, which you would know as because there's just, there's

417
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,620
more food there, right?

418
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:58,660
Even though the water is in between them and they can't get it there, they see, it sees

419
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:02,420
more that it can consume and therefore is distracted.

420
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:07,380
And the four of you make your way to the main drag of contention.

421
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:13,380
And you know that just on the other side of this drag is hotel motel, where the dopest

422
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:16,020
of dopes Bean resides.

423
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:23,060
As you approach this business highway, Wilson, are you in the air or are you on the ground?

424
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:28,820
In the air, but I'm like, uh, like on the ground critters level, like just like a foot

425
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,420
above, foot above the ground.

426
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:37,140
Up above you see, no, it, it can't be it's, I mean it is a possum, but it's not just

427
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:37,940
any possum.

428
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:41,620
It looks like it's, it's your friend.

429
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:42,740
It's common.

430
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:45,060
And he is laying on his back.

431
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:51,460
This adorable, adorable little possum that Wilson has known for years and years, just

432
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:53,300
right there on the side of the road.

433
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:56,580
I land and go over to him and like pick him.

434
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,820
I'm like, you do this all the time.

435
00:26:58,820 --> 00:26:59,460
Come on, man.

436
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:02,260
Hey, what the fuck are you doing there, buddy?

437
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:07,540
You can't just come into me with your beak all like sharp and whatnots on me.

438
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:09,460
Why are you playing dead over here?

439
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:14,500
Well, you see, there was some of the mess coming through the area and heading on down

440
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,580
to y'all in the water.

441
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:22,740
And it don't find me nothing to be consuming for when I be laying on the backside.

442
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:25,300
Rusty sees a possum and starts barking.

443
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:31,380
Hey, why are you just barking when you could say words at me, friend?

444
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:33,620
Tyler starts barking because Rusty's barking.

445
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:39,060
Guys, this is, this is my friend Common.

446
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:41,300
He, uh, what are you doing here?

447
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:48,020
Well, I was making my way down to the water to hang out with you guys.

448
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:53,700
Cause I heard that you joined away from the birds, people who don't like me much no more

449
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,300
no way anyhow.

450
00:27:55,300 --> 00:28:01,780
Well, we're on our way to, we're on our way to get bean, but, uh, you can go down to the

451
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,220
water if you want.

452
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,100
Yep, I do.

453
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,060
That was my plan.

454
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,260
And now I'm leaving.

455
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:08,420
Thanks for saying hi to all of you.

456
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,260
Thanks for barking at me and Chip.

457
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:12,980
I know what you did.

458
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:13,620
Wait a minute.

459
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:16,980
I don't think it's safe for him to be going down there alone.

460
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:21,460
You think a possum can clear whatever amount of slime is down there?

461
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:29,700
You think that looking out for my safety is worth repayment for what you did to my brother?

462
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:30,580
Chip, what'd you do to his brother?

463
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:31,300
What'd you do to his brother?

464
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,180
What'd you do to his brother?

465
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:37,300
I never liked no possum no how, and that's all I'll leave it at.

466
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:39,860
Well, first of all, possum is delicious.

467
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:43,380
Okay, now I'm really bailing on out of here.

468
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:46,500
Wilson, it's good to see you.

469
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,740
Weird crew you're running with these days.

470
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:54,180
Well, I heard Bean was in trouble, so I came down.

471
00:28:54,820 --> 00:29:00,180
The birds are not too concerned with it, so I'm trying this group out to go get them.

472
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:01,940
You're a good man, Willie.

473
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:05,300
Could never trust no possum to be brave when it mattered none.

474
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:09,140
Ouch, that hurt my feelings.

475
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,060
I better go now before you seem to cry.

476
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:20,660
Back at Critter College, we called him O-Pussy.

477
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:28,260
He's a better man now that he's not in college anymore.

478
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:30,980
Well, see you later.

479
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:36,260
Bye, this has been a good encounter that definitely helped everyone a lot.

480
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:39,860
And as you guys pass over the road, you make it to the other side.

481
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:43,140
Did Colin have something to offer us?

482
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:48,420
Besides his next dope track?

483
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:51,300
No relation.

484
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:55,620
Was that my role on me?

485
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:56,180
That was it?

486
00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:01,300
I mean, anything could have happened, but that's what happened.

487
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:05,780
So you guys make it over to the other side.

488
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:07,140
I'll go back and kill him if you want me to.

489
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:12,740
Rusty, yeah, I was like, I'd really love to eat that possum.

490
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:18,260
He's my friend, don't need him until he's actually dead.

491
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:29,620
In the distance, you see Hotel Motel with its dimly kind of lit sign, and the parking lot

492
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:39,380
is not full at all, and the exterior doors of this place hold as much residue as a sink

493
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:43,860
that is owned by a 19-year-old boy, or girl for that matter.

494
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:46,900
19-year-olds just don't clean their sinks very often.

495
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,020
Basically, they're grody.

496
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:50,980
It's grody doors all over the external of this place.

497
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:58,020
And this is Hotel Motel, where you know that Bean is in one of these motel rooms.

498
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,060
We've met Bean before?

499
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:03,620
Oh yeah, he's the dopest golden retriever this side of the Mississippi, baby.

500
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:07,620
All rest he can't see so well no more, but he can still hear,

501
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:10,740
and he can still smell like a son of a bitch, literally.

502
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:17,220
So he's gonna try to sniff out Bean.

503
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:21,460
Go ahead and roll for me, Rusty.

504
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,100
83.

505
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:23,460
There's too much.

506
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:25,380
He's confused.

507
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:32,660
He's like, I almost smell him, but there's too much in the air.

508
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:34,740
I can't get a bean on what room he's in.

509
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:38,180
You can't get a bean on him whatsoever,

510
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:45,140
but you do hear a bit of a warble in the air that's singing along the winds,

511
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:45,620
and it's like...

512
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,260
Does it sound like Bean to us?

513
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:56,260
It does not sound like Bean, but it does sound like a dog.

514
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:01,140
Yeah, so besides smelling, the other thing Rusty can do is hear,

515
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:03,060
so he'd like to focus in on that sound.

516
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:07,540
13.

517
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:12,260
You hear, through this distinct warble in the air,

518
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:15,300
a rich, clear voice come through that says,

519
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:17,700
Hello there to all.

520
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:27,060
My name is Murphy, and I would like someone to let me out of this room.

521
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:32,900
Zach, do not put my fucking dog in a locked hotel room.

522
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:42,500
I do love the cameo, but if you even fictitiously harm him.

523
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:44,340
Oopsie.

524
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:48,500
By the way, I'm dead.

525
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,020
I'm the ghost of your dog.

526
00:32:56,740 --> 00:33:02,660
I sure would like a friend in these troubling times.

527
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:03,540
Fuck you.

528
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:05,860
Fellers, you know what that means.

529
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:12,420
Contention Creek Critter, coalition don't leave no dog or aminal behind.

530
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:14,580
Namaste.

531
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:16,020
Namaste, brother.

532
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:23,300
And you guys see that to the right, there is a little office

533
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:28,740
where there's a front door with an open sign that is well lit.

534
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:30,260
Well lit.

535
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:32,180
And a different door.

536
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:40,420
There is a man who is pushing a cart with cleaning supplies and fresh towels on it.

537
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:42,420
Don't make me a janitor.

538
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:45,300
Wait, what?

539
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,260
If Murphy's there, I assume I'm there.

540
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,340
Oh sure, why not?

541
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:51,060
It's Thomas.

542
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,260
Thomas is a janitor.

543
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,300
No, you're a maid.

544
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,660
You've got fresh towels, baby.

545
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:59,940
I'm gonna go ahead and fly into that office, see if I can't find

546
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:03,940
ol' Keith's name on that list, see where Bean is.

547
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:09,460
And I fly towards the office thinking that the window is just open space.

548
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:15,220
What do you mean see his name?

549
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:18,260
I don't know what you mean.

550
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,380
What do you mean, what do you mean?

551
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:21,380
What are you talking about here?

552
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:23,860
You can only hear names.

553
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:24,900
Oh, I can read.

554
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,180
I went to college.

555
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:29,140
What is reading?

556
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:33,460
It's like human symbols that mean words.

557
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,780
You are not making one lick of sense.

558
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:38,020
Yeah, I don't follow none right here.

559
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:38,820
I'll trust you again.

560
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,500
Rusty and Ship roll sanity?

561
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:42,660
No, I'm just kidding.

562
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:47,460
But yeah, I fly through the window.

563
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,220
Doonk!

564
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:50,900
But there's some sort of force field.

565
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:53,780
What's a force field, brother?

566
00:34:54,500 --> 00:35:02,180
The last thought running through your mind before you were stopped out of absolutely nowhere was,

567
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:04,100
holy shit, that's a big cat.

568
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:08,580
Am I knocked out or am I able to fly away?

569
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,860
So go ahead and mark one on your...

570
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:16,340
So we're doing a three check box system for damage here.

571
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:21,220
And if you take a bit of damage, that's minor damage.

572
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,580
That's the first box.

573
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:25,140
And if you take some more damage, that's going to be major damage.

574
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:26,580
That's the second box.

575
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:30,900
And then if you take damage a third time, you're going to have severe damage,

576
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:36,100
which is going to require a constitution rule to stay conscious.

577
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:41,300
Otherwise, you're going to have to have one of your teammates help you

578
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:44,580
in order to come back and rejoin the squad.

579
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:51,220
This mechanic that I straight up took one for one from Sam running us through that really fun

580
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:54,980
one shot right before all this quarantine broke out.

581
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,900
Rusty sees this happen.

582
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:59,940
The damn fool bird don't know about glass.

583
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:03,380
I've seen it happen many times in my...

584
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:10,660
He tries to multiply how many summers he's been by seven, but he can't because he's a dog.

585
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:20,340
So he just says, in my many summers, I've seen quite a few birds slam against the window.

586
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:25,540
They don't know it's only good for sticking your nose up against and linking.

587
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:28,660
So I'm on the ground, very disoriented.

588
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:30,020
What the fuck just happened?

589
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:33,940
Rusty, in an attempt to revive you, sticks his nose up against you and licks you.

590
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:34,580
Hell yeah.

591
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:36,180
Describe it deeper.

592
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:41,860
Oh, he tries to put his ruffle feathers back in place.

593
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:42,500
He's just like...

594
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:46,900
Yeah, it's a very ginger, like, hey, are you all right?

595
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:49,780
Chip gets on the ground and starts shaking him violently.

596
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:54,420
Little tiny fat chipmunk is like, wake your damn ass up, bro.

597
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:56,820
We got work to do.

598
00:36:57,380 --> 00:37:02,180
I get up and I stretch my wings out and flap them off to get any of the spit off.

599
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:07,300
And then I fly up and perch on the little thing next to the window and peck it.

600
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:14,820
And you wake up the giant cat that you saw that was sitting on top of the desk

601
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:16,340
right before you ran in this window.

602
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:18,260
As you peck, it kind of slowly...

603
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:24,420
Hello there, everybody.

604
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:30,100
My name's RoPo and welcome to Hotel Moto.

605
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:33,380
You know, I know you spend more time with her, but that's not RoPo's voice.

606
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:39,060
That's very funny, Tom.

607
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:46,100
I love my sister, Ramona.

608
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,060
Could you get Taylor in here to do it right, please?

609
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:50,020
Taylor!

610
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:55,300
Thomas wants to hear your RoPo voice.

611
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,300
Taylor gets on like...

612
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,140
It has to be better than mine.

613
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:10,580
Hi, guys, it's RoPo.

614
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:18,260
I came to tell you that I just took the biggest shot and it was so fun.

615
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,780
RoPo seems weirdly high energy.

616
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:26,980
Yeah.

617
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:30,340
Have you ever seen my ass?

618
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:42,180
That's what RoPo says all the time, though.

619
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:42,660
She's right.

620
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:46,900
Every time she walks up to you and she like rubs against you and meows, she's like,

621
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,100
have you seen my ass?

622
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,060
Have you seen my ass?

623
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:53,780
I can't find it because my belly's in the way.

624
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,580
Boys, I will be back in two shakes.

625
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:58,820
This is what we call...

626
00:38:58,820 --> 00:38:59,860
Is it a pee break?

627
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:01,380
Pee break.

628
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:02,900
Everyone leave your recording going.

629
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,740
I'm gonna go break as well.

630
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:07,060
Question is, which voice do I come back with?

631
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:15,620
Are you sober?

632
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:17,940
I'm not smoking.

633
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:18,900
Oh, yeah.

634
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,340
And I'm out of edibles right now.

635
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:21,540
But I will...

636
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:24,660
I'm also intermittent fasting and...

637
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:27,140
I didn't know you were religious.

638
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:31,780
Yeah, I am really, really deeply religious.

639
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:41,380
And I don't think it's cool to personify animals because they don't have souls.

640
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:44,020
They're not going to heaven.

641
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:44,980
Oh, God.

642
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:47,460
That's for people who love Jesus.

643
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,900
A dog can't love Jesus.

644
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:59,620
So THC gets stored in your fat cells for a long ass time.

645
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:01,860
Are you saying and you're not fat anymore?

646
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:04,340
No, I'm still fat.

647
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:11,700
But when I intermittent fast, I definitely feel like I've taken a mild edible during

648
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:15,860
the course of the day, which is cool because my body is getting high on its own supply.

649
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:19,780
You got that slow release.

650
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:23,140
And then the only food he's eating is more edibles.

651
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:29,540
It's not the edibles.

652
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:31,620
It's my fat.

653
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:35,700
So which voice do you guys want me to do for RoPo?

654
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:36,420
Your Santa voice?

655
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:38,260
Whatever you feel comfortable with.

656
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:42,100
I like thinking of RoPo as a weird, big, jolly cat like that.

657
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:42,580
Yeah.

658
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:44,020
Santa Claus it is.

659
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:44,340
All right.

660
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:49,700
Welcome to Ho Ho Ho Ho Hotel Motel.

661
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,180
Tyler starts growling at the cat.

662
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:52,740
Yeah.

663
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:56,180
Rusty sees the cat and is startled and goes woof.

664
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:56,820
Hi.

665
00:40:56,820 --> 00:41:01,700
RoPo's hair doesn't stand up even a little bit.

666
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,900
Are you guys trying to intimidate her?

667
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,260
Rusty, no, no, no.

668
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:07,380
It's just a reaction.

669
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:11,780
Rusty tilts his head to the side and then when he sees the cat is no threat, his tail

670
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:12,340
starts wagging.

671
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:17,700
Tyler starts doing like the growl starts to turn into a yip kinda and then like pause

672
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:21,220
down, backs up a little, pause forward, backs up a little.

673
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:23,380
Just trying to gaze what this cat's doing.

674
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:24,660
Hello, my friends.

675
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:26,260
Rusty, what you call this stuff?

676
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:27,860
This force field, what you call it?

677
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,900
Oh, it's a window.

678
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:33,940
Hey, RoPo, can you turn this window off?

679
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:39,860
That's a picture of me.

680
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:41,620
I would never want to get rid of it.

681
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:47,300
Would Chip know RoPo as a veteran of the 4C?

682
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:51,380
Chip, it's been a long time, hasn't it?

683
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:55,220
It's good to see you're doing well in these trying times, RoPo.

684
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:58,420
Looks like you haven't been hard up for food none lately.

685
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:02,740
Well, I see you are living lavishly as well, my good sir.

686
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:06,100
I miss our nights together every now and then.

687
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:08,500
Chip slaps his belly a few times.

688
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:09,540
He's like, yeah, brother.

689
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:14,420
That's the Chip I knew.

690
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:16,100
Hey, Cat.

691
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:18,260
Cat, don't you know there's a goo out there?

692
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:21,060
Don't you know it can get into buildings and such?

693
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:21,860
A what?

694
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:22,580
There's a goo.

695
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:24,420
There's a black goo that wants to eat everybody,

696
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:26,180
so all the critters are meeting down at the creek.

697
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:28,740
I've not seen this black goo.

698
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:31,140
Well, keep an eye out for it.

699
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:36,580
RoPo, we need your help to find someone or maybe a couple someones.

700
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:41,540
You know any animals that would be trapped or something in these parts?

701
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:43,300
Are you talking about the dogs?

702
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:44,900
Yeah, Murphy and Bean.

703
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:45,380
Bean.

704
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:46,260
Oh, you almost...

705
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:47,700
Oh, you do know their names.

706
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:49,620
Yes, of course.

707
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:58,660
Well, I'm not much for the symbols, but I believe you'll find where they are on those charts over there.

708
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:00,660
I want to look at the charts.

709
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:01,140
Can you...

710
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:02,100
Did you go to college?

711
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:02,980
Yes.

712
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:05,380
Can you enroll?

713
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:07,380
Critter Community College.

714
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:08,180
Yeah.

715
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:10,500
He's got a critter.

716
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:11,780
What is your skill for that?

717
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:15,220
Intelligence.

718
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:15,540
I thought...

719
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:16,420
Don't you have...

720
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:18,420
You said understand human, which I think means...

721
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:22,500
I could have sworn you had a special skill that meant you could understand, like...

722
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:23,140
Yeah, I can...

723
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:23,540
I have...

724
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:26,100
It's called a little birdie told me.

725
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:28,180
What?

726
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:33,780
When I told you that you could have special skills,

727
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:40,180
you wrote down somewhere that your special skill was a little birdie told me.

728
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:44,980
Yeah, which means I can understand humans and read.

729
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:47,060
I see it needs...

730
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:48,500
I think it has to be one or the other.

731
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:52,500
It's I understand human stuff.

732
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:59,780
Willie's like, have you guys watched The Wire?

733
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:05,540
Dude, I love human stuff.

734
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:06,260
Season two?

735
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:06,980
Are you kidding me?

736
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:10,260
Don't bother with season five.

737
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:12,740
This is now dictating that it's...

738
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:15,220
That you can read and understand stuff.

739
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:15,540
Okay.

740
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:18,340
So go ahead and roll those dice, baby.

741
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:24,420
But if people try to talk to you, boy, you ain't gonna know what they're saying?

742
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:25,060
60.

743
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:26,980
Oh, congratulations.

744
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:31,380
So it very clearly says, hey, Luke, do you know what room Keith Vigna is?

745
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:33,300
If we said it, it was probably seven.

746
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:34,980
I think it was.

747
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:39,300
And then we've got Murphy is on the first floor in room three.

748
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:41,780
We got to go to room seven and three.

749
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:43,940
Do you guys know what that means?

750
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:44,340
No.

751
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:45,860
What the hell are you talking about?

752
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:51,780
RoPo, can you help guide us here to whereabouts we're supposed to search for our friends?

753
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:53,060
Not even a little bit.

754
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:56,180
I believe it's the woodpecker that knows the symbols.

755
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:01,860
I don't know what your quest is or give a fuck about you.

756
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:04,820
Any more, Chip?

757
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:07,540
I dream of you.

758
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:08,660
This is a really tight...

759
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:10,180
This is a really tight game, guys.

760
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:14,740
I can read the symbols on the doors here.

761
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:17,780
This one's seven right here.

762
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:19,860
And I fly over to room seven.

763
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:21,540
Yeah, it's up on the second floor.

764
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:23,620
And you guys go to the stairs.

765
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:27,300
I go to three first then, since it's on the first floor, probably.

766
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:29,300
Is this the one that Bien is in?

767
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:30,660
Is this where Bien is?

768
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:33,940
This one right here is Murphy's, but it's closest.

769
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:40,100
Don't you think we should get beans?

770
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:41,220
He's our mission.

771
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:42,820
He might be able to help us get this other guy.

772
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:45,780
I think we should get beans.

773
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:47,700
What about the other way around?

774
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:49,300
Maybe Murphy can help us.

775
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:51,700
Yeah, and this first dog's on the first floor.

776
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:54,100
Tyler, I'm gonna need you to pull yourself together.

777
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:56,980
These old bones don't get upstairs too well.

778
00:45:56,980 --> 00:45:58,580
Tyler starts chasing his tail.

779
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:00,180
He has stopped listening.

780
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:07,460
Can Chip Montgomery pick a little tiny pebble up and throw it at Tyler?

781
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:10,660
Don't throw rocks at dogs.

782
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:14,420
Like really, I'm talking, it's a chipmunk size pebble.

783
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:18,580
Wait, like a pebble for a chipmunk or a pebble that's the size of a chipmunk?

784
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:22,180
No, the pebble for a chipmunk.

785
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:24,020
Because if that's true, Chip is so strong.

786
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:25,460
Chip only has 20 strength.

787
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:28,820
He can barely, he can't lift his own body weight up.

788
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:32,900
Okay, so as this weird squabble is happening,

789
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:38,820
where the cartoon's rocks and chips are changing size rapidly back and forth,

790
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:44,980
I need you guys to roll if you have some sort of like perception ability,

791
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:48,420
special ability that is, or intelligence.

792
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:49,860
Should we all roll then?

793
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:52,260
Hearing and smelling counts as perception, right?

794
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:54,180
It absolutely does.

795
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:58,980
I failed an intelligence check.

796
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:00,020
I failed mine.

797
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:03,940
I passed an intelligence check of 12 on 50.

798
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:09,380
Yeah, fittingly, the two dogs immediately turn and look,

799
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:16,660
and you see driving by slowly is someone who is looking at you,

800
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:22,020
and in the shotgun seat, there's an old person with a cane,

801
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:25,460
and they're shaking the cane at all of you out the window,

802
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:29,620
and they're screaming something in their weird human language,

803
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:34,100
convincing the person who's on the phone to do something.

804
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:38,420
Thomas thinks they're probably calling, trying to call animal control.

805
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:39,940
So does Rusty.

806
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:42,740
Well, Rusty just knows they're up to no good.

807
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:46,740
He's like, I think we need to get a move on.

808
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:47,700
Scatter, brothers.

809
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:51,380
Tyler has been on the run for five days now,

810
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:53,940
and he knows how to avoid humans.

811
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:59,220
He's real skittish, and he's already probably running for under the stairs, maybe.

812
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:06,420
Yeah, and I think maybe even, Tyler, you've seen this caned person before.

813
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:07,540
He's my nemesis.

814
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:09,780
Yeah, exactly.

815
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:15,700
Famed Tyler nemesis, Greargin.

816
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:16,660
Greargin?

817
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:17,540
Fuck, guys, it's Greargin.

818
00:48:17,540 --> 00:48:18,820
We have to get out of here.

819
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:22,020
The old contention person.

820
00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:27,300
The 300-year-old founder of contention.

821
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:30,580
Nope, they're elsewhere.

822
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:33,620
He just won't die.

823
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:34,580
Wow, spoilies.

824
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:37,060
What are you guys doing?

825
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:41,380
How are you getting into room three or seven?

826
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:45,460
Is there a window on these, like a door with a window next to it?

827
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:47,140
Yeah, they all have a window next to them.

828
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:50,500
I want to peck on the glass of the room three.

829
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:52,660
Look who knows what glass is all of a sudden.

830
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:56,660
His allies taught him.

831
00:48:56,660 --> 00:48:57,940
He found out the hard way.

832
00:48:57,940 --> 00:49:04,340
That's honestly, that's the most character development we've had on any of the shows so far.

833
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:07,560
All right.

834
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:14,900
Is there any kind of ventilation shafts in and out of these rooms that a small rodent

835
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:16,260
could perhaps go into?

836
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:19,060
Oh, hell yeah, dude.

837
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:19,940
Of course there are.

838
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:27,780
Luke, Wilson is tapping on the glass and the curtain slowly opens with a dark chocolate.

839
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:28,980
I'm talking 92%.

840
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:32,180
Beautiful old dog.

841
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:32,900
Long hair.

842
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:37,860
And it looks at you with these gorgeous knowing eyes.

843
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:44,260
And it says, well, hello there, my good bird friend.

844
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:47,700
I sure would like to get out of this room.

845
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:49,300
Can you turn this window off?

846
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:56,820
Zach, that's, while that's not Murphy's voice, it's close.

847
00:49:56,820 --> 00:49:59,300
So, oh, thanks dude.

848
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:04,740
Cut to Chip is running on hind legs through an air vent.

849
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:08,340
I'm really out of shape, my brother.

850
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:08,900
Oh God.

851
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:11,780
John McLean in it.

852
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:13,140
Chip, are you wearing shoes?

853
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:20,180
In my mind, I pictured him wearing like a weird, like fatigues for a little fat.

854
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:22,820
He's a warfatter.

855
00:50:23,540 --> 00:50:25,060
He's like he's a prepper squirrel.

856
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:31,940
He's got some sick Nike's on combat.

857
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:34,180
No little combat boots for a chipmunk.

858
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:37,540
Oh man, Justin, I don't want to criticize your role-playing decisions, but you should

859
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:38,740
have been a chipmunk.

860
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:43,460
Oh, like bald on top or like Tony Shalhoub.

861
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:44,660
Oh, yes.

862
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:54,900
All right, let's start over.

863
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:55,860
I'm going to start the recording.

864
00:50:57,380 --> 00:51:02,820
It is a brisk December 5th here in contention, made all the more bleak by the-

865
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:06,820
Hey, no shit, I would like, I would start over if you guys wanted to.

866
00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:07,780
No.

867
00:51:07,780 --> 00:51:09,620
I think we could do this a lot tighter.

868
00:51:09,620 --> 00:51:11,540
I loved every second of this.

869
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:11,860
Okay.

870
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:13,060
I think this has been really good.

871
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:15,700
It hasn't been tight, but I like it loose.

872
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:19,860
You heard me.

873
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:23,140
Say what I said.

874
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:27,220
I don't like it loose.

875
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:28,580
Say it.

876
00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:30,340
Zach likes it loose.

877
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:36,740
All right, good talk everybody.

878
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:38,420
Did you see my chat to the group?

879
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:39,220
Yes.

880
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:39,460
Yep.

881
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:43,860
Okay, what's Chippy doing?

882
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:49,780
Chip is sprinting as fast as his little chubby legs can take him to try and get to Murphy.

883
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:52,900
Oh yeah, you may get to the vent that's on the other side.

884
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:56,260
Is there a little, can I, is there like a little pocket I can squeeze through in the

885
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:56,980
ventilation?

886
00:51:59,380 --> 00:51:59,860
What happened?

887
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:03,620
Yeah, but it's a really wide-

888
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:04,980
No, no, no, listen to me.

889
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:06,020
It's round.

890
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:07,060
It's really wide.

891
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:12,500
But it's really wide and there's some like oil that's just like dripping from it.

892
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:13,300
It's very strange.

893
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:16,420
Wait, what are we talking about?

894
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:17,540
Are we talking about your wife?

895
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:20,420
Holy shit.

896
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:22,900
That is extremely rude, Justin.

897
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:27,220
Yeah, why would you ever say that to me?

898
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:45,220
We are not lazy enough, basically.

899
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:49,060
Did Thomas just say, I'm the devil and I'll be back?

900
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:50,660
Yeah, I think that's what this meant.

901
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:52,260
Oh, Jesus Christ.

902
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:54,580
One, two, three.

903
00:52:57,940 --> 00:52:59,300
All right, let's get back to it.

904
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:03,860
My earphones just said my battery is low, so I don't know how much, I don't know what

905
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:04,340
that means.

906
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:06,340
Wait, what?

907
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:08,580
I've got these wireless.

908
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:09,620
Yeah.

909
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:12,260
Can you plug them in while you're wearing them?

910
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:15,940
The cord's like this long, but it should, it should be fine.

911
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:18,420
So let's keep going.

912
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:19,780
Some-

913
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:20,260
Body.

914
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:22,760
Morns.

915
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:24,020
Yeah.

916
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:31,940
On my Animal Crossing game, I made the town theme song All Star.

917
00:53:33,060 --> 00:53:33,940
That's really cute.

918
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:41,700
Okay, so you guys are on the outside of this window and the Wilson the woodpecker just

919
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:44,660
asked to turn the glass off.

920
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:52,980
The two dogs are right behind the woodpecker and Chip the chipmunk is about to bust into

921
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:54,900
a grate that is into this room.

922
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:56,660
Chip is always about to bust.

923
00:53:59,780 --> 00:54:02,180
I explained that to Murphy.

924
00:54:02,180 --> 00:54:04,660
I'm like, hold on there, little fella.

925
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:08,420
Help is coming in the form of a chipmunk.

926
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:09,380
Please don't eat it.

927
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:15,300
Although you might be tempted, he is on our side and he's going to help you get out of

928
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:15,860
that room.

929
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:18,500
I'm curious, do you guys have a plan, Chip?

930
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:20,660
Do you have a plan to help him get out of the room?

931
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:24,820
A real leader takes action and then thinks about it much later.

932
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:30,660
I'm assuming since we're all animals at every door in this hotel is a lever, not a knob.

933
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:33,060
This is a hotel motel for humans.

934
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:34,740
No, it's one of those things.

935
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:35,380
It's a push.

936
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:38,100
So it's just got like a push bar.

937
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:39,860
So none of the doors lock?

938
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:41,380
No, those lock.

939
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:42,980
You just have to use an Allen wrench.

940
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:46,340
I'm going to shout at Murphy from the ventilation.

941
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:47,400
Murphy.

942
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:48,740
Yeah.

943
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:49,860
Now I'm going to come on down.

944
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:50,740
Don't eat me now.

945
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:51,800
Okay.

946
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:57,620
I just really need you to promise me that there ain't going to be no eating of old chip

947
00:54:57,620 --> 00:54:58,120
tonight.

948
00:54:58,740 --> 00:54:59,700
Roll intelligence.

949
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:02,420
I would never even consider it.

950
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:04,100
I pass 38 on a 40.

951
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:06,420
Oh yeah, no, he would never even consider it.

952
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:08,660
All right now.

953
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:12,260
Well, to be fair, the real Murphy would absolutely consider it.

954
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:15,300
But if you explained it to him, he would know to hold off.

955
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:17,140
That's good to know.

956
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:23,700
Chip will, however he got through the other ventilation, like, I don't know, is it from

957
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:26,260
the ceiling I'm coming or below?

958
00:55:26,260 --> 00:55:26,900
Oh yeah.

959
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:27,220
Yeah.

960
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:27,940
From the wall.

961
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:31,460
I have a climbing skill to, to get out safely.

962
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:31,960
Perfect.

963
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:35,780
Describe how you rappel down this hotel wall.

964
00:55:35,780 --> 00:55:41,780
Well, uh, chip wants to use some of his old combat moves from the old days.

965
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:45,540
So I'd like to think he like does like a sick ass, like combat role.

966
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:48,740
Like he like slides down the wall with one hand on the wall.

967
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:53,540
So it slows him down with his little tiny, weird, creepy fingernails that rodents have.

968
00:55:53,540 --> 00:55:54,820
And he goes down really slow.

969
00:55:54,820 --> 00:55:59,060
And then as he lands, he does like a little combat role and like jumps up and he's like,

970
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:00,260
Oh, I love it.

971
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:02,020
Very, very flashy entrance.

972
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:03,380
He's like, now is my time.

973
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:10,980
Speaking of combat and Murphy, he has, uh, he has a hundred in all stats and he, instead

974
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:13,380
of three health boxes, he has a billion.

975
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:16,180
So, so you can't hurt him, Zach.

976
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:18,900
I think you know me better than that.

977
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:21,220
Yeah.

978
00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:21,860
I think I do.

979
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:23,940
What do you think of me?

980
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:26,660
I think he would hurt my dog in a role-playing game

981
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:35,380
to elicit like a genuine emotional response from your players.

982
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:41,620
Tyler sees chip fall into the room and he goes and bumps his face into the window.

983
00:56:41,620 --> 00:56:42,020
Excited.

984
00:56:45,140 --> 00:56:45,640
Yeah.

985
00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:50,660
Both the dogs seen the chipmunk forget it's their friend and like bark.

986
00:56:52,580 --> 00:56:57,220
When Tyler bumps into the glass, uh, I'm like, Oh, that's a pretty good idea.

987
00:56:57,220 --> 00:56:59,380
And I start pecking at the glass.

988
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:03,860
Oh, that's your skill.

989
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:07,700
I'm going to use my pecking skill to pack the glass.

990
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:08,660
Can you break it open?

991
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:10,360
Okay.

992
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:15,960
Luke Wilson, the woodpecker is standing on that little ledge that windows have.

993
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:25,880
And you begin slowly pack, pack, pack, pack, pack, pack, pack, pack, pack, pack, pack,

994
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:31,080
pack, pack, pack, pack, pack, pack, pack, pack, pack, pack, pack, pack, pack, pack,

995
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:38,840
and you start seeing like shards and then sparks as you're going so slowly.

996
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:45,640
So slowly through this glass, but your beak movement is so fast that these little

997
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:48,360
shards sparks of glass begin flying out.

998
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:54,760
And then finally you can smell the stale motel air on the other side.

999
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:58,120
And then the camera zooms out really fast and there's a

1000
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:02,040
as a bunch of different spider web breaks on the glass.

1001
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:07,240
And then it into pebbles as both dogs from the outside.

1002
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:08,700
No.

1003
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:19,160
As Murphy on the inside comes bounding through the glass to the outdoors being ridden by chip.

1004
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:21,800
And what is chip doing on top?

1005
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:26,840
He's a writing it like a Khaleesi does on the dragons where he's like holding it.

1006
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:33,160
That's great.

1007
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:36,920
He's up near its neck, like holding it and trying to guide it.

1008
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:40,920
Rusty gives Murphy a big old lick on the face because he's a good boy.

1009
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:43,160
And a lick is returned.

1010
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:44,200
Tyler sniffs his ass.

1011
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:45,960
Oh, how rude of me.

1012
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:49,480
Rusty sniffs his ass too.

1013
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:53,160
What kind of vibe do I pick up?

1014
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:58,600
Would we know Murphy or is Murphy news to us?

1015
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:06,920
So Murphy is just you've heard tell that there's an old wise wizard that lives in

1016
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:14,520
Hotel Motel, but you've never you've never met this Murphy, but he seems to just be

1017
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:17,800
here passing through or for a short time.

1018
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:23,400
No one really passes through contention, but people do come and leave shortly thereafter.

1019
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:28,600
Now, Murphy, we're part of something called the Contention Creek Critter Coalition,

1020
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:31,400
and we're here to help all the animals we can.

1021
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:33,240
And in particular one that's upstairs right now.

1022
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:35,800
We got to get up there.

1023
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:40,840
Murphy, have you have you smelled the other dog around here, Bean?

1024
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:41,560
Oh, yes.

1025
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:45,000
Up in room seven.

1026
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:47,720
Can you could you guide us there?

1027
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:49,800
Well, but of course.

1028
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,920
And then you're all standing outside room seven.

1029
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:53,880
Let's do it again, boys.

1030
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:54,680
Come on.

1031
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:55,000
Same.

1032
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:55,160
Yeah.

1033
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:55,960
Same game plan.

1034
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:57,480
Go for it, Willy.

1035
00:59:57,480 --> 00:59:58,200
Holy shit.

1036
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:00,120
OK, hold up.

1037
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:08,760
Cut to the glass shattering as Bean, a gorgeous golden retriever, jumps through the window

1038
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:10,440
with Chip on his back.

1039
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:15,080
And we won.

1040
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:17,080
Thanks for subscribing to the Patreon.

1041
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:20,600
Is this a Patreon episode?

1042
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:21,960
Oh, it's high.

1043
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:22,460
Well.

1044
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:24,760
Go do it anyway.

1045
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:27,960
Thanks for nothing, cucks.

1046
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:29,160
Subscribe to the Patreon.

1047
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:31,960
Oh, boy.

1048
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:33,640
We got to get you back to safety, Bean.

1049
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:36,200
Wait, did that actually happen, though?

1050
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:37,480
Oh, hell yeah.

1051
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:38,040
Give us a.

1052
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:41,000
Hey, Luke, what is Bean sound like?

1053
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:41,400
Yeah.

1054
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:42,600
What should I do?

1055
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:44,200
Oh, he's like.

1056
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:49,320
Remember, you have the opportunity to describe a voice that Zach has to do.

1057
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:50,760
Do not waste.

1058
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:56,840
He sounds like Captain Peanut Butter.

1059
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:58,200
Mr. Peanut Butter?

1060
01:00:58,200 --> 01:00:59,640
No, Captain Peanut Butter.

1061
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:01,640
The like Lumberjack.

1062
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:02,680
Mr. Peanut Butter.

1063
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:04,520
It's Mr. Peanut Butter's brother.

1064
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:05,720
Mr. Peanut Butter's brother.

1065
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:06,200
Gotcha.

1066
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:06,680
Yeah.

1067
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:07,880
BoJack Horseman, y'all.

1068
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:08,200
All right.

1069
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:10,360
Just do an excited Labrador voice then.

1070
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:17,480
So exactly Joe's voice.

1071
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:20,120
Do a different dog's voice for this dog.

1072
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:25,960
Does someone fart?

1073
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:26,680
What was that?

1074
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:27,560
Was that Luke?

1075
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:29,400
What did you fart?

1076
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:32,200
I think it was my chair.

1077
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:38,200
As soon as that sound happens, Luke, you coincidentally made a face like you farted

1078
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:41,160
and you knew it and you're a real squeaker.

1079
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:45,000
My headphones keep telling me I got low battery, so I was like.

1080
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:50,040
Luke, what is Bean sound like?

1081
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:53,880
Okay, he sounds like Woody from Toy Story.

1082
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:55,400
He sounds like Woody the Woodpecker.

1083
01:01:56,840 --> 01:02:00,200
I'm Bean.

1084
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:02,520
There you go.

1085
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Since Bean's dad is a cop, he's like a rebellious teenager.

1086
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:09,720
Okay.

1087
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:11,160
Yeah, that's good.

1088
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:12,840
Thanks for saving me, guys.

1089
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:15,080
But I was fine in there alone.

1090
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:16,840
How long have you been in there?

1091
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:17,720
How long have you been in there?

1092
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:20,200
Also, keep in mind, everyone loves this guy.

1093
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:25,560
I thought Bean was the smartest voice.

1094
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:28,440
Most compassionate and caring.

1095
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:29,720
What's up, fuck sticks?

1096
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:34,600
I'm so fucking smart.

1097
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:36,520
Hey, pussies, is your mom hot too?

1098
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:42,440
Jesus.

1099
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:44,040
Do you guys want to sniff my butt?

1100
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:46,920
If you'll let us.

1101
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:48,680
Yeah, hop on back here.

1102
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:51,320
Got you, dude.

1103
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:52,280
Ah, shit.

1104
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:53,640
Rusty.

1105
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:56,760
Did you guys see Rusty get a rusty eye?

1106
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:57,960
Oh, shit.

1107
01:02:57,960 --> 01:03:03,080
Rusty is unbelievably honored that you would gift him with that extra smell.

1108
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:04,040
Dude, hell yeah, man.

1109
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:05,480
You got my stink on you now.

1110
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:06,200
Do you love it?

1111
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:07,560
I do.

1112
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:08,040
That would.

1113
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:09,320
Do you fucking love it?

1114
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:10,360
Let's get out of here, bro.

1115
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:13,400
That's one of the finest ass smells I've ever smelled.

1116
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:14,360
Oh, hell yeah.

1117
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:16,120
Thanks, Luke, for doing this to me.

1118
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:18,360
How long have you been trapped in here?

1119
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:19,080
Oh, God.

1120
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:20,440
This piece of shit, man.

1121
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:21,560
I don't even know.

1122
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:25,640
He's my bro-lo for ro-lo, but I don't even know-lo.

1123
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:29,960
How are you surviving in there all alone?

1124
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:33,000
Honestly, just jacking it nonstop.

1125
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:36,440
Just little red riding head lipstick in this motherfucker.

1126
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:37,320
Jack links.

1127
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:38,680
There's a bunch of jerky in there.

1128
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:40,520
Oh, just rocking my jerky.

1129
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:44,040
I hate this character.

1130
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:45,080
I hate this character.

1131
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:49,240
Yeah, let's put him back.

1132
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:50,680
Let's not rescue this guy.

1133
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:51,180
Yeah.

1134
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:55,080
Hey, Luke, what does Bean sound like?

1135
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:56,440
Like a little tiny girl.

1136
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:04,840
Thanks for saving me, guys.

1137
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:08,840
As you bust through, and the glass just pebbles down and cascades,

1138
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:14,120
and you're all standing there in a line from, like, tallest in the middle,

1139
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:17,880
and then, like, well-crafted shot design all the way through,

1140
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:20,920
and you're all standing in a line sideways, it's beautiful,

1141
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:24,280
and the glass just, like, shatters at your feet into pebbles,

1142
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:27,160
and then you see, like, in the foreground,

1143
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:31,560
the animal control van pulls up, and it is game time.

1144
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:32,280
Oh shit, the fuzz!

1145
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:37,160
The fuzz is here, but we can take him?

1146
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:42,920
Chip starts punching his little tiny fist into his little tiny hand over and over again.

1147
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:45,400
Make him surfer god instead of little girl.

1148
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:46,920
No time to sniff butts.

1149
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:49,640
We've got the man to take on.

1150
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:51,160
It's time to...

1151
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:53,000
To roll initiative, doggy style.

1152
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:57,800
Yes, a hundred percent that.

1153
01:04:57,800 --> 01:05:02,920
Lettuce, tomato, roll your dice on dexterity.

1154
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:04,200
It's a deck structure.

1155
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:05,000
That's my worst.

1156
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:07,880
I got a 47 on a 60.

1157
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:09,080
I failed.

1158
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:10,600
17 on a 20.

1159
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:13,080
I passed with a 38 on a 70.

1160
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:21,640
The animal control folk rolled a 66 on a 60.

1161
01:05:24,040 --> 01:05:26,120
So you will all get to go first.

1162
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:28,520
So you guys can decide as a group.

1163
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:31,000
Yes, absolutely.

1164
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:31,720
Literally, it's...

1165
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:33,800
God, who should it be?

1166
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:36,360
It should be a pair of doofuses.

1167
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:40,760
Well, I imagine it's just Ron and Hugo from...

1168
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:41,960
Oh, that's better.

1169
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:43,480
Except Rip Harris.

1170
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:46,600
Yeah, it'll be an honor.

1171
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:51,480
No, they're both Sewage Joe.

1172
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:52,200
Who's that?

1173
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:53,160
Sewage Joe?

1174
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:54,120
From Parks and Rec?

1175
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:55,240
Oh, yeah.

1176
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:57,080
Oh, the perverted guy.

1177
01:05:58,040 --> 01:05:58,540
Yeah.

1178
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:04,200
One of them and then the surgeon on scrubs with the do-rag.

1179
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:05,080
Oh, the Todd.

1180
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:07,720
The Todd.

1181
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:09,080
Hell yeah, it's the Todd.

1182
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:13,000
And Sewage Joe.

1183
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:17,000
Fantastic.

1184
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,720
And both in dark blue jumpsuits.

1185
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:21,640
Oh yeah, I like that.

1186
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:23,560
And they both have taser guns.

1187
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:25,480
No, not guns, prods.

1188
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:25,980
Oh no.

1189
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:28,120
And they're just coming from Murphy.

1190
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:34,040
No, they're just coming from Murphy.

1191
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:36,200
Sacrifices themselves so that we may go...

1192
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:40,440
I quit the podcast forever.

1193
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:43,000
I love you, Luke.

1194
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:43,800
I love you, Justin.

1195
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:44,600
I love you, Joe.

1196
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:46,840
Fuck you, Zach.

1197
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:50,040
It's just that it's 2020.

1198
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:52,040
It's gotten me all shook up.

1199
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:53,320
I'm gonna go hug my dog.

1200
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:57,000
Okay, it's game time.

1201
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,600
When they pull up, I look at the other guys.

1202
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:03,560
I'm like, they cut down my favorite tree just because I was pecking on it in the park.

1203
01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:04,600
Fuck these guys.

1204
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:07,160
Yeah, these guys are bad news.

1205
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:10,280
They've been looking for me for days and I've been out running them,

1206
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:12,120
but I don't know how we're gonna get out of this, guys.

1207
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:12,920
They're right there.

1208
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:17,080
It don't take much to get old Chip all riled up for action.

1209
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:22,040
First of all, Willie, you know, I don't know much about human bureaucracy,

1210
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:24,200
but it seems like that must have been unrelated.

1211
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:27,560
I don't know if that's within the purview of animal control.

1212
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:30,440
I'm learning a lot of new words today.

1213
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:32,520
Bureaucracy, window, glass.

1214
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:35,400
It's a big old world.

1215
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:42,040
All I know is I've got it out for these fuckers and I take off and I fly towards them

1216
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:46,120
and I take a shit aiming for Todd's eye.

1217
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:49,320
Yes, dive bomb.

1218
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:55,720
Okay, yeah, we'll just do all of these as contested rules, I suppose.

1219
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:59,080
And if you hit the same person twice in a round,

1220
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:04,440
then they'll be at a disadvantage for that second and whatever role.

1221
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:06,840
He's gonna try to high-five it out of the way.

1222
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:13,080
You're gonna roll Dexterity or Intelligence, whichever one is higher,

1223
01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:17,720
unless you have a special skill that would help more in a shitty situation.

1224
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:20,040
Oh shit, my headphones just died.

1225
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:24,040
Well, Luke, time to find some more headphones to put on.

1226
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:28,200
In the meantime, I'd be interested to see what he rolled

1227
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:34,920
because I rolled a 49 on the Todd's ability to high-five.

1228
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:37,480
Probably pretty high.

1229
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:41,480
Okay, so I'm gonna roll Dexterity.

1230
01:08:41,480 --> 01:08:42,040
Is that what he said?

1231
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:45,000
Yeah, or Intelligence, whichever one's higher.

1232
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:47,880
I already told them what I rolled.

1233
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:50,520
I got a 51 on a 60.

1234
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:52,200
Nice.

1235
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:52,840
What did you get?

1236
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:56,360
Dude, you got a 49, you fucking...

1237
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:58,360
You barely beat the contestant.

1238
01:08:58,360 --> 01:08:59,000
That's so good.

1239
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:04,360
As the Todd goes to high-five the stream of shit, it goes right...

1240
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:10,760
It literally curves around his hand like James McAvoy shooting a bullet,

1241
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:16,360
and it hits the Todd square in the eye, disabling him for the entire round.

1242
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:18,360
Rusty barks in approval.

1243
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:20,920
Did you guys see that shit?

1244
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:21,880
He sure did.

1245
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:23,880
God.

1246
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:28,840
I don't get it.

1247
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:36,280
The rest of you can decide on an idea where you could help each other do something,

1248
01:09:36,280 --> 01:09:42,040
or basically you have the entire round yourselves before there's a reaction from Sewage Joe.

1249
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:44,920
Listen, y'all.

1250
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:51,000
We've got four dogs and a chipmunk, and they're just two stupid humans.

1251
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:54,520
I think if we work together, we can herd these fuckers.

1252
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:56,840
We can round them up and take care of business.

1253
01:09:56,840 --> 01:10:00,600
Rusty, you think you could throw me on one of them son of a bitching guys?

1254
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:02,120
No, I'm a dog.

1255
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:03,720
I don't have opposable thumbs.

1256
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:10,280
Now I'm talking like using that big old mouth of yours, wiggling me around, tossing me up on them.

1257
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:12,680
Then I can do some good work up close.

1258
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:17,240
I'm afraid if I get you in my mouth, the temptation to just chomp down will be too high.

1259
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:19,400
Tyler runs over and does it.

1260
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:22,120
Oh shit.

1261
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:28,440
He just flings you with his head real quick in one swift motion.

1262
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:33,800
I want to be flipped at the guy who has shit in his eyes and face,

1263
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:37,800
so that he doesn't see the beat down that's coming to him.

1264
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:42,040
Yeah, so he's got disadvantage, like a lot of it.

1265
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:43,400
No, he's like fully disabled.

1266
01:10:44,280 --> 01:10:47,640
Okay, I want to describe something terrible for you.

1267
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:50,360
Do you?

1268
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:53,240
I really do.

1269
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:59,800
Do you want a mass walk out of your podcast when you fuck with these adorable animals?

1270
01:11:01,240 --> 01:11:04,440
Choose your words carefully, motherfucker.

1271
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:08,120
I always try not to say um or like, but I still do sometimes.

1272
01:11:08,120 --> 01:11:08,680
It's okay.

1273
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:11,480
Um, like is it?

1274
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:17,800
As Chip is being flung at the Todd,

1275
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:24,360
who has his eyes covered in the fecal matter of Wilson the woodpecker.

1276
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:27,720
It's getting in his mouth because it's open because he's screaming about it

1277
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:31,240
and it's dripping down into his mouth and it's all over his tongue.

1278
01:11:31,240 --> 01:11:34,120
Like he just licked ice cream, but it wasn't his bird shit.

1279
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:38,680
And he's like, no, no, you hit him square in the jaw.

1280
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:44,680
And at the exact same time, you see a masked bandit

1281
01:11:45,320 --> 01:11:49,960
who has snuck out of its cage in the back of the animal control truck

1282
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:55,400
and is hitting the Todd on the opposite side of the head in the opposite direction

1283
01:11:55,400 --> 01:11:58,440
at the exact same time as you're hitting his chin.

1284
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:08,600
And the two of you chip the chipmunk and Rocky the raccoon just snap the Todd's neck.

1285
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:14,280
As his shoulders hit the ground, so does the back of his head.

1286
01:12:14,680 --> 01:12:17,320
Front of his shoulders, the back of his head.

1287
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:27,960
So facing up is his back and a face that's covered in Wilson the woodpecker shit.

1288
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:29,080
William.

1289
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:33,400
It's Wilson.

1290
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:34,120
It's Willie.

1291
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:36,360
Is it Wilson?

1292
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:38,200
I thought it was Willie.

1293
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:39,160
You didn't call me Willie.

1294
01:12:39,160 --> 01:12:39,880
I have been.

1295
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:41,000
It fits.

1296
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:54,120
Seeing that, Rusty gets into an aggressive stance and it starts growling at Sewage Joe.

1297
01:12:54,760 --> 01:12:56,920
And I just want to try to intimidate him.

1298
01:12:57,480 --> 01:13:00,280
We just killed your motherfucking co-worker.

1299
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:04,600
Why don't you step the fuck off, idiot?

1300
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:07,080
We'll roll power against power.

1301
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:17,960
Now I'm going to say Sewage Joe has a mental power of 30 because he's a flatter thing.

1302
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:24,680
Rusty is not super physically gifted.

1303
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:29,320
He's got a 20 decks and a 30 strength, but he has a 70 power.

1304
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:30,760
So unless I fuck up the roll.

1305
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:33,720
No, fuck.

1306
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:35,880
I rolled a 75.

1307
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:36,600
That's over, right?

1308
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:37,960
I rolled a 13.

1309
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:41,960
There was so much opportunity.

1310
01:13:41,960 --> 01:13:45,480
I thought that you critically failed based on your reaction.

1311
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:49,400
I just thought there was like, yeah, you were going to win.

1312
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:49,880
It's good.

1313
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:52,200
I like that amount of commitment.

1314
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:53,320
That's just my face, man.

1315
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:55,640
I like your face.

1316
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:56,520
Thanks, baby.

1317
01:13:56,520 --> 01:14:05,080
So I want you to tell me what is going through the mind of this Sewage Joe.

1318
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:08,760
When he looks into the eyes of Rusty.

1319
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:16,040
So as soon as Joe sees his best friend in the world, the Todd, shit on and like that

1320
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:17,240
like freaks him out.

1321
01:14:17,240 --> 01:14:23,320
But then he sees his fucking neck get snapped by a chipmunk and a raccoon.

1322
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:29,000
And then Rusty in the lead, Bean and Murphy flanking him.

1323
01:14:29,960 --> 01:14:33,160
Maybe Tyler's chasing his tail in the background.

1324
01:14:34,120 --> 01:14:39,240
But these dogs with their hackles up are like slowly advancing on him.

1325
01:14:39,240 --> 01:14:41,320
And you see the wolf in them.

1326
01:14:41,320 --> 01:14:45,960
They're a pack of predators and they're just staring him down and growling.

1327
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:48,600
And he knows he needs to get the fuck out of there.

1328
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:54,440
It convinces Sewage Joe to drive you all back to the creek.

1329
01:14:56,680 --> 01:14:57,800
Isn't it just right there?

1330
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:01,720
That would take longer.

1331
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:08,840
Rusty like locks eyes with him, growls and then points his snout at all the cages like

1332
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:09,340
in the back.

1333
01:15:10,040 --> 01:15:13,960
And he intimates that he needs to free the other animals as well.

1334
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:16,840
Oh, yes, no, I will be just one moment.

1335
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:17,800
I will do that.

1336
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:20,840
If he takes his time out here, I will head in there and I will take care of it.

1337
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:22,120
And then I will be right back.

1338
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:23,560
You started out French.

1339
01:15:24,280 --> 01:15:25,720
No, I have never been French.

1340
01:15:25,720 --> 01:15:28,760
I have only been what I am, which is Rocky the raccoon.

1341
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:36,600
And I will easily take everyone and get them out of there if you just have him stand there

1342
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:37,320
real quick.

1343
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:38,360
Yes, of course.

1344
01:15:38,360 --> 01:15:44,360
And so he, this little raccoon runs into the back of the animal control van.

1345
01:15:44,360 --> 01:15:49,400
And soon there's a parade of animals, three long.

1346
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:55,880
It's the raccoon that just went in there, a fox, a little red fox.

1347
01:15:56,680 --> 01:15:59,800
And there is a goat.

1348
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:06,120
Fox and a goat and a raccoon, but that's too many character voices to do.

1349
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:09,160
So we're going to get you guys back onto the Creek.

1350
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:14,760
And so can I, can Wilson do something else to enact his revenge?

1351
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:17,240
One bit of revenge from Wilson.

1352
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:17,560
Wait.

1353
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:17,720
Yeah.

1354
01:16:17,720 --> 01:16:18,920
Cause they cut my tree down.

1355
01:16:20,840 --> 01:16:22,680
Oh, well, one of them's dead.

1356
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:29,080
Or yeah, you helped to kill like in terms of eye for an eye.

1357
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:31,480
I want to, can I land on his head?

1358
01:16:31,480 --> 01:16:34,040
If you go for revenge, I will kill you.

1359
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:34,280
Why?

1360
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:41,640
You are one woodpecker against a grown human.

1361
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:43,880
I want to pick his eyeballs.

1362
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:49,800
Who just saw that woodpecker and a raccoon kill his best friend and a chipmunk.

1363
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:50,840
But I'm not sewage Joe.

1364
01:16:50,920 --> 01:16:52,920
You're a sewage Joe.

1365
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:53,640
Gloves off.

1366
01:16:55,640 --> 01:17:03,320
He'll try, but Rusty sees you like staring down at him and he's like, I just wanted to

1367
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:09,800
reiterate that animal control has nothing to do with cutting down trees in the park.

1368
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:12,040
I really think those were different people.

1369
01:17:13,480 --> 01:17:19,320
Maybe the utility company, or perhaps even just a local, you know, tree service.

1370
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:23,080
Uh, that tree might've been rotted, might've been about to fall.

1371
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:25,800
I just don't think this is the guy who cut down.

1372
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:31,000
Wilson, I know your hatred for humans runs deep, but you're, you're, you're, you're taking

1373
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:32,040
it too far, man.

1374
01:17:32,040 --> 01:17:34,040
We're, we got a mission to complete here.

1375
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:43,640
We're not saying he don't deserve to die, but Wilson is blinded by rage and brushes

1376
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:44,440
off the comments.

1377
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:47,320
Go for it, baby.

1378
01:17:48,040 --> 01:17:50,600
I want to land on his head and peck his eyeballs out.

1379
01:17:52,040 --> 01:17:55,240
He's already in the, he's in the, he's in the van.

1380
01:17:55,240 --> 01:17:57,000
I swooped through the open window.

1381
01:17:58,120 --> 01:18:02,040
It wasn't open and you smack into it and you're a killer.

1382
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:03,800
I only have one box check.

1383
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:04,040
Yes.

1384
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:05,080
Okay.

1385
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:09,320
Take your second damage, you motherfucker, because you definitely just flew.

1386
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:14,520
Wait, roll intelligence for the sake of playing.

1387
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:15,240
21 on a 20.

1388
01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:16,520
He knows what class is now.

1389
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:20,520
21 on a 20.

1390
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:22,040
That makes me so happy.

1391
01:18:22,040 --> 01:18:23,080
That is so perfect.

1392
01:18:25,240 --> 01:18:33,560
You slam into the glass of the animal control van and he looks out and you guys make direct

1393
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:36,520
eye contact as he's driving away.

1394
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:41,000
And let me tell you something Wilson, he looks scared.

1395
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:41,480
Good job.

1396
01:18:41,480 --> 01:18:46,680
Can I at least crack his window to make his day inconvenient other than his dead friend?

1397
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:52,440
Other than his partner dying and all the animals is hanging.

1398
01:18:52,440 --> 01:18:56,040
His best friend died and he was bad at his job.

1399
01:18:56,040 --> 01:18:58,920
The only two things that exist in this man's life.

1400
01:18:58,920 --> 01:18:59,560
I'll take it.

1401
01:18:59,560 --> 01:19:01,400
Oh, my window's cracked.

1402
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:03,720
This is a bigger inconvenience than my partner.

1403
01:19:03,720 --> 01:19:04,280
What a day.

1404
01:19:05,560 --> 01:19:08,840
But do please roll strength for cracking that window.

1405
01:19:08,840 --> 01:19:10,120
44 on a 70.

1406
01:19:10,680 --> 01:19:11,880
Critically succeeding.

1407
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:15,320
Yep.

1408
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:16,040
I'm content.

1409
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:19,480
You crack it so hard that it can't roll down.

1410
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:23,240
You fucking showed him, dude.

1411
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:27,560
Okay, let's get back to the creek, I guess.

1412
01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:31,960
As the van speeds away, Tyler's gonna give chase for the tire for a second.

1413
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:36,760
And then when it gets fast enough that he can't keep up, he comes back to join the group.

1414
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:43,640
When you join the group, Rusty, Bean, and Murphy all sniff your butt in my group hills.

1415
01:19:43,640 --> 01:19:45,080
Oh, thanks.

1416
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:46,680
Thanks, fellas.

1417
01:19:46,680 --> 01:19:51,880
I'm picturing just like a made pole dance of y'all just going around the circle,

1418
01:19:52,920 --> 01:19:54,440
conga line butt sniffing.

1419
01:19:54,440 --> 01:19:54,840
Oh, yeah.

1420
01:19:55,960 --> 01:20:00,280
Rusty says to the chipmunk and the woodpecker, you guys want to get in on this?

1421
01:20:01,480 --> 01:20:01,720
No.

1422
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:07,240
Chip stands back with his arms folded, but a little wry smile goes across his face.

1423
01:20:10,280 --> 01:20:12,440
He's like proud of his journey, doesn't he?

1424
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:17,800
I go and perch on the goats and horns and what's up, kid?

1425
01:20:24,040 --> 01:20:25,480
Can this goat be for hand pressure?

1426
01:20:27,480 --> 01:20:29,000
Well, of course.

1427
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:36,200
Hey, well, we're attracted to that goat lady.

1428
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:41,400
I don't think it's good.

1429
01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:44,200
We ought to get back to the safety of the creek.

1430
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:45,560
Yeah, Beans, we got you, Beans.

1431
01:20:46,360 --> 01:20:49,720
The squirrel, he sent us and we're supposed to bring it back to the creek.

1432
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:55,240
This actually, this seemed like a really good just like last shot of y'all celebrating in

1433
01:20:55,240 --> 01:20:56,040
the parking lot.

1434
01:20:56,040 --> 01:20:58,200
So I think let's just hang it out there.

1435
01:20:58,200 --> 01:20:59,000
Freeze frame.

1436
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:00,840
Freeze frame, credits roll.

1437
01:21:00,840 --> 01:21:06,360
All right.

1438
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:07,720
I think we should start recording.

1439
01:21:07,720 --> 01:21:08,360
Yeah.

1440
01:21:08,360 --> 01:21:09,720
Now that we've rehearsed it.

1441
01:21:09,720 --> 01:21:11,880
That was a really good dry run.

1442
01:21:13,080 --> 01:21:14,120
What are warmups for?

1443
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:22,520
While the credits are rolling, it has a shot of Wilson, the woodpecker, and it says Wilson

1444
01:21:22,520 --> 01:21:27,480
found a new favorite tree and never left it because he's deathly afraid that there are

1445
01:21:27,480 --> 01:21:28,760
windows in the sky now.

1446
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:32,600
It's really sad.

1447
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:33,240
He's content.

1448
01:21:34,280 --> 01:21:36,600
Are we going back to the creek or is this?

1449
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:38,360
No, what's your freeze frame, Justin?

1450
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:40,760
Pass for now.

1451
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:41,560
Not an option.

1452
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:45,080
I'll do some minor characters in between your guys's big ones.

1453
01:21:45,640 --> 01:21:47,400
And obviously Murphy will be the last.

1454
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:50,600
Murphy dies immediately.

1455
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:52,040
Yes, be careful, motherfucker.

1456
01:21:53,560 --> 01:21:56,440
Oh, right off the bat, we've got the very first one.

1457
01:21:56,520 --> 01:21:59,640
We've got Stallone, the old gray squirrel.

1458
01:21:59,640 --> 01:22:07,000
And it says Stallone carried his torch well, but not for long as he was gotten on the very

1459
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:13,320
next run, laying down his life for others on a run to get nuts.

1460
01:22:13,320 --> 01:22:15,000
It was Stallone, which one?

1461
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:15,480
Yep.

1462
01:22:15,480 --> 01:22:16,760
See, that's why he was first.

1463
01:22:16,760 --> 01:22:20,760
He was the squirrel that was the head of the contention Creek critter coalition.

1464
01:22:21,720 --> 01:22:23,640
Making way for a new leader.

1465
01:22:23,640 --> 01:22:25,160
Just a little foreshadowing.

1466
01:22:25,160 --> 01:22:26,120
Chip Montgomery.

1467
01:22:27,080 --> 01:22:31,880
Can chip Montgomery be the leader or does his beans going to be a chipmunk?

1468
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:35,560
He talks about how he wanted to be a leader, but people didn't believe in him.

1469
01:22:35,560 --> 01:22:38,120
And now he, after the successful mission, he's...

1470
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:38,840
I'm sorry.

1471
01:22:38,840 --> 01:22:42,680
You're, you're questioning whether a chipmunk can be a leader after a squirrel.

1472
01:22:44,120 --> 01:22:45,720
Well, squirrel is one thing.

1473
01:22:45,720 --> 01:22:46,200
Wow.

1474
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:46,920
But a chipmunk?

1475
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:48,200
Thomas, do you have a good one?

1476
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:49,960
Yeah, Rusty ate chocolate and died.

1477
01:22:50,760 --> 01:22:53,880
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1478
01:22:53,880 --> 01:22:55,400
God, who is the next smallest?

1479
01:22:55,400 --> 01:22:56,600
Oh, uh, Common.

1480
01:22:57,800 --> 01:23:02,200
Common died, uh, on the side of the road, dot, dot, dot.

1481
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:04,360
Or did he?

1482
01:23:04,360 --> 01:23:06,120
You know, something of that nature.

1483
01:23:06,120 --> 01:23:11,960
And then, uh, the dead possum picture up on the screen winks at you with a little star

1484
01:23:11,960 --> 01:23:12,280
that goes...

1485
01:23:12,280 --> 01:23:14,440
Oh, I'm glad Common's okay.

1486
01:23:14,440 --> 01:23:16,120
Even though I hate him and all his family.

1487
01:23:16,120 --> 01:23:24,120
Uh, and then RoPo is still just, uh, sitting like the picture of her is sitting on the

1488
01:23:24,120 --> 01:23:29,720
desk and then it says, uh, RoPo found out what the black goo was the hard way.

1489
01:23:29,720 --> 01:23:29,880
No.

1490
01:23:33,880 --> 01:23:38,120
The freeze frame on Tyler is him kind of veering away from the group.

1491
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:44,520
And, uh, he got distracted and saw a snake in the grass and started following it.

1492
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:46,200
And you guys haven't heard from him since.

1493
01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:47,800
I don't like that.

1494
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:51,960
Maybe he'll turn up at a dirty dog grooming in the city.

1495
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:58,520
There's a picture of Rocky the raccoon, uh, sniffing the butt of Rusty.

1496
01:23:59,480 --> 01:24:07,560
Rocky made a, made a good friend and then had to tragically watch him die slowly from

1497
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:08,840
chocolate poisoning.

1498
01:24:08,840 --> 01:24:10,040
Did Rocky give it to him?

1499
01:24:10,760 --> 01:24:11,560
Oh my God.

1500
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:14,600
Shared it with him unknowing.

1501
01:24:15,320 --> 01:24:19,000
I don't think animals know what they can't eat because then they wouldn't eat it.

1502
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:20,120
What is Chip's?

1503
01:24:20,120 --> 01:24:26,600
Chip would continue fighting to be the leader of the Contention Creek Critter Coalition

1504
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:31,320
despite his age, but no one would accept him because he's an old fat asshole.

1505
01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:39,960
And then there's a picture of Murphy and it says Murphy was immediately elected the new

1506
01:24:40,040 --> 01:24:42,280
leader of the Contention.

1507
01:24:43,960 --> 01:24:46,520
Thomas's eyes just lit up so big.

1508
01:24:47,640 --> 01:24:53,960
The Contention Creek Critter Coalition and remains leader fighting off

1509
01:24:57,880 --> 01:25:00,120
the chipmunk to this day.

1510
01:25:02,680 --> 01:25:04,440
That was the end.

1511
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:06,520
Did you guys like that?

1512
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:13,080
I don't know if we did a good job.

1513
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:20,040
I know I did a good job and that's all I care about.

1514
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:24,920
That's the only thing in my control.

1515
01:25:24,920 --> 01:25:29,560
I mean, we can talk more later about Thomas's job.

1516
01:25:31,320 --> 01:25:32,440
No, it was fun.

1517
01:25:32,440 --> 01:25:33,400
I like you guys.

1518
01:25:33,400 --> 01:25:34,360
Yeah, I had fun.

1519
01:25:35,160 --> 01:25:36,360
You're great too, man.

1520
01:25:36,360 --> 01:25:37,560
I'm going to start the recording now.

1521
01:26:09,960 --> 01:26:16,040
The only one trying to pull over.

1522
01:26:16,040 --> 01:26:24,040
How can you have enough drowning out of the noise.

1523
01:26:24,040 --> 01:26:30,040
With nobody home.

1524
01:26:30,040 --> 01:26:34,040
Nobody home.

1525
01:26:34,040 --> 01:26:38,040
Nobody home.
