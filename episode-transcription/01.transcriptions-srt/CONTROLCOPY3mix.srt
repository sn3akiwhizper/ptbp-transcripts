00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Welcome, my children, to the family reunion that is PTBP.

2
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:09,140
It's your Auntie Wolf here to talk your ear off

3
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:13,340
while feeding you some room temp potato salad.

4
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:17,380
If your potato salad ain't wet and milky,

5
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:19,300
you're making it wrong.

6
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:23,300
I'm feeding you live from 694.2.

7
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:27,080
I think maybe from Ocean City still.

8
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,860
I don't know, man, I ain't looked outside in a minute.

9
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:33,660
This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Rob in Atlanta.

10
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:34,700
Rob writes,

11
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:39,000
"'Mornin', Wolf, big fan Rob callin' in from the city.

but the drowning's been just fine.

00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:09,960
of this pit stop frees my mind,

81
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,480
So do you guys remember back in,

82
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,520
oh gosh, how long ago was this?

83
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,080
There was a few years ago where suddenly

84
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,520
everyone that Taylor and I knew from college,

85
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,680
Taylor being my wife,

86
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,280
for those of you who are new to listening,

87
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,040
you can see her guest appearing

88
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,960
in certain parts of the podcast

89
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,300
in season one and pretending to be b-ball.

90
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,300
Uh, but-

91
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,740
Was that a reference to season one?

92
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,580
God, no!

93
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:10,900
You said no references.

94
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,940
Ah, no references to season one.

95
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,020
So when Taylor and I were younger,

96
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:19,440
we're 29 now, when we were probably 25,

97
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,580
a lot of people here that we knew from college

98
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:24,000
in Springfield, Missouri started getting married,

99
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,300
and I was supposed to dress for weddings,

100
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,620
and I didn't have any fucking money at all,

101
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,820
and so I was like, basically what would happen

102
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:36,380
is I didn't have clothes to wear to a wedding,

103
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:39,460
so every single time I got invited to a wedding,

104
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,900
I would go to Kohl's,

105
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:46,100
because Kohl's has an insane return policy,

106
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:49,740
a very, very good lax return policy,

107
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:53,420
and so I would go and I would get a nice tie

108
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:57,140
or a nice suit coat or whatever I needed

109
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,940
to go to this wedding.

110
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:01,780
I actually, I said tie, but I never wear ties,

111
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:05,860
but I remember specifically for this story,

112
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,660
I got a new suit jacket from Kohl's,

113
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:12,420
a nice discount suit jacket that looked nice on me,

114
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:15,020
and then I wore it to this wedding,

115
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,280
and this wedding was actually really fun,

116
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,060
but it was one of Taylor's friends from a long time,

117
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,940
family, friends from an early age.

118
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,980
Zach, I just wanna get one thing clear real quick.

119
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,020
Yeah, hit me with it.

120
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:27,900
You lied about the tie.

121
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,140
How much of the rest of this is a lie?

122
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,220
Oh, all of it.

123
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,060
Yeah.

124
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:36,060
I was all set up, and so I went to this wedding,

125
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,880
and I didn't know anyone there,

126
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:43,700
and Taylor was in this group of four girls.

127
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,260
She was one of the bridesmaids,

128
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:48,520
and they were just having the time of their life

129
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:52,160
all reminiscing about when they were growing up together,

130
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:57,160
and I was pretty lit and did the photo booth by myself.

131
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,160
And did the photo booth by myself.

132
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,000
Well, it.

133
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,720
So there was a photo booth there

134
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,440
that would take four pictures of you

135
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,500
and then spit out a little image there

136
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,360
like you might in a photo booth,

137
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,380
and there were lots of little props there,

138
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:17,600
so I put on four different hats and just stared ominously

139
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:22,980
directly into the camera with the saddest face

140
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,320
that I could muster,

141
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,960
and so I had this amazing group of four pictures of me

142
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,220
in this looking fresh in this Kohl's suit,

143
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,240
and I took these pictures, and I was like,

144
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,160
man, I am gonna love these pictures forever,

145
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,080
and I stuck them in the inside pocket of my suit jacket,

146
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,280
and then I returned that jacket to Kohl's,

147
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,320
and as soon as I walked out the door,

148
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,760
I thought, oh no,

149
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:52,760
there is a picture of me inside of the pocket of that jacket

150
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,800
and not only is it just a weird set of four pictures

151
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:00,680
of a guy by himself looking sad as possible,

152
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,800
he's wearing that suit jacket.

153
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,640
But he's wearing the jacket that you just bought, yeah.

154
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,380
At least it looks like you're having a bad time

155
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,220
in that jacket.

156
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:11,600
Right, so if the Kohl's return person found it,

157
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,000
they would be like, oh, well, I see.

158
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,840
I see.

159
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,660
He did not enjoy the jacket.

160
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,200
He had a bad time.

161
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,480
This jacket would only bring forth negative memories

162
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,640
for this saddeman, but if he did,

163
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,240
just like throw it back on the rack,

164
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,520
somebody had the biggest mind fuck.

165
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,480
Yeah, straight up.

166
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,320
Maybe not.

167
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,000
They probably realized immediately what had happened.

168
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,360
That's weird that my suit jacket

169
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,000
is coming with stock photos.

170
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:38,400
Of a sad man in this jacket?

171
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,020
This kid looks poor.

172
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,800
They would have said,

173
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,500
based on how scraggly my beard probably was.

174
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,520
Yep.

175
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,720
Yep.

176
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,120
You were a great big fat person back then, right?

177
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,040
Buffalo Bill would have liked you.

178
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:58,920
Nope, nope.

179
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,760
No, that's just for us.

180
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,280
I am not editing that out.

181
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,480
No, do take out the body shaming.

182
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,760
That's just because we watched Silence of the Lambs.

183
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,800
Literally, then it makes sense for this exact moment.

184
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,800
I know, and you were a great big fat person.

185
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,800
I quit drinking soda

186
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,840
and I quit drinking Tom Collins' every night,

187
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:23,720
which at the time, for some reason, my mind was like,

188
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,000
I don't understand how every night

189
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
when I drink three pint-sized gin and tonics

190
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,680
with extra syrupy lime juice poured on top of it,

191
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,600
I don't understand why I'm getting so fat.

192
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,640
Yep.

193
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,080
So much sugar.

194
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,400
The calories in a drink will get to you, folks.

195
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,880
Yeah, but the calories in a drink

196
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:52,880
that's also filled with syrupy sugar is also no bueno.

197
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,000
I was literally putting simple syrup and sugary lime juice

198
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,620
in a drink that already had tonic water in it

199
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:04,600
because at the time, I didn't know that tonic water

200
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,440
already had a bunch of sugar in it.

201
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,120
Like as much as a soda.

202
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:08,960
That's why it's good.

203
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,120
That's why it's so fucking good.

204
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,400
Ah, so now I just drink beer.

205
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:17,680
It's honest, you know?

206
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,320
It is what it is.

207
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,880
Beer, for when you're counting calories.

208
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,040
It's fermented.

209
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,760
You can count a whole lot of them.

210
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,840
If you're practicing this well.

211
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,780
Saw a tweet that said I'm Midwest sober,

212
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:32,200
which means I'm just drinking beer these days.

213
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,680
Holy shit.

214
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,520
There was a, in Mad Men,

215
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:39,280
there was this guy like peed himself before a meeting

216
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,160
and they're like, you gotta go to rehab.

217
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,040
And one guy was like, yeah, I know,

218
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,520
so and so went to rehab and he only drinks beer now,

219
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,480
so he's doing good.

220
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,240
That actor.

221
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,060
Isn't that Brian Doyle Murphy?

222
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,480
Yeah, he was in God Bless America.

223
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,440
Brian Doyle Murray.

224
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,720
And that movie fucking rules.

225
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,720
Yeah, it does.

226
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,560
It really does.

227
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,380
Right, it does rule.

228
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,220
It's fucked up.

229
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,060
You know what?

230
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:00,880
I haven't seen it in a long time.

231
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,720
You're right, it might suck.

232
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,560
I don't know, it might suck.

233
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,480
I only recognize that guy from Shameless.

234
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,120
He played like a cuck.

235
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,200
He played William H. Macy in Shameless.

236
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:10,860
It's Bill Murray's brother.

237
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:11,680
Yeah, he's Bill Murray's brother.

238
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,520
What?

239
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,880
Yeah, guys, he's pretty famous.

240
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,100
Not Bill Murray famous, but sure.

241
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,160
I don't think it is.

242
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,320
The guy that I'm thinking of?

243
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,800
If you're thinking of Brian Doyle Murray, then it is.

244
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,640
If you're thinking of the guy

245
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,480
who pisses pants in Mad Men, that is.

246
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,480
That's not Brian Doyle Murray, is it?

247
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,320
Yeah, it is.

248
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,140
Yeah, it totally is.

249
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:28,980
Hold on.

250
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,000
What's his character's name in that?

251
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,840
And that's his whole deal,

252
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,460
is that he's the fun drunk guy, right?

253
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,280
Until it becomes too much of a problem.

254
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,700
Yeah, this guy's not in Mad Men.

255
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,540
The guy you're thinking of?

256
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:38,360
So that's what I was gonna say.

257
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,240
It's his other brother.

258
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,760
Look up Bill Murray's brothers.

259
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,600
Other brother.

260
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,420
Yeah.

261
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:45,640
He's another brother, and they eat nutter butters.

262
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,480
Butter, butter.

263
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,320
Dude, nutter butter.

264
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,040
I fuck with a nutter butter.

265
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:49,880
Yeah, dude.

266
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,520
For some reason, on the outside of a nutter butter.

267
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,360
Joel Murray.

268
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,280
Hold on, I'm talking about nutter butter.

269
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,920
I didn't know that was Bill Murray's brother.

270
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,880
Oh shit, I thought Joel Murray was Brian Doyle Murray.

271
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,520
Oh, this whole time it was Joel, not Brian Doyle?

272
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:06,360
Yeah, Joel is in Mad Men, and God bless America.

273
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,200
God bless America.

274
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,120
Yes, yeah.

275
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,760
What were you saying, though?

276
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,200
Before I rudely interrupted.

277
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,400
He was waxing poetic about nutter butters.

278
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,160
Oh, nice.

279
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,460
It's the sugar crystals on the outside

280
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:20,240
that really do it for me, if I'm being completely wrong.

281
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,920
There is nothing more horrifying

282
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,520
than listening to a podcast,

283
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,200
and you know that the hosts are incorrect.

284
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,200
And they keep saying the thing.

285
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,960
If I knew who Joel Murray was in my heart,

286
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,220
I would hate this.

287
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:40,200
Good, let's give him some negative feels,

288
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,980
because we are dealing with some very

289
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:45,820
unsettling situations here.

290
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:48,820
Wait, what are the peanut chocolate peanut butter?

291
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:49,760
Nutter butters.

292
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,140
Wafer things?

293
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:54,020
Oh, I know exactly.

294
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:54,860
Oh.

295
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:55,700
What are those called?

296
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,620
Fuck.

297
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,260
I like those more than nutter butters,

298
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,580
but I do like nutter butters.

299
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:02,420
Oh, chocolate.

300
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,380
Are those puffer nutters?

301
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,220
Peanut.

302
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,040
No.

303
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:06,700
Wafers.

304
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:07,540
What the fuck?

305
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:09,240
Are called nutty buddies.

306
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,440
Nutty buddies, yeah.

307
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,960
Or nutty bars.

308
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:12,800
Yeah, nutty buddies.

309
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,080
What the fuck is a nutter butter?

310
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,960
Nutter butters are shaped like a peanut, aren't they?

311
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,200
Yes, they are, and there's no chocolate.

312
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,700
And a fluffer nutter is marshmallow

313
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,100
and peanut butter sandwich.

314
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,400
Is that exactly what Elvis ate?

315
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,040
No, he liked something with peanut butter jelly

316
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:27,880
and bananas.

317
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,240
That's right, peanut butter, banana, and honey.

318
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,080
And honey.

319
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:31,900
And chocolate.

320
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,520
You're just the devil in disguise.

321
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,440
That's a fun Elvis song.

322
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,280
Thank you.

323
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:40,600
All right, let's get a recap of where we were at last time

324
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:45,160
because it's been one, I mean, we can let them in.

325
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,440
It's not been one week for us,

326
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,720
but it has been one week for the listener.

327
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,880
So let's give them a nice little recap

328
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:56,000
to get them in the mod for where we are now.

329
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,200
Shit's fucked up in Ocean City, New Jersey.

330
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,520
Yeah, it really is.

331
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:02,040
We got freaking, what's his first name?

332
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,040
Arvin Chilton.

333
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,960
We got an ex-Delta Green agent slicing up eyeballs.

334
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:09,440
That's right, and not slicing through the eyeballs.

335
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,300
Girl, you're so groovy.

336
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,880
I want you to know.

337
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,720
I don't know.

338
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,560
Slicing up eyeballs?

339
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,400
No, I don't know it.

340
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,220
Look, do you know it?

341
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:20,060
I am on chin and a Lucia.

342
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,360
Pixies, bro.

343
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,200
It's a Pixies song.

344
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,200
That's why I said it.

345
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,120
Cool.

346
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,440
Cool, yeah.

347
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,520
I read Fight Club.

348
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,440
That was, yeah, Frank Black's best book.

349
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,440
What's Kim's deal, though?

350
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,600
All right, so when you guys.

351
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,440
I get it.

352
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,480
Her deal is that she's in a better band.

353
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,320
Yeah.

354
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,200
Things are bad in Ocean City, New Jersey.

355
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,360
We got an ex-Delta Green agent

356
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,120
who's killing people close to him in his life.

357
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,880
Slicing up eyeballs.

358
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,200
Slicing up eyeballs.

359
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,480
Well, he's not slicing them up, though.

360
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,560
He removed them carefully.

361
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,740
He's taking them out real surgically.

362
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:00,620
We got down there.

363
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,100
We met up with an FBI agent

364
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,660
who pointed us toward his domicile,

365
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:07,180
and we went and talked to the landlord there.

366
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,800
He was kind of a weird guy,

367
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,620
and then I think it was him who recommended

368
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:13,300
we go over to a cafe and have a little lunch.

369
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,100
That was actually Mara Kinlan.

370
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:15,940
Oh, that's right.

371
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:18,620
We went back and talked to the NYPD who had been on this.

372
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,660
She was, yeah, she was Newark.

373
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,500
Newark.

374
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,340
Newark, yeah.

375
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,820
Did she give us anything good?

376
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:26,020
She disagreed with Uncle Jimmy

377
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:28,660
on the fact that Eileen McCarty,

378
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:32,800
he had this idea that Eileen McCarty was not the body

379
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,380
that was found in her own home

380
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:37,180
because she was seen by witnesses in two locations.

381
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:39,160
But she was like, it's definitely her.

382
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,540
Yeah, and then later, Agent Sparrow,

383
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:45,380
when she was looking over the actual high-res

384
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:47,860
like digital files from crime scene photos,

385
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:50,940
came to the same conclusion because Garza,

386
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,400
Uncle Jimmy with the FBI,

387
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,840
was using these like printed out-

388
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,680
Mayonnaise covered.

389
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,860
Mayonnaise covered crime scene photos.

390
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,300
Uncle Jimmy was, he was gross.

391
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,400
Yeah, he was gross.

392
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,240
He was gross.

393
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,780
Yeah, Agent Garza was pretty unprofessional.

394
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:08,660
We went to Arvin Chilton's apartment duplex,

395
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:11,140
which was above Alexander Duchesne's apartment.

396
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,500
Well done.

397
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,780
Who did that without notes?

398
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:14,620
I did.

399
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:16,100
I don't take notes, folks.

400
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,980
And we looked around.

401
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:23,300
He had a bunch of Shakespeare in his duplex.

402
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:26,580
And then we went downstairs and his landlord,

403
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,060
who lives below him,

404
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:31,580
had a copy of As I Lay Dying.

405
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:36,460
It was actually the things they carried.

406
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:38,300
Mother Faulkner and-

407
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,220
He had a copy of That Thing You Do.

408
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:44,800
He had a copy of There's Something About Mary.

409
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,380
And it was clearly overdue from Blockbuster.

410
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,220
That's right.

411
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,060
Which still existed in 4060.

412
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:53,220
It was called Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.

413
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,140
And we all sat down and watched it.

414
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,940
Luke, we literally sat down and had it on

415
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:00,220
before this started.

416
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,080
What's it called?

417
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,280
What's it start with?

418
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,100
As.

419
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,100
As I Lay Dying.

420
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:09,700
Band of the Book.

421
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,540
The book.

422
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:12,740
Or the James Franco adaptation of the novel.

423
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,300
That one.

424
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:17,580
No, his adaptation was the band of the band.

425
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:19,060
I didn't watch it for obvious reasons.

426
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:21,980
James Franco in the band As I Lay Dying.

427
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:24,460
As the world turns,

428
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:30,140
as you is mad.

429
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:33,220
As you imagined it.

430
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,420
Imagine dragging these balls on my face.

431
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:40,620
As you, I don't know what it was called.

432
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:44,220
I did look right at the title when we turned it on.

433
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,620
I know, and it's also a really famous Shakespeare play

434
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:49,260
that you've undoubtedly heard the title of

435
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,300
countless times in your life.

436
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,060
The Wind Flies.

437
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:53,900
I don't know what it is.

438
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,260
As the Crow Flows.

439
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,100
As You Like It.

440
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,540
As You Like It, as I said.

441
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,220
Do you like that?

442
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:03,340
I can't believe you made that great As They Lay Dying joke

443
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:05,260
without knowing what it was called.

444
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:07,460
I knew it was ads.

445
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:09,020
He had the ads, yeah.

446
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:12,060
Anyway, the landlord had a copy of that,

447
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,860
said that it was fitting,

448
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:16,940
and all of us having read that book play

449
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:19,700
and watch the college production of it.

450
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,720
We all pegged exactly what that meant, for sure.

451
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,500
Steely Dan was involved.

452
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:26,700
Pink, come back to me.

453
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,900
Anyway, he had a copy of that.

454
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:28,900
He said it was fitting,

455
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:33,180
and we knew that there's disguises involved in that book.

456
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,240
And he smelled like bandages.

457
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,080
What else did we find out?

458
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,620
Here's what's involved in that play,

459
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:40,900
is people pretending to be things that they're not.

460
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:43,500
People pretending to be other people.

461
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,420
Which we pointed out.

462
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:46,700
We already did the joke about our game,

463
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,300
so we're not gonna do that again.

464
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,820
We've done that.

465
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:50,660
Get over it.

466
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:51,480
But that is,

467
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,520
but that's the gist of it.

468
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:58,520
There's also some rural urban class friction themes.

469
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,480
It's pretty good.

470
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,600
I watched 30 minutes of it and then read the synopsis.

471
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,760
What else happened?

472
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,520
That's when we went over to the cafe,

473
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,640
and the waitress said,

474
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,720
man, there's this weird graffiti around the corner.

475
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,960
You should take a peek at it.

476
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,280
And boy, was it some weird graffiti.

477
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,680
Yeah, and we got really lucky with a critical role

478
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:20,080
that allowed us to season three.

479
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,840
I don't listen to that nerd shit.

480
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,680
I don't either.

481
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,360
That allowed us to recognize

482
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,720
it as a symbol of the Testament of New Flesh,

483
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,160
which is an organization obsessed with magic.

484
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,000
They chant in Aklo, a pre-human language.

485
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,440
Aklo language.

486
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:43,440
Yeah, and they worship some sort of eternal and elder being.

487
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,120
Oh shit, is this gonna be real Cthulhu?

488
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,120
Are we gonna meet Cthulhu?

489
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,160
Do you wanna meet Cthulhu?

490
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,080
I wanna meet Cthulhu.

491
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,600
We have in a campaign, haven't we?

492
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,600
Yeah, we had Cthulhu end one of our campaigns.

493
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,440
That's true.

494
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,680
Joe's character was on the beach looking out.

495
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,520
Yeah.

496
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,880
Yeah, that was pretty rad.

497
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,840
As Cthulhu just rose up.

498
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,480
Weren't the minions lifting me in the air?

499
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:11,200
The star spawn were lifting you up into the air

500
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,040
off the beach.

501
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,320
The minions from Despicable Me.

502
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,520
The minions from Despicable Me.

503
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,280
Stuart was there.

504
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,480
Kevin, Bob.

505
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,280
Yeah, all the classics.

506
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,120
I was gonna say,

507
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:25,120
I would rather have run into the Testament of Nude Flesh.

508
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,120
That's clever.

509
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,280
Cause you horny?

510
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,360
Cause I'm horny.

511
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,880
Everybody out there.

512
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,640
I'm really glad that out of all the different characters

513
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,520
that you guys have made for games that I've run for you,

514
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,080
none of you have ever been like,

515
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,320
and my character is horny.

516
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,880
If you wanna flirt with me,

517
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,200
you can do it out of game.

518
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,800
That's my rule.

519
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,720
Is that where we ended?

520
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,560
No.

521
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,400
What happened next?

522
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,480
We got a rude phone call that ruined our day.

523
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,480
And it was Duchenne saying that he had just gotten

524
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,480
a phone call that ruined his day.

525
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,640
And it was that Arvin had called and said, you're next.

526
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,280
So we sped over there.

527
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,640
How did he say that, Luke?

528
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,720
Oh, I'm gonna kill you.

529
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,560
Yeah.

530
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,160
Oh, I'm gonna kill you.

531
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,120
Slicing up eyeballs.

532
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,440
It sounded like you said slicing up bibles.

533
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,840
Slicing up bibles.

534
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,520
New Testament, gone.

535
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,840
Mickey says eyeballs.

536
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,800
Slicing up eyeballs.

537
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:43,760
And then we found out that he was in Ocean City.

538
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,320
No, we did not.

539
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,760
What we found out is that the phone call

540
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:52,320
came from Arvin Chilton's phone, which is in Ocean City.

541
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:56,120
And specifically, we found out after we went to go

542
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,920
keep watch over Duchenne that night.

543
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,160
We've got uniform PD.

544
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,400
We also had, yeah.

545
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,200
And we arrived ourselves at Duchenne's house.

546
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,760
When we called Chilton's phone,

547
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,840
we heard it vibrating upstairs.

548
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,200
And that's where we ended off.

549
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,440
Someone made an intelligence check about As You Like It.

550
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,480
I believe it was Agent Sparrow.

551
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,320
Which you passed and therefore you were allowed

552
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,680
to watch As You Like It today before we came in.

553
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,160
Right.

554
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,720
Otherwise you wouldn't have let me out of the cage.

555
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,080
I would have said, you cannot get out of this cage, Thomas.

556
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,760
Does it smell like David still?

557
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,200
I got some free time though.

558
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,800
And I watched As You Like It.

559
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,240
Why did we let him go?

560
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,080
I don't know.

561
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,000
It was such a rookie move.

562
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,480
It was so much fun to be a player.

563
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,960
All right, let's dig in.

564
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,120
It's March 25th, 2016.

565
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,120
The three of you are standing

566
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,000
in Arvin Chilton's apartment.

567
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,700
Say your character's names real quick

568
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,680
and your character voices starting with Joe.

569
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,520
Ellen Walling.

570
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,340
Now Luke.

571
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,180
Kevin Gelato.

572
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,100
Now Thomas.

573
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,360
Agent Clarissa Sparrow.

574
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,960
Wow, I loved that.

575
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,120
We should do that more often.

576
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:03,040
Okay, it's March 25th, 2016.

577
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:06,680
You're all in Alexander Duchenne's apartment.

578
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,200
It is pouring down rain outside.

579
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,160
It is now dark.

580
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,800
There are four squad cars outside.

581
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:18,560
You know that there are some ocean city.

582
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,400
Some ocean.

583
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,220
Sorry, I've got to snap.

584
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,060
I've got to take this.

585
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:21,900
Yeah, of course.

586
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:25,440
There's some ocean shitty police officers outside

587
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,240
who had their kick the dog moment

588
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,000
when they made fun of Kevin Gelato.

589
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:35,760
Yeah, he hasn't forgotten that.

590
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,040
He doesn't forget much.

591
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,800
And as the three of you are standing

592
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,640
inside Alexander Duchenne's apartment,

593
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,560
you've asked him to call back Arvin Chilton.

594
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,440
Brring, brring.

595
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,260
Brring, brring.

596
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,100
Brring, brring.

597
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:49,940
Brring, brring.

598
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:50,760
Brring, brring.

599
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,600
Brring, brring.

600
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,440
Brring, brring.

601
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,260
Brring, brring.

602
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:55,520
And you hear from upstairs,

603
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,520
look at this photograph.

604
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,520
Look at this photograph.

605
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,280
Look at this photograph.

606
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:04,920
Chad Krager classic photograph by Nickelback,

607
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:08,340
which is the vibrate thin ring, ring tone.

608
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,300
On Arvin Chilton's phone.

609
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:15,340
Let's go ahead and move in dexterity order.

610
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:17,600
So who has the highest dexterity?

611
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,440
60.

612
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,760
I got a 70.

613
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,600
60.

614
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,880
Joe, you were going to kick off in this-

615
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,920
So the phone rings and we're in combat?

616
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:30,280
Yeah, Joe is looking at me with like, incredulity.

617
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,240
Is it like that we're racing upstairs?

618
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,400
Nope, you can do whatever you want.

619
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,920
Okay, Elwood would not be the first one out the door.

620
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,000
Sure, you don't have to be.

621
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,200
Just because you're acting first

622
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,940
doesn't mean that you need to, you know.

623
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:42,780
Gotcha.

624
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,660
I thought that's what you were having us talk about,

625
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:45,920
is marching order kind of thing.

626
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,480
Well, we are talking,

627
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,320
we're talking just about action order.

628
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,040
So not marching order necessarily,

629
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:54,180
but we're going to start with what do you do?

630
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:55,720
Make wide eyes at the guys

631
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:59,020
and do the silence over the mouth thing and point up.

632
00:24:59,020 --> 00:24:59,860
Awesome.

633
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:01,920
I'm going to roll intelligence real quick.

634
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,200
Pass.

635
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,200
What are you looking for here?

636
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,880
The song is by Nickelback.

637
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,240
Thank you.

638
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,480
I was going to do something if I failed my intelligence roll

639
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,440
but I'm not going to do that.

640
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,800
Always fun when a role player in your group

641
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:17,240
decides to just voluntarily maybe fuck something up.

642
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,160
Hey man.

643
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,200
Zach's like, it's fun for me.

644
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,080
It's also what you've been a part of forever.

645
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,280
No, no, no, no, no.

646
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:31,820
We stumble into hilarious farce.

647
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:36,200
But if you're like, yeah, my guys yells.

648
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,280
He's too dumb.

649
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,080
It wasn't going to be that, but.

650
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,960
Hello?

651
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,400
Because Luke decided that he was thinking

652
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,280
about doing something,

653
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:50,000
let's just have agent Sparrow is going to go next.

654
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:50,840
Cool.

655
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,920
Agent Sparrow draws her gun

656
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,760
when she hears the vibrating phone.

657
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:57,080
And then she looks around to see how Duchenne is reacting.

658
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,360
He is immediately like,

659
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,320
and he's horrified.

660
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,720
And he is like looking for a place to hide.

661
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,160
Okay.

662
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:10,480
Can I do any kind of examination of him?

663
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,560
Like an ocular pat down and see if this is.

664
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,600
I want to see if he's wearing a human suit.

665
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,800
Okay, ocular pat down to see if he's wearing a human suit.

666
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,080
What do you want to roll for that?

667
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:23,920
What do you think?

668
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,760
Medicine or?

669
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:29,240
Search, medicine, intelligence, humans.

670
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,760
I think you would be able to determine.

671
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,520
My intelligence is telling me he's not human.

672
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,280
Three.

673
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:40,400
Oh, and three on the check.

674
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,760
That was supposed to happen.

675
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,600
It's on a timer.

676
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,240
A light just turned out in the room.

677
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,280
There's a grow light on the plants in the corner.

678
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,720
Cause I don't get enough sun.

679
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:57,160
He has the bearing of someone who is in public service

680
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,560
who worked for the feds.

681
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,920
Like the way that he reacted was something

682
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:03,040
that someone with military experience.

683
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:06,440
Like he's got big claws and fur all over him.

684
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,960
What did I say?

685
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:08,800
He said.

686
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,640
He has the bearing.

687
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,480
Oh my God.

688
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,760
I was like, I know it was.

689
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,600
I didn't think it was actually going to be relevant.

690
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:20,320
I thought it was a real big reach.

691
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,160
Like a bear might have.

692
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,000
Like a bear has.

693
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,600
Like a bear has.

694
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,040
Thomas is forgetting his background.

695
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,440
He was not in any kind of law enforcement or.

696
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,520
All that you know about Alexander Duchene

697
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:35,680
is that he supposedly played baseball when he was younger.

698
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:38,120
And you like don't know if that was.

699
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,400
I mean, he said he wasn't very good at it,

700
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,400
but that's all you really got about him.

701
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,920
You don't know a lot about him.

702
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,320
He's old enough to have been retired though.

703
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,480
And landlord is the retirement thing.

704
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,800
Oh, a hundred percent.

705
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,360
He's 79 years old.

706
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,480
Yeah.

707
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,360
Which like, you know, for me, I'll still be working.

708
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,200
That's right.

709
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,040
That's because.

710
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:01,280
Yeah, everyone listening here will be working

711
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:04,920
in the water mines until.

712
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,560
But here in 2016, a 79 year old is still

713
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,840
pulling social security.

714
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:09,760
Right.

715
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,080
Not working for Bezos H2O.

716
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,680
When you say that, does he look like a 79 year old man

717
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,760
who has that background?

718
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:19,560
Or does this look like Arvin Chilton in the body

719
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:22,880
or like something controlling his body in an unnatural way?

720
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:27,080
Go ahead and roll sanity agent Sparrow.

721
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,560
Pass 58 on a current 80.

722
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:32,080
Yeah, this is just learning something new

723
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:32,920
about Alexander D. Shane.

724
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:36,160
Damn it, this is when I should have failed sanity, right?

725
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,920
This is just learning something new

726
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,600
about Alexander D. Shane.

727
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,840
This is an interesting moment of conflict for Thomas.

728
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,680
Yeah, of course.

729
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,720
Because I have a lot of suspicions

730
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,540
about what's going on here.

731
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:46,380
Why wouldn't you?

732
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,840
However, the main thing is that agent Sparrow

733
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,640
doesn't know she's in a scenario called control copy.

734
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,480
Sure.

735
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,400
I don't know why you keep saying that

736
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,960
because I don't know what that means.

737
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,360
Shut the fuck up.

738
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,360
Don't gaslight me.

739
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:05,100
I don't know anything about computers.

740
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,920
No, it's your job, but.

741
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,040
It's my job to gaslight you.

742
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,620
That's what a DM does.

743
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:15,880
In Delta Green, yeah, like half the time for sure.

744
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,720
Yeah.

745
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,480
So without metagaming, what do you do next?

746
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,680
Like my only possible actions

747
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,300
lead me towards a terrible fate.

748
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,580
Right, yeah.

749
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:27,500
But I guess that's the game we play, so.

750
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,340
It is.

751
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:30,940
She, passing that sanity test,

752
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:33,420
she all of a sudden thinks he might be

753
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:35,980
a little more capable than she estimated.

754
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:36,820
Sure.

755
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:40,420
So she says to the uniformed PD,

756
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:42,860
you stay on him, you protect him.

757
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:44,420
I'm going upstairs.

758
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:46,340
Luke, what is Kevin Gelato doing?

759
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:49,800
He looks up at where the vibration is coming from

760
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,740
and looks down at his hand.

761
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:53,140
Which is balled up into a fist.

762
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:53,980
Right.

763
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:57,060
Sorry, let me say that again without vaping my mouth.

764
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:59,440
He looks down at his hand, which is balled up into a fist,

765
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,460
but then he sees Sparrow start heading towards the door

766
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:05,580
and decides to follow her.

767
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:06,580
I'll go first.

768
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:08,260
And he heads up the stairs.

769
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:09,260
No, no, wait.

770
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:10,500
He waits.

771
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,860
Let me in first.

772
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:13,980
He lets her in front of him.

773
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:16,900
Okay, are you approaching the stairs stealthily

774
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,700
or are you gonna run up them?

775
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,900
Stealthily, but quickly.

776
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,060
Which one of the two of you

777
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:24,480
has the worst stealth of the two?

778
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:26,540
I don't have any.

779
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:27,360
I have 10%.

780
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,200
Yeah, same.

781
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,540
Okay, so either one of you can roll.

782
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:32,680
You should roll.

783
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,780
I got a 91.

784
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,820
She's like running up like FBI.

785
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:41,100
She's not saying it, but she runs up the stairs,

786
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:41,940
drawn gone.

787
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:45,220
And behind her, I mean, behind her, you hear.

788
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:47,820
Dump, dump, dump.

789
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:48,640
Wha-choo!

790
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,800
Bless you, but be quiet.

791
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,340
And the door is closed.

792
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:55,580
Locked?

793
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:57,120
No, she opens it.

794
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,680
So just like in Silence of the Lambs,

795
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,980
which we watched yesterday,

796
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:03,240
remember at her Quantico training,

797
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,560
where she gets capped.

798
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,960
Oh, yeah.

799
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,120
From behind the door, she missed the corner.

800
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,440
She didn't check her corners.

801
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,960
She carefully opens the doors, checking her corners.

802
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,160
I love trade craft.

803
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,800
Feels so good when it's well used in a game.

804
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,180
Man, that's excellent.

805
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:19,780
Okay, so because you checked the corners,

806
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:22,200
you get to see the same thing you would have seen

807
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:26,620
if you hadn't, which is absolutely nothing different

808
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:29,940
in this room except for there is a phone

809
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:32,940
sitting on the kitchen countertop.

810
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:34,720
Can we clock that it definitely wasn't there

811
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,260
the last time we were in the apartment?

812
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:39,780
100% it wasn't, but question for Elwood Boyd.

813
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:42,180
Are you now upstairs or are you hanging out downstairs?

814
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:45,180
I am standing behind Kevin like he's a human shield.

815
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,020
Okay, perfect.

816
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:48,260
Literally peeking out from behind it from time to time.

817
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:50,260
Yes, and your hands went up to prove it.

818
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:55,380
Are there any security cameras on the property?

819
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,140
No, none that you're aware of.

820
00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:01,320
What if I rolled electrician to see if there is one?

821
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,920
Yeah, okay, go ahead and roll.

822
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:03,780
It's my craft.

823
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:04,900
Okay, fantastic.

824
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,280
I love a craft.

825
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:09,220
Just four young witches learning how to.

826
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:11,300
There's not any security cameras.

827
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,140
Thomas showed me the craft.

828
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:14,020
I'd never seen it until Thomas showed me that movie.

829
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:14,980
A couple of Halloween's ago.

830
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:15,860
No, yeah, I remember it,

831
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:17,300
but I think that was the first time I watched it too.

832
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,740
Oh, nice, it was rad.

833
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:19,580
What's up?

834
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:24,580
What about a dating show with witches

835
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:27,200
called Craft American Singles?

836
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:29,860
Yeah.

837
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:34,820
The Craft American Singles, but yeah.

838
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:38,780
It's always good when a show has sponsorship built into it.

839
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:40,460
Oh yeah, it's paid for already.

840
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,100
Yeah, wait, forget the witches.

841
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,900
Can this just be a cheese dater show?

842
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,660
What kind of cheese do you like?

843
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,040
I only eat craft.

844
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,900
I failed, so there's not any security cameras.

845
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,740
Oh, you failed, okay, sounds good.

846
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:57,460
No security cameras around to speak of that you know of.

847
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:59,560
Everything seems to be in the exact same place

848
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,400
where it was left.

849
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,220
No footprints or anything.

850
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:03,060
Like bloody footprints obviously right there.

851
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:05,540
No obvious bloody footprints, no.

852
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:07,300
Can I get this room and ocular pad down?

853
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,780
Absolutely, roll forensics for me.

854
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:10,620
Eight.

855
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:13,740
An eight on a forensics check shows that yes,

856
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:16,380
someone has absolutely been in this apartment.

857
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:18,060
You can tell because there's now a phone

858
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:20,100
in the middle of the table.

859
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:25,100
There's a path of dirt in between the front door

860
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:29,100
and the kitchen where the phone is.

861
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,380
If I forensic that and get a critical success,

862
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,380
can I Sherlock it?

863
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:35,460
You would absolutely Sherlock the entire fucking thing.

864
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:36,300
This is from.

865
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,300
So yeah, I failed.

866
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:44,820
She leans down and like picks up some of the dirt

867
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:47,040
and rubs it between her fingers and smells it.

868
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,980
And this person had stepped in dog shit

869
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:50,180
and she got some dog shit.

870
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:51,340
Yeah, a hundred percent.

871
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:53,500
But you know that that dog shit was fresh.

872
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:56,660
So like this clearly happened in between the time

873
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:59,740
where you were here earlier and now.

874
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:02,260
Kevin sees her doing that and is like,

875
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:03,900
oh, that's maybe I should do that too.

876
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:05,300
Maybe I should smell the dog shit.

877
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:08,420
And he like eats a little bit of it.

878
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:09,260
Yeah.

879
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:10,080
He's like.

880
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:10,920
No, no, yeah.

881
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:11,760
He just nods his head.

882
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,000
No, I hate this.

883
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:13,840
Yes, keep doing it.

884
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:17,400
He nods his head in his mind.

885
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,360
He's like, that's definitely dog shit.

886
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,520
I've had that before.

887
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,360
Sure.

888
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:25,040
But he just nods his head having no idea

889
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:25,960
what she's thinking.

890
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,440
She gives him the saddest look.

891
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,900
He thinks she's sad because she can't figure out

892
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,400
where the dog shit came from.

893
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,240
Oh.

894
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,200
Four rolls.

895
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,040
What's up guys?

896
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:46,300
Zach rolled the dice four times and then didn't say anything.

897
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:50,200
If Elwood feels like the room is empty, do I?

898
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,040
Yep.

899
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,160
I want to go in and go to the phone.

900
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:54,260
I want to grab the phone and I want to look through it.

901
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,440
Is this a studio?

902
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,280
Yeah.

903
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,120
Okay.

904
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:57,940
We're in the only room.

905
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:58,780
You are in the only room.

906
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:00,960
The only other thing is the bathroom.

907
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,760
There's two doors, closet and bathroom.

908
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,120
Does that dirt trail lead to the bathroom?

909
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:04,960
Nope.

910
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,080
Does that dirt trail lead to the closet?

911
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,240
Nope.

912
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,540
Does that dirt trail lead to the phone

913
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:09,380
and then back out the door?

914
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:10,220
Yep.

915
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:11,040
Okay.

916
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,100
This dirt trail leads out the floor.

917
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,280
This dirt trail leads to the door and out and...

918
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,360
This dirt trail leads to the door after it leads

919
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:26,320
to the phone, which it led to from the door.

920
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,880
It's actually dog shit, not dirt.

921
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,160
I know.

922
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,000
Me too.

923
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:34,720
Yeah, I know too.

924
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,880
I saw, yeah.

925
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,200
Maybe he has a...

926
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,040
Does that...

927
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:38,880
Alvin?

928
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,480
What's his fucking name?

929
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,320
Arvin.

930
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,140
Arvin.

931
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:42,980
Arvin.

932
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,800
But I thought his name was Alvin last episode too.

933
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,640
Arvin!

934
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,200
Does Arvin have a dog?

935
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,240
I have a feeling it's probably just an environmental hazard.

936
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,080
Okay.

937
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,680
Have you ever stepped in dog shit?

938
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,320
No.

939
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,160
Well, I have.

940
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,240
I was never trying to.

941
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:03,440
Whoa, what a weird way to answer that question.

942
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,280
I just assumed.

943
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,200
He didn't want to be embarrassed.

944
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:08,000
Yeah, she's like, who steps in dog shit?

945
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,360
I don't step in dog shit.

946
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,240
It's okay, everybody steps in it sometimes.

947
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,080
You don't know.

948
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:13,900
A lot.

949
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:14,740
Some people even say it's good luck.

950
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:15,760
A lot, I'm lucky.

951
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,640
Yeah, because after you stepped in dog shit,

952
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,520
what's the worst thing that could happen to you that day?

953
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,000
You get it in your mouth.

954
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,700
Yeah, you did that.

955
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,120
You did that.

956
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,140
But that happened before.

957
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,720
You haven't stepped in any of it yet.

958
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,560
No.

959
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,480
So there you go.

960
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,960
Once you've stepped in it,

961
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,680
probably nothing worse will happen

962
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,000
than putting that shit in your mouth.

963
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,300
What kind of phone is it?

964
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:36,140
Good talk.

965
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:37,560
I watched a trailer today.

966
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,960
Quick trailer alert.

967
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,280
Trailer alert!

968
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,000
You guys know how we do trailer alerts?

969
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,080
Yeah, classic trailer alert.

970
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,360
Stop trying to make trailer alerts a thing.

971
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,520
Trailer alert!

972
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:51,320
We watched a trailer for a Netflix Christmas movie today

973
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,620
with the guy from Crazy Rich Asians

974
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:56,840
and the blonde girl from Game of Thrones.

975
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,680
And-

976
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:02,200
They, she, a bird shits in her eye.

977
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,040
Nice.

978
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:03,880
And she fucking dies.

979
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:06,220
And he tells her it's good luck.

980
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:08,680
And she's like, what?

981
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:09,520
That's-

982
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,740
And he's like, do you want to go out with me?

983
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:11,740
And she's like, no.

984
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,280
Yeah.

985
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,240
Dog shit I get.

986
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,080
If a bird shits in your eye-

987
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:20,040
A bird shit in her eye and they show it in the trailer

988
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:24,240
of like the goop hitting, which now, uh oh, side story.

989
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:27,200
I saw Kings of Leon perform after the-

990
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,040
In a bird shit in your eye?

991
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,480
I think you told this on the pod already.

992
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,320
Have I?

993
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,640
Oh, okay, then I won't tell it again.

994
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,960
But when I saw Kings of Leon,

995
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:38,440
they played outside in a bird shit in the bassist's mouth.

996
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:42,580
And they shut down the show after three songs.

997
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:43,640
I remember that was in the news

998
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:44,860
when it happened because of that.

999
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:46,880
Okay, they opened with Closer,

1000
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,200
which is the first song off Only By The Night.

1001
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,520
And then they played the next song off Only By The Night,

1002
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,360
which is Crawl, which is a fucking jam.

1003
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,620
And then they played Taper Jean Girl,

1004
00:37:57,620 --> 00:38:00,200
which was fucking rad.

1005
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:03,560
And so I heard the only three songs I like

1006
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:08,200
by Kings of Leon and during the third one, a bird strip.

1007
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:11,960
I watched the shit fall down from the rafters

1008
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:14,840
and the bassist looked up at just the wrong time

1009
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:17,240
and it landed directly in his mouth.

1010
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:21,920
He ripped his bass off of himself and walked off stage.

1011
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,600
And then they finished the song and left.

1012
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,020
That's so lame.

1013
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:27,880
Listen, I don't know how much shit

1014
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,400
went how far down his throat.

1015
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:33,800
I can imagine a scenario in which I need to stop the show.

1016
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,360
But I think in most scenarios,

1017
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,040
if a bird shit in your mouth,

1018
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,920
you fucking wash that shit out.

1019
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:39,760
You take a minute.

1020
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,600
You take a minute and you go to bed.

1021
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,880
You take a minute and then you go play a kick ass rock show.

1022
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,280
It was made exponentially better

1023
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:49,760
because Justin Bieber broke his leg on stage

1024
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,120
and finished the show.

1025
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,840
Justin Bieber just out rockstar'd you.

1026
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,920
Yeah, and they're like.

1027
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:56,760
He's a pop star.

1028
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:59,880
They're like, we're southern whiskey drinking boys.

1029
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:00,840
Is that their deal?

1030
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,660
Yeah.

1031
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:02,500
I thought that the deal was

1032
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,340
that they were vaguely Christian.

1033
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:06,000
Their dad was like a tent preacher or something.

1034
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,240
We should get back to the episode.

1035
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:12,240
So there is a phone sitting on the kitchen countertop.

1036
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,040
I wanna pick it up and look through it.

1037
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:14,860
Yeah, of course.

1038
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:18,280
It matches all the incoming and outgoing phone calls

1039
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,200
that you would recognize from the log

1040
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:23,000
that you got from the FBI.

1041
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,720
I wanna check text messages.

1042
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,420
Yeah, when you go into text messages,

1043
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:29,240
there are very few and far between.

1044
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:32,460
It seems that Chilton was not much of a texter.

1045
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:34,840
Can I look for correspondence with his ex-wife

1046
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,720
before that phone call that she received

1047
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,960
a few days before she died?

1048
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:41,960
It had been a long time since he had called her, yeah.

1049
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:42,920
Is there a role I can do

1050
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,880
to make sure I'm not missing anything in this phone?

1051
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,020
What do you wanna roll for that?

1052
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:47,120
I'll do it too.

1053
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,480
That's an eight on SIGINT.

1054
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,100
Oh dude, hell yeah.

1055
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:53,560
So, cause you rolled SIGINT and I love that skill

1056
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,720
and we never use it,

1057
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,920
if you go through the photos

1058
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,840
and you start scrolling through,

1059
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:05,840
you're gonna realize that each panel of like nine photos,

1060
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:12,080
the top left, top right, bottom left and bottom right,

1061
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:16,720
remind you strangely of like the points

1062
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,680
of that weird pentagram thing.

1063
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,520
The flesh pentagram.

1064
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,360
The Vitruvian man pentagram.

1065
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:22,480
Yeah, that you saw earlier.

1066
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,600
And all the nudes remind us

1067
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:26,120
of the testament of the nude flesh.

1068
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:26,960
Pfft.

1069
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:27,800
Mm-hmm.

1070
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,840
Mm-hmm.

1071
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,000
That really got me.

1072
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:30,840
It did.

1073
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:33,080
I felt like I stole something.

1074
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,680
Like that wasn't that good.

1075
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:35,520
Mm-hmm.

1076
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,400
Arvin Chilton, or whoever was using this phone,

1077
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:44,280
is clearly involved with

1078
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,960
the testament of the nude flesh.

1079
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:46,800
Thank you.

1080
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:51,400
Maybe we, you should Google the new flesh

1081
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:55,560
and see if we can join in quotation words.

1082
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,480
While I'm holding this phone,

1083
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,920
can I just Google that, the testament of the new flesh?

1084
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:01,960
When you go to Google the testament of the new flesh

1085
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,800
and it autofills.

1086
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,640
Autofills, sure.

1087
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:09,080
Autofilled, he's been looking it up himself.

1088
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,400
Have you seen these pictures here?

1089
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,320
He's even like doing the diagram in his photos.

1090
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,560
He knows something.

1091
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:17,040
He's part of this group, I think.

1092
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,880
Seeing that pattern that they've seen in the photos,

1093
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:22,960
she asks Elwood, if you go to the call logs,

1094
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:26,480
are there any numbers, new numbers that start appearing

1095
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,640
around the same time as that photo pattern?

1096
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,040
Let me see here.

1097
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:34,040
It looks like there's, yeah, there's one here

1098
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:37,560
that he hadn't called before, the 20th.

1099
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,440
Yeah, it's a new one to him.

1100
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,920
When did he last call it?

1101
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:41,960
I wonder when he last called it.

1102
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:42,800
23rd.

1103
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,880
Click on the info and it says the 23rd.

1104
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,240
That was the day, three days after the deaths?

1105
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,080
Two days after the deaths.

1106
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,400
Two days after the initial deaths,

1107
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,720
but the same day as the gas station death.

1108
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,440
Yeah, what time is the call

1109
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,840
in relation to the gas station death?

1110
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:56,840
Earlier.

1111
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,020
Okay.

1112
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:01,240
And the date of the first phone call?

1113
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,320
The day before.

1114
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:04,960
So the day after the McCarty's were murdered

1115
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,520
and then the day that the gas station attendant,

1116
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,240
Quentin Harris was murdered.

1117
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,240
But before the murder occurred.

1118
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,120
But before that Quentin Harris murder.

1119
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:17,480
And this is just like a phone number, not a saved contact.

1120
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,320
It doesn't say like.

1121
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,160
Not a saved contact.

1122
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,160
Cool cult number.

1123
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,080
It does not say cool cult number.

1124
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:24,640
Is the area code the same like Ocean City?

1125
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,480
Great question.

1126
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:29,800
It is, it is not an Ocean City number.

1127
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,600
Is it like a New York City number?

1128
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,360
It's Newark, baby.

1129
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,200
Newark.

1130
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,480
No, sorry, shit.

1131
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,400
Am I dumb?

1132
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,540
Do you not know your nation's area codes?

1133
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,280
It's 417 and Zach made the call.

1134
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,080
No, I'm sorry, it's Newark.

1135
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:46,920
And is there a duration listed

1136
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,440
for how long these calls lasted?

1137
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:52,560
The first one is two and a half minutes

1138
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,740
and the second one is 30 seconds.

1139
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,480
Oh, okay.

1140
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:00,560
Oh.

1141
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,800
Zach's rolling and laughing.

1142
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:05,640
Four times.

1143
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:07,360
Oh my God.

1144
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:09,320
Again for the second time.

1145
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,700
Everybody roll alertness.

1146
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:13,600
94.

1147
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:16,200
Four.

1148
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,480
I pass with a 14.

1149
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:21,740
It is raining outside.

1150
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:23,480
The highest success was a 14?

1151
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:24,880
Yeah, it's raining outside.

1152
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:34,160
It's like I'm on the last bend of the deep end

1153
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:38,000
but the drowning's been just fine.

1154
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,320
And when my ears pop and the shell shock

1155
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:46,280
of this pit stop frees my mind.

1156
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:48,360
I'll be all right.

1157
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:53,360
I can go there now that I stare death in the face.

1158
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:56,520
I'll be all right.

1159
00:43:56,520 --> 00:44:01,520
I can go there now that I stare death in the face.

1160
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:23,840
Doesn't it always seem like the parts that made us laugh

1161
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:25,800
now make us cry?

1162
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:30,840
Doesn't it always seem like the villain

1163
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:34,240
pulling the strings is a regular guy?

1164
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:40,440
You and me have gone bad in a good way, I promise.

1165
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:48,480
Kerosene wipes clean what we couldn't bear to tarnish.

1166
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:49,480
I'll be all right.

1167
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:54,480
I can go there now that I stare death in the face.

1168
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:57,480
I'll be all right.

1169
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:02,480
I can go there now that I stare death in the face.

1170
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:23,480
I can go there now that I stare death in the face.

1171
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:45,480
There's a conundrum in the wisdom of my spirit.

1172
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:50,480
White washed hymns and the deadliest sins

1173
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,480
push me to my limit.

1174
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:57,480
But when you deconstruct

1175
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:01,480
you're shit out of luck for a minute.

1176
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:09,480
After the last bend you can break it all down to rebuild it.

1177
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:35,480
You and me have gone bad in a good way, I promise.

1178
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:43,480
You and me have gone bad in a good way, I promise.

1179
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:47,480
I'll be all right.

1180
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:53,480
I can go there now that I stare death in the face.

1181
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:55,480
I'll be all right.

1182
00:46:55,480 --> 00:47:01,480
I can go there now that I stare death in the face.
