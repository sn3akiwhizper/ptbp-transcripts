1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
What is up, my babies?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
It is your trustworthy radio DJ father figure and confidant, Wolf the Dog,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and I am here to deliver you the newest of news on the newest and only radio station here in contention.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
That is right. You are tuned into 694.2. PTBP.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And I am wet. My love of trash is strong. And I am covered in grease.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
You love that, listener. You love it.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
And I love this community. A community so trusting and smart,

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
we decided to build a delta green scenario through prompt-based writing contests.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I, Wolf the Dog, am now announcing the winner of the first writing contest.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Drumroll, please. The winner is...

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Congratulations, you.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
In the second writing prompt, we will be creating the setting for this scenario.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Join us over at reddit.com slash pretending pod.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Thank you, trusted listeners and friends.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Fuck Mark Zuckerberg.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Fuck Mark Zuckerberg.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Fuck Mark Zuckerberg.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It is the news.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Silas Cole is the best thing that has ever happened to the small, unfortunate town of contention.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You all should give him the respect he deserves.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And do not question his decisions.

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The townsfolk who are going missing are not missed.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Maybe they even deserved it.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Trust in Silas Cole.

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
He gave you lights.

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And he is now moving your hair around in a pleasant fashion.

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Why would you not trust a man like that?

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And now, vocal and instrumental sounds combined in such a way as to produce beauty of form, harmony, and expression of emotion.

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It is the creek rocks with canteen you hear them wolves they howl in.

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Can't you hear them wolves howling all around my poor little darling.

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
All around my poor little darling I'm afraid they'll get my darling.

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Can't you hear them wolves howling all around my poor little darling.

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
All around my poor little darling I'm afraid they'll get my darling.

34
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Can't you hear them wolves howling all around my poor little darling.

35
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,000
All around my poor little darling I'm afraid they'll get my darling.

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I was doing some research on hand washing during the old western times.

37
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And just like throughout history in general.

38
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And there's a sentence that I want to read to you guys that stuck out to me.

39
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Though perhaps lesser known, an important pioneer of hand washing was the Vienna based Hungarian obstetrician Ignaz Semmelweis.

40
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Who was alive from 1818 to 1865.

41
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Who realized that laboring women caught perpetual fever from doctors who went straight from the morgue to the delivery room.

42
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Oh no.

43
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
No.

44
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Is that real?

45
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
They had some crazy fetishes.

46
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It's a good observation Ignaz.

47
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Yeah good job that he was the one that picked up on that.

48
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Oh no I don't think anyone believed him.

49
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
They probably stoned him to death outside somewhere.

50
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You mean I gotta wash him after I touch the body? Why?

51
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Then all the juice will be gone.

52
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
The dead guy juice is good for the baby's immuno-system.

53
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Immuno-systems.

54
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Yeah. Life ends and life begins.

55
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Well you want to smear a little bit of wisdom on the baby's head.

56
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
And say Simba.

57
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You can't breathe water. What if I wash my hands and then touch my face and drown?

58
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Listen. There's probably another study that proves that babies who weren't touched by the hands of a man who had been groping a corpse aren't as successful in life.

59
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
So...

60
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I've read those studies.

61
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Yeah I've made them and I've read them.

62
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I wrote the studies and I read them all the time.

63
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
For what?

64
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
For fun.

65
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
For funsies?

66
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
For funsies.

67
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
For funsies my medical journal that I write.

68
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Which is called For Funsies.

69
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
If you had to be a doctor what kind of doctor would you be?

70
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Pussy.

71
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Oh my god.

72
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Is that the medical term?

73
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Yeah.

74
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I don't know. I'm not a...

75
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm not a pussy doctor.

76
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'm not a pussy doctor.

77
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Thomas Cox PD.

78
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Don't you mean PhD?

79
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
No.

80
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
No? What?

81
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I'd go Cox South.

82
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Cox South.

83
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Ball doctor.

84
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Ball doctor.

85
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Urologist probably.

86
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
A pee-pee doctor.

87
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You don't pee out your balls Luke.

88
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Yeah but it's close.

89
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
That's where it's stored though.

90
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
We're all very good at science.

91
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Zack even a first grader knows that.

92
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
That's your pee Zack.

93
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'm a doctor Zack.

94
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Pee-pee.

95
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
And I am here since.

96
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Excuse me what did you say?

97
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Pee-pee.

98
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Pee-pee.

99
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
That's what I studied in medical school.

100
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I'm a physical penologist.

101
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
A penologist.

102
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I'm a penologist.

103
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I can tune pianos and I can look at your pee-pee.

104
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Well I think I'm a piano doctor.

105
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
What is it? You have to have 10,000 hours to be a master?

106
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Yeah.

107
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Yeah you have all kinds.

108
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'm a 30 times master.

109
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You can be a man in what? A week?

110
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
How many hours are in a week?

111
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Five hundred twenty-five thousand.

112
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Five thousand six hundred.

113
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred hours.

114
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
That's how long it takes to get good at pee-pee doctoring.

115
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You can take that out.

116
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I'm not gonna now.

117
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
But he won't now.

118
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
You never do it Thomas so I know you won't do it for anyone else.

119
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Is Dr. Pimple Popper, is she a dermatologist?

120
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
That's what I would be.

121
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Wait do you like that shit?

122
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Dude I love that shit.

123
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You wanna like fuck with cysts and shits?

124
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Yeah cut them out.

125
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Do you do it to other people? Like are you into that?

126
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Yeah I have. I like doing them on myself.

127
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I admit I like popping my own pimples and stuff like that.

128
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
But I don't like seeing it on somebody else.

129
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I don't like pimple popping videos.

130
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Yeah me either.

131
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I'm a proud subscriber of the popping subreddit.

132
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
But that's about something else right?

133
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Nope.

134
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
We should compare each other's subreddits sometimes.

135
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Mine's extremely boring.

136
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Yeah mine's super boring.

137
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Mine's probably pretty boring too but I bet there would be interesting things we'd find.

138
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Like subreddits we didn't know about.

139
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
We got 13 or 30.

140
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Wait what?

141
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
13 or 30 it's pictures of people that could be 13 or 30.

142
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I follow that one yeah.

143
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Abrupt Chaos is a pretty good one.

144
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Aged Like Milk is a pretty good one.

145
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I like that one too.

146
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Are yours just like being mean to weird people?

147
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Yeah.

148
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Do you have any like not?

149
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Yeah how many like science, arts, and culture subreddits do you follow?

150
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I follow Animals Being Derps.

151
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Ate the Onion is always a good one.

152
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
That one's too depressing for me.

153
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I only follow two subreddits.

154
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Awful Taste but Great Execution and Male Fashion.

155
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Those are the only two.

156
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
That's all you need really. It balances you out.

157
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Sometimes I can't tell the difference.

158
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
What was it? Awful Taste but Great Execution?

159
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Oh I remember is that where you sent us the weird like McDonald's shoes or whatever?

160
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Oh yeah those were actually dope though.

161
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Yeah the best part is like people arguing about whether or not the thing is actually awesome.

162
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I follow the Pretending to be People subreddit where I issue fan theories.

163
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Will not be silenced.

164
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I follow the Kanye subreddit and the top post right now is

165
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
That's Enough Mr. West Please No More Today.

166
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Posted right after that Harriet Tubman shit.

167
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Did you see that?

168
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Oh no.

169
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Yeah.

170
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
That was bad.

171
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It's a sad story of mental illness that is a true bummer.

172
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
But you know when he gets real bad that he's got an album coming out soon.

173
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Yeah but he hasn't put out good music since Yeezus.

174
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Alright so.

175
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
That's not true. Life of Pablo was fucking dope.

176
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Oh I thought.

177
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Don't Refute the Gym Luke.

178
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Yeah.

179
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Well I love Kanye West.

180
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
His word is law.

181
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
It's the Wild West there aren't anyone else.

182
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
It sounded like you called him Kanye West.

183
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Kanye West.

184
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Is that not how you say it?

185
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
It's just like a 65 year old white woman doing karaoke to Kanye.

186
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Yeah.

187
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I'd watch that.

188
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'm trying to think of like the funniest.

189
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
The funniest lines of Kanye West that the old white woman could do.

190
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Yeah you probably shouldn't say those so let's dig in here.

191
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Let's gold dig in here to the Old West.

192
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Yeehaw.

193
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Yeehaw.

194
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I'm trying to say that once per episode.

195
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Root and toot and shootin.

196
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Yeehaw.

197
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Hold on before we start.

198
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Cause we haven't gone long enough before we started.

199
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Yeah people love this.

200
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
How many times do you think people actually said Yeehaw back in the day?

201
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Well let's find out.

202
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I'm googling.

203
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Two million five hundred and forty thousand three hundred and eighty.

204
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
It meant hello and goodbye.

205
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Oh.

206
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
So yeah all the time.

207
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Yeehaw means family.

208
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
God I want a tattoo that says Yeehaw means family on my back.

209
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
And it's stitched with a cowboy hat and boots.

210
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Just now?

211
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Oh no.

212
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Should we all stop?

213
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
One two three five six seven.

214
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
That was cool we kind of had like a clip clap.

215
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Like horses hooves on the ground right outside of the church here in the 1880 somethings in contention.

216
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Who's on a horse?

217
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
You know Jack Pearlman's on a horse come on.

218
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I'm on a horse.

219
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Come on hey mister.

220
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Everett did not bring his horse into town.

221
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
He walked in.

222
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'd like to think that Everett has a very small donkey he rides on.

223
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Can we make that happen?

224
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I'm not going to play unless it's a talking raccoon.

225
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Jesus.

226
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
That's a throwback for just the group.

227
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Inside jokes are great for podcasts.

228
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
But that did actually happen we had a player say that.

229
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Yeah and Delta Green.

230
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
So she was a talking raccoon.

231
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
So how do we get out of this?

232
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
What kind of horse are you riding Jack?

233
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
That is the good question.

234
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I think we established between me and Zach it's a big old brown good solid like work horse.

235
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Not like an agile like racing horse like this one can like carry a wagon around.

236
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Very sturdy beautiful horse named Jeremiah whom I love and I think Jack also loves.

237
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Ephraim has a big brown and white Clydesdale named hey mister.

238
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
H-A-Y mister.

239
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Love it.

240
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Love it.

241
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I think that's the horse maybe I have too is the Clydesdale the weird like.

242
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Budweiser horse.

243
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Yeah the Clydesdale is the one you can use in Red Dead but that you would absolutely never ever ride in real life.

244
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Right.

245
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Oh.

246
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
They're too majestic.

247
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
But mine I'm such a big guy that I've got to have a big old horse.

248
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Okay I don't have that guy I just got a big fun horse.

249
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I'll write that down.

250
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Can you write that down so we don't forget.

251
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Big fun horse.

252
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Big fun horse Jeremiah.

253
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Professor Horace Green did you ride in town?

254
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Yeah he rents a horse from the local livery stable.

255
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Horcery.

256
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Uh huh.

257
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Yeah he's got whatever horse they gave him today.

258
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I'm seated on my horse and I look over at Horace.

259
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Is that animal sick?

260
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
It sounds a little hoarse.

261
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Gosh.

262
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
And Ephraim slaps his knee and laughs to himself.

263
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
God damn it Ephraim.

264
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
It's just no it's just a standard American quarter horse and I think it's in fine health.

265
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
It was a joke.

266
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I don't follow.

267
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
It sounds hoarse.

268
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
It's a horse.

269
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Yeah yeah.

270
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Well uh we had a plan to do something right?

271
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Yeah I reckon we were gonna head over there.

272
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
And I point to the midpoint between the cemetery and my place.

273
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
We were thinking we were gonna see if she dropped off those bodies somewhere.

274
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Are you uh you just walking?

275
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I mean I'll be way behind you guys if I do a walk.

276
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Perhaps you should perhaps you should hop on the back of this man's gigantic Clydesdale

277
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
here.

278
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Bobby Custard speaks up and is like.

279
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Would you be okay with with Everett hopping on the back of yours if not you know Everett

280
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Everett there's a good place right here on the back of old Bucky.

281
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Bucky looks like a good place for you to ride and Bucky is a gorgeous black horse.

282
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
If you're offering space on Bucky there I'll take it.

283
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
And as Everett Pace hops up onto Bucky.

284
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
It's it's kind of a slow arduous process.

285
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,000
His old rickety bones getting up there.

286
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I used to be able to ride all over this countryside but now it's hard to get up on.

287
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
That's why I keep the donkey at my place.

288
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
It's easier to get up on.

289
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
It's a little shorter you know.

290
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:00,000
And a sheepish young girl is approaching as Everett Pace is trying to get up and you all

291
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
would know her.

292
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Her name is Elizabeth Connor.

293
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:10,000
She lives in contention and Judge Cortland you would remember her as a friend of your

294
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
deceased daughter.

295
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
What's sheepish about her?

296
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Is she like furry?

297
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Woolly.

298
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,000
No when she opens her mouth she's just like.

299
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
She has a Serta mattress.

300
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Yeah one of the Serta sheep comes bouncing up to you.

301
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,000
And I won't play if I can't be that Serta sheep.

302
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
How close is she to us?

303
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
She's approaching right now and she is walking up behind Everett.

304
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Hi there folks.

305
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Hey Lizzie.

306
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Oh hi there Judge Cortland.

307
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
It's good to see you.

308
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I don't reckon I didn't mean to cause nothing but.

309
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Speak up.

310
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
And she walks right over to Cortland and is.

311
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Yeah I didn't want to say anything with Mr. Cole around.

312
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:14,000
But this morning I overheard Mr. and Mrs. Cole there arguing something loud and fiery.

313
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,000
And I did hear they were screaming about copper wire.

314
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I heard them talking about it.

315
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Yeah he had some copper wire for those fans but I think it's got something to do with

316
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
my copper wire.

317
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Well I heard him yell and he was real angry that she took some.

318
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
She took some?

319
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Why did she take some?

320
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I reckon I don't have any sort of idea.

321
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I was just fetching some water and happened over here and when you came in Judge screaming

322
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
and hollering about how your copper wire had been done taking.

323
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I thought maybe.

324
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I mean I would hate to think that of the Coles.

325
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I don't know.

326
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I don't trust any of them.

327
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
He's always seemed a little off to me.

328
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,000
We don't agree about much but on this we definitely do.

329
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Creepy little fella.

330
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I don't trust a man with pants that big.

331
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Never can never should.

332
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
And Elizabeth's father hollers for her.

333
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I better be long now.

334
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I just wanted to pass that on to you.

335
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Do with it what you will I suppose.

336
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Thanks for the heads up Lizzie.

337
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:32,000
And with that she's gone and during that entire conversation Everett Pace was just.

338
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Now we got you.

339
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Okay now you're back on here.

340
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Okay and just don't hold on too tight there.

341
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Yep.

342
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Okay.

343
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Now I think maybe and the crowd is leaving.

344
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:58,000
They kind of do that thing that big crowds do where they're congregating like a congregation

345
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
in front of the church.

346
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
So they're all like saying their goodbyes but it's taking them a while to leave and

347
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Custard.

348
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Alright yeah maybe let's just take a.

349
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
What?

350
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Hey.

351
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:14,000
That's what horses are.

352
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Custard delete this if it turns out I asked you about this last time but do you know anything

353
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
about a local gambler named Thomas?

354
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Oh yes actually Thomas was the one in there that disappeared back.

355
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Oh six days ago?

356
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Well that's right Judge the young lady who just spoke to us mentioned that she overheard

357
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,000
the woman she was referring to having having an argument with Miss with Mr. Cole.

358
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I also I overheard some of the minors mentioning that Thomas had had gotten in a terrible conflagration

359
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
with Mr. Cole that they had argued fiercely shortly before his disappearance.

360
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I don't know if that's any help to the mystery but there it is.

361
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Luke can you hear Thomas?

362
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
It was very roboty.

363
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Shit really?

364
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Yeah I was having trouble understanding some of it.

365
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I could hear I could like understand what you're saying but.

366
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:13,000
It sounds like you're talking into a big fan with how roboty it is.

367
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Still?

368
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Yeah.

369
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Maybe leave the Zoom call and hop on back in.

370
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Yeah that whole time he was talking I was like well I can kind of get it I don't know

371
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
if we're gonna interrupt and say anything but.

372
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I was having trouble following.

373
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Hello?

374
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Hey.

375
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
How is it?

376
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Still roboty?

377
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Still bad.

378
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Damn it I was saving that burp for when I talk next time but I'll get another one.

379
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Rick and Morty style.

380
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Save up all the burps for when you speak.

381
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Yeah.

382
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Hey Zach what's that shirt you got on?

383
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I've never seen it before.

384
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I only have like four shirts that I like.

385
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Same.

386
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I ain't clear this some bitchin' closet on out.

387
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Get me some proper western attire so I can get in character.

388
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I show up in like a full cowboy garb for the next episode.

389
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
That would have been fun.

390
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
We should start doing costumes for the Patreon.

391
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Hell yeah.

392
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Me and Joe can just wear our weird luchador masks.

393
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
We play luchadors in every single one shot from here on out.

394
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
It's the only silly mask I have.

395
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,000
There is a worldwide wrestling RPG that looks fucking hilarious.

396
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I could be George W. Bush.

397
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I have a mask of that.

398
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Oh man you should have just been GW for this one.

399
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Okay so am I still a robot?

400
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Yeah.

401
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Yeah.

402
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
How about now?

403
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Still fan.

404
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Very roboty.

405
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Okay I'm gonna restart.

406
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I think it's worse if that helps you at all.

407
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I'm stopping my audacity track.

408
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Okay.

409
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Pause.

410
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Yeah let's all just pause it.

411
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Five, six, seven.

412
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:27,000
So that's all I know about Thomas.

413
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Does anybody know?

414
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Go ahead and run it back.

415
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I think we got a pretty good one.

416
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Oh I'm sure we did but they didn't hear you.

417
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
They didn't understand you.

418
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Oh all that gotcha.

419
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Yes well the gist of it is that I overheard some of the miners talking about Thomas and

420
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Mr. Cole getting in a terrible argument shortly before his disappearance.

421
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
And apparently he'd made some kind of great discovery down there.

422
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I'm not sure what it was.

423
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Thomas had made the discovery or Cole had?

424
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Cole makes discoveries every day.

425
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Thomas found something in Mr. Cole's mine.

426
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
What was it?

427
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
A goo.

428
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Like oil?

429
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Do you strike oil?

430
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Living oil.

431
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
That sounds like a bit crazy if you ask me.

432
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I'm a man of science and I have seen many things.

433
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:27,000
You think maybe they hit like a gas leak or something down there making him feel a little

434
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
wacky?

435
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Judge with all due respect, is there a gas leak in your own home?

436
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Why do you do the things you do?

437
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
He's just got his mouth open unsure how to respond.

438
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I like this science guy a lot.

439
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Now I don't know much about science and about living goo but I know that you did just roast

440
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
this man's beans and for that I do applaud you.

441
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Now maybe we should be off instead of talking about hypotheticals of living slime and whatnot.

442
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Sounds too goofy to me.

443
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Yes, I completely agree unless there's anything else that people aren't telling each other

444
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
that might help us solve this case on the way there.

445
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I know this is of limited interest to the rest of you but I would like it to be established

446
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:30,000
scientifically and for all posterity from now in the 1880s that this is a goo.

447
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:37,000
It's called a goo.

448
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I reckon I like that a whole lot.

449
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
We'll name it after young Thomas.

450
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Thomas goo?

451
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
You want to call it the Thomas goo, huh?

452
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Thomas goo.

453
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
No, no, no, no.

454
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Bottle that up.

455
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Thomas's goo?

456
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Of course it will have a name in Latin that will roughly translate to Thomas's goo.

457
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Does anyone here know Latin?

458
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I actually do, but it would be above you.

459
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
You wouldn't understand it.

460
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
You say I just hear static.

461
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I'm just sure of it.

462
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
What's static?

463
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Oh, uh, well see Silas Cole found out about electricity and sometimes it makes a weird

464
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
zzzz noise.

465
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Ah, I know some Latin.

466
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I know habeas corpus.

467
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
I don't, I don't think you do.

468
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Tell me, go ahead and tell the class what habeas corpus means, Ephraim.

469
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Well, speaking of habeas corpus, don't we got some corpuses to find?

470
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Let's go.

471
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
General natural world for those of you who have natural world.

472
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Oh shit, I got to find my character sheet.

473
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
18 on a 40.

474
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
It's a one.

475
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
I passed with a one.

476
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Hell yeah.

477
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Oh, holy shit.

478
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Nice.

479
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Where are the, I have my character sheet pulled up and I can't find it.

480
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
There's too many fucking.

481
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Oh no, I restarted.

482
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
God damn it.

483
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Oh, thank God.

484
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
I still have it.

485
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Let's get all these things back up.

486
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Apologies.

487
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Apologies.

488
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Y'all need not roll.

489
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Okay.

490
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
We got a one Everett pace.

491
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Looking up into the sky, you see three vultures circling about a half mile down the road and

492
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
right down there, there's a row of homes.

493
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Uh, just a little, uh, early idea of a suburb happening down here on the west side of contention.

494
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:32,000
You can just hear these vultures.

495
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
The vultures are barking?

496
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Yeah, a little bit.

497
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:41,000
To seemingly no one, Horace Green pipes up and says, actually, the concept of the suburb

498
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
dates to the Roman times.

499
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Uh, meaning it comes from suburbus, meaning beyond the city.

500
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Oh, is that Latin?

501
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
What?

502
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
I'm sorry.

503
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I was just thinking out loud.

504
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
And Everett, you would know that that is the sound vultures make.

505
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Uh, you just, just like in general, I looked it up.

506
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Hey, listen here fellas, them vultures, there's three of them up there.

507
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
They're barking.

508
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I've had vultures follow me around before.

509
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Uh, usually take a shower, bath after that, but I've heard them bark.

510
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Don't you figure for, uh, if we're looking for bodies, there's a good chance that, uh,

511
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
they're circling a body.

512
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I mean, might as well check there.

513
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
I think that's a wonderful observation Everett.

514
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
That's a good start Everett.

515
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Thanks everyone.

516
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
You're welcome.

517
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
We all love you and cherish you.

518
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Which is exactly what Joe had in mind with this character.

519
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Horace Green has never heard another man speak that way to a man, much less heard a

520
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,000
man get that kind of positive affirmation in his life at this point in the 1880s.

521
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
So sad.

522
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:52,000
He doesn't know what to do with it, but he feels, he feels all of a sudden like something's

523
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
missing that he didn't know about before.

524
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Oh no.

525
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Maybe it'll help him grow to become a better man.

526
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
He mutters, does the patriarchy hurt men too?

527
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Jesus Christ.

528
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:14,000
As we approach and get closer, I want to pull my gun out and try to shoot one of the buzzers.

529
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Okay.

530
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Everyone roll animal handling except for the judge who does this so often that his horse

531
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
is used to it.

532
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Totally used to it.

533
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
I don't think I passed.

534
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I think you got to roll it for me.

535
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I'm not, I'm not controlling this bad boy.

536
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
How about you roll it for me?

537
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Oh.

538
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Could I roll ride?

539
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Either way, I failed hard.

540
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Yeah, same.

541
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I rolled a 92.

542
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
I failed.

543
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I failed hard as well.

544
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Oh no.

545
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
What?

546
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:49,000
I put all my points into drive wagon thinking I could just drive us around in a wagon.

547
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Your sick party wagon.

548
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
I should have.

549
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Science party wagon.

550
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Well, I figured he went out to his dinosaurs bones every day with a little, with a little

551
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
wagon.

552
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:06,000
So horse green is leading you guys in this wagon that you're all sitting in the back

553
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
of.

554
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Look over there vultures.

555
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Thankfully Everett sitting right up front.

556
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:18,000
He notices he's um, no, this, this sucks.

557
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Uh, so as soon as, uh, firearms.

558
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Oh yes.

559
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Absolutely.

560
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Oh, please don't quit failure.

561
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Firearms are all that you didn't have to roll a second.

562
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
15 on a 50.

563
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Ooh, that's a dead bird.

564
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Do you want to describe it as we're riding up?

565
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I pull my gun out and ate all my bacon last night and pop, shoot a, shoot a vulture and

566
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
the vulture, uh, shrieks except for they don't shrink.

567
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
They bark.

568
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:58,120
It's just like, and it turns over and immediately begins falling to the ground and the other

569
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:01,960
two begin circling just a little bit lower.

570
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:02,960
The horses.

571
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,960
Let's see.

572
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:04,960
We got Bucky.

573
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:05,960
We got Jeremiah.

574
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:06,960
Thank you.

575
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,960
Yeah, we got Bucky.

576
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:14,000
We got Jeremiah and then the rental, his name's hurts.

577
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:20,400
So you guys can push this role if you would like, uh, on either ride or animal handling

578
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:30,760
in order to try to basically at the apex of this horse trying to knock you off, you can

579
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:37,000
push the role to try something a little bit different to hold on tight and regain control.

580
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,600
However, if you fail that role, it'll be a crit fail.

581
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,200
The screen doesn't have time to push.

582
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:47,120
He just gets bucked straight off the back of the horse and is suddenly on his backside.

583
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:53,680
Jack Pearlman tries to, to emotionally and mentally connect with his best friend, Jeremiah,

584
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:58,760
the horse, and like hugs really tightly to its neck and tries to whisper into its ear

585
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,960
to calm down Jeremiah.

586
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,960
It's just me now.

587
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:02,960
Okay.

588
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,160
Did you put points into horse whispering?

589
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:08,280
Hell yeah.

590
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,600
Natural world, baby.

591
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,680
I pa- uh, 58 on a 70.

592
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,680
So I pass.

593
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,680
All right.

594
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:18,800
And the Everett Pace, uh, we're both kind of hanging on by a thread here.

595
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,640
What are you going to do?

596
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:25,200
So I'm really scared to push because if you fail a push, it's a crit fail, right?

597
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,200
That is correct.

598
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,200
Yeah.

599
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,760
Uh, I'm not going to push.

600
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,760
Okay.

601
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:36,960
Everett Pace, you fall off and the preacher, preacher, sheriff, Bobby Custard, I forgot

602
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:37,960
his name completely.

603
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:43,240
I dare you forget everyone's favorite character, Bobby Custard.

604
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:47,080
And uh, preacher, sheriff, Bobby Custard falls directly on you.

605
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,720
You're going to lose one hit point.

606
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:55,480
And professor horse green, you fall off as well, losing a single hit point and the horses

607
00:30:55,480 --> 00:31:06,160
just stay near, thankfully, uh, they kind of trot in circles and Jack Pearlman, you

608
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:13,600
grab on tight and you pull yourself forward, your legs dangling like you're Superman riding

609
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,600
this horse.

610
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:17,120
Like I'm doing a sick plank almost on my horse.

611
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,120
Exactly.

612
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,760
What do you whisper in its ear?

613
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,240
None of this loss in translation bullshit.

614
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,800
All right, Jeremiah, it's just me and you now.

615
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,160
We got this.

616
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:29,140
Come on now, Jeremiah, come on now.

617
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:33,700
And I'm like petting it's under, under its neck like you do with a weird doggy or with

618
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:34,700
your fat cat.

619
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:42,380
And Jeremiah sits down on its butt to where you're standing on the ground and then slowly

620
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:47,260
rises from the back so that you just kind of slide back up on.

621
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:52,740
As a good horse, Jeremiah, I have a sugar cube that I feed Jeremiah.

622
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:56,660
Can you, can you, can you role play that for me please?

623
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:57,660
Yeah.

624
00:31:57,660 --> 00:32:00,220
Here, watch what I do.

625
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,220
Watch what I do.

626
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:03,040
Hold on Zach, let me get it on back of you real quick.

627
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,560
Ooh, I like that.

628
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,560
I like it.

629
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,560
I certainly don't.

630
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,560
I certainly do not.

631
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:13,640
Well, some of us don't like real role-playing Joe and some of us love real role-playing.

632
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,640
Oh God.

633
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,640
Yeah, that's good.

634
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,640
Oh God.

635
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,640
Oh God.

636
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,640
Are you okay?

637
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,800
Did you hurt yourself role-playing as Jeremiah?

638
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,560
Did you feel like a horse for a second?

639
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:28,000
Was it hard to take yourself back out of being a horse?

640
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Okay, you're Zach.

641
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
You're Zach.

642
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
You're Preacher Sheriff Bobby Custard.

643
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Everett's laying on the ground.

644
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Hold on, while Zach was a horse, he shit all over the place.

645
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Let's see it.

646
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
We'll let him pick that up.

647
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Role-play it now.

648
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Good thing he ate grass today.

649
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Do it.

650
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Do it.

651
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Shit.

652
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Show us your poo.

653
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Everett, are you, are you, are you okay?

654
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:02,960
God damn it, Judge.

655
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:03,960
What the?

656
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:04,960
God damn it.

657
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,960
I'm holding out a hand for the Sheriff.

658
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,960
Looks like you've fallen and you can't giddy up.

659
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,960
That was pretty good.

660
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:25,960
I don't got time for this and I ride my horse over to where the bird fell.

661
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:30,920
Everett, you know, there's room on the back of this saddle for another if you'd rather

662
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,920
be with someone a little more experienced.

663
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,920
Well, that wasn't Bobby's fault.

664
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:38,920
God damn Judge shooting a gun out of nowhere and pissed off all those horses.

665
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,920
He should have known better.

666
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:41,920
God damn it.

667
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:46,920
I completely agree and I will say that Jack is a better rider than I am, that's for damn

668
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:47,920
sure.

669
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:53,920
However, not my fault, Judge Cortland, but you know, he kind of does what he does.

670
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,920
We can't all agree.

671
00:33:55,880 --> 00:34:00,880
Professor Green is watching his horse just run off back to the stable in town, just over

672
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,880
the hill.

673
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,880
Completely all the way home.

674
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,880
Yeah.

675
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:12,880
He's like, uh, well, I, I, I think I need a ride, uh, from, from whoever's, from whichever

676
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:16,880
horse is behind that Mr. Pace does not occupy.

677
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:17,880
All right.

678
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,880
It's the bachelor time.

679
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,880
Just hand out your rose, Everett.

680
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,880
Wait, what?

681
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:30,880
You gotta pick a horse to get on.

682
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:33,880
I thought that, that we were helping each other back onto the horses.

683
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,880
Yeah, you're probably right.

684
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,880
I'm already, I'm already riding up there with Bobby.

685
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:43,880
I was just giving you another shot if you wanted to get on my horse.

686
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,880
Uh, Horace, you can go on, you can go on and get up here.

687
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:55,840
I know you probably don't want to get on Ephraim's and I reached my arm out to like, heave him

688
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,840
up with me.

689
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,840
Thank you, Mr. Bowman.

690
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,840
You're welcome.

691
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:04,840
As you guys are click clacking down this dusty old ass pathway in between some of these houses,

692
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:10,840
large plots of land, but houses closer, maybe a hundred yards apart, give them some space,

693
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:16,840
but not nearly as much as being out a little bit outside of town lends you a lot more room

694
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,800
like Pace or Perlman's places.

695
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:26,800
And as you guys are heading on down here, you see that there is a modest wooden cabin

696
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,800
with a covered wraparound front porch.

697
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,800
There is a watermelon patch out front.

698
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:38,800
To the side, there's a herd of cows nearby on the side of the house.

699
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,800
And you guys would know this place is called the Brick House.

700
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,800
Ow!

701
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,800
B-R-I-C-K-H-A-U-S.

702
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,760
Is it mighty mighty?

703
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,760
It's mighty mighty.

704
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,760
It's the kind you don't take home to mother.

705
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,760
That's a super freak.

706
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,760
I know.

707
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,760
That's my favorite mashup.

708
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,760
She's a brick house.

709
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,760
The kind you don't take home to mother.

710
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:04,760
And also mashed up are all of these watermelons.

711
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:11,760
You see as you're approaching, every single watermelon in this watermelon patch has been

712
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,760
destroyed.

713
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:19,720
And on the front porch, there's a very tall, very buff woman who is crying.

714
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,720
She's weeping very openly.

715
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:26,720
And you know that this is Greer Hilfintop Kamonkarno.

716
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:35,720
Big ol' shout out to M from Michigan, a citizen of contention and a $10 level backer tier

717
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:39,720
backer patreon.com slash pretending pod.

718
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:48,680
Thank you M from Michigan for both Greer Hilfintop Kamonkarno as well as the Brick House gym.

719
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:54,680
Before anybody can say anything, Horace Green has never seen this person and he just says,

720
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:58,680
Hello ma'am, have you seen any interesting bones on your property?

721
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,680
I...

722
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:03,680
Perhaps now is not the time.

723
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,680
What happened to your vegetables?

724
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,680
Their fruits.

725
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:07,680
Melons.

726
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,680
My melons?

727
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,640
They are...

728
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,640
They have been completely destroyed.

729
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,640
And I...

730
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,640
I woke up in the night...

731
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:28,640
Please tie up your horses and come here.

732
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,640
The church is perfect.

733
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,640
Preach your sheriff.

734
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,640
Come here.

735
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,640
Hear my story.

736
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,600
Where are you from?

737
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,600
Contention!

738
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,600
Ephraim's already on the ground.

739
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:50,600
He bends over to get the buzzard he shot and he shoves it in a bag on his horse and leads

740
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:56,600
his horse over to the porch and ties the horse up and just kind of looks at her.

741
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,600
It was an excellent shot.

742
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:06,600
It has been circling ever since last night when one of my cows, my beautiful, beautiful

743
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,560
is completely eviscerated.

744
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,560
Like...

745
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,560
Like wolves or...

746
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,560
They must have been wolves.

747
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:18,560
Can you show me the way to this here cow?

748
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:21,560
Horace, I'm going to need you with me on this one.

749
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:24,560
Well of course, I've always happened to lead my biological expertise.

750
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,560
Do I know this woman?

751
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,560
Yeah, and she just started...

752
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:34,560
The brick house is a place where people can come work out.

753
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,560
Where they can work out?

754
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:44,520
She's a fitness person and she teaches people of all ages and credos here in contention

755
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:51,520
how to do that cool thing where you destroy a watermelon with your thighs.

756
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,520
Nice.

757
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,520
Oh that sounds fun, I'd like to learn.

758
00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:02,520
If only you could because I am all out of watermelons.

759
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:07,480
Since this was supposed to last me through next year, are we just harvest?

760
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:12,480
I'm going to look down at the watermelon patch and search through it to see if there's any...

761
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:18,480
I want to see if there's anything in there that's not just like dirt or leaves or watermelon pulp.

762
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,480
Yeah, go ahead and roll.

763
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,480
Spot hidden maybe?

764
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,480
You could roll spot hidden.

765
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,480
You could roll...

766
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,480
Archaeology.

767
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,480
I'll do spot hidden.

768
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,440
50 on a...

769
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,440
45, that's a fail.

770
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:39,440
So you're looking around and you see footprints all over this place.

771
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,440
Two different sets.

772
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,440
How big?

773
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:46,440
Neither large, they're medium to small as far as feet go in the world.

774
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:50,440
Hey, are these your footprints down here, ma'am?

775
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,440
No, I have not stepped foot.

776
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:56,440
I looked from the porch but all of them, they have been gone.

777
00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:00,440
Boy, it looks like there's been two perps smashing melons.

778
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,400
Yeah, there was a fight.

779
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,400
A fight?

780
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,400
A melon fight.

781
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,400
It's two women.

782
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,400
You saw them?

783
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:16,400
Yes, it evoked me from my slumber and I got up and I looked and I watched them.

784
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,400
They were destroying everything in the melon patch.

785
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:25,400
They were stepping all over it and they had no regard for my watermelons.

786
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:29,400
So you don't think they were here just to smash your property?

787
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:36,360
No, one was catching the other but I cannot believe with how.

788
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,360
How?

789
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,360
She's shaking her head and she's crying and she's like...

790
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,360
I...

791
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:46,360
My distress must have caused me to see things.

792
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:49,360
What did your distress cause you to see?

793
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:54,360
Well, I could have promised at the time.

794
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,360
Now looking back I do not know.

795
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,360
You know how the mind plays tricks on you.

796
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:07,360
You can create false memories in oneself but it looked to be that woman from the saloon who had gone missing.

797
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,360
Kitty?

798
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,360
Yes, that is the one.

799
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:14,360
And then there was another girl that she was capturing.

800
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,360
She was dressed strange.

801
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,360
Like how?

802
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:23,360
Just odd, vibrant colors, shoes made of different material.

803
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:25,360
How old was she?

804
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:29,360
She must have been a teenager of some sort.

805
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:36,360
But this lasso that Miss Kitty was using to catch her, it was magic.

806
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,360
What kind of magic are you talking about here?

807
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:43,360
We all know that magic ain't real.

808
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:47,360
I already hung the witches that were hanging around here.

809
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:49,360
I disagreed with that decision personally.

810
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:54,360
Not that I don't respect you, it's just that it didn't seem that they were actually witches.

811
00:41:54,360 --> 00:42:03,360
Anyway, I think that this lasso somehow, you know the lights in town, yes?

812
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,360
Yeah.

813
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:10,360
This power that moves through them seems to be moving through this lasso.

814
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:14,360
Like some kind of electric lasso of some kind.

815
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:21,360
Yes, it was filed to see and it burned her enough to make quite a smell.

816
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:27,360
Horace, you think someone could handle an electric lasso that weren't hooked up to some big ol' power line?

817
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:33,360
Glad to know Tildy B's doing okay here in the past.

818
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,360
Yep.

819
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:37,360
Horace Green, what are you doing during this time?

820
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:40,360
It was Courtland's turn last time, what are you looking at?

821
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:45,360
Horace is looking at a bug that has wandered into his frame of vision.

822
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,360
What's it look like?

823
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:50,360
It's a rather remarkable little beetle.

824
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,360
Do you really want to know?

825
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,360
I do, yeah.

826
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:55,360
No, you don't.

827
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:01,360
Alright, good turn. Jack Pearlman.

828
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:05,360
I was taking Horace with me to go check out the cow.

829
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:09,360
Yeah, and when you get over there you see that there is...

830
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:11,360
You remember last night?

831
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:14,360
Yeah, that's what I was assuming.

832
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:16,360
I'd say it looks a whole lot like that.

833
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:21,360
Jack Pearlman's eyes widen and he looks back at Horace.

834
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:25,360
You ever seen something make marks like this on an animal before?

835
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:29,360
There's a fucking hole in this cow, the size of a bowling ball.

836
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:33,360
Around it there seems to be bite marks.

837
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,360
Go ahead and roll biology if you got it.

838
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:37,360
That is not an Old West skill.

839
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:40,360
Go ahead and roll natural world I guess if you got it.

840
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,360
Using that one a lot!

841
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:43,360
Is there science?

842
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:44,360
Five.

843
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:45,360
Oh, there's science.

844
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:48,360
Oh, either way you succeed on that roll

845
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:51,360
as you see that these are bite marks

846
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:53,360
roughly the size of a human jaw

847
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:56,360
and roughly in the shape of a human mouth.

848
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:58,360
Horace, I didn't want to...

849
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:00,360
I didn't want to frighten nobody.

850
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:04,360
Well, I hate to frighten you, Mr. Pearlman,

851
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:07,360
but a man did this.

852
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:11,360
Now both of you are all saying it again.

853
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:13,360
Yeah, fail.

854
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:15,360
Horace passes.

855
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,360
Jack Pearlman, you just lose one sanity.

856
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:20,360
This sinks in a little harder

857
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:23,360
because this has already happened.

858
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:27,360
Specifically, you've already seen these exact markings.

859
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:31,360
Seeing it for a second time confirms what you saw last night.

860
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:35,360
Horace, I didn't want to shock nobody at the town hall,

861
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:39,360
but this, before I looked at it myself,

862
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:43,360
but something similar to this happened to one of my horses last night

863
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:45,360
and by God, Dandelion,

864
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:48,360
it looked like she just got murdered and ate up

865
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:51,360
by some kind of creature that in the distance,

866
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:54,360
I thought my eyes was playing tricks on me,

867
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:58,360
but you're telling me it's some kind of man that does this?

868
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:01,360
Well, something with a jaw very much like that of a man.

869
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:03,360
What kind of creature did you see?

870
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:06,360
It was so far,

871
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:09,360
it almost looked like some kind of person,

872
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:14,360
but they were so far and they were moving ungodly fast, I'd say.

873
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:17,360
I couldn't even catch up with them before they got into the woods

874
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:19,360
and I was on horseback.

875
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:21,360
And the wounds looked like this?

876
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:23,360
Do you still have the body? I'd very much like to see it.

877
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:26,360
Yeah, she's still on the barn.

878
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:30,360
I put some dirt on her to keep her from the other horses, but...

879
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:32,360
I'm sorry, she's on the barn?

880
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:34,360
She's on top of the barn.

881
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:36,360
How did you get her up there?

882
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:37,360
Trebuchet.

883
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:38,360
Jack Perlman is very strong.

884
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,360
My God, what a specimen.

885
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:42,360
Oh, thank you.

886
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:44,360
Strong as a horse. Not that horse.

887
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:46,360
You're an absolute mountain of a man.

888
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:50,360
You make that sludge, Ephraim, look like a sludge.

889
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:51,360
Oh.

890
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:52,360
Got him.

891
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:55,360
Certainly not a noble goo.

892
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:57,360
But yeah, if you need to go take another look,

893
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:01,360
but I'm telling you, it looks an awful lot exactly like this,

894
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:04,360
and I'm assuming this happened to her last night also.

895
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:09,360
Is there any other things I can perceive from this?

896
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:11,360
Is there any tracks nearby?

897
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:13,360
You could roll a tracking or...

898
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:14,360
Is there a spot hidden?

899
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:16,360
I think natural world would still work weirdly.

900
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:19,360
I spot hidden in natural world.

901
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,360
You gotta roll as well.

902
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:23,360
I pass, 35 on a 40.

903
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:27,360
You see footprints that are dug in right here on the ground,

904
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:31,360
dug in hard, and they've left a mark.

905
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:33,360
It's weird because shoes don't,

906
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:37,360
typically the tread doesn't have a design on the bottom,

907
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:41,360
but these have a three leaf design.

908
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:43,360
It's like three leaves,

909
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:49,360
and it's got three lines through the bottom of this trefoil,

910
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:54,360
and under it, it says EST 1949.

911
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:57,360
Go ahead and roll the sanity check.

912
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:01,360
This is from the future.

913
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,360
God damn it, I failed again.

914
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:04,360
Would anybody make that assumption?

915
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:06,360
It depends on if he fails the sanity check.

916
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:07,360
I failed it.

917
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:10,360
It's from the future.

918
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:12,360
Go ahead and lose one sanity.

919
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:15,360
Horace, do you see these here tracks?

920
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:17,360
Let me just look at them.

921
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:18,360
You're looking at them.

922
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:23,360
Why do you think it says established in 1949,

923
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:27,360
a year that does not exist as far as we know?

924
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:30,360
Probably just the bottom part of the other eight wore off,

925
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:33,360
and it's from 1849.

926
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,360
Yeah, maybe you're right.

927
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:36,360
Maybe.

928
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:39,360
And Jack looks a little unsure of himself at this point.

929
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:42,360
Jack, it's perfectly silly to assume otherwise.

930
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:45,360
Yeah, you're probably right.

931
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:50,360
I didn't sleep good last night after Dandelion's passing, but yeah.

932
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:52,360
Yes, the body of your beloved horse.

933
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:53,360
When can I see that?

934
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:55,360
Cutting right back to Everett Pace.

935
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:56,360
What are you up to?

936
00:47:56,360 --> 00:48:01,360
He's surveying the watermelon still and talking up to Greer.

937
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:09,360
Miss Hilfentob-Germunkenau, you know that this isn't here a total loss.

938
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:11,360
You can make a fine jelly out of any of this here.

939
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:13,360
I can show you a little.

940
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:15,360
Gathered up here.

941
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:18,360
I mean, you can't be popping them with thighs no more, I guess,

942
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:20,360
but it's still usable.

943
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:23,360
I thought you were talking about the cow.

944
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:26,360
Oh, God.

945
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:29,360
You can make a fine jelly.

946
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:31,360
Beef jelly.

947
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:33,360
Well, that is, I mean, you melt down hooves.

948
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:38,360
That is very kind of you to say.

949
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:44,360
Go ahead and roll either psychology or persuade or charisma.

950
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:48,360
I mean, I'll try to persuade us, I guess.

951
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:51,360
It's just a 10.

952
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:54,360
76, close.

953
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:55,360
Yeah.

954
00:48:55,360 --> 00:49:02,360
Everett Pace, you are just as uncaring and otherworldly

955
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:06,360
as they say that you are in town.

956
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,360
I must be going now.

957
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:12,360
And she goes into her home and slams the door shut.

958
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:14,360
Well, if you're not going to use it, then I'm kind of.

959
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:18,360
And he starts putting some watermelon in his pockets.

960
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:25,360
Just goo-ing up his pockets with watermelon.

961
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:29,360
And then he'll join the cow inspectors.

962
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:33,360
As he is shoving watermelon goo into his pockets,

963
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:38,360
Ephraim looks at him doing it and bends down and scoops up a little crushed up watermelon

964
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:40,360
and eats it and kind of makes a funny face.

965
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:44,360
And then he pulls his flask out and takes a couple gulps of it

966
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:47,360
and then starts to pee on the side of the house.

967
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:53,360
And after he's done, he follows Everett back to the cow.

968
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:56,360
I hope you die a terrible, terrible death.

969
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:59,360
Yeah, Horace Green walks up behind him and shoots him in the fucking head.

970
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:08,360
It wasn't like a malicious pee, it was just he had to go

971
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:11,360
and this was what was there.

972
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:14,360
It wasn't a malicious pee.

973
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:16,360
Wasn't malicious.

974
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:20,360
Are you saying that Courtland has in his past?

975
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:21,360
Yes.

976
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:23,360
Oh, shit. Oh yeah, right?

977
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:25,360
Delicious pees.

978
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:29,360
I would imagine that like 60% of his pisses are malicious.

979
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:37,360
Malicious and delicious because you know this guy's got diabetes for sure.

980
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:39,360
That sweet pee.

981
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:42,360
Sweet human oil.

982
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:49,360
Does yours come out as oil and float on the top of your toilet water?

983
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:53,360
Sign of a healthy kidney.

984
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:55,360
Sometimes.

985
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:57,360
It's like extra virgin olive oil.

986
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:05,360
I've got to shake the toilet bowl up for it to be a uniform yellow.

987
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:07,360
I regret.

988
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:15,360
Yeah, Ephraim takes his sweet piss on the lady's house and walks back.

989
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:16,360
Oh boy.

990
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:18,360
What a foul man.

991
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:20,360
As Everett's walking up on you guys.

992
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:23,360
Boy, it sure sounds like Miss Kenny had herself a night.

993
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:26,360
She was up here and then she was at the cemetery, she was up at my place.

994
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:28,360
She's been running all around.

995
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:34,360
And she dragged a woman with bizarre clothes around with an electric lasso.

996
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:37,360
Sounds to me like we got two people stringing up now.

997
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:46,360
Hey Everett, did you have anything that was living eviscerated on your property at all?

998
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:48,360
Like this here cow.

999
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:54,360
If you want to look at it, I wouldn't recommend it personally because it hurt my brain when I did.

1000
00:51:54,360 --> 00:52:00,360
But you could look at it if you wanted to, but you could just trust me that it looks real bad.

1001
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:02,360
No, I don't reckon I did.

1002
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:04,360
I saw her out there and I run her off.

1003
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:08,360
Mr. Pace, you're absolutely sure you saw nothing last night?

1004
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:13,360
100%, I mean I saw Miss Kitty trying to dig up my wife, but no, nothing other than that.

1005
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:19,360
Okay, because I had one of my horses get real messed up, similar to this,

1006
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:24,360
and I just needed to know if it happened to you two, we could put something together maybe.

1007
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:26,360
Figure out what's going on.

1008
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:29,360
Ah, nothing. I think I just got there in time.

1009
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:31,360
Jack, which horse was it?

1010
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:33,360
It was Dandelion.

1011
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:34,360
Oh god damn.

1012
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:36,360
Beautiful, beautiful god damn horse.

1013
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:39,360
I always wanted Hamister and her to get something we could sell.

1014
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:42,360
That wasn't going to happen, but she was a beautiful horse.

1015
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:44,360
I miss Dandelion already.

1016
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:46,360
What do you think happened here?

1017
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:54,360
Horace told me that, Horace, why don't you tell them what your science tells you about what could have possibly happened here.

1018
00:52:54,360 --> 00:53:06,360
Well, by the distance between the upper and lower parts of the bite, the dentation, the depth of the wound, all signs point to a human jaw.

1019
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:09,360
You think Miss Kitty did this?

1020
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:10,360
I don't know.

1021
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:14,360
Now it sounds like Miss Kitty was with someone else.

1022
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:21,360
Now do we know that maybe this someone or something else is the cause of all this?

1023
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:30,360
I mean, when she was over there digging up the grave over by my place, she was in a tizzy. She had a frenzy to her.

1024
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:37,360
Maybe she got bit. Maybe she got bit by a snake or something and rattled her up in there.

1025
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:39,360
Made her eat a cow?

1026
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:41,360
I've seen it do worse to worse.

1027
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:43,360
What?

1028
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:46,360
You've seen it do worse to worse?

1029
00:53:47,360 --> 00:54:00,360
Horace, you ever heard of something like that? Some kind of disease that makes you go wild and be able to murder a horse and a cow in one evening and outrun another horse?

1030
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:06,360
Well, why certainly. All sorts of maladies affect man's mind and can drive them insane.

1031
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:11,360
Yeah, but I'm talking like speed and such and viciousness of the jaws.

1032
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:21,360
When the body becomes hyper excited, it has the power to ignore pains that might otherwise hobble it.

1033
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:30,360
And so under immense strengths, a man is capable of great feats of strength and speed.

1034
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:34,360
But I'm talking outrunning a goddamn horse here.

1035
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:40,360
Not like outrunning another person. I'm talking grade A, beautiful horses that I raised.

1036
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:47,360
Mr. Perlman, science would suggest that the most obvious answer is a slow horse.

1037
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:52,360
You talking about Jeremiah like that? Look at Jeremiah and you tell what you think about him.

1038
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:59,360
And when you look over at Jeremiah where he's tied up at the post at the entrance to the brick house,

1039
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:06,360
you see Preacher Sheriff Bobby Custard is across the road in between a couple houses

1040
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:15,360
and he's looking off at a trail that leads in the southeasterly direction out of town.

1041
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:20,360
And he comes walking back with his head slunk down.

1042
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:24,360
None of y'all had tracking, is that right? None of y'all is getting good at tracking?

1043
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:28,360
I think it was established that you are quite the trackster.

1044
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:35,360
Yep, so I went ahead and took care of it for you and turns out it seems like one person

1045
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:43,360
dragged some body, I guess, through this way, threw him on top of a horse

1046
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:47,360
and the horse, it just trotted on right off.

1047
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:52,360
Going about, you know, pretty quick pace, quick clip, heading on down this path here

1048
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:55,360
and this path only leads to one place.

1049
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:56,360
Yeah, that's handy.

1050
00:55:56,360 --> 00:56:05,360
And you all know that it leads to the southeast part of town, which is where the new mine resides

1051
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:13,360
and it also happens to be the property on which Silas and Mary Cole live.

1052
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:17,360
I haven't been here long, but if I'm not mistaken, it leads straight to the coal land.

1053
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:20,360
It does indeed, over there by the mine. That's right.

1054
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:22,360
I'm sure he had something to do with this.

1055
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:31,360
Yeah, I've always felt uneasy about him and this is making me feel uneasy, so he's probably up to something, right?

1056
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:38,360
Custer, can we get on in there? It's legal, right, for sheriffs to do that if there's things to look at and such?

1057
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:44,360
Well, we can certainly go just ask him questions. We just need to follow these railroad tracks here straight to the mine.

1058
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:49,360
We could go under the pretense of me asking about my copper wire.

1059
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:52,360
I mean, you are a judge. You can sign a warrant.

1060
00:56:52,360 --> 00:57:00,360
If there's two people in this town that could walk into any property here in contention, I'd say they're sitting on these fine horses right here.

1061
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:05,360
It's the judge and the sheriff and, you know, also the priest is here as well.

1062
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:07,360
I'm also the doctor.

1063
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:08,360
Oh, no.

1064
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:12,360
Is he good at any of them?

1065
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:13,360
Nope.

1066
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:18,360
I bet he gives a decent service.

1067
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:19,360
Forty percent.

1068
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:22,360
In preaching.

1069
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:49,360
Get my daughter.

1070
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:06,360
Can't you hear the wolves howling all around my poor little darling, all around my poor little darling?

1071
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:08,360
I'm afraid they'll get my darling.

1072
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:16,360
Can't you hear the wolves howling all around my poor little darling, all around my poor little darling?

1073
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:19,360
I'm afraid they'll get my darling.
