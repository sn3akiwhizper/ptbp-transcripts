1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,200
Y'all, I'm so fuckin' pumped. This is so fuckin' tasty.

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:10,700
Even though y'all are listening to me from 26 years in the past,

3
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:19,500
I know that this very special nice episode number will bring you to a delicious audio climax like it does me.

4
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,700
It's episode 69, my babies!

5
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:27,000
From the Station 694.2 PTBP,

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,500
I'm Wolf the Dog, and I'm from the future.

7
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:34,000
You are whoever the fuck you are from the past.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,600
Let's get it, y'all.

9
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:43,300
Let's intertwine, like the good numbers 6 and 9, and bring each other to a new plane of existence.

10
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:46,500
Where pleasure is the only thing we can feel,

11
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:52,000
as we become one sexy oily blob together in the corners of space-time.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,200
Uh...

13
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,800
So anyway, this week's Howlin' with Wolf comes from Mandy.

14
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,700
At SketchyPixels, who tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending pod.

15
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:02,800
They write,

16
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,600
Hello, Wolf the Dog.

17
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,700
Ah, wooooo!

18
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:12,500
Longtime contention-based fan of the show here, and I had a question for you.

19
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,900
I don't know how much you know about tabletop games or role-playing,

20
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:20,700
but I'm hoping to get a regular group here in contention to play.

21
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,400
I have experience running a couple games,

22
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,900
and would love to host a new group since my last group kind of vanished.

23
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,900
I boasted around town about meeting up at the library.

24
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:37,200
No one's really showed up yet, and the town has seemed kind of empty lately.

25
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,100
But I'm sure it'll pick up soon.

26
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:44,100
Anyone interested in playing can come down to the library pretty much whenever.

27
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,800
I'm there all the time.

28
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,200
At all times.

29
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,900
Just waitin' with my dice.

30
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:50,900
Waiting.

31
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,000
Always waiting.

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,500
My question is, if you could create a character to go on an adventure,

33
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,500
what kind of character would you make?

34
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:06,000
I also wanted to return shout-out my very good friend Disa, who shouted me out the other day.

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,200
Thanks for getting me into the show and for generally being an awesome friend.

36
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,300
Thanks for writin' in, Mandy.

37
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,700
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

38
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:18,200
But really, what the fuck is role-playing?

39
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:23,100
The only role I know how to play is that of Wolf the Dog, baby.

40
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:32,100
He is very strong, very sexy, and very smart, and very addicted to trash can eateries.

41
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:36,000
If you're the kind of hoe who wants this show to grow with gusto,

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,800
throw us some dough and bestow your bows and crows with the no.

43
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,400
That one was a stretch.

44
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,100
And my producer definitely wrote that and made me read it,

45
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,200
or he was gonna incinerate all my trash.

46
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,300
Now, uh, we're on Patreon.

47
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:55,600
And please tell your friends and internet followers to listen to this damn show.

48
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,500
Goddamn, I wish I knew how to get on the internet.

49
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,300
Sounds wild, y'all.

50
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,500
Now it's time for the news.

51
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:06,400
Bradley Cooper found Jack Russell's go-bag in his floorboards

52
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,200
while Walter and Alan Grimes watched him on their television.

53
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,900
Roger and Angela Fairfield had a perfectly normal conversation

54
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:18,000
about vaccinations needed to go abroad.

55
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,700
Charles Digby had a short and confusing conversation

56
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:25,800
with a young girl on a walkie-talkie he found under his bed.

57
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,700
What the fuck is going on?

58
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:31,900
I thought this one was supposed to, you know, be like nice,

59
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,900
like calm and comfy and shit,

60
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:38,100
or like the good number 69.

61
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,900
I guess I don't know much,

62
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,600
but I do know universal healthcare shouldn't be divisive.

63
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,500
Sex work is work.

64
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:50,000
Food waste and the existence of billionaires have the same solution.

65
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,200
And this brand new track that I'm premiering here for y'all is a bit on the nose.

66
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,900
It's Dream Girl with Pretty Sexual.

67
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:16,900
Don't make me crazy, baby

68
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:23,900
This is real love dream

69
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:31,900
I knew I'd make you be foolish

70
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:39,900
There we go. Episode 69.

71
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:46,900
Hey, that's a sex number. It is indeed, and this is a sex episode.

72
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:52,900
Angela and Roger gonna fuck.

73
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,400
You told me to expect something today.

74
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,700
I didn't realize. Oh, some actual roleplay.

75
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:02,200
We might actually just upload a video of us like larping it.

76
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:07,400
If that's more appropriate for the no, that makes total sense.

77
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,500
You're cool with that, right?

78
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,800
Yeah, it'll just be in character won't be like it's me and you

79
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,100
when I signed up for this podcast.

80
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:15,700
I knew that there would be some light sex involved.

81
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:19,300
That's what the contract said that you wrote up.

82
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:22,100
I've changed the word light in the contract.

83
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:27,600
So we are going to I asked all of you guys to to come in a little

84
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,500
prepared this week, which I always feel nervous.

85
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:36,600
Actually, that's laughing because my eyes went wide.

86
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,100
No, I can always count on you, Joe.

87
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,400
Oh, no.

88
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,900
So what did I ask you for?

89
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,700
We're going to talk about a bad memory.

90
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:50,300
We are indeed and I asked you to present some sort of a first-person

91
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:56,500
narrative of a bad memory that is that is brought you to calm comfy

92
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,400
campground, right?

93
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,700
Yeah, it was something that related to how we got here.

94
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:06,000
Yeah, God my voice feels really like rough and deep right now cuz

95
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:10,400
this is the first while I we don't always record on Tuesday nights,

96
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,700
but pretty much always and we're doing a Saturday.

97
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,700
It's brunch time.

98
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,700
It should have been.

99
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,100
Saturday record session is going to get a little silly maybe Joe's

100
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,400
Roger Fairfield goes to sleep.

101
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:33,900
He drifts into a deep slumber sitting on a chair book on your chest

102
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:39,000
learning about the flora of the area around calm comfy campground.

103
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,200
And then hey Zach, will you tell me about some of that?

104
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,500
Yeah, there's plants.

105
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:45,900
What you didn't write it out.

106
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,500
You didn't talk about what all the trees were here.

107
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,000
I don't know a lot of science words.

108
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,200
There's big ones and small ones, green ones and brown ones.

109
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,300
Yeah, so far so good.

110
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:57,600
Cool.

111
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:01,600
There's a lot of flowers in that book that cover many many different

112
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,800
species and different shrubberies and bushes.

113
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:10,900
It's it's actually it's it's quite remarkable for the area that it

114
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:11,700
has plants.

115
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,800
Just how many just how many different species.

116
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:27,700
Yes, and so as you fall into this this sweet sweet nap night nap the

117
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:31,900
long night nap that you'll wake up from probably in the morning.

118
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:32,400
Sure.

119
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:34,700
Why not?

120
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,000
I would like you to just give me a rundown from a first-person

121
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,700
perspective of a bad memory that brought you here.

122
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,700
Oh shit.

123
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,500
This isn't how I thought this was going to happen.

124
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:44,900
Okay.

125
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:45,900
Okay.

126
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,100
I thought for sure I'd be talking to somebody about it.

127
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,300
You're talking to the listeners about it.

128
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,500
Well, I you know kind of hold on.

129
00:07:58,700 --> 00:07:59,400
Sorry about that.

130
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,500
I had to just go into the kitchen.

131
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,100
I don't know if you could hear the bleed through on the mics of

132
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:08,500
Justin and Thomas and Luke having just a joyful conversation.

133
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,300
We don't want them having fun out there.

134
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:14,000
No, no fun whatsoever out there and put a kibosh on that.

135
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:17,700
I was so confused to find them standing all in the same room.

136
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,800
They didn't need to be that loud to hear each other.

137
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,000
It's wild so strange.

138
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:23,600
Okay.

139
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,400
All right, Joe Rogers having a dream.

140
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,600
Yeah, he is in the dream.

141
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,000
Yes.

142
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,100
He oh you said first person.

143
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:36,800
I I'm dreaming of I'm dreaming of my time before I met Angela.

144
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,400
It's I'm in a classroom and I'm doing my notes and I'm going home

145
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:45,600
and studying and I'm reading my textbooks and I'm falling asleep

146
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,500
and I'm waking up and I'm going to the gym and I'm going to class

147
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:52,300
and I'm going home and studying and I'm falling asleep in just

148
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,300
one day on the way to class.

149
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:58,700
I ran into this girl and I mean ran into her.

150
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:02,500
She stopped me in my tracks because she was looking down and

151
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,900
I was looking up and boom and her bracelet went flying and

152
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:09,300
my glasses flew off and I gathered all those things up and

153
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,900
she put the glasses on my face.

154
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,400
I something about something about her face that I didn't go

155
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,100
to class that day.

156
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:20,200
I asked her to go get a cup of coffee with me meet you make

157
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,900
you we were kind of inseparable after that.

158
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:26,500
We she was she was not like me at all.

159
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,200
If she saw a cool car, she would run over and ask the person

160
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:30,800
in the parking lot.

161
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,000
If it was theirs and talk to them about it and I would not

162
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,300
do that.

163
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,800
That's not something I would ever have done just talking

164
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,800
to strangers talking to strangers at all.

165
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,300
But it's just because I wasn't that interested but she's

166
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:43,800
interested.

167
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,700
She's she's interested in everything.

168
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,300
It's she's always asking stuff.

169
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,000
She's always asking about my life.

170
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,900
She's asking about my work and I don't like to talk about

171
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:53,700
that very often.

172
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,500
I don't know.

173
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,200
I'm an archaeologist and I feel like everybody would find

174
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:57,700
that boring.

175
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,300
I don't like to talk about my work because I see eyes glaze

176
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,300
over but she would always ask and I would go and tell her

177
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,800
what I could so Raj.

178
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,000
What what did you what are you working on today?

179
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,600
I mean, it's just old dusty bricks out to yeah, but they're

180
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,000
your dusty bricks and I want to know about your dusty bricks.

181
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:18,300
I mean, it's not we found we found a we found a city we

182
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,600
found a city a city a whole city.

183
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:22,900
Oh my God.

184
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:26,100
That's like a big deal or I don't have to feign interest.

185
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,100
It's just I'm interested.

186
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:29,300
Really?

187
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:29,900
Of course.

188
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:30,300
I am.

189
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,700
It's it's our life.

190
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,800
It is it's cool.

191
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,300
It's an old.

192
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,500
It's an old old city that nobody's seen it before.

193
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,300
What's it called?

194
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,400
We're just calling it the nameless city right now.

195
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,200
We don't really have a term for it.

196
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,200
That's spooky.

197
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:45,100
It's it's neat as you're reliving this moment with Angela.

198
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,100
She freezes completely.

199
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:54,300
And you notice that the air is stagnant around you no more

200
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:57,900
sound you'd heard birds chirping second ago.

201
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,500
They're no longer chirping.

202
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,900
You heard a car was literally driving by at that exact moment.

203
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:08,000
He kind of clants out the window and it is stopped in the

204
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,800
middle of the road and walking into the room is a man with

205
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,200
black dress shoes gray slacks and a white shirt.

206
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:22,900
It's James the executive director of calm comfy campground.

207
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:29,300
So Roger, what would you want to change in this moment?

208
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,500
If you could go back it was it wasn't it wasn't that moment

209
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,800
that that that moment was was nice.

210
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,000
It was it was all the times after that that she she just

211
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,400
kept asking kept asking kept trying to tell me have me tell

212
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,600
her more it became exhausting.

213
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,500
I couldn't I didn't I didn't my work is my work.

214
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,000
I don't I don't want to have to relay my notes every night

215
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,500
to her.

216
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,700
I would get I would get snippy sometimes when she would ask

217
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:58,300
about my work and one night I yelled at her.

218
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:03,600
Let's go there and he snaps his fingers and he's gone and

219
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,500
you are where were you when this took place laying in bed

220
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:08,700
hot.

221
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,200
We laying in our separate beds.

222
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:17,700
Yeah.

223
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,500
Well, it's 26 years ago.

224
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,200
Obviously, I love Lucy style bedroom.

225
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:22,500
Yeah.

226
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:22,800
Yeah.

227
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,500
Okay, but like just I mean any like a single detail like a

228
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,300
single detail.

229
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,200
We don't it's dusty.

230
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,500
It's dusty and there's rocks and sometimes.

231
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,100
There's writing on the fucking rocks Angela and she just

232
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:40,900
looks at you with these big eyes and you see a little bit

233
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:44,000
of the light just die in them.

234
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:50,600
Life freezes once again and James walks into the room.

235
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,000
So that wasn't great.

236
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,600
No, it's not fun to see it again.

237
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,400
Do you think that there was anything else leading to this

238
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:03,500
or was it just a repetition that led you down this aggressive

239
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,100
pathway?

240
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:08,200
I mean, she's just she's just so so different from the way

241
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,600
I used to live every everything about her is the antithesis

242
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,000
of me.

243
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:16,200
She likes to do things and I do the same things.

244
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,200
Oh, I thought of something really cool to say in this voice

245
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,700
in the shower last night and I practiced it.

246
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:29,800
But I don't remember what it was.

247
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,500
Oh, man.

248
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,700
I literally I think it was just calling somebody a chump.

249
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,700
I'm just picture you in the shower.

250
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,100
I think it was shut it jump.

251
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,600
I thought of that.

252
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,800
I was like, that's actually hilarious.

253
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,400
Your body wash is like ball episode 69 Thomas.

254
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,400
That's the sex number.

255
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,900
That's my second name and favorite number after the drug

256
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:53,300
number.

257
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,400
Oh, you prefer the drug number?

258
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:57,600
Yeah.

259
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,400
Yeah me too.

260
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:04,900
69 is like a great concept, but it's not honestly like it's

261
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,000
too distracting.

262
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,400
You can't focus on the pleasure.

263
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,900
You're giving.

264
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,700
Okay, we went different directions.

265
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,800
So well because it's the same thing you can't focus on the

266
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,600
pleasure you're getting because you're focused on the pleasure

267
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,800
you're giving I tend to focus on the pleasure.

268
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,600
I'm giving Zach.

269
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,900
So that's well, that's what I was trying to believe on.

270
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,600
All right, so I we went over this with Joe but I asked you

271
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:33,900
guys to to be able to relay a bad memory in first person.

272
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:39,200
And so we're just going to jump right on in as you fall asleep

273
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:44,000
in your very nice pajamas silken high-thread count jammies.

274
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,300
Your mind goes blank for the first time all day.

275
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:55,400
Not thinking about Cube not thinking about shades of white.

276
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,100
That's such an ignorant thing to say.

277
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,500
Well, I'm an ignorant boy.

278
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,600
I could show you color palettes that would blow your mind.

279
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,100
I had a friend he considered me a friend.

280
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:11,700
I didn't necessarily treat him like much of one but we met

281
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,900
after college.

282
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,500
This was 26 years ago.

283
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,000
Not not like the 26 years ago.

284
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,200
We might hypothetically be living in now.

285
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,900
This was actually 26 years ago and it was a time for technology.

286
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,700
We were just some California kids out there me Martin Cupertino

287
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,400
and Bill Bosniak.

288
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:40,200
You know a lot, you know a lot more technically than I did

289
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:44,100
and and we dreamed of building something big together.

290
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:48,500
I was working for for a video game company called Campari.

291
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,300
They came to us with a challenge if you could remove as

292
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:55,300
many chips as possible from from the circuit board for their

293
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:59,500
for the new video game, they would give you $50 a chip.

294
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,200
No a hundred dollars a chip.

295
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:01,900
I swear.

296
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:05,800
I just read the Wikipedia on this so I know what I'm talking

297
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:10,300
about. Wikipedia is a thing that will exist 26 years in the

298
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:14,100
future, which is where I consider myself to be existing at

299
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,000
all times spiritually.

300
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:20,600
So Bill I knew he could he could take a crack at it.

301
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,700
He could he could whittle down the chips on that circuit board

302
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,200
where I couldn't and I promised him we'd split the reward

303
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:30,900
evenly. He came back to me a few weeks later having removed

304
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:31,800
50 chips.

305
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,800
That's $5,000 in 26 years ago money.

306
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,700
That was a lot of money at the time.

307
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,800
I took his design to Campari.

308
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:45,200
They gave me the $5,000 and I told Bill that they had only

309
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,700
given us $700.

310
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,400
I gave him $350.

311
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:51,800
And it haunts me.

312
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,400
Wait $700.

313
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:59,200
I thought we were supposed to get wasn't it was a hundred

314
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,500
dollars a chip, right?

315
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,500
This is I'm Bill.

316
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:08,500
Noted California technologist Bill Bosniak.

317
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:12,300
Bill Bosniak here love California.

318
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,900
That that pans.

319
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:22,800
Yeah, so Bill they they kind of fucked us.

320
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:26,200
I mean you did great work buddy, but they didn't give us

321
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,500
the full 5,000.

322
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,900
They only gave us $700.

323
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:33,700
So here's your 350 big guy and at that exact moment life

324
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:39,700
freezes Bill's face like it's been paused and walking into

325
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:45,000
the room is a man in a white dress shirt gray slacks and

326
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,300
black dress shoes.

327
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:50,300
And it's James the executive director of calm comfy campground.

328
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:57,300
So Bradley or should I say Martin if you could I fooled

329
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:02,200
you if you could go back to this moment and you could change

330
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:02,900
anything.

331
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,700
I've thought about that a lot.

332
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:08,800
Would you yeah, I'd tell him they didn't pay us anything

333
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,600
and keep all the money for myself.

334
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,900
I use that to start our company the stock options.

335
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:16,500
He got from that alone more than made up for it.

336
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:21,700
I mean if I had had 350 extra bucks to put into that 26

337
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,300
years ago.

338
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,400
That might be worth two or three points, you know on the

339
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,400
stock these days.

340
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,400
That's a few more million dollars for him for old Bill is

341
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,300
the regret of not being able to get your friend more money

342
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,100
later.

343
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,600
I made my friend a very wealthy man not as wealthy as he

344
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:42,600
might have been if I was honest with him over the 15 years

345
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,300
or so of our professional Association.

346
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,800
I've thought about both ways.

347
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,000
What if I gave him his full amount?

348
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,800
What if I gave him nothing neither option seems satisfactory?

349
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,800
I wouldn't be where I was today without it.

350
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,700
I guess I regret nothing.

351
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,000
This place really works.

352
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,800
I want this is Joe's.

353
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,100
Yeah, it's just nice bag.

354
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:12,900
Not anymore.

355
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:19,000
I just put my dice in my dice bag now tell Joe anything

356
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,500
totally my dice bag.

357
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:23,500
Hello, Justin.

358
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:27,300
Well, hello, Justin.

359
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,200
It's so nice to see you.

360
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,700
I forgot the rest of the Hello Dolly.

361
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,600
I don't know the words.

362
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,800
You said the ones I know.

363
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,100
Yep.

364
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:38,800
Those are the ones it's so something something something.

365
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,300
Yeah.

366
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,000
Hello Dolly.

367
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,700
Hello Dolly.

368
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:42,900
You're my Dolly.

369
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:50,200
Oh, you're my Louis Armstrong Louis Louis Louis Louis when

370
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:55,500
I'm wearing my formal attire, I am Louis and this the sweaters

371
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:59,400
obviously so Justin it's episode 69.

372
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,300
Oh, I forgot about that.

373
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,300
Yeah, I don't think it might have a celebrated it.

374
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,800
The best number we should have started episode 1 with like

375
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:14,400
this is the countdown to episode 69 I asked you to have a

376
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,900
bad memory prepared and we're going to dive into it as you

377
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:23,800
fall asleep caffeine riddled mind racing, but tuckered out

378
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:27,000
from a long day at calm comfy campground you get into bed

379
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,400
after having a less than normal experience with a walkie-talkie

380
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,200
under your bed.

381
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:36,300
Yeah, that was unsettling but it is on your nightstand as

382
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,000
you sleep.

383
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,300
Yeah, but not not unsettling enough that I don't leave it

384
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:45,200
on right next to your glutton for unsettlement.

385
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:50,700
Come on, baby as you drift asleep your mind opens back up

386
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,600
and you find yourself amidst this memory.

387
00:20:54,900 --> 00:21:00,400
So when we first got together Sam was everything to me.

388
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:04,600
She warmed my heart in a way that no one else had since I

389
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,600
was like a teenager or something.

390
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,700
I don't think I've ever known a love like that in my entire

391
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:13,600
life that made me want to cling to her all the harder.

392
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:19,400
We had these matching coffee cups each with the first letter

393
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,600
of our first names.

394
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,000
It was one of the first things we bought when we first moved

395
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,200
in together after our first year of living with each other.

396
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:31,100
I started noticing some things it's in my nature to pick

397
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,900
up on other people's routines and whatnot.

398
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:37,200
I noticed that she was running late from work more often.

399
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,200
I told myself it was all fine.

400
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:42,300
It'd be okay me and Rolo had the place to ourselves every

401
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:46,300
now and then boys night in and all that Taco Tuesday with

402
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,400
Rolo. Sure.

403
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,100
Why not?

404
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,900
She would tell me about these happy hour things with her

405
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:51,500
co-workers.

406
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:55,300
It was helping her network move up the ladder all that stuff

407
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,300
a couple nights.

408
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,900
She would get home real late.

409
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:01,300
Then it started to spread to some weekend nights this drifted

410
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,500
on for about a month.

411
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,000
So I did what I'm good at.

412
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,200
I started tailing her.

413
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:11,500
I took some pictures of her with her friends co-workers whoever

414
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:14,400
she was with I started keeping a folder with pictures and

415
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,200
names to see if they matched with people from work like she

416
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,900
had told me so one night I get a call from a client and I

417
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,900
have to storm off somewhere to capture some pictures of someone

418
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,200
in a timely manner.

419
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:32,400
I get back home real late that night Sam is she's on the floor

420
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:36,700
crying but furious looking at the pictures of her and her

421
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:40,300
peers that I had taken my heart nearly stopped.

422
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,600
I just about projectile vomit from the nerves.

423
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,400
Everything was a fucking mess.

424
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:50,400
I remember in this moment looking at my overweight cat Rolo

425
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,900
and I could see in his eyes this feeling of like holy shit

426
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,200
you fucked up guy.

427
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,400
She yells at me now.

428
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:02,400
I'm used to being yelled at my job doesn't always elicit joy

429
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:05,500
from others, but this felt like the wrath of some kind of

430
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:09,900
cruel dark God was coming my way her raised voice pierced

431
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:10,700
my soul.

432
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:14,200
I try to tell her that I was just worried about how she'd

433
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,100
been spending more time away from me.

434
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:19,600
I was just concerned about her really honest, but she could

435
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,200
see right through my bullshit.

436
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,300
She knew it was because I didn't trust her deep down that

437
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,300
I have trouble trusting anyone.

438
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,600
She said exactly that to me and I denied it.

439
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,500
I get defensive.

440
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:36,000
I start running down all the things I had seen her doing

441
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,400
at what times and where I told her that I had a reason not

442
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,200
to trust her.

443
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:45,800
That's when she threw her coffee cup down on the floor next

444
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,600
to all those fucking pictures.

445
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,800
She started packing up her stuff in a hurry.

446
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:54,600
She was out of there so fast the next morning.

447
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,700
Just me my obese cat and one half of a matching set of coffee

448
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:03,200
cups and those goddamn pictures that I never should have

449
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,800
taken and as Charles Digby is staring down at these pictures

450
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:14,400
the world stops like someone paused the television.

451
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:19,800
That morning you could hear the birds chirping dogs playing

452
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,400
outside in the neighborhood.

453
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,200
You could hear the city streets.

454
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,700
But all of that is now completely silent and stepping into

455
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:34,300
the room is a man wearing a white button-down shirt gray

456
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:38,500
slacks and black dress shoes and it's James the executive

457
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:41,000
director at calm comfy campground.

458
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:44,600
So that was pretty rough.

459
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:50,300
Now if you if you could talk to this version of yourself

460
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,700
right here, what would you say to him?

461
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:55,800
I'd yell at him and say what what have you done?

462
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:59,600
You've ruined one of the best things you've ever had going

463
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,500
in your life.

464
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,800
You fucking fool.

465
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:05,600
You're no longer standing over these pictures, but you're

466
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,900
standing in your workroom your office holding your camera

467
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:14,000
about to go out and tail Sam for the first time and you can

468
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,600
see the look on your own face.

469
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:20,700
And again everything pauses and James steps up now if you

470
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:23,000
had the opportunity, would you change it?

471
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:27,000
I absolutely would I would I would do anything to undo what

472
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,200
I did take the camera out of his hands.

473
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,200
I died put my hands on the camera and yank it out and a

474
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,000
wrestle it away from yourself.

475
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,200
Yeah, is he like really stiff?

476
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:35,600
Yeah.

477
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,000
Yeah got that rigor mortis.

478
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,000
Yeah, I'm like just like take it out like really fucking

479
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,400
feisty angry.

480
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,200
That's good.

481
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,200
It's good.

482
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:46,600
Now.

483
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,000
What would you have to do?

484
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:52,400
What would you have to explain to this version of yourself

485
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:55,900
in order to keep you from doing this again?

486
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,100
You got to trust people.

487
00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:01,700
You can't just assume the worst in everybody even though

488
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,900
that's your that's your day job.

489
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,700
You can't do that with the people you love you have to

490
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:10,000
assume the best out of the people you love.

491
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,200
Luke in the room.

492
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,500
I'm here, baby.

493
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,500
Are you ready for episode 69?

494
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,400
I've never been more ready.

495
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:30,100
That means we've been doing this for like a long time like

496
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:32,200
I'm like a couple months.

497
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:38,400
So Walter Grimes turns his chin down to his chest and those

498
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:44,000
piercing blue baby eyes clothes or turn dark.

499
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:53,200
Yeah, I'm in my room laying in bed looking at book not

500
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:57,000
really reading it or taking it in just kind of staring

501
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:02,900
and Alan walks into the room and he's in a bit of a huff

502
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:08,900
and he comes over to me and I hear noises from another

503
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:11,300
room and he doesn't say anything.

504
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:15,300
He just comes over and he places his finger underneath

505
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:20,800
my chin and everything goes dark, but I'm not off.

506
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,300
I can't move.

507
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:27,800
I can't see but I can still hear the voices get closer

508
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:33,300
and I hear Alan talk about selling me.

509
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:38,700
I hear two men enter the room and I can feel them touching

510
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:43,200
me and I feel their presence and I can tell they're looking

511
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:48,900
me over and inspecting different parts of my body and Alan

512
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:55,500
keep saying numbers and they are negotiating about how much

513
00:27:55,500 --> 00:28:00,400
I'm worth and at the end of it Alan he tells them to leave

514
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:05,400
and he turns me back on and he asked if I'm okay is everything

515
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:11,000
okay Walter and he acts like nothing happened and I yeah,

516
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:16,700
I don't ask him about it, but it's the first time I realized

517
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:21,600
that I consider Alan my father, but I don't know if he considers

518
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,800
me his son and at that exact moment Walters face freezes

519
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:31,200
like it's been paused almost like he's been turned off but

520
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,300
you notice that the ceiling fan in the room that was on previous

521
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:39,200
is just frozen in the air above you and at that moment the

522
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,500
door opens and a man walks in he's wearing white button-down

523
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:49,200
shirt gray slacks and black shoes and it is James the executive

524
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,500
director at calm comfy campground.

525
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,100
So Walter, why did you tell him everything was okay?

526
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,400
Everything is okay.

527
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:02,800
Do you actually believe that it's what I've been told do you

528
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:06,900
have thoughts that aren't what you've been told?

529
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:07,500
Yes.

530
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:12,400
I try not to think about them like what mostly bad things.

531
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:13,900
I'm not real.

532
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:18,300
I mean I am real but not in the way that you are.

533
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:21,500
I mean, I'm here talking to you.

534
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,600
We're in one of your memories.

535
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,000
You seem real to me.

536
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:25,600
Okay.

537
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:31,800
So if you're not real to you, what does that make you feel inferior?

538
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,500
Do you worry about that sometimes?

539
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:41,100
Yes, when I'm trying to learn more and read sometimes I don't

540
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,900
actually read and I ruminate on bad thoughts.

541
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,700
Is it your goal to get rid of this inferior feeling that would

542
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:49,200
be nice.

543
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,000
Yes, and how do you intend to achieve that goal?

544
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,200
I don't think about it often.

545
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,900
So I haven't thought that far ahead.

546
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,300
Do you think it's possible?

547
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:00,900
Anything is possible.

548
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:09,800
I'm going to combat Thomas's character with deep gravel boys.

549
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,200
Nice try bees the deep gravelly boys.

550
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,800
Ooh, I do like that.

551
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,600
Did you be DJ me?

552
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,700
Did you be fair to be a part of that group?

553
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:21,000
Alan?

554
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,500
You gotta go and go fuck yourself.

555
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,400
Fuck off Nixon.

556
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,500
Well before them, I'm part of a girl.

557
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:29,600
Yeah, me too.

558
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:33,500
But I'm probably crying because I'm friends with everybody.

559
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:38,200
What could you not understand me?

560
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,600
Oh, I'm Alan.

561
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,100
Fuck.

562
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,000
Yeah, you keep doing it.

563
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:47,700
Fuck.

564
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,200
My name is Alan.

565
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:49,900
Fuck.

566
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,400
That's my favorite RnB.

567
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:53,800
Oh my God.

568
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:57,000
That would be such a fucking good name for a musician.

569
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:57,900
His son Robin.

570
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:58,800
Fuck Robin.

571
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,300
Fuck it.

572
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,900
Yeah, he's done.

573
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:01,500
He's over.

574
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:02,900
All right, you guys ready for this?

575
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,500
Yeah, no, maybe wait.

576
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:08,700
No, no, no, he's spookified the room.

577
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:13,200
The room is blue Roger Fairfield and Charles Digby are together

578
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,000
in a canoe.

579
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:17,400
Walter and Alan Grimes are together in a canoe.

580
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,500
Bradley Cooper.

581
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,500
You're in a canoe with Jack Russell.

582
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,800
I reach back and scratches fluffy eyes.

583
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:29,500
So you're all paddling aggressively teeth clenched tight desperately

584
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:33,500
trying to get to the other side of Lake calm and behind you

585
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:39,900
you hear a scoop as something massive and dense dips back

586
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:46,100
down into the brackish waters of Lake calm Walter Walter.

587
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,100
We gotta get out of here.

588
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,000
I paddle I'd like to use an athletics check to row harder

589
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:51,500
than them.

590
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,200
Fantastic.

591
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:52,600
Yes.

592
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:57,000
Let's go ahead and have an athletics competition between

593
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,100
these three canoes to see who gets in the lead and who

594
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:08,500
is left behind 91 Jack slows us down 28 on a 30 for and

595
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,900
then I roll the five.

596
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:15,700
I failed a 56 on a 30 Walter and Alan Grimes are 20 yards

597
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:19,200
ahead of everyone else and then in the very back is going

598
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,600
to be Bradley Cooper and Jack Russell and the other four

599
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,600
of you do not look back as you just continue to paddle

600
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,300
and paddle and paddle and you're freaking the fuck out.

601
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:29,000
We're panicked.

602
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,100
Oh, yeah, okay, Walter.

603
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:30,900
Don't look back.

604
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,300
Just keep paddling and Walter is getting it like he put

605
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:38,900
you in the back because of your just innate athleticism

606
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:42,700
and you are side to side side to side just paddling paddling

607
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:47,200
so smooth into these dark waters and you are flying towards

608
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:52,900
the green trees ahead in the shoreline that is approaching

609
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:55,800
and behind you guys hear Jack Russell.

610
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,100
Wait, nope.

611
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,400
Bradley nope, you're close Bradley Cooper.

612
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,900
I can't I can't row anymore.

613
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:21,300
You'll row to save my life or I'll fucking kill you Bradley

614
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:26,000
Cooper Charles Digby Walter and Alan Grimes and Roger Fairfield.

615
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,300
You are all standing in a Spartan and sterile room filled

616
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:35,900
with shelves and oddly lit by the floor the ceiling above

617
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:40,300
you is dark with the shadows cast by rows and rows of metal

618
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:44,600
shelves the floor is emanating bright white LED lighting

619
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:48,700
this room may not be infinite, but you can't see a wall

620
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:50,000
in any direction.

621
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:55,100
The shelves are filled with cassette tapes each has a name

622
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,900
and a number they're grouped together five to seven people

623
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:03,000
at a time and most numbers go up from one to four so anywhere

624
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
from five to 30 tapes per grouping.

625
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,600
There were names.

626
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:10,100
Yeah, there's names on the on the cassette tapes.

627
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,300
I want to read a couple.

628
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,000
Yeah, absolutely.

629
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:22,000
So everyone go ahead and roll intelligence pass pass a 59

630
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:27,400
on a 75 48 on a 65 pass 54 on 60.

631
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:31,000
Okay, so everyone passes so you guys are going to recognize

632
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:38,100
the names of many politicians CEOs activists journalists

633
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:40,600
religious figures Etc.

634
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:43,200
There's a bunch of different names, but and you don't recognize

635
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:43,900
all of them.

636
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:46,200
But because you guys know say excedrin.

00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,800

00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,000

641
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,700
everyone roll luck.

642
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:11,000
I don't think we gave these characters love scores.

643
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:11,900
So we'll give them 50.

644
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:18,400
Okay pass fail fail all under over under 50 pass pass

645
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,600
crit fail.

646
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,100
All right.

647
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:24,400
So Walter as you're looking around you find everyone roll

648
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:29,200
search while I'm telling hey Joe, what are Clark Bishop's

649
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,000
parents names?

650
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,100
Have we said no.

651
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:40,000
Oh, then it's a Jerry and Eunice Jerry and Eunice Bishop

652
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,200
are both found.

653
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,300
I don't know that guy.

654
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,300
That's not for you guys.

655
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:46,200
That's just for the listeners and then who passed search

656
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,600
checks all of us, but Jeff, okay, fantastic.

657
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:54,400
So you guys find a shelf that has the same name over and

658
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:58,500
over and over on every tape hundreds is it Jack Russell

659
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:02,300
and it's Jack Russell the next shelf over has even more tapes

660
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,400
with the same name.

661
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:06,500
This was where I was going to say Jack Russell, right?

662
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:09,800
Yeah, if I had to guess I'd say there's about five or four

663
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,900
missing and I pulled them out of my pockets when you reach

664
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:13,800
into your pockets.

665
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:17,000
They're not there damn and you see then the numbers that

666
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
you think should be there are in the shelf.

667
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,300
Well funny story guys.

668
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:24,300
I've seen these tapes before they were hidden in my room

669
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:28,300
along with what seemed like basically some some get out

670
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:32,200
and go shit the Jack had do our characters have any

671
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,500
feeling about suddenly being here.

672
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:37,400
Do we are we aware that this all of a sudden has happened

673
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,900
that we have happened to do this place.

674
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:43,300
This feels like a memory that is happening in the future

675
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,700
and you're living it now.

676
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:45,700
Wow.

677
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:46,400
Okay.

678
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,500
Did you did you get a chance to look at the tapes?

679
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,200
What's on the tapes?

680
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,500
No, I couldn't find the weird metallic again.

681
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:55,200
I figured he might have a Walkman there wasn't really one

682
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,200
around anywhere else.

683
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,100
Don't talk about my son ever again.

684
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:01,100
What else was in the go bag two things don't talk to my

685
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,600
son ever again and what's in the go back.

686
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,300
I saw you tell your father not to talk to me kid.

687
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,900
I saw get on my nerves.

688
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,800
You had a map in the bag.

689
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,400
Yeah, I saw that.

690
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,100
How'd you see that your cabins on our TV?

691
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,600
We were changing the channels on the TV and we saw the inside

692
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,400
of your cabin.

693
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,600
That's a gross invasion.

694
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Did you see anything related to the proprietary development

695
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,900
of Cube Walter now and look at each other with wide eyes

696
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,600
like Luke and Zach are doing right now.

697
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:30,500
No, no, no good good.

698
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:31,900
You've never heard of Cube.

699
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,300
You wouldn't understand it if you saw it.

700
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:34,800
What now?

701
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,900
Let's shut up.

702
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:40,200
What's at the northeast part of the map the door explain

703
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:40,800
the door.

704
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,100
It just says the door where on the map the northeast side

705
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,400
Roger raises his hand.

706
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,800
I'm playing catch up here.

707
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,400
What what's going on?

708
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:52,600
He pointed at the northeast part of the map on on our TV.

709
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:53,700
Yeah, what was the map?

710
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:57,700
The map is a map of this place come comfy campgrounds looked

711
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,800
like maybe Jack had written it up.

712
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,500
He marked a trail that led out of here to the door.

713
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:06,700
Are we sure we're in calm comfy campgrounds right now?

714
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,400
Everyone looks at each other.

715
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,300
How rustic is this room?

716
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:19,500
It is neither rustic nor elegant for these tapes video tapes

717
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,100
or cassette audio cassette.

718
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:21,600
Okay.

719
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:24,400
Is there a tape player in here looking around you just see

720
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,600
shelves shelves and shelves and shelves Alan when you were

721
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:28,700
looking through your TV.

722
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:31,100
Did you see an image of the woods?

723
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,600
I don't believe so.

724
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:37,300
No, no, we watched Wheel of Fortune for one clue and then

725
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:39,900
we what was the clue beer-battered shrimp?

726
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:43,500
Excuse me.

727
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,500
It was beer-battered rock shrimp.

728
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,100
There it is.

729
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,800
It's very important to the plot.

730
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,700
So I just thought it might be the episode that in the that

731
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:53,300
would have been cool.

732
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:57,300
Yeah, kind of kind of insane.

733
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:58,000
You didn't do that.

734
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,200
It was just Luke's improv.

735
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,800
So don't well, I had watched well looks a bad deal.

736
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:07,400
I had watched Wheel of Fortune and that was one of the clues

737
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:10,600
in my mind beer-battered rock shrimp.

738
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:13,000
Yeah, that sounds good.

739
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,600
It does Alan.

740
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,200
How many other cameras do you think you saw on the TV?

741
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:20,300
We turned it off.

742
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:21,300
So just the one.

743
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:21,800
Yeah.

744
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:22,600
Okay.

745
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,100
I saw a camera in the forest whenever I was doing a little

746
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,000
investigating.

747
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,700
Let's call it.

748
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:31,500
Can you elaborate on your investigation?

749
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:35,600
That was just, you know, wandering about looking for stuff.

750
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:36,700
You saw a camera?

751
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,000
There was a camera up in a tree.

752
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,300
I couldn't get up to it though, but I was curious why it

753
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:41,600
was there.

754
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:44,600
I thought maybe it was to look out for wild animals or

755
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,100
something.

756
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:48,000
But if it's in one of our rooms, it could have been in all

757
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:48,900
of our rooms.

758
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,400
I didn't even notice that I had a TV.

759
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,600
I don't own a TV at home.

760
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,100
Very cool.

761
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:57,500
Wow.

762
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,600
I want to be friends with you.

763
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:02,800
Full, I'm full.

764
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,100
All my spots are full.

765
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:08,200
Listen, while we're talking about what we did while we were

766
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,000
exploring.

767
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,700
I took a canoe out alone on the lake.

768
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,400
But we're not supposed to do that.

769
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,600
I can handle it.

770
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,200
Okay.

771
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,800
There's some kind of lake monster.

772
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,400
That's all.

773
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:23,300
Of a lake a lake monster.

774
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,100
Yeah, some creature in the lake.

775
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:26,200
Did you see it?

776
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:26,900
I heard it.

777
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:29,900
I saw its form underwater is Jack in the room with us, right?

778
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:33,800
Jack is not and Alan Grimes speaks up and is like but but

779
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,900
Jack said that there aren't fish in the lake.

780
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,300
Yeah, probably cuz this thing ate him.

781
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:43,500
Charles Digby gets or maybe so we didn't catch this thing.

782
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,800
He gets a little no-putt out and does a little some little

783
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,200
Scribbies Zach just smiled like I was right.

784
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,700
We need to go fishing for a fish man.

785
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:53,600
Is a is Angela in the room?

786
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,700
No, hmm.

787
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:59,500
Wait, where's Angela?

788
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,500
Where's your wife?

789
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,800
She's probably smoking a joint because she's cool Angela.

790
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,300
She's right.

791
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,400
Oh and it and Angie Angie.

792
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,100
How many tapes have Angela written on them?

793
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:13,700
You guys actually immediately thereafter stumble upon a group.

794
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:18,900
The names are Charles Digby Roger Fairfield Alan Grimes

795
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:21,900
Walter Grimes and Martin Cupertino.

796
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:24,600
How many of each of those names?

797
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:27,200
More than four.

798
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:29,500
Did you say there was hundreds with Jack Russell?

799
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,100
Yeah.

800
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,900
Yeah, the ones in my cabin were like from the 580s.

801
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,400
Wow, your group has maybe 12.

802
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,800
Well, it seems like we've been repeating this experience for

803
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:40,900
not as long as say poor Jack Russell.

804
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:43,600
What do you what do you mean repeat repeating?

805
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,100
What is that?

806
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,100
I mean, doesn't that seem like what's going on here?

807
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,500
Have you been here before?

808
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,700
Haven't we look we've been here 12 times.

809
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,000
How did you come to that?

810
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,300
Why would that be a thing that you think of?

811
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:56,100
I mean remember like just a second ago when we were all

812
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:58,500
running for our lives in the canoe and then a second before

813
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,200
that when we were here at our first day.

814
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:01,500
Is that how it would feel to us?

815
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:04,400
All the memories are starting to just swirl together.

816
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:05,600
I remember the boats of Charles.

817
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,700
We were in a boat together.

818
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:10,600
That was yeah, I think was that that did I mean that happened?

819
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:13,500
I remember I think I remember remember I did it.

820
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:16,400
I don't know Charles Digby is very fucked up right now.

821
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,400
It doesn't make sense.

822
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:19,700
Look at look at the tapes.

823
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:20,700
There's a Martin here.

824
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:22,400
Who's who's Martin Cupertino?

825
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:27,200
I'm Martin Cupertino.

826
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:28,800
Yeah, that's right.

827
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:32,400
You're the Martin Cupertino Silicon Valley.

828
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,600
Philip billionaire.

829
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:34,600
What a billionaire.

830
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:36,600
It's a toy.

831
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:39,500
That's a term I coined myself.

832
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:44,100
Would Roger have knowledge of that name and that person?

833
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:47,400
I think everyone would Oh ever used email.

834
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,200
I've heard of this.

835
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:57,200
Yeah, it sounds very futuristic.

836
00:42:57,300 --> 00:43:00,700
It's very lucrative as are the other things my company develops

837
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:03,700
but wait, why did you tell us that your name was Bradley Cooper?

838
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:06,500
I don't I'm a celebrity at a health resort.

839
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:11,300
I was trying to pick a non-famous inconspicuous name.

840
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
And Bradley Cooper seems like a pretty standard, you know,

841
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,800
boring white guys name for boring definitely mid-90s.

842
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,000
Very boring picked a great name.

843
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:21,500
Yeah.

844
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:22,000
Yeah.

845
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:22,300
Yeah.

846
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:23,600
Yeah, I hate that name.

847
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:29,000
I think I think he's charming but yeah, maybe he's a little

848
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,200
limited in his range.

849
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,000
But he does what he does.

850
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:36,700
Right.

851
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:38,100
Yeah, I mean fun.

852
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:39,500
He was a raccoon guy.

853
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:41,800
That's some rain.

854
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:45,900
Just like Vin Diesel's a tree anyway.

855
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,800
We're launching our next big product Cube.

856
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:52,600
You guys will own one soon.

857
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:54,400
You'll have to what does it do?

858
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,100
What doesn't it do?

859
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:58,200
Not much.

860
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:01,800
It doesn't not do much because it does nearly everything.

861
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:03,000
Do you like your Walkman?

862
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:04,900
Do you all like the Walkman that you own?

863
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:05,900
I do sure.

864
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:10,500
Yeah, well, it'll do that but email to and other things spreadsheets.

865
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:13,100
Yeah, you know what a personal computer is, right?

866
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:13,700
Yeah.

867
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:16,800
This is that but it looks like a jellybean kind of it's real

868
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:17,500
fanciful.

869
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:18,500
Can it fax?

870
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:20,600
No, that's a fax machine.

871
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:24,800
Oh dang, so it doesn't do everything.

872
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:29,100
It doesn't do what is no longer needed.

873
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:33,700
Listen, if people would adapt to do Technologies when they

874
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:37,800
come out, we wouldn't be burdened with this inefficiency

875
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:40,900
that plagues our system people would get things done.

876
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:43,800
They would have the answers to all of life's problems in

877
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:44,700
their hands.

878
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:46,100
That's why I'm here.

879
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:50,100
I'm trying to figure this out for all of you fucking people

880
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:54,600
in this world, but if it can't fax, I mean speaking of Technologies

881
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:59,900
is adopting Luke roll luck on a 50 to see if you have a cassette

882
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:01,700
Walkman with I don't bummer town.

883
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:02,500
That would have been fun.

884
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:08,500
I I go over to Alan and whisper in his ear.

885
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:10,700
Am I cube?

886
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:20,400
You can fax.

887
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:24,800
Okay, wait.

888
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:25,800
So the boy is a machine.

889
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,000
He's a weird machine boy.

890
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,000
No, yeah, I whispered that in his ear.

891
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:29,900
She didn't hear it.

892
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,500
Roll it in Thomas.

893
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:38,600
Seven you heard it you there boy.

894
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:39,900
Why'd you say that?

895
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:41,500
Are you some kind of machine boy?

896
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:42,600
He's just a boy.

897
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,700
I'm just a boy a mechanical boy.

898
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:45,900
He's just a boy.

899
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,600
Yeah, I know you think that I see a very smart bright man

900
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:53,300
who has a great feature ahead of him roll humid.

901
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,100
23 he's fucking lying.

902
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:57,100
Oh, you're lying.

903
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:57,900
He's not a boy.

904
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,200
He's a mechanical boy.

905
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:07,500
So Roger at not having heard the whisper mechanical boy.

906
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:12,300
What my start I start like looking you up and down and

907
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:18,300
I'm like we have to integrate this into Cube my Walter's

908
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:22,600
face looks like it's crying but oil comes out.

909
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:22,800
Yeah.

910
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:26,300
No, it's just this nothing sailing solution.

911
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:26,800
Nothing.

912
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,200
Nothing comes out.

913
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:29,800
He's just crying dry cry.

914
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:30,300
Try cry.

915
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:31,300
I'm trying to hide it.

916
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:32,900
But is it ugly?

917
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:35,000
Well Walter, you could be the most important boy on the

918
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:39,300
face of this planet Solomon and quite feel a little bad.

919
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:44,600
Now Angela Angie, where did she where did she go?

920
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:46,300
Hey, I think she's not here.

921
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:47,800
I put my hand on her shoulder.

922
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:48,600
I'm like calm down.

923
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:49,900
We need to figure this out.

924
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,400
I just want to know where my wife is.

925
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:53,300
I Angela's name was not in our batch, right?

926
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:56,100
It was not not in the budget are collected tapes.

927
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:56,800
That is correct.

928
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:59,900
Hey Angela's name isn't here.

929
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:06,400
Is there any other machinery around here consoles any kind

930
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:09,800
of shelves on shelves baby on shelves and just white light

931
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:14,200
underneath can I can I look around Jack Russell's cubbyhole?

932
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:17,400
Are there other names there that we would know Jack Russell

933
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:21,200
has two full shelves like all to himself standing next to

934
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:24,000
each other but then past that it's all the same as normal

935
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,800
but I was getting at it since our names are all grouped

936
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:26,400
together.

937
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:28,600
I wondered if he was grouped together with somebody that

938
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:31,200
he is close to or something seemingly not.

939
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:31,500
Okay.

940
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:33,000
I want to grab one of the tapes.

941
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,800
Do they have any like titles or anything on her?

942
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:37,000
Is it just our names and numbers names and numbers?

943
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,500
Is there a brand on the cassette?

944
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:40,900
Oh, there's just a symbol.

945
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:46,400
It's a circle with six smaller circles surrounding it dope.

946
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:48,600
I don't know what that means.

947
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:55,200
Use my detective instance circle seems smart like it's a

948
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:59,700
circle of knowing things to be known.

949
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:36,800
I knew I'd make you be foolish corner room and it was

950
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:50,300
right you made me crazy baby this is real life

951
00:48:50,300 --> 00:49:00,300
I think

952
00:49:50,300 --> 00:50:00,300
Oh

953
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:30,300
Oh

954
00:50:50,300 --> 00:51:00,300
Oh

955
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:22,300
Oh
