00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,920
Hello, my talk show audience. It's your host with the most advice, Dr. Wolf the dog.

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:16,080
I always believe in quantity over quality when it comes to talking people through their complex problems.

3
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:23,040
The more words I say, the more likely you are to believe I know what the hell I'm even talking about.

4
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:30,400
And I am chatting at you live from 694.2 PTBP as always.

5
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,120
But not as always. We got a different type of episode today.

6
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:41,520
Well, them boys from pretending to be people ain't seen each other in person in so long.

7
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,560
But today I got a real sweet treat for y'all.

8
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:50,400
Those five fine fellas use the internet to have a remote conversation with each other.

9
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:56,080
During this talk, they attempted to answer every single question sent in from y'all.

10
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:00,240
Our beautiful and charismatic listeners.

11
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,840
I only have remote conversations with everyone.

12
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,080
So I don't know what the big hubbub is over all this stuff.

13
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,760
My voice reaches beyond the stars into other dimensions unknown.

14
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,720
I ain't never had to shake no hands to get my point across.

15
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,480
But I digress. So I can digest.

16
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:30,640
We here at 694.2 PTBP are proud to present another Q&A for our next episode.

17
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,840
Episode 74 if you're keeping track.

18
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:41,840
However, this next one will be less focused on the players and more focused on the story and characters.

19
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,960
Wolf knows the expanse of the webs in place from contention to the city,

20
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,880
from the future to the past and all times in between.

21
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:58,880
Our dear cops are merely cogs wrapped up in something so, so, so much bigger than themselves.

22
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:06,400
Let's try to take a more objective look at what has unfolded here on 694.2 PTBP

23
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:11,920
as we head into the final few fables of this, the story of contention.

24
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:19,280
So head on over to the subreddit at reddit.com slash r slash pretending to be people

25
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,280
and find that Q&A thread to submit your questions.

26
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,560
Understanding the nature of this being a closed game,

27
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,240
we are going to shy away from secrets between players

28
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:35,680
and focus more on details that have been glossed over or just plain forgotten.

29
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,240
I'm not saying this puzzle doesn't currently have plenty of missing pieces,

30
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:46,160
just that some of them were forgotten under the table and dragged away by an inquisitive kitty.

31
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,120
Or time.

32
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,960
Or it's just thick fluffy clouds of that good good that are merely fogging some memories.

33
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:58,720
Either way, now's a good time to get loose, shake it out, maybe do some light stretching

34
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,560
because this next tune, it'll give you the Pringles Tingles.

35
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,480
You will pop.

36
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,400
You will not stop.

37
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:14,400
Stop me if you've heard this one before, but don't because it is kudzu with no back.

38
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:28,400
Boom.

39
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:47,040
Hi, Zach.

40
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,040
What's up, everybody?

41
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:49,520
What up?

42
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:49,840
Hello.

43
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,480
I'm in my home and I'm wearing sweatpants.

44
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:54,720
That's gross.

45
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,400
I'm in my home and I'm wearing jorts.

46
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,560
Ooh, I like that.

47
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,080
And half in for the majority of this ordeal.

48
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,480
Jorts has been the go-to.

49
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,320
Yeah, too hot for sweatpants.

50
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,040
I keep going back and forth between joggers and corduroy short shorts.

51
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,680
Ooh, short shorts.

52
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,560
Short shorts.

53
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,080
How short are these short shorts?

54
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,920
Five inch inseam, baby.

55
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,040
I don't know what that means, but it sounds tight.

56
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,240
It sounds uncomfortable.

57
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,000
It's really nice because you get a breeze.

58
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,560
Oh, under your dong.

59
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:33,680
Yeah.

60
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:34,800
Nice.

61
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,480
Yeah, dude.

62
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:39,440
Yeah.

63
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,160
This is weird breeze.

64
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,200
The recording over the...

65
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,520
I can see all of you.

66
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,240
Windy Wang.

67
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,800
I don't have to side-eye any of you anymore.

68
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,000
I can see you all in one place without really moving my eyes at all.

69
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,440
Stop moving your eyes.

70
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,720
I'm just doing it out of habit.

71
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:08,720
So today we are taking this experimental trip into remote recording to record a Q&A.

72
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,000
Luke just sent a chat to the group in Zoom.

73
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,560
It says,

74
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,720
My friends, I've missed you terribly over the past few weeks.

75
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,120
It's honestly, I can't read the rest of it because it's going to make me cry.

76
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:27,920
It doesn't say pee.

77
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,680
Just kidding, it's Luke.

78
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,160
It says pee.

79
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,000
I'm not eloquent enough to write anything more than that.

80
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,800
I knew what you meant.

81
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,920
Yeah, we all remember the vibe.

82
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,560
Hey, this is the wrong time to do it, but I'm going to grab a glass of water and a weed cookie.

83
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,120
All right, bye.

84
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,620
Bye.

85
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,760
And this is the Thomas List Q&A.

86
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,840
He just like doesn't come back for the rest of the time.

87
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,560
He never said he was coming back.

88
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,040
He just said he was going to go grab that stuff.

89
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,920
You know where he's going.

90
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,880
He's going to go sit on his porch.

91
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:09,760
And talk to his dog.

92
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:13,040
It's a nice porch to sit on upon.

93
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,440
What else?

94
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,480
Oh, I hope Murphy talks at least once or twice.

95
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,320
Oh, he might.

96
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,840
Thomas is set up in the kitchen.

97
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:29,040
I can see that because his life-size Ozzy Smith poster is right behind him.

98
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,000
The one that Zach has an intimate relations with.

99
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,520
Oh, look, Thomas is back.

100
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,360
Oh, my God.

101
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,400
Oh, God damn it, Luke.

102
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,880
Luke has the ability to screen share, which is nice.

103
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,600
Yeah, that's good.

104
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,400
I just typed in weed guy and that came up.

105
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,840
It's great.

106
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,960
His fingernails are bad and hurt me to look at.

107
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,120
He's pretty gross.

108
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,920
I'll stop sharing that.

109
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,160
Sorry.

110
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,160
Thanks, dude.

111
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:56,560
Thank you.

112
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,240
There's definitely won't be the last one though.

113
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,120
Yeah, I still miss you guys.

114
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,480
I do too.

115
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,520
Yeah, I get misty in my downs.

116
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,480
You guys have been watching.

117
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,680
You guys have been watching anything to pass the time.

118
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,400
All the things.

119
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,880
Obviously, Tiger King.

120
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,200
Yeah.

121
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,120
Dude, I just finished it.

122
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,880
I know everyone's talking about it.

123
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,800
It's so crazy.

124
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,600
Yeah, if you haven't watched it yet, you should watch it.

125
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,320
Boy, howdy.

126
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:35,840
It is so bizarre in a way that I was not even prepared for already knowing how bizarre it was.

127
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:41,840
Dude, I could not help but laugh out loud when they were showing the pizza that they made at the zoo.

128
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,160
Oh, no.

129
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,140
Yeah.

130
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,920
Imagine if you'd been there and you saw that and you had eaten one of those pizzas.

131
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,160
Right.

132
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,840
So I saw somebody on Facebook was posting about it and one of the comments was like,

133
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,240
dude, you know I got married there, right?

134
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:06,640
And then he posted a picture and said, Carol Baskins was our officiant.

135
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,160
And it was a picture of them getting married.

136
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:08,320
No way.

137
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,360
Carol Baskins with the flower crown marrying them.

138
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,880
Yeah, it was wild.

139
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:16,320
Oh, Chip, I really wish I'd been here for the start of this conversation because

140
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,720
I don't know about you guys personally,

141
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:25,520
but y'all are fucking wrong about Tiger King and Carol Baskins.

142
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,480
She's the only good one in the whole fucking documentary.

143
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,320
She killed her husband to save those tigers.

144
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,400
And the hero worship of Joe Exotic is really disturbing to me.

145
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,880
Wait, is there hero worship of him?

146
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,160
Oh, yeah, dude.

147
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,920
I agree that that's disturbing to me too.

148
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:42,960
He's a shithead.

149
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,240
He's a horrible person.

150
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,360
He's a terrible, terrible person.

151
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,320
Watching that fucking wedding scene, I was like,

152
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,840
dude, Danny McBride's whole career was just invalidated by

153
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,120
the most insane piece of nonfiction I've ever seen.

154
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,840
Are the wedding or the funeral?

155
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,360
Sorry, the funeral where he's seen.

156
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,040
He's talking about the kid's balls right in front of his mom,

157
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,760
who was just clearly on so much fucking meth.

158
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,200
Yeah.

159
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,600
Then the wedding immediately afterwards,

160
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,000
where she was one of two people he invited

161
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,080
just so he could post on social media that she was there two months after he died.

162
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:18,560
Oh, boy.

163
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,920
Yeah, fuck that guy.

164
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,800
I wonder how long until Carol Baskin is in jail.

165
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,200
I think she rubbed him down pretty good and that's sardine oil.

166
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,080
I think the evidence is gone.

167
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,320
Well, guys, we have a crazy amount of questions to get through.

168
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,080
I don't want to do any of these guys.

169
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,280
Let's talk about Tiger King.

170
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,360
This is a Tiger King spoiler cast now.

171
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:39,860
Exactly.

172
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,600
We're talking Tyg.

173
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,080
Let's do episode by episode.

174
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,280
Honestly, if you can have it spoiled for you by now,

175
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:51,440
that clearly means that you are not social distancing, you're not staying at home.

176
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:58,240
Do you like, you've done bad and you deserve to have it spoiled

177
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,680
if you haven't seen it at this point.

178
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:04,480
Our first question comes from crush36 over on the subreddit.

179
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,800
I think it's K. Ruse36.

180
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,760
It's crush.

181
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,280
K. Cruz.

182
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:10,720
It's Cruz.

183
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,080
Crux36 is the mod.

184
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,680
He's a dude who started listening a while ago.

185
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:23,120
He lives on the other side of the country and he is kicking ass modding the subreddit

186
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,880
as well as co-modding the discord for pretending to be people.

187
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,680
Very fun.

188
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:33,520
Someone changed his name to crush316 in the Google doc.

189
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:43,920
So crush asks, who would win in a round robin style and championship match thumb wrestling

190
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:49,280
game you do right after reading this question and then immediately commented, oh fuck, never

191
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,320
mind coronavirus.

192
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,440
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

193
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,440
Yeah, we can't do it live, but that's an easy one.

194
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,160
Obviously me.

195
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:56,880
Yeah.

196
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,400
I was going to say Thomas.

197
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:58,560
Yeah.

198
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,640
I've seen Thomas's thumbs and they frightened me.

199
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,560
I think I would give you guys a run for the money.

200
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,040
I've got tall thumbs and they're double jointed.

201
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,800
I can pop it.

202
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,200
I've got, I've got kind of short, but like stout boys.

203
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,600
I think, I think we'd be an interesting fight, Joe.

204
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,320
Yeah, for sure.

205
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,720
I think Thomas would play a little dirty though.

206
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,200
I would.

207
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,920
I'd, uh, throw some, oh, I was going to say throw some tickles in.

208
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,300
Okay.

209
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:29,440
The tenacity of Thomas would really pull through, uh, moving, moving right along.

210
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,280
We got that one answered pretty quickly.

211
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,080
Joe, give up.

212
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:39,600
Uh, so, uh, Jayhawk asks, let's say your character gets a do over.

213
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,640
What one thing would you change?

214
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,520
And then in parentheses row, you can answer twice.

215
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:49,520
If for some reason the player and the character would want to change different things.

216
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,520
Bonus points of the GM can give an idea.

217
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:54,080
The GM just say Zach, come on, man.

218
00:11:54,080 --> 00:12:01,200
Uh, if the GM can get an idea, if the Zach, uh, can give an idea of how things would be

219
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,000
different from that point forward, which I acknowledge could be difficult for the sake

220
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,600
of avoiding campaign spoilers or whatever.

221
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,560
That makes sense.

222
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,960
Let's start with, I've got an answer.

223
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:14,320
Um, I saw this question earlier today and I realized like I had no, I hadn't ever even

224
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:21,280
thought of that and I felt a little disappointed because people like go so in depth and do

225
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:25,440
their notes and shit and we just kind of play it once a week.

226
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:26,800
So I don't know.

227
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,240
I have no idea what I would change.

228
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,720
I'd have to really like what Thomas would change.

229
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,680
I don't think anything.

230
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,960
Cause that's kind of like antithetical to the, to play in the game.

231
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:40,720
But John Lee Pettymore, uh, would definitely just have fucking booked it with his $5 million

232
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,160
in Coke money and left town, left the state.

233
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,440
He'd be on a beach somewhere.

234
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,720
Like that's good.

235
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,120
Yeah.

236
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:49,600
Yeah.

237
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,520
That's, that's what he would have done differently.

238
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,440
How long would you have been on that beach though?

239
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,800
Before you realized maybe you weren't on a beach all along and you've been trapped.

240
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,200
I don't know.

241
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,280
He wouldn't fucking care.

242
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,880
How long have we been cops in contention?

243
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:12,000
Like four days, five days, December 1st to December 6th.

244
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,800
And then back again, who's up next?

245
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,920
I got one.

246
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,200
I have to talk about it cryptically because the other guys don't know about this.

247
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:24,240
But in this very last arc, I would have gone to a different place when I, when it was,

248
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,760
when it was brought up both Joe and Clark, I think, think that.

249
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,320
Oh, not this, not comp camp.

250
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:30,560
Sorry.

251
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:30,720
Yeah.

252
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,440
Not comp comfy.

253
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,840
The one, the one at the, uh, the university, there was an opportunity for Clark to maybe

254
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,440
go to city state university.

255
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:38,720
Yeah.

256
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,960
Go hit Luke.

257
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,600
His name's Luke.

258
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:42,720
No.

259
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,080
Does anyone remember their mascot?

260
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:52,320
Was the miners won it, or we, he was a flower to the mascot.

261
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,280
Oh, that was high school.

262
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,320
That was the contention.

263
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,440
High school is the miners.

264
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,280
Oh, was that, was it a poinsettias?

265
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:57,600
Yeah.

266
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,600
No, it was the, uh, the other ones, right?

267
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,200
It was the, uh, Edie guys.

268
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,080
Venus flytraps?

269
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:02,880
Venus flytraps?

270
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,600
Perhaps.

271
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,320
The Edie guys.

272
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:04,800
Doesn't matter.

273
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,320
Feed me Seymour.

274
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,240
I call my dick the Venus flytrap.

275
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:11,600
Wow.

276
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,200
Why?

277
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:19,360
Because it's Chris and Vanny and green for some reason.

278
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,640
Green and it eats flies.

279
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,280
I think if, if Keith was going to change anything, he would have really milked the

280
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:32,240
wheelchair aspect of it more, um, after he got shot in the foot.

281
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,600
Yeah.

282
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,520
Gone full Ray Gillette.

283
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:35,840
Yeah.

284
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,320
I would have, uh, I don't remember.

285
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:43,440
I think I got like a drone or something instead of a, like a military wheelchair.

286
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,720
I would have changed that.

287
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,280
The drone worked really well for me, man.

288
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,000
You should have got one.

289
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,120
I don't remember what my thing was, but yeah.

290
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:53,360
Yeah.

291
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,120
That didn't work out too well for you.

292
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:01,520
If anybody listening, uh, wants to send us all in quarantine drones and 3d

293
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:09,200
printers, that would, I would have a lot more fun if I could fuck around with both

294
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:09,760
those things.

295
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,600
I've followed subreddits for both of them for years.

296
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,200
Oh, wow.

297
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,040
Wait, how much do you know about dude?

298
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,720
Not as much as I know about 3d printers.

299
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,480
What would you print first?

300
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,760
That's my, well, you've got to, you've got to print benchy, which is the little,

301
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:32,000
uh, it's this little boat model, this adorable little boat that you print to

302
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,400
like, and it it's for troubleshooting like your initial setup and it's really

303
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:40,000
easy to tell based like it puts it through all the paces, does a bunch of

304
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,800
different things and you can tell really easily what needs to be fixed.

305
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:47,680
You do know a lot about 3d printing and people print giant benches and shit all

306
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:47,920
the time.

307
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,240
It's fun.

308
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,880
Here's a benchy that didn't get printed for the audio format.

309
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,160
No more screen sharing.

310
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,040
Boom.

311
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,000
There you can see some fucked up benches too.

312
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
So you can see some good benches here.

313
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,480
Yeah.

314
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,760
3d printing's dope.

315
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:05,040
What if your 3d printer has thalassophobia?

316
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:05,680
What is that?

317
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,400
The fear of like the ocean loss.

318
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,360
Anyway, thank you for what would you change about howling with Wolf?

319
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:16,480
Yeah.

320
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,080
Would Wolf the dog change anything?

321
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,240
I think he's perfect the way he is.

322
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,720
And I think he thinks he's perfect the way he is.

323
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,920
I agree.

324
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,160
Yeah.

325
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:26,400
Yeah.

326
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:26,880
I don't know.

327
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,440
There's there's not much to change about perfection, baby.

328
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:32,880
All right.

329
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,040
Yeah.

330
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,800
I'm going to say the opposite because if I could change anything about

331
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,800
would have canceled him after the first episode.

332
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:55,280
No, like as a GM, I constantly look at things and I'm like, Oh, I could have done that better.

333
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,960
But that's just like how you grow.

334
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:01,600
And like, as the person who actually like is the only one who knows what's going on.

335
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:09,600
Sometimes, you know, it's like a, it's, it's always like a thought in my mind of like,

336
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,480
Oh, I could have changed that.

337
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:16,000
Oh, I could have changed that to do the finish of like, what would change in the campaign

338
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,080
if you guys had done the things that you had changed.

339
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:23,440
Thomas, if you would have left with the money, I definitely would have had someone stop you,

340
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,320
obviously.

341
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:27,120
And perhaps imprison you likely.

342
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:27,600
Oh yeah.

343
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,320
I know that's not a, that's not like a real viable option.

344
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,440
That's just what Don Lee anymore would try to do.

345
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:33,680
Yeah.

346
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:40,000
And then they would have had to like, uh, you know, uh, come and capture or not capture.

347
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,440
What's the opposite of capturing someone?

348
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,040
What's Mario trying to do for save rescue.

349
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:46,560
Bounce.

350
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:55,760
So any of those things, uh, to you, uh, Joe, if you would have gone to a different location,

351
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,760
uh, then yes, a lot would have changed.

352
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,880
The last arc might not have happened the way it happened.

353
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:08,960
And, uh, I, I actually had completely other plans that I decided to change.

354
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:15,840
Uh, so that, that entire past arc in 26 years ago at calm, comfy campground,

355
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,520
was going to be something else.

356
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,680
So, um, because Joe went to a different place.

357
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,320
Yeah.

358
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:22,800
Wow.

359
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:32,720
Luke, uh, if you would have worked the wheelchair angle more, I would have made sure that

360
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,840
Contingent had ramps.

361
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,800
Contingent had ramps.

362
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,840
Is that what you said?

363
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,080
Yeah.

364
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,520
I would just would have made sure that Contingent was like, uh, compliant.

365
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:41,840
It is.

366
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,320
It does.

367
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,200
Disability friendly.

368
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:43,600
Oh yeah.

369
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,000
Of course.

370
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,880
Like all the businesses, they're super chill about that.

371
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:52,400
So, uh, Jayhawk Inc also asked what made you choose the specifics for this Delta green

372
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,840
game and went on to say, you're playing a group of police officers who are stumbling

373
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:00,720
into mythos rather than a group of seasoned agents on a sanctioned DG mission or a mix

374
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,600
of seasoned rookie agents or agents based on expertise agents in general, right?

375
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,440
So really there's a broad scale in how much Delta green lore and specifics you use and

376
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,040
how much you deviate and homebrew.

377
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:16,160
And I'm curious how we ended up in contention PD as opposed to anything else that could

378
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,280
have been, you know?

379
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:23,040
So why did we start as novices to the mythos, not seasoned professionals like you do in

380
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,640
a lot of Delta green scenarios?

381
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,280
Exactly.

382
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:31,440
And why are we playing in like a place we made up, I guess maybe in like a sandbox town

383
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,200
instead of like a mission, like where you are sent somewhere?

384
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:40,240
Well, I'll answer part of it cause I remember you, cause the character stuff obviously I

385
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:45,600
can't help with, but I remember you saying that the, the idea of the small town thing

386
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,640
was always like really appealing to you.

387
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:54,720
And we kind of all liked those stories being from the Midwest and having been to some very

388
00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:00,240
small towns in our lifetime where just like weird crap kind of happens all the time, but

389
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:05,600
taking it to like the super extreme and how would a small town react to like the supernatural

390
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,040
elements and stuff like is just, I think that's just fun.

391
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:09,440
Yeah.

392
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,440
And I've wanted to run a sandbox for a while, like right, right.

393
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,480
And run a sandbox.

394
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:20,800
So that definitely had some to do with it, but also we just like, I think we came together

395
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,000
with that idea, right?

396
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,320
Like it was already going to be a small town when we met for the session zero.

397
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,200
I think so.

398
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,640
And I don't know.

399
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,720
I personally think it's a lot more fun this way.

400
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,320
Yeah, I agree.

401
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,880
Delta green missions are great.

402
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,160
They're just not really how we've played campaigns in the past.

403
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:44,320
And we, so, Oh, that's something we can say that this is pretty much how we did two full

404
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:49,280
like year long campaigns just around our table and kind of a little bit sandboxy.

405
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,960
Not, we didn't have a whole made up town or anything, but sure.

406
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,280
Yeah.

407
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:59,440
It was basically just like, I would take pre-written adventures from either call of Cthulhu or

408
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,480
Delta green.

409
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:07,440
And then I would mess with them and then make little like connecting scenarios to play in

410
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:12,000
between to kind of make the overall thread of whatever story we were telling connect

411
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,560
to itself, spiderwebs and all that.

412
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:20,240
I also think having a stumble into mysteries is fun from an audience standpoint that they're

413
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:25,200
learning and freaking out about things along with us that you maybe not, you maybe wouldn't

414
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,600
get if our characters were so hardened that none of this was new to them.

415
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,120
It's kind of fun that we're freaking out with weird shit in character and out.

416
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:33,600
Agreed.

417
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:40,320
I also love introducing the lore of Delta green, like whatever bits I choose to use

418
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,840
from the actual Delta green.

419
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:48,080
And then the ones that I make up and add, I love like sneaking that in slowly to a story

420
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,560
of people who are relatively normal.

421
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,960
I mean, it's, it's also fun.

422
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:59,680
This is it's fun as a player because I personally have never done any research about Delta green

423
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:03,600
lore or it's fun to, I've read a bunch of Lovecraft.

424
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:10,320
So, you know, I'm obviously familiar with Lovecraftian themes, but I don't own a Delta

425
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,600
green handbook or anything.

426
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,280
Keep it that way.

427
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,640
Have we just been running the default scenario?

428
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,760
Welcome to conviction USA.

429
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,360
A small town like any other.

430
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,840
Everyone on the threads are like, we don't play that one.

431
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,040
It's not very well written.

432
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:39,120
I actually wanted to say one time I played a Delta green mission and because someone

433
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:44,480
was like, so up to date with a lot of the Delta green lore, some weird monster of some

434
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,520
kind was spawning somewhere and they were already like, Oh, I know what this thing is.

435
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:54,560
But it was weird that their character would like, their character shouldn't know that.

436
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:59,840
And so it became this weird thing of them being like, Oh, I have to like pretend I don't

437
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,480
know this.

438
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:00,880
I don't know.

439
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:05,280
It's kind of more interesting to use the rule set, but then kind of be able to insert your

440
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,120
own fiction within it.

441
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,200
And then that way there's not people who are like, Oh, I know what's coming.

442
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,400
Like, yeah.

443
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,600
And I guess it's, that's not really a problem if you're playing somebody who is supposed

444
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,240
to be a seasoned Delta green agent, right?

445
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:18,880
Yeah, totally.

446
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:23,200
But their, their character was like just a small town, like park ranger or something.

447
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:28,160
Which I just, I think it's way more fun to play normal people exposed to this than it

448
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:28,720
is to.

449
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,320
Yes, I think so too.

450
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:36,400
One of my favorite ways to play is as a Delta green agent who has gone on one mission before

451
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:44,400
and has like one experience, but that's the interesting thing about a seasoned quote unquote

452
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:50,640
Delta green agent means they've probably like been doing it for not that long and not been

453
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:56,320
on very mission, very many missions, because if they had, they're probably loosey goosey

454
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,400
or a deady wetty.

455
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:09,120
And so as this virus ravages our nation, a lot more people are going to wind up deady

456
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:09,520
wetty.

457
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:13,680
So let's try to be respectful.

458
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,600
We've got another question here from feared reindeer.

459
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:23,280
It says, if you each had to give one bit of advice to someone, what would it be?

460
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:24,960
Don't listen to me.

461
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,280
First off, I just want to say, yeah, none of us are in any position to give any advice.

462
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,080
I think I am.

463
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,800
No, just be patient with everyone you meet.

464
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:42,960
Try to be, if they don't, if they do things that seem irrational or not understandable

465
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,080
to you, just know they're probably coming from a really different place.

466
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,680
And yeah, just don't be a Dick.

467
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:56,800
Don't, I don't like people who get like angry, like my stepdad perception is reality.

468
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,300
Mark.

469
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,160
I have a good one.

470
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:06,320
If, if some, unless someone else wants to step up, if you're already talking, just like,

471
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,840
stop interrupting me.

472
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:15,200
My advice is so like I was saying, yeah, yeah.

473
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,240
That's what I'm saying.

474
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,760
Justin, this is a year.

475
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:19,920
He's mean.

476
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,240
Hey, do you see what's happened?

477
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,280
You know what?

478
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,440
It's worth it to break free of your oppressive.

479
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,520
My advice.

480
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:42,000
This is something I said in, in the discord is, uh, is nevermind.

481
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:42,480
I forgot.

482
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:48,880
It was a bitches get paid.

483
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,640
He realized that he probably shouldn't say it.

484
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:51,840
Yeah.

485
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,720
It's not cool.

486
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,440
Cause he doesn't.

487
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,040
Oh my God.

488
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,160
I'm a fucking idiot.

489
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,960
I was really ready for some shit.

490
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,520
Like I was ready to be enlightened.

491
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:05,920
Luke.

492
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,720
Do you have any advice for the listeners at home?

493
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,560
Find a therapist you like.

494
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,200
Yup.

495
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,000
It helps.

496
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:12,400
Nice.

497
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,360
Mine's Mark.

498
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,160
Shout out to Mark.

499
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,000
Oh, nice.

500
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,400
Thomas's stepdad is Luke's therapist.

501
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,840
Uh, I yelled marker earlier.

502
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:31,760
Uh, so my, what's your advice?

503
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,600
My advice.

504
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,240
Oh fuck.

505
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,360
Am I going to Justin it?

506
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,240
I remembered mine.

507
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,240
Perfect timing.

508
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,440
Do you want me to go?

509
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,160
Yes.

510
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:42,880
Okay.

511
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:47,200
So mine is a, it's kind of like a mindfulness based thing, which is, uh,

512
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:52,160
take control of what you can and what you can control, make plans of action,

513
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:57,680
begrudgingly accept what you can't control and move on and be kind like Thomas said.

514
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:58,640
Yeah.

515
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:03,520
Everyone like, just be kind to each other, no matter what the haps are.

516
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:07,360
Unless someone's being a real big piece of shit, then you can be a dick to them.

517
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:13,920
But like the average person, you don't know what's, you don't know what's going

518
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,640
on in their life.

519
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,320
Like we do know what's going on with Zach.

520
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,760
He's just mean and malicious.

521
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,260
Yeah.

522
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,360
We met his nice parents.

523
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,800
We know it's just genetic.

524
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,300
Yeah.

525
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,040
I mean, not, we know it's, yeah.

526
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,520
Like you got it from a grandpa or something.

527
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,360
They definitely nurtured you, right?

528
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,920
Oh, my grandpa's a dick.

529
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,320
Yeah.

530
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:34,720
Like you.

531
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,360
It's good to see you guys.

532
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:39,600
Yeah.

533
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,200
It's really good to hang out again.

534
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,000
But yeah, I want to amend my answer.

535
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,680
Don't be be patient with everyone except for Zach.

536
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,520
Oh man.

537
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:58,480
My advice is to, uh, to ask questions.

538
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,200
Good one.

539
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,400
Like, what did you touch?

540
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,680
What's that smell?

541
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,240
I like, uh, what's wrong with you?

542
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:11,360
When I was in high school, I think like, is your face stuck like that?

543
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:17,120
When I was in high school, my face was stuck in this really, like I thought

544
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,800
attractive position, but that's just because I looked in the mirror all the

545
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,600
time and they say, the more you see something, the more attractive you

546
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:30,560
think it is, uh, which I'm finding in marriage, but no, it's, uh, it's,

547
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:35,040
it's just a, like when someone like talks about a band and asks if you've

548
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:39,360
heard of them and you like have heard of them, but you haven't listened to

549
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:45,440
them, like, just ask, I don't know, like, don't act like you know everything.

550
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:45,680
Okay.

551
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,440
So that's, that's wrong.

552
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,720
That's wrong listeners.

553
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,760
You should, you should be like, oh yeah, I've heard of them.

554
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,800
I've heard of them.

555
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,080
I prefer their earlier stuff.

556
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,040
Just like ask people questions and learn more.

557
00:28:59,040 --> 00:28:59,440
Nice.

558
00:28:59,440 --> 00:28:59,920
I like that.

559
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,560
Good advice.

560
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,680
Or front like, you know,

561
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:06,480
shut up.

562
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,440
Front it till you crown it.

563
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:12,880
That was good.

564
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,440
I liked it.

565
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,160
Joe.

566
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:14,880
Hey Joe.

567
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,200
Yeah.

568
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:15,920
Hey Joe.

569
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,240
Hi.

570
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,960
Give us some really good advice and don't embarrass yourself.

571
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:19,840
Like Zach just did.

572
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:22,800
Fin for yourself.

573
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,800
You heard it here.

574
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:33,840
Fucking number one, numero uno, baby.

575
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,000
Figure it out for number one.

576
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,960
It's Joe Terry.

577
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:42,480
I absolutely adore this next question.

578
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:47,440
We got it on Twitter and it's from at crane song.

579
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:53,440
And it says, if contention had continued to be boring and normal and the boys had

580
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:58,800
just kept on their normal person trajectory, what would their future have looked like?

581
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,600
Would they marry, have kids retire early?

582
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:05,200
And then they also, they said, I humbly offer unto you this blep.

583
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,360
And they had a nice picture of the cat with a little blep and that was very nice.

584
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,240
Cute cat.

585
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:16,640
Clark would definitely still be at the station and he would be eternally waiting for Maggie

586
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:21,120
to vacate her position position so that he could take over.

587
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:25,680
But I foresee it being like a Prince Charles thing that he, she would be there forever

588
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:28,400
and he would grow old and probably never get his goal.

589
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,720
That sounds right.

590
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,680
That's so sad.

591
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:35,360
That might be sadder than what actually happens to Clark Bishop.

592
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,320
Oh no, he's definitely living his best life now.

593
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:46,960
I think also something Clark would be doing in five years is probably arresting John Lee

594
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:54,320
Pettymore for like either John Lee Pettymore would have devolved into like the same

595
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:59,920
criminality he got up to in the podcast or he would have really gone hard on the cop

596
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:03,840
thing, gotten into some pretty questionable Facebook groups.

597
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:04,960
Oh God.

598
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,440
Yeah.

599
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,960
It's not a, it's not a bright, uh, it doesn't look good.

600
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,920
Let's hope John Lee Pettymore stays the path.

601
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:16,720
You know those people who are like, who hate AOC, but also clearly are like obsessed with

602
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:16,960
her?

603
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,760
I don't go to that part of the internet or at least I try to stay away from it.

604
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,800
I go to the parts of the internet that make fun of that part of the internet.

605
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,080
There you go.

606
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:33,280
Do you think John Lee Pettymore would have like a bunch of kids with multiple women or

607
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:36,000
is he a little more like, I'm a one woman kind of guy, man?

608
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,680
I really don't know.

609
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:45,760
I think, I think he, uh, I met a guy once who was, um, extremely just like Missouri

610
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,360
in a lot of ways, this electrician.

611
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,160
And we were talking when I was like 23 and he was like, so you're not going to get like

612
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,160
married or have kids anytime soon.

613
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:58,240
And I was like, yeah, I never, uh, I never really wanted kids.

614
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,520
And he like stopped and he was like, Oh, huh.

615
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,800
I never even thought about not having kids.

616
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,600
I think John might've been a little bit like that.

617
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,080
He's just like, yeah, it's what you do, right?

618
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,880
Like, sure.

619
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,600
That's good.

620
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,720
What's Keith's story?

621
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,840
Keith, uh, works there for about a year.

622
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:20,960
Gets fired.

623
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:27,920
Um, can't, uh, hold down a job eventually becomes homeless until his brother finally

624
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,120
takes pity on him.

625
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,040
Um, lets him live at his house.

626
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:41,200
And then Keith becomes like a manager of some small part of the beans Corp and probably

627
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,720
kills his brother at some point.

628
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:50,560
Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if, if, if he like hired you as security or something

629
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:53,440
and then you accidentally shot him in the head.

630
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,880
I think that's like what happened to John F.

631
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:57,440
Kennedy.

632
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:58,820
Yeah.

633
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:04,480
There's a 30 rock bit where Tracy says he knows his dad is dead because he's a celebrity.

634
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:10,640
And if his dad wasn't dead, he'd be paying him 250,000 dollars a year to mow his lawn.

635
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,520
That's such a good job.

636
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:21,520
So yeah, Keith, Keith is, uh, probably better, better off with the shit going down now.

637
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,760
Drew Andrews, I think would eventually.

638
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:24,640
Okay.

639
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,160
First of all, no one asked Zach.

640
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,120
Oh man, did they not?

641
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,520
That's another question.

642
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,080
Tell us about Drew.

643
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:34,800
I'm just being a dick.

644
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,320
There's another Drew Andrews question.

645
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,520
No, you're right.

646
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,120
It didn't, it didn't ask.

647
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,240
Yeah, not now.

648
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,600
Wait your turns.

649
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,440
I'm sorry.

650
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,880
Guys, I feel so bad.

651
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,000
Say it like Drew.

652
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:56,480
Guys, I feel so, I mean, contention police office.

653
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,760
This is Drew speaking.

654
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,280
Oh, I love him.

655
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,640
Yes, that makes me miss that.

656
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,360
I love Drew.

657
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:02,480
He's dead.

658
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,360
We got another question here.

659
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,960
That dude, no one knows says, is there a PO box?

660
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,160
We can send you beer.

661
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,480
We'll be setting one up shortly.

662
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,240
Yeah, just because you said that.

663
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:19,840
Hey, shut the fuck up.

664
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,120
And we got another one.

665
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,720
When are you coming out with merch?

666
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,320
Cause I need that shit.

667
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,720
That is also very soon.

668
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:36,160
We've got some really cool shit lined up and I'm very excited for you all to see it.

669
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,680
Every size of cock ring.

670
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,480
The colostomy bags with, with the logo on them.

671
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,520
Pet caskets.

672
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:50,560
Dude, pet caskets is so good.

673
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:50,960
Yeah, I know.

674
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:55,600
That's why we're going to be shipping them out pretty soon to everybody's who's already

675
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,880
pre-ordered a pet casket.

676
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,040
Which is most of you.

677
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:03,920
Thank you so much for going to my best friend died.

678
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:04,800
What do I do now?

679
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,840
Dot com.

680
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,440
Thankfully we were able to get that.

681
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:12,560
Uh, so yeah, that'll be out soon.

682
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,520
I'm really excited about it.

683
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:19,680
What is your favorite system for quick one shot slash introducing people to RP?

684
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:24,320
I mean just right off the bat, Delta green, Delta green, and it's the best one.

685
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:28,080
And it's, I think the best way to introduce people to role playing.

686
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,680
It's super easy to play.

687
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,880
Super intriguing.

688
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,080
I fucking love it.

689
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:32,480
I agree.

690
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,040
A hundred percent.

691
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:36,960
And the one shots are just always a fucking blast and you can get them done in three or

692
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,640
four hours usually.

693
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,040
Yeah.

694
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:39,920
What about you, Justin?

695
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:44,160
Uh, don't do what I did, which is try and learn an entire new system you've never played

696
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:48,000
and then try and run brand new people through it while you're also learning it.

697
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,800
Cause I tried that with dungeon world and it became a mess.

698
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:55,760
Even though dungeon world seems super dope, having all new people with like a more complex

699
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:00,320
system than like others, like the dice rolling mechanic was really easy, but like all the

700
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:04,000
other character building and other stuff was what is dungeon world.

701
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,720
How's it different from like D and D you, uh, gosh, I haven't played it in so long,

702
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:13,440
but the crux of it is like most roles are accomplished with two D six if I remember

703
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:13,760
right.

704
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,720
And a third of them are you get to do what you want.

705
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:22,080
A third are you kind of succeed, but I get, but I get to take something from you.

706
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:25,680
And then the other third are like you fail, which I thought was really cool, but it can

707
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,640
be a little confusing.

708
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:30,960
I think Delta green is really good for most people to start on.

709
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,160
It's easy to wrap your head around.

710
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,200
It's just percentages.

711
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,560
So you kind of get an idea right off the bat, how good or bad at a thing you are.

712
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,240
So you can kind of role play that a little easier.

713
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,320
It's easier to build the characters too.

714
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,240
I feel like, Oh, absolutely.

715
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,080
I think Delta green's like awesome.

716
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,400
I'm about to probably run some friends through it.

717
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,880
And I was like, this seems like the way to go.

718
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,320
Yeah.

719
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:59,200
I also think that the mechanics of a game are always the part I care least about and

720
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,960
the mechanics get in the way as little as possible.

721
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:03,520
Exactly.

722
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,800
That's my thing too.

723
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,960
I want to tell a cool story with my buds, not play a tactics.

724
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:09,360
I'm sorry.

725
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,440
You want to tell a cool story with your butt?

726
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,640
Dude, you fucking got me.

727
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:17,840
Sorry.

728
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,240
I'm real.

729
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:18,720
I'm real.

730
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,680
COVID caddy.

731
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,080
I'm real.

732
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,640
I'm real quarantine caddy tonight.

733
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,840
Quarantine caddy.

734
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:32,080
Final question from that dude no one knows is will drew ever get his teeth fixed and

735
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,640
be as successful as his paramedic cousin?

736
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,320
Oh, yes and no.

737
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,480
He's just as successful in our hearts.

738
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:45,440
I mean, he is not good at what he does, but he's a good friend.

739
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,760
He was always there for me.

740
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,280
He was actually, yeah, he's fantastic.

741
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,360
I made $5 million with that motherfucker.

742
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,000
So he could get his tooth fixed.

743
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,280
That's not an issue.

744
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:02,160
Our next question is

745
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:06,240
is from room service nachos.

746
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,040
That's me.

747
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,160
That's like, that sounds familiar.

748
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,240
Yes.

749
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,440
What's in my pocket?

750
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,160
Oh, it's a ring.

751
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,160
I've read that book.

752
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,600
Yeah, it's pretty good.

753
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:26,720
Harry Potter number three, I think number three, Harry Potter number three, Harry Potter

754
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,440
and Luke.

755
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,400
What's in your pocket right now?

756
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:29,840
Let's see wallet.

757
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,560
I'm calling wallet.

758
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,560
Like just a bunch of condoms.

759
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:34,880
Fuck.

760
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:38,240
If we'd actually been playing, we could have super one.

761
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,360
That would have been really easy.

762
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,760
Yeah, that would have been my passport.

763
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,240
Are you all like ready to evacuate?

764
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,120
Just in case, baby.

765
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,320
Some people have go bags.

766
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,280
He has go pants.

767
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:57,200
And a salt rifle tweezers tweezers.

768
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,800
Now you take care of that unibrow.

769
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,680
I know I was picking nose hairs out of my nose.

770
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,680
Oh, you pull them.

771
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,640
Yeah, I don't have many.

772
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,920
So I just do it.

773
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,200
It's kind of fun to pull them.

774
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,120
If you're a pervert like me and Luca.

775
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,680
It makes me sneeze.

776
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:14,960
I know I like it though.

777
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:15,760
Oh, okay.

778
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,000
Yeah.

779
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,200
I can't come unless I sneeze.

780
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,240
Oh, there it is.

781
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,040
Dude, that.

782
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:23,280
Okay.

783
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:29,440
There was this dumb ass like book of facts that was given to me for Christmas one year.

784
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,640
This is in there too.

785
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:33,040
And it's holding up his driver's license.

786
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,160
Go ahead and screen cap that.

787
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:34,720
Put it on there.

788
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,440
Audio.

789
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,800
Audio medium.

790
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:41,760
So in this book of facts, it was like your brain can't tell the difference between

791
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,200
sneezing and an orgasm.

792
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,160
And it's like my brain can.

793
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,200
Obviously it can.

794
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:55,120
Obviously you're never like, oh, I've got to go change my pants when you sneeze.

795
00:39:55,120 --> 00:40:01,120
It was always like a rumor going around when we were kids that a sneeze was an eighth of

796
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,160
an orgasm.

797
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:02,400
Yeah.

798
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:08,240
And so if you sneeze twice, you'd be like, oh, a quarter of an orgasm.

799
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:09,920
Yeah.

800
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:14,720
And then if you got the elusive eight in a row sneeze, then you had to leave.

801
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,440
You completed.

802
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,080
Yeah.

803
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:16,720
That's different.

804
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,040
Like eight sneezes in a row sucks.

805
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:19,680
Oh God.

806
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,560
Can you imagine?

807
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:27,680
I think the closest thing you can get is like, you can get, I think like a third of an orgasm

808
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:30,000
is like taking a really long, satisfying piss.

809
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:30,960
Ooh.

810
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:31,520
Yeah.

811
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:34,240
Oh, after a movie or something, maybe a quarter.

812
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,200
What about just, all right.

813
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,480
You got another question here.

814
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:39,280
Yeah.

815
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,280
If you push your pants twice, you're halfway there.

816
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,320
I'm living on a prayer.

817
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:44,640
Okay.

818
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:50,000
Nothing for asks is Alan Grimes based on Walter Mathau.

819
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:57,280
So here's the thing I really fucked up because Alan Grimes was originally based on Walter

820
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,040
Cronkite and Walter Mathau.

821
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:06,400
But then like, as Thomas pointed out, definitely turned into, um, Nixon and Nixon and Mathau.

822
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:08,720
Yeah.

823
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:15,360
But that is why I kept calling him Walter, even though Luke's character's name was Walter

824
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:21,120
because I had set him up as a Walter in my head and then made his son or not son's name

825
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,080
Walter.

826
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:22,560
Yeah.

827
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,200
That was a silly, silly call on my end.

828
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,080
They got another question here.

829
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:28,960
I liked this one a lot.

830
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:34,240
Each person name and describe their favorite tourist attraction in or around Springfield,

831
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,240
Missouri difficulty level.

832
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:39,200
You may not give the same answer as someone else.

833
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,600
Ooh, I'm going to go for the obvious one then.

834
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,680
Cause I think it's legitimately awesome.

835
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:47,920
The new aquarium in town is legitimately world-class.

836
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,680
It's uh, it's the best pro guy.

837
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:51,520
Johnny Morris.

838
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,760
Wonders of wildlife aquarium.

839
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,640
Still haven't been.

840
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,520
I've been twice.

841
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,240
It's really cool.

842
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,360
Go to the aquarium.

843
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,280
Don't go to the other part.

844
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,280
Which is animal trophies.

845
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:04,480
Yeah.

846
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,360
It's like under the guise of conservation.

847
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:11,360
It's just like, look who all these like rich fucks have shot.

848
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:11,680
Yeah.

849
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:18,800
And literally the signs next to the giraffes or the elephants say this animal was taken

850
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:25,920
by and then the name and then sometimes there's pictures of like Johnny Morris is like shit

851
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:29,040
eating nephews, like next to dead rhinos and shit.

852
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,480
And it's like, what the fuck?

853
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:30,720
Yeah.

854
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,320
It's really, it's really creepy.

855
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,640
But the aquarium is great.

856
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,960
The aquarium is super duper dope.

857
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:43,040
You should go to a Casper's when you, I'll avoid the, the like obvious tour tourist traps,

858
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,960
but you should go to Casper's.

859
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:50,720
It's this cool old, uh, burger joint in a, uh, in an authentic old Quonset hut.

860
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:54,080
That's a cool part of like Springfield LGBT history.

861
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:56,800
And they have dope burgers.

862
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:00,320
Wait, I didn't know it was, uh, I didn't know it was an ally.

863
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:06,000
Uh, the guy who ran it forever, uh, from like the seventies until the early two thousands

864
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,360
or even a little later.

865
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,160
Oh, that's sick.

866
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:11,760
Me and my dad used to go there for lunch every week and get Frito pie.

867
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:12,080
Yeah.

868
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:14,000
The chili there was dope.

869
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,600
I do like how they serve the chili in the bowls where it's like totally overflowing.

870
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:18,160
Yes.

871
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:22,080
It's completely overflowing.

872
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:23,280
Like slopped in there.

873
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,600
I have one also food adjacent.

874
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:28,480
Try some cashew chicken when you come here.

875
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:28,880
Yeah.

876
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,240
Yeah, we invented it.

877
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,280
Motherfuckers.

878
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,000
It's really good.

879
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,880
If you just want some weird fried chicken breast or thigh or whatever battered and with

880
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:41,840
just like a salty soy sauce over it, it's decadent and delicious.

881
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:46,560
If you go to a Chinese place near your place and you ask for cashew chicken, you will not

882
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,000
get what we're talking about.

883
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,240
Hers is very specific to Springfield and it's, yeah, it's like fried chicken and gravy.

884
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:52,720
It's great.

885
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,320
It's a nap maker.

886
00:43:56,320 --> 00:44:01,120
But you can pretty much go to any good, cheap Chinese place in Springfield and get a pretty

887
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:02,880
good version of it, which is kind of fun.

888
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,320
For $4.50.

889
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:04,720
Yeah.

890
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:07,280
$4.50, a little side of rice and an egg roll.

891
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:11,360
But there's really good places too if you want to actually get a little more.

892
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:13,600
It's on the end that had the $4.50 forever.

893
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:14,160
Yeah.

894
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,120
What's your go-to Chinese place?

895
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:17,920
I drove by the other day and they're like $5, $5.50 now.

896
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:18,880
What the fuck?

897
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:19,360
I know.

898
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:19,840
Damn it.

899
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,520
What's your go-to Chinese in Springfield?

900
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:32,800
My favorite tourist attraction in and or around Springfield is not a Chinese food place, but

901
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:36,720
it is exotic animal paradise.

902
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:37,840
Oh yeah, dude.

903
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,360
Well, which hasn't been called that for years, right?

904
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:42,560
And is it even still open?

905
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:43,360
I don't think so.

906
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:44,880
Wait, is that the one where you drive through?

907
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,920
It is open and you do drive through it.

908
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:51,120
I think it's called Wild Animal Safari.

909
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:59,120
The reason that it's my favorite, besides the animal abuse, is on a real note, it is

910
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:01,920
probably some fucked up shit going on.

911
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:06,240
But when I was a kid, I went there a lot and I have a lot of really good memories with

912
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:12,240
my grandpa who passed away, who is the only grandparent who passed away when I was younger

913
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:17,120
and therefore holds a really nice memory in my heart because I didn't get to find out

914
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:18,320
that he was probably racist.

915
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:25,520
And so all my memories of him are pure and he would always bring leather gloves with

916
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:32,320
him so that he could unroll the window and pet the ostriches who would then peck at his

917
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:34,960
hands and grab onto his gloves.

918
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,080
And it was very fun.

919
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:41,680
One of my favorite memories growing up was driving through there and him rolling the

920
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:47,360
window all the way down and leaning the seat back in a buffalo put its entire head inside

921
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:52,800
the minivan and started licking the ceiling and my grandma was just like freaking out.

922
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:53,840
It was so funny.

923
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:55,840
That's dope.

924
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,120
Don't go there though if you come to Springfield.

925
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:03,040
It's not as, well actually I haven't been, I haven't even seen the place in like 15 years

926
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:06,480
so I can't, I don't know if the new owners are like Joe Exotic bad or not.

927
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,160
They do have two tigers.

928
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:12,400
Back in the day it was not like Joe Exotic's weird fucking zoo.

929
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,160
They were like roaming around.

930
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:19,040
There's also a real zoo where you can go and see the animals and they're well taken care of.

931
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:22,160
Yeah they have like a medical team that takes care of them all at the ad.

932
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,960
And the peacocks running around.

933
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,880
All right we've got, did anyone?

934
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:27,440
Hold on.

935
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,000
Hold on Luke.

936
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:28,800
Yeah we've got more.

937
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:32,400
Fantastic Caverns is pretty cool.

938
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:32,880
Oh hell yeah.

939
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:36,640
Silver Dollar City, not really Springfield but close enough.

940
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:37,920
It's so dope.

941
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,240
Food is great and you gotta ride the rides.

942
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:41,920
Are you a roller coaster guy?

943
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,920
You gotta ride the rides or they won't let you eat the food.

944
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:47,120
Yeah you have to throw, do the loops and throw.

945
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:50,000
It's always fun to throw up on the people behind you as a goof.

946
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:51,280
As a goof.

947
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:52,320
As a good goof.

948
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:53,040
I goofed you.

949
00:46:54,720 --> 00:47:00,320
We went there, Zach and I and our and our partners went there last year on acid and

950
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:04,960
had a really fun time watching the old-fashioned glass blowers.

951
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:07,920
That would be incredible.

952
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:10,880
I was melting alongside the glass.

953
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:11,600
It was really chill.

954
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:14,960
I still have a knife that I bought when I was a kid.

955
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:17,040
Like a pocket knife that was made there.

956
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,080
It's pretty cool.

957
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:25,600
We then took Thomas on a roller coaster that you sit in and it goes around like a like

958
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:30,960
a carnival ride does but then it also goes on a roller coaster track so you're going

959
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:35,040
spinning around while you're going upside down and doing corkscrews.

960
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:39,040
Right like the car you're in itself like just spins all around on its axis.

961
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:41,120
Which is my favorite.

962
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,720
Yeah everyone loved it but me.

963
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,920
I don't want to ride a roller coaster on acid again.

964
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,520
Yeah I think that's really fair.

965
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:54,800
It was scary.

966
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,480
Did everybody say their favorite stuff?

967
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:01,120
Oh we also have the world's biggest fork in Springfield.

968
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:02,320
Do we really?

969
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:04,800
Yeah it's over in Chesterfield village.

970
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:09,520
What was the restaurant?

971
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:13,600
I have to pee so I'm gonna ask I'm at my parents house I'm gonna ask them they probably

972
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:13,920
remember.

973
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:14,480
If you can pee.

974
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:18,960
Hey guys would be cool if I did this.

975
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:21,360
We're gonna we're gonna need to wrap this up because my parents said no.

976
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,080
We have to watch they have to watch me do it.

977
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:30,480
It's like my mom used to work in prison for a while so I'll be right back.

978
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:35,840
Luke has a huge urethra so it's easy to smuggle contraband in with.

979
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:39,120
It's more like splashing a bucket of water on the ground.

980
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:41,520
No one talk.

981
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:44,960
I'm also gonna go pee so I'll be right back.

982
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,800
Is this it's pee break time it sounds like.

983
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:47,520
Sounds like it.

984
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:48,880
I might as well take advantage.

985
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,000
I don't have to pee.

986
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,200
I don't have to pee either.

987
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,800
I'm just gonna stare down.

988
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:54,160
Hi Justin.

989
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:55,120
Hey.

990
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Hey it's just you and me.

991
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,920
It's just us now us two guys.

992
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:01,760
Two fancy boys.

993
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:03,280
Your beard looks incredible.

994
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:04,240
Thank you.

995
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:05,120
It's doing pretty well.

996
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:05,840
I'm loving it.

997
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:09,760
I went I went the opposite direction where I was like I need to change something about

998
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,920
my life and I have control over my hair.

999
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,280
It looks very sharp.

1000
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:17,760
Thank you.

1001
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:22,480
My mom was whenever I first shaved I'd like did like the more clean shaven thing and she

1002
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:26,880
was like she's like you look like you're 18 again and it's weirding me.

1003
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:32,000
It's like I'll take that as a compliment being a 30 year old boy.

1004
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:38,960
There's finally enough years on my face that I don't look like a total child when I shave

1005
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:43,840
but I do still have like weird baby face so it's like man baby.

1006
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:51,680
Have you been playing any dope games or anything or are you just watching a bunch of stuff or.

1007
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:55,440
I've been playing the fuck out of Total War Three Kingdoms.

1008
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:57,200
Oh I'm so jealous.

1009
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:58,080
It's super fun.

1010
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:01,440
My cousin actually bought it like gifted it for me.

1011
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:02,800
Oh wow that's awesome.

1012
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:03,680
Which was super nice.

1013
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:09,040
Yeah I just woke up and like got on my computer and was like your dope ass cousin has sent

1014
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:09,840
you a gift.

1015
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,120
Oh that's awesome.

1016
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:15,120
Because she bought her brother like the DLC for it the new DLC and she's like you guys

1017
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:18,560
should play multiplayer together which we haven't I've just we've both racked up like

1018
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:24,800
I can see his play count rising along with mine as we're just like at home alone.

1019
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:30,800
I've heard what game Total War Three Kingdoms the newest Total War game it's a lot of fun

1020
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:34,080
and the setting is really cool like ancient China.

1021
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:38,880
Yeah I love that whole setting I used to play all the Dynasty Warriors games just because

1022
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:44,160
I love that like the idea of that setting yeah and then realizing it was like actually

1023
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:48,800
a thing makes it even more interesting it makes me want to play the Total War stuff because

1024
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:53,760
I feel like they're a little more historical while still making the heroes more hero like

1025
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:56,560
but it's more a little grounded in a lot of other aspects.

1026
00:50:56,560 --> 00:51:02,080
So you can play it like two ways which is kind of interesting romance or records is

1027
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:02,560
what they call it.

1028
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:03,600
Oh interesting.

1029
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:09,440
So romance is based more on just like the novels the romance of the three kingdoms yeah

1030
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:15,120
yeah and or just novel but and so it's it's also kind of inspired by the the war hammer

1031
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:16,240
Total War games.

1032
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:21,040
Yes yeah which are fantastical abilities and stuff and and and that your generals are just

1033
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:27,040
like single units who have like superhero level powers yes yeah or you can play it more

1034
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:29,680
old school Total War which is what I do.

1035
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:33,840
Both those sound interesting to me for like different reasons but it's like yeah yeah

1036
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:38,720
that's that that one's on my list for sure once it goes like just enough on sale it's

1037
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:42,720
going to be one of those ones I just like instant buy and probably put like way too

1038
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:43,920
many hours into.

1039
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:50,960
So they asked another question Okay Nothing Four asked are you going to set a new Patreon

1040
00:51:50,960 --> 00:52:02,480
goal one million dollars you're the guy you tell us yeah I mean we will when we decide

1041
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:09,200
what we want it to be we'll probably come up with two or three ideas and let the patreons

1042
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:15,040
decide the patrons decide in a poll what the next goal will be so if your patron look out

1043
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:19,120
for that that'll be coming up shortly you will figure it out.

1044
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:25,360
They also asked for the players how much time do you each spend thinking about this campaign

1045
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:31,680
outside of recording sessions it just Thomas don't answer first it'll make it sound bad

1046
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:42,480
it just kind of depends on what you've told us to think about some specific things but

1047
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:49,680
I legitimately think about it a whole lot and sometimes I pull out my notebook and refresh

1048
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:57,920
myself on stuff okay sorry Thomas yeah yeah I mean you're right the answer the answer

1049
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:03,680
is not much I think about the act of I think about us spending time together and stuff

1050
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:09,600
like that but and like look forward to it yeah the act of physical love that we exactly

1051
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:13,600
that we engage in well that makes sense I'll think about like cool stuff we did or like

1052
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:21,360
things I might want to do or try to figure out but I am more with Thomas in this boat than uh

1053
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:27,200
Joe a lot of it is like it I it'll be cool to do this next week also this might suck for like the

1054
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:32,240
DM and like invested listeners to hear but I'm totally just here for the ride I'm have like

1055
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:36,240
it's really fun to experience the mystery like washing over you yeah if we think about it too

1056
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:43,760
much we might figure stuff out my animal yeah exactly how smart can how smart can Zach be

1057
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:51,520
if you actually go back and listen to it um pretty pretty fucking good at this man

1058
00:53:53,360 --> 00:54:01,520
we know we know I would say even I think about it a lot while like making music and shit like

1059
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:06,240
I think about like what moments could possibly come up or like what would have been cool for

1060
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:12,080
another moment and also wolf wolf the dog in it every week obviously I'm like always kind of

1061
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:16,880
caught up on what's going on and then being in the show even it was like it's so it's so many like

1062
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:21,600
weird different angles that I feel like I've approached it from which is kind of kind of fun

1063
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:25,600
if I haven't been thinking about it at some point within the week I will start thinking about it

1064
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:31,200
again you know yeah yeah because I leave oh hit me I was gonna say this next question can

1065
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:37,200
lead into whatever your answer is to both this and the next question oh oh bless you Joe that

1066
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:41,680
was such a good transition I fucked it up immediately by thinking about it uh we got

1067
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:50,720
Joe Tapa Joe Tapa Joe Tapa jot a paw anyway asks Zach what does your session slash campaign

1068
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:56,160
preparation look like everyone how much time do you spend playing PTBP are you playing any other

1069
00:54:56,160 --> 00:55:02,480
TT RPG real quick I'll just hit the what does my prep look like when I was first writing the

1070
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:10,480
campaign I would go to the public library so I didn't get distracted and I would sit down at a

1071
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:18,240
google doc and I would write out characters who lived in contention and then I like not at the

1072
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:24,240
very beginning like once I already had like the plots kind of slightly like the plot that happened

1073
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:30,880
before the podcast started essentially so I wrote all that out almost like a short story first and

1074
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:40,640
then I created NPCs out of that and then for week to week I do I actually like I write the campaign

1075
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:46,880
week to week now because I have no idea how their actions are gonna affect what we do next so I try

1076
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:54,720
not to plan too far in advance outside of like big moving pieces within the setting that's pretty

1077
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:59,840
much same here nice do you have any do you guys did that make sense to you guys no yeah yeah

1078
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:08,640
uh basically like if I if I have an idea of what their plan is or something I'll try to prep

1079
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:14,240
places people and motivation and that's it and then I've talked about bangs before on the other

1080
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:21,520
Q&A's yeah always having a few of those in back pocket is good so we've got are you guys playing

1081
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:28,000
any other RPGs I guess that question would have been maybe different before I'm still playing

1082
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:38,000
another delta green campaign I'm zooming it in tomorrow but he nobody else had ever played it

1083
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:41,920
and the guy running it is not me so I'm helping him out a little bit

1084
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:46,800
but it's fun it's called we're calling it the moldy worm campaign

1085
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:54,960
gross nice but yeah it's fun but it's no it's no PTBP wow way to downgrade your

1086
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:00,640
yeah that's rough shout out to I assume by everybody that listens to this

1087
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:04,560
so Tyler

1088
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:13,600
um I am actually haven't been playing any others but as I've vocalized a couple times here I've

1089
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:19,760
been wanting to to dip in a little bit with running some stuff and I think I'm going to try

1090
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:26,800
I didn't realize the core rule book of delta green and the one of the missions is free online it's

1091
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:31,760
called need to know and you can download it and it gives you all the information that you need to

1092
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:38,320
play your first game as well as a dope intro scenario exactly one we've ever done uh yes it's

1093
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:43,760
the one with Clyde Bauman I believe Joe is the only one who has not played it so I'm thinking

1094
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:48,320
of running some of my friends through that since uh we were kind of talking about doing it anyway

1095
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:53,920
and a great social distancing thing is a role playing online so I think that's going to be a

1096
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:59,280
big thing for me because I was like man I really would like to do this and it's fairly simple to

1097
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:03,360
set up stuff online especially delta green you don't need a board or anything

1098
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:07,200
to look at you just need your character sheets and your imaginations

1099
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:19,840
why I just think I'm the luckiest role player in the world because PTBP is my weekly game

1100
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:27,200
oh that's just so sweet of you Thomas why it is just so nice I appreciate the words that you say

1101
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:35,360
to me every time yeah I think I definitely got spoiled by this being my first uh roleplay group

1102
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:43,040
yeah like once we clicked and found each other uh especially reading horror stories on the internet

1103
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:49,120
and just like normal stories on the internet I was just like oh fuck we once we finally booted

1104
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:59,120
Alex really came together yeah happy birthday Alex oh no is it his birthday today it is I

1106
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:09,280
all text him right now I'll text him at the same time but how I'm I didn't get on Facebook how

1107

1109
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:28,640
I said happy birthday my sweet babe oh I'm texting him from an unknown number and saying I'm gonna

1110
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:40,080
find you I have a very particular set of skills you guys like my Irish accent yeah that's really

1111
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:49,600
good I have a daughter oh no I still remember it like an early comedy bang bang where Kevin

1112
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:54,080
Pollock came on he was showing off his bit of like one word impersonations he's like can you

1113
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:59,120
find one word that gets to the uh like absolute essence of the person you're trying to uh

1114
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:02,160
impersonate sure and for Liam Neeson it was banana

1115
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:10,480
oh that's really good he was like a little too proud of himself and he just kept saying it

1116
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:14,720
yeah well that'll happen fun I've been thinking about it for like five years

1117
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:22,720
worth it yeah hypothetically uh Joe Taba also I don't know how Joe Taba also asks

1118
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:29,760
uh hypothetically if a gorilla uses sign language and asks that you eat it does the

1119
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:35,440
gorilla's consent make the meat vegan or are you more worried that the gorilla might have

1120
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:42,320
poisoned itself and is trying to kill you I don't trust anybody who's into vore uh gorilla or not

1121
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:55,360
vore is the sexual fetish of being eaten I don't understand the issue I know you've asked me

1122
01:00:55,360 --> 01:01:01,680
several times so you know like you're like just a toe just nibble the toe I just want you to draw

1123
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:07,280
it all right so we already talked about the guy who made tacos out of his foot yeah we did yeah

1124
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:15,600
we did that well is dry uh we got another question here I didn't I I wouldn't eat it and it's not

1125
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:22,080
vegan yeah I don't know if I would eat gorilla um it seems fucked up how tasty is it that's that's

1126
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:30,240
a good question it'd be like eating a really strong man I know oh yeah it'd be sinewy the

1127
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:37,120
closest we can get is to like eat how tasty is it how tasty is the rock I think like a big fat

1128
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:42,000
gorilla would taste better yeah you gotta get some like you're gonna let's move on

1129
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:46,800
you gotta get some you gotta fat that gorilla

1130
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:56,080
feed you and feed you and feed you I want to eat a girl on a diet of like old meat from walmart

1131
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:02,240
that joke wasn't bad it was jane goodall

1132
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:09,200
oh my god yeah when they bust out the walmart truck

1133
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:20,800
oh my god it's so fucking sad all right uh we got uh damn guardian uh dom guardian on reddit asks

1134
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:27,440
how long do you usually play for like how long are sessions two to four hours depending on if we do

1135
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:38,720
one or two yep yeah hour and a half to yeah nailed it moving on j sake or j sake i i don't know uh

1136
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:46,800
so joe faved one of my tweets casting the pt bp tv series good stuff which led me to click on his

1137
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:53,680
twitter profile which leads me to the following question joe why the fuck does obama follow you

1138
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:59,760
on twitter oh and then we had a follow-up of j-hog inc said might as well ask why britney

1139
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:05,520
spears follows him while we're at it is that real that is real the verified accounts i checked it

1140
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:09,840
earlier today because i'd never seen that the verified accounts of both barack obama

1141
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:16,800
and britney spears were two early followers of joe's twitter account yeah so me and barry go way

1142
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:23,440
back uh i introduced him to michelle and brit brit has been a fan of mine forever back when we were

1143
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:27,760
in the tall dark and handsome she was a fan of our band uh great answer moving on wait how did

1144
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:33,520
that actually happen though the real answer is that obama follows i think anybody who follows

1145
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:38,560
him i i haven't checked but that's i think he's probably got a million follows also joe's just

1146
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:44,320
assumes that but really like barack has been for like a decade like well i won't fucking joe like

1147
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:50,960
i just want him to notice me i wish joe would dm me slide into my dms he's got 115 million followers

1148
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:58,960
but only 600 000 follow he's only following i'm in the top 600 000 baby yeah you're a great

1149
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:03,840
american that's pretty good uh this next question is from barry obama

1150
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:09,520
and it's just the complete uh lyrics to stan

1151
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:20,720
i was when i was in a like elementary school maybe middle school i was i had a huge huge

1152
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:24,320
huge crush on britney spears so maybe she sensed that through the net and was like

1153
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:30,400
i'll throw that kid a bone did you ever like retweet something of hers or no i mean i probably

1154
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:35,280
follow her that's probably where the accounts crossed paths but no i don't know why she's

1155
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:38,720
following me there's a really cool dude named joe terry who's friends with both of them

1156
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:46,640
it's his dad to be honest i don't want to meet the kind of person who's friends with both

1157
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:53,440
britney spears and barack obama they've been looking at him they've seen some

1158
01:04:54,080 --> 01:05:01,200
dog shit i don't know man those both seem like very uh kind-hearted celebrities to follow yeah

1159
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:07,120
britney's like leading the revolution now so i guess i should get on board uh we've got another

1160
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:12,320
question from jay saki he says now that dennis detwiller has released an entire absolutely

1161
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:18,480
amazing campaign around the king in yellow called impossible landscapes which starts this with the

1162
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:24,000
scenario night floors will you get ross paton to run y'all through the whole thing pretty please

1163
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:29,120
it's a wild fucking ride i think i should be the one that goes on there and none of you guys and

1164
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:36,800
i'm just really combative the entire time with yeah i think that's a good i'd like that i won't

1165
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:42,640
leave until it's finished but i make it as hard as the campaign yeah well frankly this town's not

1166
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:50,400
big enough for uh for both of our podcasts so uh rppr watch your back

1167
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:59,360
i would i would love to do that yeah that would be great i don't sounds fun yeah if ross has the

1168
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:05,200
time that would be a huge commitment yes it would it would be really fun and really nice i absolutely

1169
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:12,080
loved playing in uh night floors and to go back into that world would be a lot of fucking fun i

1170
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:17,760
think that's such a cool weird scenario uh yeah i would love to love to do more of it that would be

1171
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:25,520
super i would too super cool yeah i mean once we get the patreon up there's it's not out of the

1172
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:31,680
realm of possibility if we hit a goal that was high enough to run a second campaign on the patreon

1173
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:39,920
we also have to do get pins uh before we do that to give to him he was kind enough to give us all

1174
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:47,280
enamel pins the rppr logos super cool and we got another question it's from xylopia on reddit said

1182
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:42,800
and i'm like what the fuck luke ginsman valedictorian of ozark high school yeah if you google my

1202
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:09,360

1203
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:14,880
horror movie or the very first very great one that comes to mind my fluctuates all the time

1204
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:20,800
it follows is a great answer uh but i fell in love with the conjuring the very first conjuring

1205
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:24,800
and i still rank it up there as one of my favorite horror movies of all time i think it's

1206
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:30,160
really really well done the witch is up there for me too the witch is amazing which is awesome um i

1207
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:36,960
gotta say my favorite all time is alien oh hell yeah it's such a perfect movie and then uh my

1208
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:46,000
favorite recently is probably uh uncut gems i get a horror i consider it oh yeah man watch it again

1209
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:52,080
like the first reaction you get from the movie is exactly like a great horror movie i saw it

1210
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:58,080
three times and loved it i also before we went and saw it watched good time which is like good

1211
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:03,120
time is awesome even crazier i still haven't seen that one it's really good it's on netflix it's on

1212
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:09,600
my heart attack dude it's stressful he is our greatest working actor though i like honestly

1213
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:13,680
believe that about this better than michael shannon yeah i think he's got more wrench oh

1214
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:19,600
i can't wait for his batman did you see michael shannon play comedy in that christmas movie with

1215
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:26,880
joseph he's really good and seth rogan and anthony mackie no it is it's really delicious uh justin

1216
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:31,440
i saw that one together in theaters justin you got a favorite horror movie i don't i don't do a

1217
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:37,600
lot of horror movies even though i'm always super interested in them uh i have trouble with the the

1218
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:42,480
expectation of jump scares taking all the enjoyment out for me just like being like

1219
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:46,880
there's probably going to be a jump scare because this camera angle is this way and it's edited this

1220
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:51,440
way and then i just like yeah i have a lot of trouble actually getting to just sit there and

1221
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:58,880
like get myself into it i think uh but best like horror like adjacent thing the hannibal tv show is

1222
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:04,160
really fucked up and weird wonderful wonderful answer that's a really good answer that's so

1223
01:12:04,160 --> 01:12:10,320
good horror thing and it's really well done yeah it's like it's like is it horror it's like parts

1224
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:15,840
of it are horror and parts are like this there's a lot of drama and it's like it's so also

1225
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:23,680
soundtrack wise some of my favorite weird creepy soundtrack shit ever oh um actually uh i really

1226
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:29,840
liked enemy a lot and a lot of that was soundtrack that was good it follows was like one of those

1227
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:35,200
things though too where i i really liked it like thinking about it but watching it i just was like

1228
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:40,000
always waiting for a jump scare and because of that i feel like it's harder for me to actually

1229
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:45,600
just enjoy it for whatever reason if that makes any sense it's just like i'm waiting for that

1230
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:50,880
noise to fuck me up instead of like focusing on the horror of what's actually happening

1231
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:57,360
so dude i have so many horror movies in my mind i love that genre it's even the shitty ones are

1232
01:12:57,360 --> 01:13:03,840
great yeah luke showed me my favorite horror movie is my own mind man that's my favorite

1233
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:09,040
horror picture luke one night we were hanging out and he was like have you seen drag me to hell

1234
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:15,440
and i was like oh that one is really had a blast it was so fun uh it's like my favorite is the

1235
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:21,600
shining like i i don't think i've seen anything that rivals that experience for me because i saw

1236
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:29,040
a little too early and so it it's on like sixth or seventh grade and it it left a real mark

1237
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:37,120
the scariest movie i've ever seen is sixth sense when i was 10 oh holy shit every time i went to

1238
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:42,480
the bathroom at night same dude i was the other thing is i was like really into ghosts at the time

1239
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:47,360
and i never thought about them being scary and like wounded and then i was convinced i was just

1240
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:52,880
gonna see like a bloody fucking ghost like right i was like dude my mom is gonna be uh the bathroom

1241
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:57,680
is at the end of this long ass dark hallway and i would just like sit at my door there was like

1242
01:13:57,680 --> 01:14:04,400
a few months when i would just like weigh if i really needed to go when i was in the second

1243
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:10,480
grade i watched the ring and that terrified oh shit the ring is really fucking good yeah did

1244
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:17,520
you just say second grade second grade it came out in 2002 i was in the second grade oh my god

1245
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:22,400
you were probably in the third grade i was a super duper scaredy cat kid and horror movies

1246
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:29,040
freaked me the fuck out to like crying hysterics and we were trying to watch uh the faculty

1247
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:35,440
and john stewart in that movie gets all of his fingers cut off at one point and i ran screaming

1248
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:41,280
out of the room and i was kind of like huddled in a corner and my evil sister comes running in

1249
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:45,280
and going look my fingers are gone and she's holding down her fingers into her

1250
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:51,040
at like she she had to have been you know six years old maybe and she was fucking with me the

1251
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:58,480
older brother it was uh it was horrific that is exactly what i imagine your relationship with

1252
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:05,440
your sister is still like exactly i call her in to kill the spiders for me and she tortures me

1253
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:12,880
about it i got one more before we move on oh hit it okay the house of the devil or anything that

1254
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:19,760
ty west directs all i've heard those are really good he did one of the in that movie vhs he did

1255
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:27,680
one of those oh yeah yeah i would say recently mandy was like mandy's wonderful maybe not horror

1256
01:15:27,680 --> 01:15:33,680
like it's a thriller i guess technically oh it's pretty thrillers are definitely my like jam more

1257
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:38,320
than horror same that's if we're doing thrillers i can run there's too many like thrillers are

1258
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:44,000
definitely yeah the way it goes for me gotta say hereditary to hereditary i was just about to bring

1259
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:49,600
up because that is like if we want to talk about like horrific movies yeah that's the scene with

1260
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:55,600
the i'm gonna transition because i haven't seen that one yet just finally oh my god dude it's

1261
01:15:55,600 --> 01:16:04,480
gonna fuck you up it's so much let's move on to the next one marie x lupin marie x lupin asks

1262
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:10,480
everyone what is your favorite piece of lovecraftian media books movies comics etc

1263
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:15,920
or is playing tabletops your main slash only exposure to the genre thomas can you please

1264
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:20,880
start since you said that you read lovecraft earlier uh yeah in my early 20s uh i read

1265
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:26,000
uh a lot of the lovecraft stories i don't know if i really had a favorite because they're kind of at

1266
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:32,000
this point just like interesting historical artifacts yeah oh there's one that is not

1267
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:40,880
lovecraft but it's from like the 1890s or something uh the willows 1907 uh by algernon

1268
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:46,880
blackwood um it's just a really name it's just a really creepy story about like these two guys

1269
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:53,680
going down um the daniel river like on a canoe trip anyway it's it's just really it's it was

1270
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:59,680
really influential for like the the tone of a lot of the things we all enjoy so that's my that's my

1271
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:04,640
out of left field answer i don't remember if it really went anywhere i remember kind of being

1272
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:09,760
dissatisfied in the ending maybe but i i did enjoy the ride and it's just like it's got atmosphere

1273
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:17,520
out the fucking ass um and it's not uh racist like all of lovecraft stories so that helps my

1274
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:21,760
answer my answer actually so i haven't read a whole lot of lovecraft i think i've read maybe

1275
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:26,000
three or four of the short stories uh but one of my favorite pieces of media is called the the

1276
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:33,200
ballad of black tom and it's one of his stories it's the uh horror at red hook from the viewpoint

1277
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:39,360
of his black servant in that story whoa oh that's cool i've heard it's really really good it's a

1278
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:46,080
novella you can read it in a night it's really really well done i read really slow uh i've

1279
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:56,160
i've never read anything by hp lovecraft i haven't either uh i know that's kind of like uh

1280
01:17:57,200 --> 01:18:02,160
maybe fucked up but uh you should when we when we get off of here you should read like call it

1281
01:18:02,160 --> 01:18:08,800
gathulu because it's not that long and it's really cool for just the the world of like

1282
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:14,000
unnatural horrors that it introduces and you'd understand you'd have more context to say

1283
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:22,400
photography all the time which i do so probably my favorite lovecraftian media has got to be

1284
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:29,280
the yellow wallpaper which i just recently brought up during one of the integral scenes

1285
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:36,560
of the last episode of this last arc and what's cool uh for me like that story means a lot to me

1286
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:43,680
personally uh because i once went insane and was trapped inside a room that my husband had locked

1287
01:18:43,680 --> 01:18:50,480
me in because i was anxious uh no uh so like i was obsessed with that book ever since i or the

1288
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:56,560
since that short story ever since i read it for the first time when i was in sixth grade and then

1289
01:18:56,560 --> 01:19:06,320
i studied english in college the first time and i read it in two other classes actually and it

1290
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:14,000
brought it back for me and then uh turns out that the girl i was dating who then uh was also named

1291
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:23,600
taylor and is also my wife now uh she uh that is actually her favorite short story and so she

1292
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:29,520
teaches it in her english classes i think she finds a way to push it in there and so it's

1293
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:35,680
always on my mind anyway love that short story it's very creepy yeah i've never read lovecraft

1294
01:19:35,680 --> 01:19:41,680
but i've seen some like movies based on his stuff um when i was a kid i didn't realize it was

1295
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:49,680
lovecraft but i saw um from beyond it's like a 80s like kind of b movie uh but it was scary when

1296
01:19:49,680 --> 01:19:55,040
i was a kid and i remember it being good and then i recently watched color out of space with nick

1297
01:19:55,040 --> 01:20:01,360
cage oh hell yeah that was really fun i want to that's on my list of quarantine movies i'm gonna

1298
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:08,480
yeah it's i check out so i enjoyed it a lot um and then i recently played the uh call of cthulhu

1299
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:15,120
game on the switch which was fun but took me like five hours to beat so not really worth the price

1300
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:22,080
so one of my favorite lovecraft adjacent things which actually kind of got me more into it was

1301
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:27,440
like the weird true detective season one shit where they talk about carcosa and the yellow

1302
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:32,480
king and it's like kind of in the weird background and shit that actually was like one of the first

1303
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:36,800
times i was like oh what is all like what's the yellow king what's this what's carco like i don't

1304
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:42,400
i didn't really know anything before watching that and it added this weird like supernatural

1305
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:48,560
tinge to uh what is more kind of grounded in reality and all the cultists and stuff like so

1306
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:53,680
oh shit i'm gonna rewatch that yeah i've been thinking about it a lot lately for some reason

1307
01:20:53,680 --> 01:20:57,520
i don't know but that's mine i have actually we have a lot of time on our hands yeah

1308
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:03,520
but yeah that's mine i actually like i'm kind of like some of the other people i haven't read any

1309
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:07,600
lovecraft stuff i've actually been meaning to read the willows also that's on my list so when

1310
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:12,160
thomas brought that up i was like oh someone i know actually has read this i added a bunch

1311
01:21:12,160 --> 01:21:18,320
of horror books to my to read list so i'm excited to dive into some it's a it's a good one when i

1312
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:22,240
was i haven't done it in a few years but for a while i was really in the habit of reading like

1313
01:21:22,240 --> 01:21:27,280
our no sleep stories before bed and stuff interesting i've been doing that they're

1314
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:32,400
perfect for it because they're like they're short they're spooky and engaging the only problem is

1315
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:38,720
it's it just gets so hard to like find an actually good one for sure and i feel like the writer base

1316
01:21:38,720 --> 01:21:45,120
has gotten maybe younger yeah uh so there's just a lot of bad writing mistakes i literally last

1317
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:49,680
night i hadn't been to no sleep in a long time but i just went to top of the year and started

1318
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:54,080
reading that's always good yeah this is something i don't know if you guys have but like i said with

1319
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:59,760
like horror movies specifically it's like prepping for that jump scare is like too much for me

1320
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:04,800
sometimes for whatever reason i don't know if it's because i know video editing and camera work and

1321
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:08,880
other stuff and kind of like the technical details of how they're prepping to do certain

1322
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:12,400
things and horror stuff sometimes it's like oh they're probably going to do a jump scare and

1323
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:17,440
then i get like more psyched out instead of like just kind of like soaking in the the ambiance or

1324
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:23,280
whatever but reading horror does not have that effect on me at all and so i find myself when i

1325
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:29,600
read scary stories or like a comic book or other stuff i really enjoy that and so i think i'm going

1326
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:35,120
to start diving more because i love like the story of horror it's just the way so many horror

1327
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:40,880
movies are shot is so jump scare heavy or you're even if it's not jump scare heavy i've been like

1328
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:46,560
my mind is expecting it constantly so it like takes it it takes me out of it instead of like

1329
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:52,800
just getting to like wallow in the the weirdness or whatever i get really annoyed when non-horror

1330
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:59,360
movies have uh like set up shots over somebody's shoulder in a mirror or something yeah exactly

1331
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:04,400
i was watching walking dead recently uh because my parents watch it and i was just kind of like

1332
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:07,920
i was like i guess i'll hang out and watch it with you guys or whatever and it's like one of

1333
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:12,000
those things where it's like oh there's going to be a jump scare here and almost every time

1334
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:16,560
there is but it's still like it's because they always put like a stinger with audio and the other

1335
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:21,600
stuff it always gets me because it'd be the same as like if someone just yelled at you randomly

1336
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:27,120
out of nowhere in your everyday life you'd be like it's just like that sound and the way it's

1337
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:33,040
usually cut and edited it always like it always works on me like it's really hard to get a good

1338
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:38,000
one a good jump scare yeah i think they have their place for sure had my absolute favorite

1339
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:44,560
jump scare of all time it's so fucking well done yeah everyone talked about that jump scare and i

1340
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:48,560
didn't want to spoil it for myself but i haven't watched the series yet the whole series i loved

1341
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:53,680
but that jump scare was it's an all-time for me it's so well done is it more of a slow burn kind

1342
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:58,960
of horror thing or is it pretty jump scare heavy or uh both it's a slow burn because it's a series

1343
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:03,040
yeah they have to stretch out the horror for yeah episodes or whatever it was but there are some

1344
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:08,080
good jump scares in it but like i said they're well done like it's it's it's i think they're

1345
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:13,520
one of my favorite ones ever yeah it's so well done it made my soul fly out of my body in such

1346
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:20,640
a great way it took me four episodes before i was like oh yeah that's the other thing it's it does

1347
01:24:20,640 --> 01:24:24,800
take a few episodes i agree and but then it became one of my favorite it's like a really

1348
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:30,880
good it's like a really good family drama that's also a horror thing like it's not just scary it's

1349
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:38,000
like actually like a well-acted there's also one episode that's all one take and it's really well

1350
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:44,480
done yeah they did a good job on that yeah that's on my list how long is that shot well so i mean

1351
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:48,960
it's there's trickery involved but it's the episode i mean they don't cut for the whole

1352
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:55,600
oh that's right that's right but there is one sequence that is like 12 minutes long wow where

1353
01:24:55,600 --> 01:25:00,240
they actually like don't have yeah like oh yeah you're right you're right uh i read that on the

1354
01:25:00,240 --> 01:25:05,600
mdb trivia that like that one of their longest not actually it's super long cuts yeah it's

1355
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:10,080
super duper long they they did a whole thing where because that the whole show takes place

1356
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:16,560
between two time periods and they they did a camera transition between sets to do the time

1357
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:21,600
change there's a whole behind the scenes of that episode that's so so freaking cool well and that

1358
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:27,920
leads us into to another question about whether or not clark bishop's character uh is based on

1359
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:35,120
jonas convolt from dark oh yeah i i would never say sure but i've never seen it i know i i didn't

1360
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:40,320
think uh either of you had um it's actually it's pretty good it would be a good quarantine watch

1361
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:44,720
i've heard nothing but good things about that show but the first time that i put it on i was

1362
01:25:44,720 --> 01:25:53,120
too high to read it is it is all subtitles um i heard it described as grown-up stranger things

1363
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:57,120
that's a pretty good way to put it actually what about grown-ups too and stranger things

1364
01:25:57,120 --> 01:26:04,320
that would be great it is it is like so there's this time travel thing going on in this town and

1365
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:10,000
no spoilers they i'm i won't spoil it but they set it up so it's a certain amount of years between

1366
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:16,240
like time-traveling windows and they just like very like carefully do it so it avoids all of

1367
01:26:16,240 --> 01:26:22,880
the unpleasantness that happened in germany during some certain years which is a good call

1368
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:30,960
but it's a little like interesting no nazis in this store no nazis only before and after

1369
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:37,360
millennium hand is who asked that question by the way millennium hand german is like a really uh

1370
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:41,440
funny language to to read the subtitles of and then like hear it

1371
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:45,360
because the subtitles will be like are you all right and they're like das ist in ordinung

1372
01:26:52,240 --> 01:26:56,000
uh yeah no i will watch that i'm excited to watch it and then i'll steal all the

1373
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:00,800
ideas to finish up clark's ark all right it's good i think taylor would really like it too

1374
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:08,400
probably uh she's also very into this exact kind of tv we actually watched uh haunted

1375
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:15,200
hill house haunting the heil house uh twice didn't mean to say heil so uh

1376
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:21,760
we got a question from the quiet shouter oh my god thomas has pulled down his shirt

1377
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:30,000
so deeply to reveal all of his chest hair and both of his nipples which he is rubbing vigorously

1378
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:36,000
well the podcast got us these nice webcams and i've got to make a little extra money somehow so

1379
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:41,200
i honestly have been thinking about like would i get kicked off uh

1380
01:27:41,200 --> 01:27:45,280
like a porn campsite if i just went on like with my two kittens

1381
01:27:46,480 --> 01:27:52,800
oh hey guys look at me not if your dick's out there you go probably even just like one ball

1382
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:58,720
would be fine one ball in it that's like what i'm into just some real lance armstrong hitler shit

1383
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:06,080
don't take it out of context but they both have one testicle all right so uh all right

1384
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:13,840
god well you guys didn't get that from just like the thing i said well i just i don't know you

1385
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:20,560
said heil earlier and i got all confused yeah it was like i'm really sorry zach becoming a nazi

1386
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:28,640
i don't think so uh so quarantine does strange things to us all not that thankfully we've got

1387
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:36,640
a question now is all right uh the fun jojo rabbit nazis dude that movie was incredible

1388
01:28:37,680 --> 01:28:43,120
we got a question from the quiet shouter who asks what is each character's favorite musical

1389
01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:50,000
drew's is the producers mine is nice wicked i don't know about keith but john lee pettymore's

1390
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:55,760
is uh guys and dolls because it was the one he was in in high school yep clark's is wizard of

1391
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:59,920
us he likes the idea of getting the courage and the brains and the heart

1392
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:10,320
wolf the dogs would be phantom of the opera because he likes how that guy lurks around

1393
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:17,840
in the theater all the time oh my god that's perfect a personal personal yeah he's like he's

1394
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:25,280
like this show needs a name there luke what about keith vigna do you think he's ever seen a musical

1395
01:29:25,280 --> 01:29:30,080
probably not i mean he's seen the wizard of oz so he would probably just hop on and say that

1396
01:29:31,680 --> 01:29:38,480
i don't know how would keith vigna pronounce lay miserab he would he wouldn't try

1397
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:46,720
less miserables exactly we've got another question from quiet shatter asks what book

1398
01:29:46,720 --> 01:29:53,040
recommendations do y'all have for the fine folks in the contention book club uh right now i'm

1399
01:29:53,040 --> 01:29:59,120
reading the plague by kamu because it seemed thematically appropriate and it's good i think

1400
01:29:59,120 --> 01:30:05,680
i'm an anarcho-syndicalist now so not really so that's nice um i've been reading a book called

1401
01:30:05,680 --> 01:30:13,920
why buddhism is true by a behavioral psychology anthropologist that's really cool as i am on my

1402
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:20,000
mindfulness bullshit basically talking about how like the teachings of buddhism are like actually

1403
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:25,920
still ringing true in modern psychology and how they apply to humans as we have evolved from

1404
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:30,800
living in villages and stuff but we still like freak out over the same things that we've always

1405
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:37,840
freaked out over because our brains aren't that much evolved from those past times it is a very

1406
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:42,400
cool book and he's very funny that's he's very funny otherwise it would not be fun to read

1407
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:48,480
i would recommend house of leaves i always loved that and any fan of this podcast would probably

1408
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:54,720
find something to like in it uh and then also the next question is from uh the modest light

1409
01:30:54,720 --> 01:31:01,200
who brings up uh john dies at the end which is uh i love that book too and a fan of this podcast

1410
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:06,640
would also find a lot to enjoy in there if you've found that um you don't read as much as you once

1411
01:31:06,640 --> 01:31:11,920
did or would like to because of the internet or just the world or whatever i just read uh

1412
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:16,960
kitchen confidential by anthony bordain and it's you know it's a book i'd always heard about

1413
01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:21,920
uh but it was really entertaining it's a really quick read and it like really helped put that

1414
01:31:21,920 --> 01:31:26,240
reading habit back into my life and it became a lot easier after like having a book that i

1415
01:31:26,240 --> 01:31:30,240
could just that was like a page turner that i could just scorch through to like make time to

1416
01:31:30,240 --> 01:31:38,000
read each day now that's awesome so so did living in quarantine uh real quick to give a suggestion

1417
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:44,240
for a book uh for the contention book club would just be uh Dianetics the modern science of

1418
01:31:47,200 --> 01:32:01,920
it oh no and all your people here you're tremendous except the people in the left

1419
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:09,440
when you're smoking on a big ass i think i'll probably read john dies at the end because

1420
01:32:09,440 --> 01:32:16,000
i've seen the movie like five times over the past many years and like the movie it's

1421
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:22,160
did you like it are you so you've seen it many times because you like it yeah so i it it's the

1422
01:32:22,160 --> 01:32:28,480
weirdest thing that that movie starts out so perfectly stuck to the book like the first act

1423
01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:33,760
is is verbatim from the book and then it goes really wild at the end i wonder if they ran out

1424
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:38,880
of budget or something it it really screws with the story and it leaves out a huge chunk that's

1425
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:45,120
like a whole like arc in the book it's it's really wild how crazy that movie went i'm really glad

1426
01:32:45,200 --> 01:32:52,480
that i didn't read it first then yeah because like it was fun i have not seen the movie or read the

1427
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:59,440
book but i should so far in quarantine i went back and read uh cat's cradle again i anything

1428
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:06,720
Vonnegut is always good yes read breakfast of champions and then i read uh the time machine by

1429
01:33:06,720 --> 01:33:13,920
hg wells it's really short and fun and then i've been reading a lot of Cormac McCarthy books so i

1430
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:20,560
read uh shit i forgot the name of one of them uh child of god was interesting it's pretty short too

1431
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:27,440
uh and i'm reading blood meridian right now and it's very violent and it's still cool i really

1432
01:33:27,440 --> 01:33:33,040
like uh douglas adams i think that's probably i haven't read john dies at the end but i'm guessing

1433
01:33:33,040 --> 01:33:38,560
that my favorite book by him uh which is dirk gently's holistic detective agency

1434
01:33:39,120 --> 01:33:46,160
probably has a super super fun yeah probably has a similar vibe i don't know also that was a

1435
01:33:46,160 --> 01:33:52,000
crazy tv series uh i don't know if you guys saw my list it's on hulu right now what is it

1436
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:59,040
two seasons of very fun television with elijah wood if i'm not mistaken it is elijah wood indeed

1437
01:33:59,040 --> 01:34:07,840
uh really fucking silly and very very fun anon a no-no asks okay i've got a real scandalous one

1438
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:15,920
kiss marry kill past present future i love kiss give a little yeah kisses give a little smooch

1439
01:34:15,920 --> 01:34:24,080
brother yeah you gotta you gotta kill your past gotta kill your past kill the past kiss the

1440
01:34:24,080 --> 01:34:29,120
present marry the future boom yeah that's mine for sure no i think you gotta kiss the future

1441
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:33,920
you gotta marry the present you gotta marry the present you gotta be grounded in that present

1442
01:34:33,920 --> 01:34:38,880
baby but but without without completely killing the possibility of the future you want to give

1443
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:45,040
it a smooch you have to look forward to it with a gentle smooch but yeah sometimes a kiss can lead

1444
01:34:45,040 --> 01:34:54,880
to the future but uh right now my present is uh is coronavirus lockdown so i would kill it

1445
01:34:54,880 --> 01:34:59,120
i would kill it to do anything to the future

1446
01:35:01,840 --> 01:35:07,600
whatever you want future i'll do whatever you need baby whatever yeah to ride this wave uh

1447
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:13,680
i've got some great news uh i mentioned last week's uh on last week's episode that my dad

1448
01:35:13,680 --> 01:35:19,920
uh went in and got tested for covid and his test came back negative

1449
01:35:20,880 --> 01:35:23,760
yeah

1450
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:30,880
two days later his fever broke and he's feeling no symptoms and my mom has not gotten sick or gotten

1451
01:35:30,880 --> 01:35:37,840
any symptoms but they're both still doing a full 14-day quarantine to make sure and i am proud of

1452
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:43,520
them both and super happy that they don't hopefully have it because it could be a false negative but

1453
01:35:43,520 --> 01:35:48,560
hopefully not yeah so it's wild how much the symptoms mirrored it and then to yeah be negative

1454
01:35:49,200 --> 01:35:55,280
that's awesome dude it's also wild some of the like false the like the tests are kind of bad

1455
01:35:55,280 --> 01:35:59,840
especially depending on where they came from like some of them fail up to like 30% of the time

1456
01:35:59,840 --> 01:36:01,920
so yeah but your mom's fine probably

1457
01:36:05,680 --> 01:36:10,480
zach oh he was frozen i see i thought he was oh yeah i did too

1458
01:36:13,120 --> 01:36:15,120
did someone say something mean about my dad

1459
01:36:15,120 --> 01:36:23,520
nobody said anything about but the truth about your about your shitty fucking dad

1460
01:36:25,120 --> 01:36:28,160
denny denny is amazing maybe one of the best people

1461
01:36:30,080 --> 01:36:37,600
to have ever existed he's a good one uh hey question joe yo do do we need to wrap this

1462
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:43,920
thing up oh no i can keep going okay i assume everyone else is on a uh similar sleep schedule

1463
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:52,320
to me so let's keep pushing yes yeah yeah okay sorry not asking a question no sorry

1464
01:36:52,320 --> 01:36:59,040
when my statements are supposed to be questions um just so forceful we got a question from

1465
01:36:59,040 --> 01:37:06,480
at snuggles mcsquigg nice does each cast member have a favorite character they'd

1466
01:37:06,480 --> 01:37:10,960
created for a past campaign they wish they could bring into a new one oh yeah

1467
01:37:10,960 --> 01:37:18,560
yeah yeah for sure doctor dr denny denison i really hope makes an appearance at some point

1468
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:25,120
dr denny denison was great that was a character he was a cult surgeon yeah he was a doctor surgeon

1469
01:37:25,120 --> 01:37:32,320
for a cult uh i think i got kicked out of it you did get kicked out of it uh i don't remember how

1470
01:37:32,320 --> 01:37:38,720
he was just nasty and gross he was always trying to collect bodies yeah he developed a poop fetish

1471
01:37:39,440 --> 01:37:46,160
at one point he sounds like a joy that was fun that one so yeah luke literally when i gave him

1472
01:37:46,160 --> 01:37:52,560
that fetish uh just ran with it he stood up and he said okay i'm gonna play this out i'll be right

1473
01:37:52,560 --> 01:37:58,320
back and he walked out of the room and we all sat there and then he walked back in and he set up a

1474
01:37:58,320 --> 01:38:05,200
chair as the toilet which is like he got this fetish from like finding a clue inside a toilet

1475
01:38:05,200 --> 01:38:13,040
that was filled with shit he found it in a turd right yeah and then like as he found it like a

1476
01:38:13,040 --> 01:38:21,440
bunch of the brood worm yeah like yeah like came out of the the the fecal matter as well and so

1477
01:38:22,720 --> 01:38:28,640
he acted out like charade style him with this chair as the toilet and then him acting out the

1478
01:38:28,640 --> 01:38:34,480
entire scene of pulling out and all the facial expressions to come with it and that's when i knew

1479
01:38:35,200 --> 01:38:43,600
that i was in a very good fun role-playing group yeah so that's that's mine miss him forever i

1480
01:38:43,600 --> 01:38:49,280
have three actually from like three really different i'm fucking sorry joe but if you

1481
01:38:49,280 --> 01:38:54,800
can show the fuck yes joe some of us take role-playing seriously and i know you don't

1482
01:38:57,200 --> 01:39:03,600
i've looked at joe's notes and it's just he just writes penis over and over again with diagrams

1483
01:39:04,400 --> 01:39:09,200
that's true you're really good at drawing all my plots just spent all his time role-playing

1484
01:39:09,200 --> 01:39:15,600
just trying to imagine what each character's penis looks like that's my style baby that's

1485
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:23,120
the most excited thing like he's not listening to anything zach says except except for how it

1486
01:39:23,120 --> 01:39:29,280
might inform what like the dude's fucking junk looks like it's like describe this squamous tube

1487
01:39:29,360 --> 01:39:35,840
monster how confident is how confident is this guy what's his walk look like

1488
01:39:37,680 --> 01:39:41,920
i can tell you very confidently confidence has nothing to do with size

1489
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:55,120
um no uh we talked about the scion campaign before i uh really loved my guy who uh killed

1490
01:39:55,120 --> 01:40:02,480
saddam hussein and he was a curt he was a curtish rebel he was really fun to play as because he had

1491
01:40:02,480 --> 01:40:07,520
a bunch of like weird skills and was like kind of a weird character to be with all those other

1492
01:40:07,520 --> 01:40:14,560
i mean in scion everyone's kind of but he had a lot of guns and knives and swords yeah which

1493
01:40:14,560 --> 01:40:21,920
was fun in a weird like magical god thing to be like yeah i have a fucking gun though and then uh

1494
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:28,320
from the patreon episode i really loved my guy who had the little tiny teleporting cat

1495
01:40:28,320 --> 01:40:34,560
in his pocket yeah agent wolf i actually really liked him and uh more i just liked that he had

1496
01:40:34,560 --> 01:40:40,480
a little teleporting cat that lived in his like dress shirt pocket and then in one of my dnd

1497
01:40:40,480 --> 01:40:46,560
campaigns where i first got introduced to role-playing i had a weird minotaur blacksmith

1498
01:40:46,560 --> 01:40:52,880
character who had a big hammer and one of my other friends was a dragon person or whatever

1499
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:58,240
i don't there's they're called dragon born is it okay he was a dragonborn or wait is that

1500
01:40:59,360 --> 01:41:06,880
no it might be i think it's dragonborn it's both right yeah yeah um but he uh our dm let us do a

1501
01:41:06,880 --> 01:41:12,400
combo attack where he would heat up my hammer as though i was gonna do some sick ass blacksmith

1502
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:18,240
shit with it and then like bash people away and he also had a bunch of grappling moves so he's

1503
01:41:18,240 --> 01:41:23,440
just like hitting people with this huge hammer that's almost like melted while like suplexing

1504
01:41:24,160 --> 01:41:30,400
other dnt characters so that's really fun he was very fun character that you had on the same

1505
01:41:30,400 --> 01:41:36,720
patreon episode as agent wolf yeah it's one of my favorite characters that we've had on the show

1506
01:41:36,720 --> 01:41:44,000
oh thank you i liked him too he was uh he was uh he was psycho he was unfeeling

1507
01:41:45,760 --> 01:41:49,840
clark is definitely my favorite character i've ever played but i also really liked

1508
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:53,360
the first time i ever played with you guys i had a character named stacy bloom

1509
01:41:54,240 --> 01:42:00,480
and he was a wide-eyed new kid on in law enforcement let alone delta green so i it was i

1510
01:42:00,480 --> 01:42:06,400
was able to play my own real reactions to feeling you guys out about how to play this

1511
01:42:06,400 --> 01:42:11,920
new game i've never played before i could do it through the guys of this wide-eyed new character

1512
01:42:11,920 --> 01:42:19,840
and to give uh listeners an idea of what stacy bloom walked into uh he joined right after the

1513
01:42:19,840 --> 01:42:26,000
other players had just run through last things last into the shotgun scenario metamorphosis

1514
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:31,600
so uh last things last is the one we were talking about earlier and then metamorphosis

1515
01:42:31,600 --> 01:42:38,480
is a shotgun scenario for delta green and those two pair very very well and then joe came in and

1516
01:42:38,480 --> 01:42:45,520
they were all explaining what happened uh in the last session and his eyes were fucking massive

1517
01:42:47,440 --> 01:42:52,480
it was quite the world to be thrown into you yeah thomas thomas i would i would agree with

1518
01:42:52,480 --> 01:42:56,400
joe that john lee pettymore is probably the favorite my favorite character i've ever played

1519
01:42:56,400 --> 01:43:06,000
um but uh that same scion game justin was talking about uh i played a david bowie inspired superhero

1520
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:14,080
named aladdin sane uh who was like a legitimate pop star and uh in the world so i got to like make

1521
01:43:14,080 --> 01:43:20,320
up dumb little songs and stuff can you give us a taste it was so fun yeah the one we all the the

1522
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:26,960
one people seem to remember the best one it was yeah we were playing this game at christmas time

1523
01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:31,600
so i was talking about like the profits from my from my numerous christmas albums and i brought

1524
01:43:31,600 --> 01:43:37,360
up the song christmas time in london town they're like well how does that go and it goes it's

1525
01:43:37,360 --> 01:43:46,800
christmas time in london town the skies are gray and the streets are brown the streets are brown

1526
01:43:46,880 --> 01:43:49,360
the streets are brown we all just kind of looked at it

1527
01:43:53,680 --> 01:43:59,280
that was a really fun campaign and then my very first dnd character was uh an era kokra which is

1528
01:43:59,280 --> 01:44:08,400
a bird person oh yeah i named myself harvey birdman and uh my two uh would be my pathfinder

1529
01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:13,600
character and the only game of pathfinder i played uh for like two or three sessions before i bailed

1530
01:44:13,600 --> 01:44:17,040
because we started making this podcast and i didn't have time for literally anything else

1531
01:44:17,040 --> 01:44:26,800
in my life ever again was his name was alexander iman and he was a bard halfling and his name was

1532
01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:37,680
alexander iman and if you shortened it his name was alex seaman yeah uh yep i think that got a

1533
01:44:37,680 --> 01:44:48,320
yeah from luke like yeah uh-oh it took andy way longer to realize that i mean as soon as i heard

1534
01:44:48,320 --> 01:44:54,160
it i was like yeah that's dope yeah the other players and the gm didn't realize until the

1535
01:44:54,160 --> 01:45:00,880
third or fourth session uh after which i andy andy's a sweet boy i stole all their gold and

1536
01:45:00,880 --> 01:45:09,280
i left to go try to save my sister and ended up giving a virus like a disease to an entire town

1537
01:45:09,280 --> 01:45:16,880
down river so uh yeah the other one was uh i really liked the delta green shotgun scenario

1538
01:45:16,880 --> 01:45:26,160
burner uh that ross paton wrote uh i played a brolo named brody and uh there was a fun

1539
01:45:26,160 --> 01:45:34,240
scene in that one where i got to um uh you know make a bunch of molotov cocktails and bust open

1540
01:45:34,240 --> 01:45:43,040
the doors of a saloon while blasting eye of the tiger and i had taken like the grime from the

1541
01:45:43,040 --> 01:45:49,680
floor of the bar and like rubbed it underneath my eyes to to become a warrior and then i died

1542
01:45:49,680 --> 01:45:55,120
that uh that is still one of the most fun uh sessions i've ever played in and your actions

1543
01:45:55,120 --> 01:46:01,360
in it like opened up the insane possibilities of role-playing for me i'd never played delta green

1544
01:46:01,360 --> 01:46:06,800
and you were like so confident as like you're we we played all these people who came together when

1545
01:46:06,800 --> 01:46:11,440
like shit hits the fan at this strip mall and i think you were just like the teenager who worked

1546
01:46:11,440 --> 01:46:16,800
at a cell phone store right yeah and you were just like really confidently like playing with

1547
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:21,360
the world and what you were allowed to do and i was like oh that's dope thank you i hated a

1548
01:46:21,360 --> 01:46:27,280
bathroom and posted on reddit a bunch at the beginning yeah you like it was like what's zach

1549
01:46:27,280 --> 01:46:30,960
doing and he's like yeah i'm just on my phone in the bathroom but then you were also like you had

1550
01:46:30,960 --> 01:46:35,040
snuck into the bar and you made the molotovs without us like really knowing i was just passing

1551
01:46:35,040 --> 01:46:39,840
sam notes and he was having me do like secret checks and then like he basically passed me a

1552
01:46:39,840 --> 01:46:43,920
note that was like all right narrate your cool scene of you like coming out of the bar with all

1553
01:46:43,920 --> 01:46:52,240
your molotovs and um yeah molotovs didn't help uh the shotgun that i didn't have ammo for didn't

1554
01:46:52,240 --> 01:47:01,360
help it was the fact that we all got real shit face didn't help yeah and there were like seven

1555
01:47:01,360 --> 01:47:08,160
players at the table and two people were sharing one player yeah that was wild that was wild god

1556
01:47:08,160 --> 01:47:16,880
bless sam all right uh very very much so yeah uh anyone else have any players i think that's it

1557
01:47:18,320 --> 01:47:23,920
all right cool uh so they actually had another question snuggles mcsquig asked are there any

1558
01:47:23,920 --> 01:47:29,920
other systems anyone is interested in trying something like never going home which is a world

1559
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:36,160
war one kathulu rpg with beautiful art well i've never heard of it until now but yeah that sounds

1560
01:47:36,160 --> 01:47:41,360
dope as i've said before love to get more into dungeon world and really learn that system a

1561
01:47:41,360 --> 01:47:46,560
little bit better i have the book the book is also very cool and fun to read i've been really wanting

1562
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:52,880
to get into uh like super stripped down rpg stuff uh sam actually ran us that weird like homebrew

1563
01:47:52,880 --> 01:47:57,520
thing where it was like the most stripped down ever i'd like to go like a couple steps above

1564
01:47:57,520 --> 01:48:04,480
that where it's like yeah there's a thing called uh risus or r-i-s-u-s it's free on the internet

1565
01:48:04,880 --> 01:48:10,720
uh people said it's a really good introductory way to do role-playing stuff uh just in case

1566
01:48:10,720 --> 01:48:17,200
anyone else was looking for that like i was a couple days ago is this the anything rpg

1567
01:48:17,200 --> 01:48:24,080
oh risus is latin for laughter it's uh i think it's just like a very like bare bones like you

1568
01:48:24,080 --> 01:48:28,960
can kind of apply it to whatever stuff you want it to be which sounds really interesting to me

1569
01:48:28,960 --> 01:48:33,680
i kind of like that like zach said i kind of what can i do that like i want to do like cooperative

1570
01:48:33,680 --> 01:48:39,920
storytelling more than like gameplay functionality it's like we can play a video game together if we

1571
01:48:39,920 --> 01:48:46,800
really want to get down into that stuff but i'd rather have like the just a a loose set of rules

1572
01:48:46,800 --> 01:48:51,520
to guide a story it's kind of what i like there's a lot of like single page rpgs that i'd love to

1573
01:48:51,520 --> 01:48:58,960
play i'll do whatever zach runs same yeah i've always really wanted to play like a long-term

1574
01:48:58,960 --> 01:49:04,320
sci-fi campaign uh same like the star wars one or something no no i really wouldn't want it to be

1575
01:49:04,320 --> 01:49:10,400
like in a star wars world just i got you bigs but like yeah having fun in a space opera setting

1576
01:49:10,400 --> 01:49:16,160
would be dope this is one that i would be interested in if zach would run it no stop

1577
01:49:16,160 --> 01:49:24,880
sharing screenshots and it ruined ugo rpg does what exists anybody has a ugo rpg

1578
01:49:25,840 --> 01:49:33,040
boy howdy i've been wanting to play in a deadlands it's the weird west one it sounds like it'd be

1579
01:49:33,040 --> 01:49:40,000
super cool super cool dope did you guys uh did you guys listen to dad lands i did adventure time

1580
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:47,040
live episode oh yeah i did yeah it's super funny wait oh gotcha yes that was really adventure zone

1581
01:49:47,040 --> 01:49:53,600
none of them yeah so i got super confused oh in adventure time rpg would be fun as fuck i bet

1582
01:49:53,680 --> 01:49:58,400
there is one oh i'm a big star trek nerd i'd love to play the star trek role-playing game

1583
01:49:58,400 --> 01:50:04,240
apparently it's super cool because you have like your character but also you have like ship traits

1584
01:50:04,240 --> 01:50:09,200
that when you're on the ship like you have maneuver it and stuff it looks super cool that's

1585
01:50:09,200 --> 01:50:12,800
exactly the kind of thing i want to play where we're like the crew of a spaceship going yeah

1586
01:50:12,800 --> 01:50:21,120
different like well instead of that uh what we are probably gonna play soon is someone made a

1587
01:50:21,200 --> 01:50:24,400
play set for fiasco based on tiger king

1588
01:50:31,600 --> 01:50:39,760
i just sent a message uh there is an adventure time uh tabletop rpg and this is the entire set

1589
01:50:39,760 --> 01:50:47,680
of rules and everything so that'd be fun very fun uh we've got another question here from dazed

1590
01:50:47,760 --> 01:50:53,840
underscore wanderer asks one what the fuck zach spelled my name wrong so

1591
01:50:55,440 --> 01:51:00,960
what the fuck dazed underscore wanderer back at you number two uh was everything

1592
01:51:00,960 --> 01:51:04,400
in the storage lockers k-cells hmm

1593
01:51:04,720 --> 01:51:07,680
hmm

1594
01:51:10,720 --> 01:51:18,720
interesting uh so next week or basically here's what i'm thinking is uh i would like to do another

1595
01:51:18,720 --> 01:51:26,240
q a that is a plot q a where we can talk about like things that the characters have learned

1596
01:51:26,240 --> 01:51:31,200
and connecting some of those dots together let's give the people what they want more q a's

1597
01:51:35,200 --> 01:51:43,040
so i think now is a really good time to uh get the plot like ironed out and have you guys ready

1598
01:51:43,040 --> 01:51:52,480
to um head into the next arc of this story uh so we will answer that question on that episode

1601
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:11,440

with them mine are in the living room but i've been working out almost every day i've been

1608
01:52:46,320 --> 01:52:50,560
working out a couple times a day because i'm drinking a lot of beer a couple times a day

1609
01:52:51,520 --> 01:52:58,480
yeah nice i've been going on runs i run a small in cave and back yeah nice i've lost uh 15 pounds

1610
01:52:58,480 --> 01:53:05,840
in the last uh 24 days thank you that's awesome how much of that was from the haircut

1611
01:53:09,520 --> 01:53:18,720
12 our beloved chuckling boy asks if the next campaign you played could not be in the kathulu

1612
01:53:18,880 --> 01:53:26,640
family of game systems rude dg csc pulp trail etc what would it be and why is it red markets

1613
01:53:26,640 --> 01:53:33,280
i don't know what red markets is but let's do that one yeah red markets is apparently

1614
01:53:33,280 --> 01:53:40,080
chuckling boy it's good enough for me i've heard only great things and i know ross paton

1615
01:53:40,080 --> 01:53:46,560
is really into it which would make sense because it's written by caleb stokes who lives around here

1616
01:53:46,560 --> 01:53:54,240
and is on rpr rppr a fair amount and wrote a really he also wrote a really dope campaign

1617
01:53:54,240 --> 01:54:01,040
called god's teeth that he ran on rppr that is being published currently are being worked on

1618
01:54:01,040 --> 01:54:07,680
to be published by delta green currently and yeah red markets is basically a survival game

1619
01:54:07,680 --> 01:54:14,400
where you are in a zombied world but then your supplies run low and you have to go out on

1620
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:21,040
missions and like the more intense the mission is the better like rewards are available on that you

1621
01:54:21,040 --> 01:54:27,680
know and basically you're trying to survive and make a world for yourself so the description is

1622
01:54:27,680 --> 01:54:35,120
really interesting online uh red markets a game of economic horror yes uh and red markets characters

1623
01:54:35,120 --> 01:54:39,280
risk their lives trading between the massive quarantine zones containing a zombie outbreak

1624
01:54:39,280 --> 01:54:45,360
in the remains of civilization that sounds markets uses the traditional uh zombie genre

1625
01:54:45,360 --> 01:54:50,880
to tell its story about surviving on the wrong end of the economy weird sounds that sounds really

1626
01:54:50,880 --> 01:54:57,120
interesting that sounds close yeah that sounds dope thanks for the tip chuckling boy i hit up

1627
01:54:57,120 --> 01:55:03,840
caleb on twitter and asked if he would run god's teeth for us when it and he said when it's

1628
01:55:03,840 --> 01:55:12,000
published he will so that's fucking sick uh maybe he'll ride run some red markets for us before then

1629
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:17,360
seeing as how he's the dude who wrote it i've seen him stream shit i bet he can do it remotely

1630
01:55:18,400 --> 01:55:23,440
that'd be cool uh he also asked uh chuckling boy asked what is a question that you were surprised

1631
01:55:23,440 --> 01:55:28,880
no one has asked i can answer this literally anything about the campaign i don't know why

1632
01:55:28,880 --> 01:55:33,520
people don't ask questions about the story stuff it always surprises me it feels like

1633
01:55:33,520 --> 01:55:38,080
the people on the subreddit have a much stronger grasp of the campaign than us so

1634
01:55:40,800 --> 01:55:46,560
yeah they they don't need any questions yeah they know what's going on i don't understand why you

1635
01:55:46,560 --> 01:55:54,560
guys don't can we do a q a where we get the cues you guys ask the questions and then the chat

1636
01:55:54,560 --> 01:56:03,600
answers them yeah there you go so sad uh should the should the air uh light be on on my focus

1637
01:56:03,600 --> 01:56:10,720
right yeah uh i think joe got you to turn it on before we started he totally pranked you because

1638
01:56:10,720 --> 01:56:19,680
now you sound like you've been sucking in helium the entire time oh no great break though uh we

1639
01:56:19,680 --> 01:56:27,680
got another question here from gwen egr and they ask how do you like to transition between

1640
01:56:27,680 --> 01:56:33,920
campaigns do you prefer to build off an old thread or create something brand new create something

1641
01:56:33,920 --> 01:56:40,240
brand new every time i think that especially in delta green most of the games i think all the

1642
01:56:40,240 --> 01:56:47,440
campaigns that we've played in end with at least some sort of impact that would leave the globe

1643
01:56:47,520 --> 01:56:53,520
reeling and therefore if we were to start another campaign in that same world the impact of the

1644
01:56:53,520 --> 01:57:00,480
previous campaign would be evident and therefore i prefer to have a clean slate yeah in the uh

1645
01:57:00,480 --> 01:57:05,920
in the two previous like mega campaigns we've done with you uh we did not

1646
01:57:08,480 --> 01:57:14,960
save things you put it off you put it off for a long time we tried

1647
01:57:15,920 --> 01:57:20,480
we did our best that's all anyone could have expected from us i think we mostly go insane

1648
01:57:20,480 --> 01:57:27,840
or die and and then the world ends yeah whose character like got killed and then came back

1649
01:57:27,840 --> 01:57:35,040
alive and killed over and over again that was thomas's professor character was trapped in a room

1650
01:57:35,040 --> 01:57:39,520
it wasn't that you died though right it was that you had to watch your wife die over and over again

1651
01:57:39,920 --> 01:57:47,920
wasn't that the thing yeah he had to watch a film of him performing a spell on his wife who had

1652
01:57:47,920 --> 01:57:54,640
cancer trying to cure her and fucking up the spell and killing her and he had to

1653
01:57:54,640 --> 01:57:58,960
watch that on repeat infinitely super fun do you remember her name

1654
01:57:58,960 --> 01:58:12,160
times elizabeth uh yeah i believe uh the great old lord cthulhu came on up out of the ocean

1655
01:58:12,160 --> 01:58:16,800
at the end of that campaign and stared joe's character right in the eyes we blinked at each

1656
01:58:16,800 --> 01:58:20,000
other it's cute it's a meet cute

1657
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:28,880
oh you come to this beach too cthulhu dropped something on the beach and you guys bonk heads

1658
01:58:29,200 --> 01:58:36,640
for talking you talk funny bud

1659
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:40,560
but i think you're so cute

1660
01:58:42,880 --> 01:58:48,640
uh we got another question this is uh oh man ain't on a no-no you've really truly

1661
01:58:48,640 --> 01:58:54,160
outdone yourself here if you were stranded on a dessert island what kind of sentient

1662
01:58:54,240 --> 01:59:02,240
confectionary treats would you hunt for survival gummy bears oh that'd be a truly horrifying one

1663
01:59:04,160 --> 01:59:07,680
they're full they're full-sized like they're bear-sized

1664
01:59:07,680 --> 01:59:14,800
yep uh yeah joe took the good animal and i would hunt whatever was brownies

1665
01:59:15,600 --> 01:59:17,600
so

1666
01:59:21,600 --> 01:59:27,920
and you know if they if they happen to like get like warm by being chased then maybe

1667
01:59:27,920 --> 01:59:33,440
chase them around like directly toward the vanilla ice cream fountain or something like

1668
01:59:34,320 --> 01:59:40,480
god stop zach and uh and then that's all that's all i need for a perfect dessert uh you know if

1669
01:59:40,480 --> 01:59:47,600
you want to drop a double shot of espresso on top of that be it since you're not um stop it

1670
01:59:47,600 --> 01:59:57,360
i forgot to have one uh whatever weird critter i want like a turtle made out of chocolate chip

1671
01:59:57,360 --> 02:00:04,400
cookies but his body is like a hershey's chocolate turtle body but his shell is a big chocolate chip

1672
02:00:04,400 --> 02:00:10,720
cookie yeah i get you cut him i can like split him right down the half in front of his turtle

1673
02:00:10,720 --> 02:00:21,920
family crack him open that yeah that's a good answer i want to hunt down uh a moose that is

1674
02:00:21,920 --> 02:00:29,920
darker than dark and squeamish like oil and it writhes about in the air and i just like moose

1675
02:00:29,920 --> 02:00:36,160
i like moose and pudding a lot i could do something like that uh would be good for me on

1676
02:00:36,160 --> 02:00:40,720
an island you're a little pudding boy oh dude when the sun's out i've got to have my pudding

1677
02:00:44,080 --> 02:00:50,960
i haven't had a a dessert pizza in like a decade yeah the godfather's m&m pizza is like the

1678
02:00:50,960 --> 02:00:57,760
godfather's m&m pizza was so good i want one right now herman cain baby oh i forgot herman

1679
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:07,120
started oh yeah was he the cigarette smoking ad um he was he was the stare and smile uh the stare

1680
02:01:07,120 --> 02:01:11,520
and smile he might have also been the cigarette ad i don't remember oh what a character i want

1681
02:01:11,520 --> 02:01:21,360
andy's that's andy's uh custard that's my answer just but what animal would it be would you have

1682
02:01:21,760 --> 02:01:26,560
brutally kill while you i would be i would be stranded there with andy and

1683
02:01:29,760 --> 02:01:31,760
i would force him to make me custard

1684
02:01:35,040 --> 02:01:39,280
actually you guys have seen you guys have been to andy's you have to watch the the custard

1685
02:01:39,280 --> 02:01:46,080
come the chocolate comes out it looks like and um and that's the joke yeah i get a brownie

1686
02:01:46,080 --> 02:01:52,640
that's a fresh idea i get a stolen brownie pecan concrete every time oh no i got an idea you have

1687
02:01:52,640 --> 02:02:01,120
to suck the custard out of zach's weird chocolate moose moose out of his bunghole i was thinking

1688
02:02:01,120 --> 02:02:08,320
like oh teats no it's out of its butt because we said it looked like poop wow now we agreed to it

1689
02:02:08,800 --> 02:02:19,840
all right uh i don't like this island so holy shit a pigeon well yeah fantastic name asks which

1690
02:02:19,840 --> 02:02:26,960
player character has the nicest butt i think it's john lee pettymore i think i think canonically it

1691
02:02:26,960 --> 02:02:32,240
is i think that in one of the early episodes you said that he has a magnificent ass he's got a

1692
02:02:32,240 --> 02:02:38,080
tight ass he wears he wears two tight jeans yeah yeah in a good way to people like it

1693
02:02:38,560 --> 02:02:44,320
holy shit a pigeon also asks who would you pick to play your characters and npc's if pt bp

1694
02:02:44,320 --> 02:02:51,520
was a live action movie or show we are going to take our time with that question on the next

1695
02:02:51,520 --> 02:02:58,320
episode how about that uh it was all a snow globe asks how much of the story right yeah that's fun

1696
02:02:58,320 --> 02:03:04,080
uh how much the story writing process is influenced by slash influences the song you've

1697
02:03:04,080 --> 02:03:08,880
chosen for the intros do you typically find that music influences you're writing a lot

1698
02:03:08,880 --> 02:03:15,920
yes it absolutely does i remember specifically writing the plot for the silver spheres when

1699
02:03:15,920 --> 02:03:20,240
i realized that john lee pettymore was the only one who had picked it up and then he put it in

1700
02:03:20,240 --> 02:03:26,960
his pocket and i said okay well those balls have to do something weird and then i was like okay

1701
02:03:26,960 --> 02:03:33,040
well why is john lee pettymore allowed to touch it if no one else is and no backbone was a part

1702
02:03:33,040 --> 02:03:37,360
of that like when i was coming up with like the idea for that i was like oh shit this is this is

1703
02:03:37,360 --> 02:03:45,280
perfect uh so literally that song made thomas's character's entire arc essentially nice super

1704
02:03:45,280 --> 02:03:54,240
cool the theme song's about me guys uh and then when i was picking out the other songs

1705
02:03:54,960 --> 02:04:01,680
yeah i find the lyrics like extremely important especially like uh moon dance i knew i knew what

1706
02:04:01,680 --> 02:04:09,440
i was looking for plot wise uh for that arc before i got the song picked out but uh when

1707
02:04:09,440 --> 02:04:14,640
that song happened when i came across it i was like oh yes of course this is absolutely perfect

1708
02:04:14,640 --> 02:04:20,480
and then the next one this most recent one where we had dream girl uh that actually influenced the

1709
02:04:20,480 --> 02:04:28,080
plot as well once i decided on that one uh that actually probably helped change joe's entire plot

1710
02:04:28,080 --> 02:04:36,240
uh for that the line uh i swear i knew you before this yep yeah and then she says uh corner room

1711
02:04:36,240 --> 02:04:44,560
and it was right so the room has no corners which is an allusion to a circle the hounds of tenderloose

1712
02:04:45,280 --> 02:04:53,520
which is some nerd shit and a circle um okay moving on uh so a lot a lot and always and it

1713
02:04:53,520 --> 02:05:00,720
always matters so uh ain't on a no-no once again how much filth could have wolf ah fuck i fucked

1714
02:05:00,720 --> 02:05:05,200
it up how much felt could a wolf wolf down if a wolf could wolf down filth well done

1715
02:05:06,480 --> 02:05:10,320
uh justin why are you asking me and moving on we've got

1716
02:05:10,720 --> 02:05:11,360
a question

1717
02:05:16,720 --> 02:05:23,920
lord dairy is wrong with you guys uh d-a-r-r-y lord dairy asks is jeremy pettymore still alive

1718
02:05:24,800 --> 02:05:32,640
no right like no like no no like no he dead john lee pettymore shot him in the head

1719
02:05:33,360 --> 02:05:39,920
yeah i answered uh one of my favorite moments from this podcast that ending to that was so

1720
02:05:39,920 --> 02:05:46,640
fucking well done i had not planned that in any way and when thomas and i were role playing it it

1721
02:05:46,640 --> 02:05:55,440
just fucking happened and i was on the edge of my seat with what he was going to do next and with

1722
02:05:55,440 --> 02:06:00,640
what happened i was just so fucking so that's one of those moments in role playing where you just

1723
02:06:02,320 --> 02:06:07,920
it's three eighths of a sneeze three eighths of a sneeze three sneezes

1724
02:06:07,920 --> 02:06:11,760
three eighths of a sneeze is so much less

1725
02:06:14,400 --> 02:06:22,400
guys sneezing is so much better than role playing i swear uh so at ripsaw underscore unicorn applied

1726
02:06:22,400 --> 02:06:29,200
with uh pet pics and a question uh those pets were very adorable and they ask a question that

1727
02:06:29,200 --> 02:06:35,680
i cannot answer what anime tropes do y'all feel each player character would fall into you know

1728
02:06:35,760 --> 02:06:42,480
how in some anime in some animes uh like they're in a fight and they keep revealing more and more

1729
02:06:42,480 --> 02:06:46,720
powers and they're like getting stronger and stronger keith would be like the opposite of

1730
02:06:46,720 --> 02:06:51,920
that where he just keeps doing stupider and stupider and stupider so keith keith would be

1731
02:06:51,920 --> 02:06:56,000
like the anime character who just like is constantly eating all the time and that's

1732
02:06:56,000 --> 02:07:04,880
their only like yeah that's the brad pitt anime john lee pettymore is not an anime trope is is

1733
02:07:04,880 --> 02:07:10,560
the best way i can put it everybody who's he's just not serious enough as a person

1734
02:07:11,200 --> 02:07:15,920
in the way that everyone in fucking anime is about every little fucking thing they do

1735
02:07:15,920 --> 02:07:21,920
whoa wow such harsh language it's just uh it's just a little theatrical for me

1736
02:07:23,760 --> 02:07:30,080
that's weird plus like plus i can't uh yeah i don't know i love theater clark bishops would

1737
02:07:30,080 --> 02:07:39,680
be having huge titties yeah clark bishop yeah got them anime titties dig it

1738
02:07:42,480 --> 02:07:47,040
i i don't watch like any anime so i will defer to you guys on what my trope would be i don't

1739
02:07:47,040 --> 02:07:51,760
know what anime tropes there are i feel like a lot of our characters don't obey a lot of traditional

1740
02:07:51,760 --> 02:07:59,200
anime tropes generally it's tonally so not that john lee pettymore i feel like is like the badass

1741
02:07:59,200 --> 02:08:04,800
character that a lot of animes have yeah but that that badass character is always like has

1742
02:08:04,800 --> 02:08:11,600
this dark past that they're like trying to atone for or like get revenge for or something yeah

1743
02:08:11,600 --> 02:08:18,000
and john lee pettymore is just here to fucking ride wild yeah pretty much he just wants to now

1744
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:23,520
that he has five million dollars yeah he's just a dude running around in his dad's body

1745
02:08:23,760 --> 02:08:33,040
that'll animate i am my dad like john lee pettymore looks down he's looking at a dick

1746
02:08:33,040 --> 02:08:42,000
that's fucked his mom that's cool wow nice holy shit clark has the like dead parents anime trope

1747
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:48,320
oh that is true yeah you're the protagonist of every anime he's also the protagonist in this

1748
02:08:48,400 --> 02:08:50,160
he's also the protagonist of the story

1749
02:08:51,680 --> 02:08:55,920
okay that's my that's if that's true then why do i have the theme song the theme song is about

1750
02:08:55,920 --> 02:09:05,920
thomas but the story is about joe and luke is uh keith is there there scraping by you're all

1751
02:09:05,920 --> 02:09:12,080
very important i hope you know that uh so we've got another one here from at stories colossal

1752
02:09:12,800 --> 02:09:18,640
says if you guys were playing with bonds in the main timeline bonds is a mechanic in delta green

1753
02:09:18,640 --> 02:09:26,400
where uh you lose and gain a good relationship with three or four different people two to four

1754
02:09:26,400 --> 02:09:32,160
different people in your life and you can like basically your sanity uh is affected

1755
02:09:32,720 --> 02:09:38,240
or affects those relationships so who would they be for each of the pcs uh we started to

1756
02:09:38,240 --> 02:09:43,600
touch on it i think in one episode and we i decided that clark is a real sad lonely guy

1757
02:09:43,600 --> 02:09:49,920
so his bonds would be like the checkout guy at the grocery store who is in a dream of yours yep

1758
02:09:50,720 --> 02:09:56,400
and uh probably maggie if if that was a thing that you could do have a bond with somebody who

1759
02:09:56,400 --> 02:10:01,680
isn't in the story much totally like that would be definitely one of his bonds when we were thinking

1760
02:10:01,680 --> 02:10:06,400
about maybe even having pawns i think as a mechanic i think john lee pettymore was going

1761
02:10:06,400 --> 02:10:13,280
to use just the extended pettymore family as a bond and then like as as he called on them to do

1762
02:10:13,280 --> 02:10:18,240
different things obviously that relationship would get strained as more of them were like taken by

1763
02:10:18,240 --> 02:10:24,000
supernatural horrors but but thinking about it now john lee pettymore definitely has like an

1764
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:29,760
ex-girlfriend who got tired of his shit but still cares for him that like if shit really went down

1765
02:10:29,760 --> 02:10:34,640
he could be like shit like fuck and call her but she definitely doesn't want to be a part of his

1766
02:10:34,640 --> 02:10:42,800
life on a day-to-day basis anymore oh for keith uh he's never dated anybody he killed his brother

1767
02:10:43,760 --> 02:10:51,520
doesn't have much family to speak of so his one and only bond would be no spoilers

1768
02:10:52,560 --> 02:10:56,320
i mean if they're listening to this they just listen to everything else i'm kidding

1769
02:10:56,320 --> 02:11:03,600
uh so it would be bean my dog uh which leads us into the last question which is a very good

1770
02:11:03,600 --> 02:11:11,680
question and it was brought up on the discord uh pretty recently and crush posted in the uh

1771
02:11:11,680 --> 02:11:20,480
in the question thread what happened to keith's dog and then uh bx borei 9181 who is currently

1772
02:11:20,480 --> 02:11:27,360
doing a re-listen while taking notes and posting the notes in the subreddit which is dope uh very

1773
02:11:27,360 --> 02:11:32,960
cool and fun to fun to watch uh i think she might have even been the one who posted it in the

1774
02:11:32,960 --> 02:11:38,640
discord but anyway uh she said also if keith was in the city before coming home to contention

1775
02:11:38,640 --> 02:11:45,360
how did he miss all those dirty dog grooming locations especially since he had a dog um okay

1776
02:11:45,360 --> 02:11:52,640
so what happened to keith's dog he is happily at at home in the motel hotel motel i'm sure

1777
02:11:52,640 --> 02:11:59,120
it's only been a couple days he can fend for himself it's been five days yep yeah what if

1778
02:11:59,680 --> 02:12:05,120
what if like uh maybe he was running around in the creek bed having fun with all the other dogs

1779
02:12:05,120 --> 02:12:12,480
okay so guys he probably tore into that dead in a hotel room no he torn in my big bag of dog food

1780
02:12:12,480 --> 02:12:19,200
and then chewed his way out of the hotel room and is swimming with the fishes

1781
02:12:22,160 --> 02:12:26,080
and his and his stomach burst because of all the food he ate and now he's dead

1782
02:12:26,640 --> 02:12:30,800
no he's alive i would hope we haven't been to contention in a while so i've got to check on

1783
02:12:30,800 --> 02:12:40,400
him he should call him come here bean what do you guys think about playing animals in contention

1784
02:12:41,040 --> 02:12:51,120
for like uh one hour one shot you guys play animals in contention who have to save bean from

1785
02:12:51,120 --> 02:12:57,440
the room that he's locked in in hotel motel the stakes are simply too high uh

1786
02:12:58,720 --> 02:13:05,520
the emotional devastation if we didn't like yeah if we didn't save beans and also it's not one hour

1787
02:13:05,520 --> 02:13:13,120
it's an entire campaign also we're starting it now and it's as long as the quarantine is

1788
02:13:16,160 --> 02:13:18,720
and if you go to sleep i'll come over to your house and kill you

1789
02:13:21,360 --> 02:13:28,720
what uh yeah you know you gotta keep playing continually yeah you can never stop oh no

1790
02:13:30,080 --> 02:13:36,080
never stop never stopping bro uh so i will come up with a like uh you said you will come

1791
02:13:38,720 --> 02:13:45,200
and i only speak the truth uh right and you guys will play different animals who are in contention

1792
02:13:45,840 --> 02:13:55,120
and we'll uh we'll see what happened to old bean okay cool i'm warning you now if it's not

1793
02:13:56,160 --> 02:14:02,480
if it's not him if it's not alive yeah we will come kill zach yeah six feet

1794
02:14:05,040 --> 02:14:11,040
we can shoot you yeah we can kill you from six feet away oh god i don't like that

1795
02:14:11,360 --> 02:14:18,240
well yeah you know you best not fuck with the dog now you know where you fucking stand

1796
02:14:20,080 --> 02:14:24,960
okay lower than an imaginary dog the mechanics of this game are pretty simple

1797
02:14:24,960 --> 02:14:32,720
uh if i ask you to roll you succeed good that's right to answer this question though uh

1798
02:14:32,720 --> 02:14:39,280
keith is fucking stupid and he just gave his dog baths in his in his own house yeah i like to think

1799
02:14:39,280 --> 02:14:44,240
that keith is such a good dog owner that he didn't need a grooming place my dog is grooms

1800
02:14:44,240 --> 02:14:51,120
himself and he proved in the story how good of a dog owner he was yeah i mean i didn't know i was

1801
02:14:51,120 --> 02:15:01,120
gonna get shipped off to the city okay so far ahead uh this has been the q and a uh episode
