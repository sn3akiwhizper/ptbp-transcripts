1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,840
Well, well, well, I see y'all are crawling back for more Wolf the Dog, and it don't matter

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:17,640
if I'm broadcasting in contention, the city, or anywhere else in the galaxy, everybody

3
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,640
always wants a taste of ol' Wolfy Boy.

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:30,640
Well, I am here hittin' you live from 694.2 PTBP to let y'all feast upon my mouth sounds.

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,480
I hope it's real satiatin' for y'all.

6
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:41,320
This week's Howlin' with Wolf comes from Dr. Colossus, who is an honorary police officer

7
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:47,080
on our Patreon and a member of the community over on the subreddit.

8
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:53,600
They tagged atpretendingpod in a tweet, which is just about the sweetest thing to ol' Wolf.

9
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,920
Dr. Colossus writes,

10
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,280
Time for ol' Wolf to come clean, my pups.

11
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:05,400
The audio adventures of the contention PD are just a cover to distract from my own insidious

12
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,240
efforts to dominate the national radio landscape.

13
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:15,320
Today contention, tomorrow the city, later on the world.

14
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,400
I can tell you this now because it's too late to stop it.

15
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:25,880
There's nowhere to hide as my hypnotic suggestions surf the electromagnetic waves straight into

16
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,900
your ear holes and hack your brain stems.

17
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,760
My dominion is nearly absolute.

18
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:38,520
Remember, the trigger phrase is plate of foot meat.

19
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,700
Thank you, Dr. Colossus, for ruining the surprise.

20
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:48,620
My producer and I were going to start by buying out all the local radio stations in

21
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:56,020
every small town so that Wolf the dog could have a grassroots movement of domination.

22
00:01:56,020 --> 00:02:00,000
Then I'd begin the persuasion.

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,220
Real nice, real slow, you see.

24
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:05,580
I got time.

25
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:09,580
There's no one else for them to even listen to.

26
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:15,660
Draw them all in with hunnied words and promises of infinite foot meat.

27
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:22,620
Then, when the time was right, well, y'all just gonna have to wait and see, I guess.

28
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:27,620
Remember, if you want to write up something for your old wolf to how, tag at Pretending

29
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:33,700
Pod on Instagram or Twitter, tag Pretending To Be People on Facebook, or write a five-star

30
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:39,260
review and email us at pretendingpod at gmail dot com.

31
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:45,380
Y'all, I need that positive motivation from you beautiful people because life in the city

32
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:46,780
is strange.

33
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:50,900
Yesterday, I saw two pigeons eating a rat.

34
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:55,700
Whenever I went over to try and scare them away, they hissed at me like a rabid raccoon

35
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,700
before skittering off.

36
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,300
They didn't even fly, y'all.

37
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,020
They just ran away real fast.

38
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:06,860
Please remember, my dear listeners, we got ourselves a Patreon now.

39
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:11,380
The link is in the show notes, and if you can't support us with your money, please write

40
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:16,540
a review on iTunes, and if you already wrote a review, please steal your friends' phones

41
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:21,900
and write a review on their iTunes, and if you don't have friends, go to the nearest

42
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:27,100
Apple store and write a review on iTunes from every phone and tablet on display in the whole

43
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:33,420
fuckin' place, and while you're there, grab that aux cord that's connected to the speaker

44
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:38,100
system and warn everyone that shit is about to slap.

45
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:57,540
It's KOTSU with no bap-a.

46
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,540
Spank me.

47
00:03:58,540 --> 00:03:59,540
Flank me.

48
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:02,540
Call me stanky.

49
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:06,460
Stinky.

50
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:10,380
That means you yourself admit it yourself that you love your mother-in-law.

51
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:14,140
Are you ready?

52
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,140
Yeah.

53
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:19,340
John Lee Pettymore, you are standing outside a storage unit.

54
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:23,580
A massive yellow symbol has been spray painted on the door.

55
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:29,160
The symbol is a wonky question mark with two lines, one curved and one straight, jutting

56
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,860
down from the question mark's dot.

57
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:38,260
The storage unit door slides up, and inside is the thick brush of well-wooded land.

58
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,880
In the distance, you see a small cabin.

59
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,580
Looking down, your hands are covered in blue paint, and you are holding one of those small

60
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,280
silver spheres.

61
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,180
It feels warm in your hands.

62
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,580
It has a nice weight to it.

63
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:54,860
And then you see a sky of endless darkness.

64
00:04:54,860 --> 00:05:00,020
Far out in front of you, through this thick and terminable nothing, you see two children

65
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:05,240
standing completely still, holding hands, and you hear the sounds of torment.

66
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:11,900
Agony and loss in an audio medium, you lose the ability to see, smell, feel anything as

67
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:16,100
the wretched noise overwhelms your senses.

68
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:23,140
You open your eyes, and you're staring up at a ceiling, and you look to the left, you

69
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:26,340
look to the right, and you see corpses.

70
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:34,300
And it smells overwhelmingly like blood and viscera and death and shit, other bodily fluids

71
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,700
spilled out.

72
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:40,380
You see the body of John Lee Pettymore IV.

73
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:44,300
Your body, but not your current body.

74
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:51,980
And you see the body of Rich Nichols, the man that led you from room to room in this

75
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:54,580
layer of Marvin Glass.

76
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:55,580
What do you do?

77
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:59,460
I look down at my new body, and what do I see?

78
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:04,620
Well honestly, the body of Kevin, or as we'll call him, John Lee Pettymore.

79
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,340
I guess I'd like to find a mirror.

80
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,340
Okay.

81
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:14,940
One of the files in this room, one of the file cabinets, has the front of it is actually

82
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:18,500
reflective, extremely reflective.

83
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:27,540
Looking in, you see this man who is, he looks like a broken version of your daddy that you

84
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:35,180
knew from when you were a child, a very young child, but he is much older.

85
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:39,940
He may be my father, but he ain't my daddy.

86
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:46,700
You see you have you to now have surgical scars all down your neck and jawline on either

87
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:56,100
side and these crazy eyes, and you're just an older man, basically the same build, you

88
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,540
still have a mustache, you know there's a lot of similarities.

89
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:03,980
I want to look at my old body and see where I came out of.

90
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:04,980
Oh yeah.

91
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:11,740
So it's very clear that you came out of the back of the neck.

92
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:12,740
Okay.

93
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:13,740
What do I feel like?

94
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:17,780
Do I feel like a person or like something wrapping itself around a host?

95
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,860
Well you feel like you've always felt.

96
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:20,860
Okay.

97
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:21,860
Makes sense.

98
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:27,580
So I, John Lee Pettymore kind of shudders as he looks at his old body.

99
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:32,260
I want to, I want to basically pretend to be Kevin as long as I can.

100
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,260
Okay.

101
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:39,620
So let's discuss the mechanical changes out of character for John Lee Pettymore the third.

102
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:40,620
Yeah.

103
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,660
What am I now?

104
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:47,980
So as I've described on the last two episodes for the other boys, we have, we've decided

105
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:54,980
to adapt some of the rules from Pulp Cthulhu, fold them into this campaign and in doing

106
00:07:54,980 --> 00:08:02,260
so, we have given each of the PCs two talents from the Pulp Cthulhu rule book.

107
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:07,940
Thomas, you chose quick healer and this game we roll one D four to get new hit points for

108
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:13,780
each day and in your case you'll get one D four plus three every day.

109
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:17,180
And then you also chose clairvoyance.

110
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:24,020
Basically how we're going to do that is I'm going to trust you to not use this every second

111
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,020
that we're playing the game.

112
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,020
That's a mistake.

113
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:29,100
Yeah, I think that's fair, but here's what I'm gonna allow you to do.

114
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:36,140
You can spend 10 luck at any point in time to like dive into your internal self and have

115
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,140
a vision.

116
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,140
Cool.

117
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:42,100
Also with your, uh, with your character for the stuff you hit a breaking point yesterday

118
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,100
as well, I believe.

119
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:46,620
Um, no, I've got 22.

120
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:47,620
As your breaking point?

121
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:51,020
No, 20 is my breaking point and it's, it's very hard to see.

122
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,020
Right.

123
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:55,220
So that means you're actually extremely close to your 28.

124
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:56,380
There's no way that's a 28.

125
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,380
It's a 22.

126
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,380
Okay.

127
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,620
So you're extremely close to your third breaking point.

128
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,060
What happens on your third breaking point?

129
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:05,100
Well, we will hit that when we get there.

130
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:09,620
However, on your, uh, on your first breaking point, when we did that, we had the idea that

131
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:14,540
you were going to have to put your life in danger to save others.

132
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:19,100
Basically you were going to throw yourself in harm's way to, to save others.

133
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:24,800
And if you didn't, then there would be a willpower disadvantage for you the next day that is

134
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:32,760
going to be subsumed by this next breaking point situation, which is when you roll sanity,

135
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:39,000
if you fail and the role would also fail on a power check, what's your power 60.

136
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:47,080
So if you roll on a sanity check and you roll over 60, then you are going to split into

137
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:51,080
a mind and a body at odds with each other.

138
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,720
Okay.

139
00:09:52,720 --> 00:10:00,120
And that is a, uh, a load of role-playing that I am heaping onto your very, uh, capable

140
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,120
talents.

141
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,120
All right.

142
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,120
I believe in you.

143
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:08,600
Let's remember that mechanic.

144
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:14,240
You walked into this room and it was filled with filing cabinets and my file was sitting

145
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,240
out open.

146
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:20,920
John Lee Pettymore IV's file was sitting out open on the table as was a file regarding

147
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,920
some people that ended up being Kevin.

148
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:29,440
As you were like getting up and looking around this room in your new body, you hear a voice

149
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,520
from behind you, Hey, Kevin, come on.

150
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,040
Marvin wants to talk to us.

151
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,120
So without saying anything, I just told up one finger, like, wait a second.

152
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:44,040
And I want to real quick see if, um, I can find a file for Clark and Keith.

153
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,040
Okay.

154
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,880
Go ahead and roll search for me.

155
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,880
35.

156
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,920
Uh, let's see what my search is.

157
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,920
50.

158
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,920
All right.

159
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,920
Then you were good.

160
00:10:54,920 --> 00:11:00,560
And actually, um, in your new body, we're going to up your hit points and willpower

161
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,840
all the way to full full for a John Lee Pettymore full for John Lee Pettymore.

162
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,840
Okay.

163
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,800
We're going to keep all your mix.

164
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,800
Yeah.

165
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,800
All your takes after his dad.

166
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,800
Yeah, exactly.

167
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,640
Ooh, that puts me up to 20 hit points and 12 willpower.

168
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,640
Okay.

169
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,960
So yeah, I passed the search rule.

170
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:21,160
So you open this most reflective file cabinet and it just so happens to have three file

171
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,400
names that catch your eye.

172
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:28,360
One says Clark Bishop and it is completely empty.

173
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:33,260
Another says Keith Vigna and it too is completely empty.

174
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:39,320
Both of these file folders are, they're like extremely crisp and new.

175
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:45,800
Then like the third folder you find titled the contention PD, which is so worn, it is

176
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:50,120
turned a noticeably different color, uh, opening it.

177
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:57,520
You see a lot of recent news stories, file clippings, uh, newspaper clippings that are

178
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:04,600
cut out and put into this folder and they all have to do with the police force and whether

179
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:10,480
or not you guys weren't handling missing persons cases or you were firing weapons into

180
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,920
the air in public or you were harassing citizens.

181
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:19,840
There are plenty of news articles written about the contention PD that have come out

182
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:25,600
in the past three or four days that have been grouped into this folder.

183
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:33,640
Uh, John Lee Pettymore, the third and fourth letters of fake news, um, and, and stashes

184
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,080
the file back where he found it and follows Rosemary.

185
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:43,480
So you guys go out the hallway into the elevator and I want to, I want to try out Kevin, like

186
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,720
some spy craft as Kevin.

187
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:50,080
So I'm just going to be like, uh, how you doing Rosemary?

188
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:56,440
Well, uh, everything's going exactly as planned, so pretty fucking good Kevin.

189
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,680
That's that's great.

190
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,560
It's not out of character for me to ask you how you're doing, is it?

191
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,840
I mean, we haven't chatted like this in years, but well, it's a good day.

192
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,840
Everything's going as planned.

193
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,840
Yeah.

194
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,840
I wasn't going to question it.

195
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,840
What part of the plan are we at?

196
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,840
What do you mean?

197
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,320
Where are you on your part of the plan?

198
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,880
I know where I am, but what have you, what have you accomplished?

199
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:19,000
Well, I think that's why we're, uh, I think that's why we're going to see Marvin for us.

200
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,480
He's probably going to send us to go collect the money now.

201
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,480
Great.

202
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,480
Perfect.

203
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,480
Yeah.

204
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,760
So you guys make it to the top of the, uh, elevator ride and the door opens and there's

205
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:34,960
a long hallway and at the end of the hallway, there is a 10 by 10 slab of black marble and

206
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:41,020
four guards, two on either side of the enormous and strange door that slowly slides open as

207
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,020
you approach.

208
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:47,240
And the guards are in full brown jumpsuits and they each have a large scythe strapped

209
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,240
to their backs.

210
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,280
And the blade of each scythe is shaped like an enormous fish hook.

211
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:56,800
A closer look reveals these men have unnatural matching faces.

212
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:00,200
Their eyes are far apart, almost on either side of their face.

213
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:05,400
Their noses do not jut out, but are rather two slits above their two wide thick lipped

214
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,480
mouths.

215
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,920
And they have a few flaps on either side of their necks.

216
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,920
Fish man.

217
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,920
Walking into this.

218
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,320
I knew it.

219
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,320
This whole time.

220
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,320
I knew it.

221
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,320
It was the fish.

222
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,320
All right.

223
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:23,880
When you walk into this room, you see it's the size of a basketball court to your left.

224
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,880
One of the long walls is entirely made of glass.

225
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:32,640
And there is murky greenish water on the other side, like an aquarium, but it's of staggering

226
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,640
proportions.

227
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:40,200
Marvin Glass is standing behind a table, arms folded behind his back, staring off into the

228
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,200
distance.

229
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:45,560
And again, he is just massive and gaunt all at the same time.

230
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:49,240
And he is still wearing that fitted black tuxedo that you've seen him before.

231
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:56,160
And when you turn, you see his weird hole in his face where his mouth should be is still

232
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,320
just covered in this circle of red lipstick.

233
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,360
And that hole begins moving.

234
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,440
Hello, Kevin.

235
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,920
Hello, Rosemary.

236
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,920
And Nod.

237
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:12,320
You have been doing excellent work for me recently.

238
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:21,160
And we are moving into the final phase of contentions demolition.

239
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:25,360
I need the two of you to go retrieve.

240
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:31,520
And as he's saying this, you notice that behind them, there are these windows and you see

241
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:35,600
lights, just like crazy lights, just like shining in and off.

242
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,680
It looks like there's something happening in that room behind him, but you can't quite

243
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,680
tell what it is.

244
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:46,960
Whatever it is, there's a lot of movement with the lights and it's getting out of control

245
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,960
back there.

246
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,960
Kevin, thanks.

247
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:53,560
I'll probably hear that in another episode.

248
00:15:53,560 --> 00:16:02,140
Looking around the room, you see that on Marvin's desk, there is one of those small silver spheres

249
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:08,520
sitting on like a little tripod holder that's holding it up.

250
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:13,800
That's awesome because I knew he had one from the tape and now I don't have to go looking

251
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,800
for it.

252
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,800
It's right there.

253
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,840
You can see it.

254
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:23,840
And he continues on saying the money, as Rosemary said, and Rosemary cuts in.

255
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:33,780
Yeah, let's see, there's $5 million in the police station and then there's $5 million

256
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:38,240
at the house of one of the police officers.

257
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,960
That is extremely good work, Rosemary.

258
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:47,800
I just have one request on your way to contention.

259
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:53,600
I need you to go check in on a new venture I've begun.

260
00:16:53,600 --> 00:17:01,640
You see, Stan Manstein, his daughter's funeral is today.

261
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:08,680
I believe it begins rather shortly and he will be out in the world for the first time

262
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,540
in a very long time.

263
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:19,720
I have sent your new Charles, Keith Vigna, one of the officers from the contention police

264
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:26,080
department, to go bring Stan Manstein back to me.

265
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:34,720
Rosemary and Kevin, I need you to go make sure that our new family member completes

266
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,320
his job.

267
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,880
Not again.

268
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:41,880
Kevin thinks it's very appropriate that Vigna is the new Charles considering he killed the

269
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,880
first one.

270
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,320
Oh shit, I didn't even think about that.

271
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,320
That's so good.

272
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:52,920
He's like, that's justice for Keith in some small measure.

273
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:57,400
While we're all still in front of Marvin Glass, I want to clear my throat.

274
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:01,000
He turns quickly and looks at you.

275
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:10,140
I heard Rosemary brought the gun instead of the money we're going to get.

276
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:12,040
Why'd you do that, Rosemary?

277
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:19,120
They both look at you and Rosemary turns and starts laughing.

278
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,480
I know I'm not very quick, but...

279
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:26,480
And she looks at Marvin and she's like, that's why we don't trust old Kevin here with making

280
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,360
the plans, huh, sir?

281
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,920
And Marvin laughs.

282
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:43,440
I guess so.

283
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:48,520
My attempt to shame Rosemary in front of Marvin has failed miserably.

284
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:56,720
I was really trying to sow some division, but nope.

285
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,720
I think you did great.

286
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:03,560
So he kind of, with a flick of his hand, waves you off and the door moves back out of the

287
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:10,640
way and you guys take the elevator back up to the top after loading up with some heavy

288
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,080
artillery, I would assume.

289
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:18,480
Rosemary, you know I'm because of what they've done to my brain.

290
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,680
I don't remember the plans too well.

291
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,680
Why did you get the gun instead of the money?

292
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:29,560
Well, okay, well, I already got in a shootout with those police officers and they did not

293
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,560
stop.

294
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:34,200
Like, I thought for sure that they were going to keep going until they just blew my brains

295
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,320
onto the concrete.

296
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,340
And I don't trust them to have not stopped the second time.

297
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:44,300
And so I obviously not wanting to get shot, I hate getting shot.

298
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,940
You know, I hate getting shot.

299
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:49,380
So I, you know, just figured that was the easiest way.

300
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:55,060
Kevin grunts, but John Lee Pettymore or the thing that was John Lee Pettymore is pretty

301
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,940
pleased that she was like actually intimate.

302
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:01,340
Like we were something of a force to be reckoned with at least.

303
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:02,340
Right.

304
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,340
Yeah.

305
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,340
Some sort of fry.

306
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:08,660
We, yeah, we made some small impact in her plans.

307
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:14,460
So as you guys, uh, the elevator opens and then all of a sudden you are just standing

308
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:21,580
in an alleyway in the city and the sun is shining in kind of bright from the, from a

309
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:30,080
low angle and there's fog in this alleyway and you look over and you see a group of raucous,

310
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:35,200
like rowdy people, like people that you wouldn't expect at 10 AM, but maybe in the city that's

311
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,320
more normal.

312
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:40,960
There's at least 12 of them and they all walk up to this, uh, this alleyway that you're

313
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:47,740
in and there's a large grate on the ground and they all stand on it and they all hold

314
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:53,600
up their dirty dog key fobs at the same time and the grate seems to disappear and they

315
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,640
all just fall straight down into it.

316
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,980
Interesting.

317
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:01,600
These dirty dog passes, they're like the key chains that John Peter said.

318
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,600
Yeah.

319
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,600
Okay.

320
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,120
And that's sitting in lockup, evidence lockup most likely.

321
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,120
Cool.

322
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:15,200
Turning away from that, Rosemary clicks the beeper on her white Toyota and the two of

323
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:20,640
you hop in and begin making your way to the city cemetery.

324
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:37,080
Luke, after leaving this meeting with Marvin Glass, you head back down the hallway into

325
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:43,680
the elevator that you came in on and you ride up to the top and it leads you back to the

326
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:50,840
parking garage that you drove into when you came with your partners and Doug Jacobs and

327
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:53,600
the body of agent Trent Chad and Rosemary.

328
00:21:53,600 --> 00:22:00,200
And when you arrive up there, there are still the same guards up there wearing suits and

329
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:07,440
earpieces and your police cruiser from contention is also sitting exactly where it was before.

330
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,560
Do I see any of my friends?

331
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,880
No, you do not.

332
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,160
I go over to the car and I get in.

333
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:18,400
When you get into the car, you see that you had actually left your cell phone in here

334
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,400
this whole time.

335
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:28,880
I believe you're wearing a boat shoes and shoes, the oversized shorts that are teal.

336
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:37,500
I think some sort of way too tight orange polo, so you look great and you get back into

337
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:42,120
your cruiser and when you look at your cell phone, you see that you have a bunch of missed

338
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,800
calls and a voicemail from Drew Andrews.

339
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:48,200
Okay, I listen to the voicemail.

340
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:55,120
Oh, fuck, Keith, Keith, Keith, you got to get somebody, somebody please answer somebody

341
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,120
you guys.

342
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,120
Oh, fuck everybody.

343
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,400
It's everywhere now.

344
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,620
You have to tell everyone, everyone, please, please, you have to get as far away.

345
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:05,440
You have to get as far away as possible from here.

346
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,520
It's growing.

347
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,360
It's growing.

348
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:13,460
I want to call Drew.

349
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:16,120
When you call Drew, it goes straight to voicemail.

350
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,120
Fuck.

351
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:25,680
My first reaction is to drive back to contention, but he also said get away, but I got to go

352
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,680
save Drew.

353
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,680
Okay.

354
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,920
Oh, do I have the camera with me?

355
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:36,300
No, when you look inside the police cruiser, you find that it has been stripped of many

356
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,580
of the items that you came here with.

357
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:39,580
Okay.

358
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:41,420
And then what did we, who is the gun?

359
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,540
The gun's gone.

360
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:44,100
The gun is gone for sure.

361
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,100
Yeah.

362
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,100
Okay.

363
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:52,340
You've got some guns left, but not the gun, the tubed gun, not the tubed gun and the camera's

364
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,340
gone.

365
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:54,340
The camera's gone.

366
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,660
The body armor's all gone.

367
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:56,660
Okay.

368
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:57,660
Yeah.

369
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:58,660
You're just left with a couple of guns.

370
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:03,060
And then Marvin actually gave you your small, powerful gun.

371
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,060
When is this funeral?

372
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,540
Oh, it starts in like half a night.

373
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:08,260
You've just enough time to like make it there.

374
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,260
Okay.

375
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:14,220
I guess hopefully Drew calls me back or something, but I guess gonna head to this funeral if

376
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:17,100
I have just enough time, I guess I can't go get my dress clothes on.

377
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:20,500
So I'm going to be dressed for a different occasion, but.

378
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,500
Styling.

379
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,500
Yeah.

380
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,500
Maybe stand out like a sore thumb.

381
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,500
Maybe not.

382
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,500
We'll see.

383
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:31,020
So you, uh, you drive to the city cemetery and I don't know if Keith has been here before,

384
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:33,220
but the city cemetery is all.

385
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:34,740
Oh, it is in the city.

386
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:35,740
It is in the city.

387
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:36,740
Yeah.

388
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:37,740
And it's all above ground.

389
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,620
Oh, like a new Orleans style.

390
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:40,620
Exactly.

391
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:45,860
So there are, as you drive up, you park and then there are countless tombs winding aimlessly

392
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:49,420
about creating all these odd little pathways.

393
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:53,900
The mausoleums are just tall enough to look down on you as you pass through.

394
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:58,660
And the morning fog adds an extra layer of disorientation.

395
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:06,900
I'm kind of wandering through trying to find people and then I get a whiff of, is that,

396
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:10,700
it smells like a crawfish boil.

397
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:14,420
And I head to where the smell is coming from.

398
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:20,380
And as you head to, as you follow your nose, you find that in a small clearing, there is

399
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:26,700
a funeral service set up for Ari Manstein surrounded by these ornate and menacing graves.

400
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:33,220
There are a handful of rows of chairs, all facing a small podium next to a coffin.

401
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:37,820
And I'm going to hold up this whiteboard here and show you.

402
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:39,060
Okay.

403
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:40,580
Where would you like to...

404
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,020
Are those seats?

405
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:44,060
Yeah, the circles are seats.

406
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:49,420
I want to go to the very front row on the very middle.

407
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,420
Okay.

408
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:52,700
You head toward the front row.

409
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:55,020
Where's the crawfish boil pot at?

410
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,020
It is...

411
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:58,180
It's actually right in front of the coffin.

412
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,180
Okay, cool.

413
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,860
So once it's all done, I'll...

414
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:01,860
You want to be first in line.

415
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:02,860
I want to be first in line.

416
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:03,860
Absolutely.

417
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:10,420
And as you walk up there, Jan Manstein, the mother of Ari Manstein walks towards you to

418
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,420
greet you.

419
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:12,420
Oh my goodness.

420
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:15,300
Oh, I just, I didn't think you would come or maybe I did.

421
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:19,140
I thought maybe there was a chance that you weren't going to come, but you know, last

422
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:23,620
minute and then I don't know where your partners are, but this is just, I couldn't be any happier

423
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:28,540
or sadder technically, I guess I am at my daughter's funeral, but thank you.

424
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:29,540
Yeah, I wouldn't miss it.

425
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:33,060
The other police officers send their condolences.

426
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:37,060
They're a bit incapacitated right now though, but I wouldn't miss it for the world.

427
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:43,820
And she moves on flitting about to many of the other funeral attendees and you take a

428
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:45,260
seat in the front row.

429
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:45,780
Okay.

430
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:57,620
All right, yeah, I'm good.

431
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:58,620
Yeah, you are.

432
00:26:58,620 --> 00:26:59,620
One of the best, they all say.

433
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:02,340
That's what literally everyone has agreed on.

434
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:07,380
We all came together, put our thumb on the thing, showed that we pledged our allegiance

435
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,380
to you.

436
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:09,380
I appreciate it.

437
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:10,380
Thank you.

438
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,380
Thank you everyone.

439
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:23,260
Clark, you just came to, on this table in the middle of this odd dungeon style room

440
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:33,420
and you are looking at chief Maggie cook or Maggie cook now, and she backs away from you

441
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,420
pretty quickly.

442
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:41,220
As soon as the weird squamous, like worm like creature with the mouths is back in the ground,

443
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:44,300
she steps back and she looks at you and she's, Oh, okay.

444
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,300
I didn't expect that.

445
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,300
Um, all right.

446
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:53,020
So Clark, you, um, are you, how you.

447
00:27:53,020 --> 00:28:00,740
When you came back, I know we went over this, but how, how was it that you are still alive?

448
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:04,380
I mean, your, your guess is as good as mine.

449
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:06,060
In fact, I would hope it'd be better.

450
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,060
Okay.

451
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:10,580
Well I'll, I'll keep thinking on it and I'll let you know what I come to, but for now you

452
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:11,620
need to get going.

453
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:17,300
So basically as soon as you're finished up, you can do pretty much whatever.

454
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,180
You can head back to contention.

455
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:20,300
You can hang out in the city.

456
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:25,540
We'll put you up here if you'd rather stick around and be close, but this job isn't a

457
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:28,780
daily situation or it won't be at first.

458
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:34,460
We'll get you trained up and, uh, working more and more often, but for now you can pretty

459
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:40,340
much go back to contention, get your affairs in order and, uh, pack up everything because

460
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:43,180
your life there, it doesn't, doesn't have to stay there.

461
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,380
You can, you can move here.

462
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:49,140
You can, you can move wherever you need to be and, uh, and we'll, we'll stay in contact

463
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,500
with you either way.

464
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,220
You said it's not a daily thing.

465
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:59,780
I mean, the thing I saw, it, it, it shook me to my core, Maggie, I'll make it a daily

466
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:00,780
thing.

467
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,780
Let's, let's stop it.

468
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:02,780
Let's make it not be.

469
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:03,780
All right.

470
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:04,780
All right, Clark.

471
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:05,780
I like your passion.

472
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:06,780
I like your fire.

473
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:10,540
This is exactly what we need in this organization right now is fire.

474
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,740
All right.

475
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:18,180
So take this and she pulls a burner phone out of her pocket and she hands it to you.

476
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:20,420
Take this and I'll be in contact with you.

477
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:23,340
I'll, I'll, I'll hit you up tomorrow and I'll make sure that we get going.

478
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,340
All right.

479
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:28,900
Hey, hey Maggie, do you know anything about my partners?

480
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:32,020
No, no I don't.

481
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:35,380
They dropped off the radar about when you did.

482
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:39,140
So I have no idea what they're up to.

483
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:45,260
If they're, uh, if they're still with us and I had the opportunity, would you be willing

484
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:47,580
to take them into the circle with us?

485
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:48,580
Do you think they're ready?

486
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:51,300
I mean, they've seen the same things I have.

487
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,300
Yeah, but are they ready?

488
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:55,700
I don't know Maggie.

489
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,900
Will you be the judge of that?

490
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:58,900
Let me know.

491
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:04,700
All right, Clark, you being a part of this, that means I trust you.

492
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:07,620
We're going to rely on each other a whole lot moving forward.

493
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:10,580
So if you say they're ready, then I believe you.

494
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:11,580
All right.

495
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:17,460
I, I, I thank you Maggie and I hope you know that I've always, always trusted you.

496
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:24,980
I wouldn't have, I wouldn't have stuck around in that, that, that dead end job.

497
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:30,620
Well Clark, you're not at a, well, I guess you are still in a bit of a dead end job.

498
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:34,300
If poor choice of words, Maggie, at the end, we're all going to be dead.

499
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:37,340
So in order for that not to happen, let's get you moving.

500
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:38,340
All right.

501
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:43,020
And so she leads you back up top, back into the parking lot of the mill and sets you up

502
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,220
with a car.

503
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:49,900
It's a little silver Honda Accord and she hands you the keys.

504
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:57,220
What gear did you decide to bring from the, from the room that we were just in?

505
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:59,940
That room that spawned anything and everything that I would ever need.

506
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:00,940
Of course.

507
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:01,940
Yeah.

508
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:02,940
What'd you pick up?

509
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:06,060
All a news, a gun.

510
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:09,300
You guys have all those old contention police department uniforms in there.

511
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:12,220
I went ahead and got my old uni, an old uniform of mine.

512
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:13,220
Amazing.

513
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:15,140
I'm afraid in it still.

514
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:20,060
And uh, Oh, you got any of those, uh, Leon gave me this gun that shot these tranquilizer

515
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:22,860
darts that made people do things.

516
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:24,100
You got any of those left?

517
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,100
You know what?

518
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,380
Uh, we are actually out of that serum right now.

519
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:31,900
We just used the last of it to make sure we could get the federal Bureau of investigation

520
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:32,900
on our side.

521
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,920
We thought that might be quite important.

522
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:40,260
Do you have any leftover from when you were doing that or I believe, uh, the glass family

523
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:42,140
now possesses that item.

524
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:43,140
The glass family.

525
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:44,140
Oh boy.

526
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:45,140
Okay.

527
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:51,220
Well then this thing is a bit more convoluted than I, Hey Maggie, can I know why I'm killing

528
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,220
Stan?

529
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:53,220
Yeah.

530
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,220
He needs to die.

531
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:55,220
Okay.

532
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:57,500
Is that good enough for you right now?

533
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,640
I guess it's going to have to be.

534
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:03,020
And she turns around and walks back to the mill.

535
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,020
Cool.

536
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:05,020
Cool.

537
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,020
Cool.

538
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:11,260
So, uh, you hop in the car and you're heading off to the city cemetery and the car is actually

539
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:12,380
low on gas.

540
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:16,460
So you have to stop and fill it up on the way over there.

541
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:21,180
And while you're filling it up, I need you to roll an alertness check for me.

542
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:23,380
Ooh boy.

543
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:25,500
I pass a 32 on a 70.

544
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:32,340
So you feel this movement behind you as you're filling up this car, your car now, and you

545
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:38,740
turn around just in time to see that something has been dropped into the passenger seat of

546
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:46,860
your car from a woman who is now 10, 15 yards away and is running away from you.

547
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:48,860
Can I get any sense of who she is?

548
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:50,260
Any chance I've seen her before?

549
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,260
Just from the back.

550
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:54,420
It is an average build woman with dark hair.

551
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:57,880
I'm peeking in through my, the window I'm closest to, to see what's been dropped.

552
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:00,620
It looks like a cell phone.

553
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:02,620
Huh.

554
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:05,020
I go around and pick it up.

555
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:09,880
You walk around the car, open the door, pick up the cell phone and the cell phone immediately

556
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,940
buzzes with a text message.

557
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:18,940
And it says, do you want to know why your parents were killed?

558
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:21,940
Joe just made the funniest face.

559
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:28,260
It was like a, Ooh, mixed with like a what?

560
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:32,740
Uh, boy, I don't know.

561
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:39,180
I, uh, first of all, before I reply to anything, I want to do a, just a quick little look through

562
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,300
the menus on this phone.

563
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,460
Do I see anything else?

564
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:45,240
Old text messages, a sign of a phone number anywhere, contacts.

565
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:49,540
Looks like this phone is completely blank except for this one text that is now in your

566
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:50,540
inbox.

567
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:52,060
I just reply, who is this?

568
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,060
Okay.

569
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:58,360
And then you hop back in the car and head back on your way to the city cemetery.

570
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:03,880
And when you arrive, uh, I don't know if Clark has been to the city cemetery before, but

571
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:07,160
it is all above ground mausoleums and such.

572
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,160
Exactly.

573
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:14,400
So you pull up to a parking lot and then you walk in to the city cemetery underneath this

574
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:20,760
big gate that like old like iron rot that kind of spells city cemetery in the gate and

575
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:27,820
you walk through and you're now in these windy, endless seeming walkways that you're surrounded

576
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:32,960
by these tall tombs and mausoleums on either side that are looking down on you and it's

577
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,660
morning and there's fog all through.

578
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:36,660
Cool.

579
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:37,660
Yeah.

580
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:47,620
And, uh, eventually you, um, you smell this, um, fishy scent, this seafood scent of some

581
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:48,620
sort.

582
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:53,820
It smells almost like a, like a new Orleans party in the cemetery and you follow your

583
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:57,020
nose to a small clearing.

584
00:34:57,020 --> 00:35:05,260
And my feet lift up off the ground and I float.

585
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:10,260
And as you approach, you can see that there in the distance, uh, there's a small clearing

586
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:16,380
and inside the clearing there's a funeral service set up for Ari Manstein, a handful

587
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:22,060
of rows of chairs and they're all facing a podium next to a coffin.

588
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:26,220
And you can probably see from where you're at, you're far enough away to where no one's

589
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:30,600
really paying attention to you so far, but looking in and you see Jan Manstein, the mother

590
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:36,260
of Ari and you see Keith Vigna and he is wearing Sperry's boat shoes.

591
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:42,620
I believe a blue coral shorts that are very small or big.

592
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:45,540
I can't quite remember.

593
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:47,260
And then I think they're too big.

594
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:48,260
That would make sense.

595
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:53,140
And then a, uh, like an orange polo that is extremely tight.

596
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:55,100
I don't know necessarily.

597
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:58,340
You don't know why he's wearing that, but that is what he's wearing.

598
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:01,800
How's he looking physically like in the face and maybe even his hair.

599
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:07,300
He looks pretty good from the, from a distance, you know, you can't really see, but you were

600
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:10,900
in the cage when you watched him die.

601
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:15,540
So this might be a confusing sight for old Clark Bishop.

602
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:19,380
Then again, you've been through some stuff.

603
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:26,680
You yourself perhaps might have an inkling that it's easier than you thought to come

604
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,060
back from the other side.

605
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,060
Who knows?

606
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:30,060
Oh, this makes sense.

607
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:32,100
So basically this is the setup.

608
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:37,540
I'm holding up a whiteboard with the setup and Keith is on the front row in front of

609
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:38,540
the coffin.

610
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:44,920
Uh, in front of the coffin, there is a crawfish crawdad boil going on, which is causing the

611
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:49,680
scent to be overwhelming in this area.

612
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:53,240
Is that as weird to Clark as it is to Joe?

613
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,280
It's as weird to you as it is to me.

614
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,280
Okay.

615
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,280
Yep.

616
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,280
Good.

617
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,420
I didn't know if that was a tradition that you knew about that I don't.

618
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:06,360
It's the classic city ritual that everyone knows about.

619
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:10,040
It was in your, uh, it was in your package that you were supposed to read before you

620
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,040
came in today.

621
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,040
Yeah.

622
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,040
Uh, Zach, it was a hundred pages.

623
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,600
I wasn't going to do that.

624
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,040
I just want you to be prepared.

625
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:22,040
So basically I, I, I need you to pick a spot to set up a where you're going to be.

626
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,100
You can, you know, so is there a crowd?

627
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,100
There is a crowd.

628
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,100
There is a crowd.

629
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,280
Do I see Stan?

630
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,280
You don't.

631
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,400
I'm going to not sit.

632
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,360
I'm going to stand toward the back of the chairs.

633
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,360
Okay.

634
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:35,840
You know, in a movie when the guy goes to the funeral that doesn't want to be seen at

635
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:40,400
the funeral and he's kind of amongst the trees, but he's not, he's not hiding per se.

636
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,400
Sure.

637
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,400
That's what I'm doing.

638
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,620
So you're amongst the trees, but there are no trees.

639
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:50,260
So are you in the back in open sight of everyone or are you going to kind of creep behind some,

640
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:52,760
some like one of the tombs that's nearby?

641
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:57,880
You could probably like hide behind a column or just like stand up against the column.

642
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:01,680
I don't want to be conspicuous enough that if somebody saw me, they would say, why is

643
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,780
that guy hiding?

644
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:06,080
So maybe more like just blending casually.

645
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:09,200
Maybe I'm leaning against a monosmoselium nearby.

646
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,200
Love it.

647
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,200
Yeah.

648
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,200
Nothing respects the dead like leaning on them.

649
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Of course.

650
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Okay.

651
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Is my other partner there?

652
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,160
Do I see John Lee Pettymore with Keith?

653
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,800
You do not see John Lee Pettymore there.

654
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,800
Oh, okay.

655
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,520
Oh, they thought of me.

656
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:46,000
So John Lee Pettymore, the third and fourth and Kevin and Kevin, you are, you are on the

657
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,240
way to the city cemetery in the car with Rosemary.

658
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:59,040
And as you're driving there, she says, I, uh, I didn't, I didn't know that Charles was

659
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,760
dead until Marvin said that we'd replaced him.

660
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:10,080
And then I just looked it up on my phone and I saw that he, he died in contention.

661
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:14,840
And I know that the officers, the police there, they told me that they killed him, but I didn't

662
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:15,840
know.

663
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,280
I didn't know that they were serious.

664
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,160
I thought they might've been lying to try to get me to talk or something.

665
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:27,800
I didn't, I just didn't know that he was going to actually die.

666
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:32,120
I didn't know that you cared for nobody but yourself and the glass boy.

667
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:38,320
Oh, it's just, you know, he had the same, he had the same modifications done.

668
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:43,440
So I just thought that, you know, we were a little bit more robust than that.

669
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,440
Is that where are you?

670
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:49,000
I'm not that philosophical Rosemary, but okay.

671
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:53,200
I don't, I was trying to just suss out, but like how articulate was Kevin?

672
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,920
So you guys actually never heard him talk.

673
00:39:54,920 --> 00:40:02,080
I would imagine that a guy like that is quite broken, but still easily like you can communicate

674
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,160
easily.

675
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:07,240
I would imagine you're not going to keep him around if he's just a dog on a leash basically.

676
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:13,480
So he, I think he's far more far more eloquent than even say Rosemary, you know, cause she's,

677
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:17,480
she's when you're, when you're right next to her, you see that she's got some scars

678
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:20,320
on her as well and she's able to keep up.

679
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,320
Got cool.

680
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,800
So she has had the same shit done, but yeah.

681
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,800
Gotcha.

682
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,800
Okay.

683
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,800
All right.

684
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,800
Hold on.

685
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,640
John, John Lee Pettimore talks like this and then you fuck up his body and his mind

686
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:32,280
and you put a bunch of years on it.

687
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:43,600
Rosemary, I'm not that philosophical, but did you think we, we couldn't die?

688
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,360
Everything dies.

689
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:51,520
And you guys pull up to the city cemetery and the city cemetery is all above ground.

690
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,520
Like New Orleans.

691
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,520
Exactly.

692
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:58,540
So you pull into a parking lot and the two of you begin walking through all these different

693
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:04,420
mausoleums and these little pathways that are winding endlessly to and fro about.

694
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:09,640
And it's morning and the sun's coming in at a low angle on this fog that is perpetuating

695
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:12,680
all throughout this entire cemetery.

696
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:19,340
As you're walking through you, you smell this like nice seafood, like crawfish, like scent,

697
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:20,340
like New Orleans.

698
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:22,100
It smells like New Orleans.

699
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:29,440
And following the scent, the two of you see from a distance, you hear a large group of

700
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:33,860
people and you see that there's a small clearing ahead where there's a funeral service set

701
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:36,460
up for Ari Manstein.

702
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:41,500
And it is surrounded by all these ornate and these, these menacing, these tall graves,

703
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:46,420
these tombs that are completely encasing this, this little clearing.

704
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:51,440
But inside there are a handful of rows of chairs that are all facing a small podium

705
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,720
next to a coffin.

706
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:56,080
And in front of the coffin is the crawfish boil.

707
00:41:56,080 --> 00:42:00,240
You see that there is a Keith Vigna sitting on the front row.

708
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,240
How does Keith look?

709
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,460
Has he been modified?

710
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:08,640
From where you are, you can't tell whether he has been quote modified, but you can see

711
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:16,200
that he has regained an eyeball and his jaw, that he has regained his eyeball and his jaw.

712
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,500
And so that is different.

713
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:23,900
And he's also wearing a very tight fitting orange polo, like bright orange polo and these

714
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:27,980
massive coral shorts.

715
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:29,540
What's Keith's bod like?

716
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:31,500
He's still wearing those big pants.

717
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:34,420
Yeah, you still got him.

718
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:36,780
What's he like under that tight, tight polo?

719
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:38,220
Stringy, I think.

720
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:39,220
Yeah.

721
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:40,220
Beanie.

722
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:41,220
Beanie.

723
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:47,100
He's got a lean muscle on him, you know, he's like a horse.

724
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:50,020
That seems like a high compliment.

725
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:52,140
He's like a stringy horse.

726
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:54,420
It's like a sick horse.

727
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:56,580
In a polo.

728
00:42:56,580 --> 00:43:00,100
I would love to see horses play polo.

729
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:02,620
Wait, on top of other horses?

730
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:05,900
No, that wouldn't work, but if they carried the sticks in their mouths.

731
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:09,620
I was picturing horses on people who are running.

732
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:14,220
It wouldn't work, Zach, but if you glued a stick to a horse's mouth and taught him to

733
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:15,220
whack a ball.

734
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:20,580
I think they would invent polo naturally.

735
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:24,220
It's probably the first game they come up with.

736
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:29,140
Anthropologists look at horse cultures and see if they've come up with polo to determine

737
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:30,700
how advanced they are.

738
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:31,700
Horsey culture.

739
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:33,500
See, you and Rosemary are looking for...

740
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:34,500
Horsey culture.

741
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:35,500
Did you see that Brony documentary?

742
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:36,500
Thankfully, no.

743
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:37,500
Don't you mean they?

744
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:38,500
Oh, no.

745
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:39,500
I'm sorry.

746
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:49,540
So, you see there are these handful of rows of chairs and Keith is up front.

747
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:52,660
He's sitting in the very front row in front of the coffin.

748
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:58,460
And as you continue to look around, go ahead and roll a search for me.

749
00:43:58,460 --> 00:43:59,980
84, fail.

750
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:07,960
You notice there are lots of people here for the funeral and in the back, leaning up against

751
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:11,520
one of the mausoleums is Clark Bishop.

752
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:18,640
He is wearing an old contention police uniform, like an older model of the contention police

753
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,680
department uniform.

754
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:23,440
And he is just leaning casually in the very back.

755
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:24,440
What do you want to do?

756
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:27,280
Oh, first of all, is Stan Manstein in attendance?

757
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:30,520
Stan Manstein is not in attendance currently.

758
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:35,440
So I say to Rosemary, looks like our new boy didn't get his job done.

759
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:38,520
I'm going to circle the perimeter and check things out.

760
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:43,940
And I want to make my way towards the so-called Clark Bishop in this old uniform.

761
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:45,600
Does he look natural?

762
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,800
Is his stance Clark's stance?

763
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,440
Yeah, absolutely.

764
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:50,440
It looks like Clark.

765
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:51,440
Do I still have?

766
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,440
No, John died in his underwear.

767
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,920
He didn't have a cell phone.

768
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:59,560
John died in his underwear.

769
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:01,720
Shot by his daddy.

770
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:03,240
Where do you want to set up?

771
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:08,200
Rosemary is like, I think I'm going to get some higher ground over here.

772
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:11,560
She is going to climb on top of one of the mausoleums.

773
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:15,280
And she's like, I'm just going to lay flat and watch.

774
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:16,900
That looks real dumb.

775
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:24,480
You look very conspicuous, but I've learned to trust your methods in our many years together.

776
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,480
Nailed it.

777
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:26,480
Convincing.

778
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:31,360
So yeah, I want to walk behind or just walk near and around that Clark Bishop.

779
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:36,880
I want to be kind of unseen and I want to cough bubblegum tree in the middle of a crowd

780
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:37,880
and see if he looks.

781
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:38,880
Okay.

782
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,480
Go ahead and roll stealth for me.

783
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:43,480
Yeah.

784
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:45,580
81.

785
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:46,580
My skill is 50.

786
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:47,580
Okay.

787
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:48,580
Yeah.

788
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:49,580
We don't even need a mirror.

789
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:52,880
I want to get behind just some people near him and kind of like play in the penis game

790
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,760
just like bubblegum tree, bubblegum tree.

791
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:55,760
Okay.

792
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:56,760
Yeah.

793
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:57,760
That's great.

794
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:58,760
Does he look?

795
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:02,000
I I'm should I go ask him?

796
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Maybe.

797
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Yeah.

798
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
All right.

799
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
I'll be right back.

800
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Okay.

801
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
All right, Joe.

802
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Hey there.

803
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Clark Bishop is leaning up against this mausoleum and from behind him, he hears bubblegum tree.

804
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:29,880
I whip around.

805
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:35,440
When you turn around, there's a crowd around standing around before the funeral service

806
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,080
actually begins.

807
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:42,360
And there are people both like in front of and to the side and behind you through the

808
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:45,040
small crowd behind you.

809
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:49,240
You notice a face that you recognize.

810
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:56,520
It's the face that you saw standing at the bar when you're in the cages hanging in that

811
00:46:56,520 --> 00:47:02,160
God forsaken room in Marvin Glass's place.

812
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:08,480
It is Kevin, the security guy, the one who was kind of unaffected by the scene.

813
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:09,480
Yes.

814
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:10,480
Gotcha.

815
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:11,480
I see him.

816
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:12,480
Does he see me?

817
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:13,480
Yeah.

818
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:14,480
He's staring straight at you.

819
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:19,200
I'm, I'm, uh, Oh fuck.

820
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:22,160
I'm looking to see if I, anybody I know is with him.

821
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:23,360
It doesn't look like it.

822
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:27,520
I look straight at Kevin bubble gum tree.

823
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:33,600
Kevin looks away and continues walking through the crowd.

824
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,120
Oh shit.

825
00:47:53,360 --> 00:48:22,000
Oh my, the only one trying to fool all, how can you have enough drowning out of the noise.
