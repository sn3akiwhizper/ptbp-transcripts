1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
Hello, and welcome y'all.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,360
It is December the 6th, and my clock here says

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:10,120
it is 1030 a.m. here in the city.

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,400
What time is it in your world?

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,440
What is time anyway?

6
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,560
Is it a circle or some shit?

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,820
Shit, I don't know, that's for sure.

8
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:23,820
Well, anyway, I'm coming at you live from 694.2 PTBP,

9
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,920
this dimension's best radio show

10
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,660
that is fueled by dumpster meat of varying quality.

11
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:36,200
I've got a howlin' with wolf here from an anonymous source.

12
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,280
Remember, if you wanna write up somethin'

13
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,120
for your wolf to howl, tag at PretendingPod

14
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,160
on Instagram or Twitter, tag PretendingToBePeople

15
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,600
on Facebook, or write a five-star review

16
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,320
and email us at pretendingpod at gmail.com.

17
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,280
This one is a bit unsettling, so no point in settlin' in.

18
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,840
We alone are the last of the line,

19
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,120
ascendant when the giants walked

20
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,600
and still clutching to power when the last ragged outpost

21
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,240
of our kind fell to internal ruin.

22
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,160
Our line will rule again.

23
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,280
There are secrets buried still,

24
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,680
lost in the deserts forgotten and places

25
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,720
where man cannot go.

26
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,700
Our illusion is perfect.

27
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:19,360
We walk unseen through the streets

28
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,280
in the child scrawl of the world before us,

29
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:27,200
and we resist the call to feed, the smells, the meat.

30
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,880
We resist, for there is clarity and starvation.

31
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,480
Just as in our disguises,

32
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,780
there is freedom among the savages,

33
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:38,920
and then in the desert where we buried our last machines,

34
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,760
there is salvation.

35
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,060
Well, fuck.

36
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,080
Once they started talkin' about meat,

37
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,920
I just kinda lost track there, y'all.

38
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:51,440
Anyway, things aren't any cleaner or clearer here in the city

39
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:55,800
It's uncertain, it's impure, it's the news.

40
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,640
Stan Manstein left the city asylum, a rare occurrence,

41
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,240
in order to speak at the funeral

42
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,680
of his daughter, Ari Manstein.

43
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,740
He was accompanied by three guards,

44
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:08,040
all made out of flesh and wire.

45
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,040
He spoke in a strange tongue,

46
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:13,440
and the world slowed down around our three officers

47
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,000
who heard Stan speak inside the heads,

48
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,400
tellin' the story of a particular past

49
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,480
of the town of contention.

50
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,880
Clark Bishop shot Stan Manstein mid-story,

51
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,600
bringin' the world up to speed

52
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,640
and causin' full-blown chaos at this funeral.

53
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,560
People began to run for their lives

54
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,880
as our obliviously intrepid heroes fought, shot,

55
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,520
and demolished the large guards made of blood and metal.

56
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:42,540
Keith Vigna plugged Stan Manstein's wounds with his fingers,

57
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:45,560
givin' him just enough strength to complete his story

58
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,040
and blip out of existence.

59
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,980
John Lee Pettymore IV,

60
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:52,680
inside the body of his adopted father,

61
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,600
John Lee Pettymore III,

62
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,680
who the officers met as Kevin,

63
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,740
Marvin Glass's head of security,

64
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:01,380
tried to explain that whole convoluted mess

65
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,920
to his former coworkers.

66
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,720
The officers took stock of their situation,

67
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,520
tryin' to remember where the weird items they'd found

68
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,220
are currently located.

69
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:15,720
Last we saw, John Lee Pettymore put his hands up to his head

70
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,240
and his eyes turned white.

71
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,560
Man, I tell you what,

72
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,840
I left contention because of all this weird nonsense,

73
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,140
but it seems to have followed me to the city.

74
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,800
Wolf.

75
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,400
Oh, no, Wolf.

76
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,240
What if you're the source of all this pain and sufferin'?

77
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,320
What if I am the sinner

78
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,520
from which all struggles emanate from

79
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,180
the pulsating heart of darkness?

80
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:44,080
Does it all come from little old Wolfie?

81
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,720
Uh, probably not.

82
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,040
I have a message here from my producer.

83
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,040
They say we are sitting at 84 reviews on iTunes.

84
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,800
That's about 16 reviews short of bein' real nice,

85
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:03,800
and 336 short of bein' real nice.

86
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,600
So we got a super special announcement in mind

87
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,920
for when we hit that 100 review mark.

88
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,480
You'll be happy, Wolf'll be happy,

89
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,000
and when Wolf is happy,

90
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,840
he claps his hands on the three and the four.

91
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:19,060
It's kazoo with no backbone.

92
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,680
No.

93
00:04:49,060 --> 00:05:00,940
John, as your eyes roll backward, your vision goes dark.

94
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:07,280
Images begin flashing through your mind, just snippets, moments, and you try to keep up.

95
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:15,780
As the speed of this sequence waxes and wanes, you see a motel safe, shiny, black, and closed.

96
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:22,540
You see the sign for Bean's Pond, the little pond behind Chief Maggie Cook's house in contention.

97
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,140
You see a television.

98
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:32,300
It is blinking with different letters on it, R, S, T, L, N, E. You see a small clearing

99
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:36,540
in the woods, and the ground is scorched.

100
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:43,180
In a dark room, lit by various electronics and machines, you see a massive, shiny metal

101
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:49,740
sphere, 20 feet tall, with silvery arms extending from either side.

102
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:54,500
A tube connects this gargantuan ball to a machine below.

103
00:05:54,500 --> 00:06:00,740
The machine begins whirring, and you see a small metal sphere, roughly one inch in diameter,

104
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:06,700
begin moving up through the tubing into the larger, armed version of itself.

105
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:11,700
As this happens, a vast circle opens up in the ceiling, and a disorienting amount of

106
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:17,420
light and sound pours into the room, revealing text painted on the back wall that says the

107
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:29,260
same thing you hear violently chanted by an unseen crowd, Planet Juggernaut.

108
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:34,780
The scene changes again, and you see Marvin Glass standing at his desk in the grand room

109
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:39,440
you recently stood in as Kevin, alongside Rosemary.

110
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:45,080
Marvin is holding the odd camera with glass tubes, closely inspecting it, tapping its

111
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,180
lit red luminaire.

112
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:55,000
On his desk are two file folders, splayed open, entitled, The Real Files on Clark Bishop

113
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:04,040
& Keith Vigna, Contention Police Officers, subtitled, Oh That Cunning Marvin Glass, subtitled,

114
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:11,720
Zach Was Being Lazy.

115
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:19,480
You can see in Keith's file are various clippings about the Beenz family, the tragic

116
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:25,440
accidental deaths of William and Lena, Keith's parents, the takeover of the family business

117
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,160
by Ferguson.

118
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:32,720
In Clark's file, there is a newspaper article about the murderer who killed Clark Bishop's

119
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,920
parents and love.

120
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:43,040
There is a mugshot of a woman smiling, a cold, vacant smile behind asymmetrical bangs covering

121
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,720
one of her eyes.

122
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:51,560
Written in Sharpie, underneath the mugshot, it says in all caps, Karen.

123
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:56,520
Your vision readjusts, and you are standing in the mid-morning sunlight near your partners,

124
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:03,160
Clark Bishop and Keith Vigna, in the wake of a funeral gone terribly awry.

125
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:06,160
That was, uh, that's one hell of an info dump.

126
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:12,040
Zach, you will be pleased to know that I already have, um, Am Love and Karen written down in

127
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,040
my notes.

128
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,040
Oh, yes please!

129
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:19,700
But I don't expect the listeners to remember all the fucking shit that happened to John

130
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,360
Lee Pettymore four or five episodes ago.

131
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,360
Sure.

132
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,360
Because I didn't.

133
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,920
Had to go back in and listen to that?

134
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:29,080
Had to listen to it again and wrote it all down on my phone.

135
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,080
Absolutely.

136
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,120
So, uh, with that I need you to lose ten luck.

137
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,960
Uh, let me find my character sheet.

138
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,960
Luck.

139
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,640
Okay, I'm at twenty luck now.

140
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,100
Down to twenty luck.

141
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,680
No longer able to survive if you die.

142
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,920
But I can avoid major damage and some other things.

143
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:48,160
Alrighty, let's get the other boys in the room and kick this thing off.

144
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,160
Let's do it.

145
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,160
Ramona.

146
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,160
Ramona.

147
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,160
Ramona.

148
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,160
Ramona.

149
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,160
Ramona.

150
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,160
Ramona.

151
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:55,760
Ramona.

152
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,260
Ramona.

153
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,080
Ramona.

154
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,700
Ramona.

155
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,860
Meow meow meow!

156
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:00,460
Ramona!

157
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:00,960
Woof!

158
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:12,800
Oh my goodness.

159
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:25,840
I think we can get him on the podcast.

160
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,640
He's probably dead.

161
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,240
I bet it's pretty easy to get the Numa Numa guy on the podcast if he's not dead.

162
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,720
What do you think he's up to these days?

163
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,600
He's either dead or he's making shitty podcast appearances.

164
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,840
He was a question on Ask Me Another a couple of weeks ago.

165
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,320
The Numa Numa guy was the answer?

166
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:42,680
Yeah.

167
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,080
Nice.

168
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,840
Did they accept the Numa Numa guy?

169
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,720
Was that the answer?

170
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,080
Or did they have to know his name or something?

171
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,920
Oh no, it was the Jimi.

172
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,160
You had to know Boris Fonks-Kold.

173
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:50,840
Yeah, right.

174
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,200
His name is actually Dr.

175
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,320
Carbuncle McPhee.

176
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,640
Little shout out to the Patreon listeners.

177
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,560
Yeah, last week.

178
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:01,920
Dr.

179
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,000
Carbohydrate Uncle.

180
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:10,080
On Monday, we released our second Patreon exclusive episode in which we played Everyone is John.

181
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:10,880
It was delightful.

182
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,560
It was a lot of fun.

183
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,600
It's where we all play John Peters in the moments before his death.

184
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,440
In the moments before he turns into a dog.

185
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,960
You try to save John Peters.

186
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,280
Let's play this dang old game.

187
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,800
I'm going to vape in the mic real quick.

188
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,160
Throwback to the old days.

189
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,640
Man, I wish you wouldn't do that.

190
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,240
We didn't even do that in the old days.

191
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,000
It's on, I think, the first episode.

192
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,440
Yeah, and you're instantly reprimanded.

193
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:49,880
Keith Vigna and Clark Bishop, you look over and the eyes that have rolled back into the back of John's head are now right back where eyes normally are.

194
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,320
And he looks at you with a startle.

195
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,840
John, what's going on?

196
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:55,840
A lot.

197
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:57,480
What?

198
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:57,920
Yeah.

199
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,280
Are you, are you with us?

200
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:06,280
All right, well, so boys, I don't know how to tell you, but I think I developed the second set.

201
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:12,680
At least I believe I developed the second site in my transition from John to Kevin.

202
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,600
What did you just see?

203
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:20,240
Perhaps I just unlocked something I always had within me, but I feel slightly less lucky.

204
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,320
And here's what I saw.

205
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:28,040
I saw, I saw a motel safe and hotel motel.

206
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,320
Oh, shit.

207
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,320
I saw Bean's pond behind Maggie's house.

208
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:43,240
I saw television blinking random letters, perhaps not so random, and I saw a small clearing in the woods where the ground was scorched.

209
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,320
I saw some other things, too.

210
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,880
Marvin Glass has the camera.

211
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,880
It's currently in his possession.

212
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:01,160
What else I saw was perhaps too terrible to repeat right now.

213
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:08,040
I know what you saw, the lockbox, the safe at hotel motel.

214
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:08,760
Yeah.

215
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:13,280
I have, I have my brother's watch in there.

216
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:25,120
I got it after his unfortunate demise, but I put it on and some real weird shit happened.

217
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,720
I felt like I was like on an alternate plane while I had it on and I knew I had to take it off.

218
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:36,400
I know it means something, but I, I couldn't have it on my body cause it was just doing some fucked up shit.

219
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:40,160
So I threw it in my safe in my hotel motel room.

220
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,520
Keith, can you describe that alternate plane?

221
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,480
Was it as though the ground were made of light?

222
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:53,320
No, I just, I, it's not that it took me physically somewhere else.

223
00:12:53,320 --> 00:13:00,560
I was still in contention or around there, but in my mind I was seeing different stuff.

224
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:08,000
It was hard to decipher what was real and what I was seeing, but I knew it was something, it just felt evil.

225
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,760
And I had to throw it in that safe cause I thought the longer I had it on the weirdest shit was going to happen.

226
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:19,200
And I it's, it means something I'm sure, but we'll, we'll have to go check that out.

227
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,760
And I think with the three of us together, cause I was by myself when I had it on.

228
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:29,400
So I think had I had it on just by myself for a while, I might've gone insane or something.

229
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,520
That, uh, that watch didn't have tubes like all of our other objects.

230
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:37,560
No, it's just a, just looks like a nice, like gold Rolex watch.

231
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,040
Does being spawn mean anything to y'all?

232
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:47,360
I mean, it's at behind Maggie's house and yeah, I just, I believe I have the second side.

233
00:13:48,240 --> 00:14:01,200
And when I thought about the objects, these are the things I saw and I saw Marvin glass with the camera, but then I don't know, it sounds like Keith's describing an object of, of power that he put in that safe.

234
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,240
What can be in these other places?

235
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:09,560
The, uh, those letters on the television, did you, uh, you have to remember them?

236
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:17,080
I do R S T N L N E.

237
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:21,800
What were you saying that right or wrong?

238
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:35,520
Cause I said S and you said L, but I have a T there's an L in there though in there after the T I know, I know what those are.

239
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,360
John and Keith, you even might know what those are.

240
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,680
R S T L N E.

241
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:43,200
Well, that's the wheel of fortune letters.

242
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:43,960
Exactly.

243
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:49,360
They're the letters they give you at the end of wheel of fortune, but that's, that's not all fellas.

244
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:52,960
Yeah.

245
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:55,440
Wow.

246
00:14:55,520 --> 00:15:06,120
I never would have imagined when I, uh, fellas, when I came to, I, uh, well, Keith, you don't, Keith, I got to show you something.

247
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,240
Clark pulls up his shirt and shows Keith.

248
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:08,960
Holy shit.

249
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:09,360
All right.

250
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:10,720
Keith.

251
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:22,440
When Clark lifts up his shirt, you see that there is a hole in Clark's chest as if his body has been gauged like an earlobe.

252
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,120
So it's kind of healed over through.

253
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:29,080
Can I see all the way through skin tunnel leading you through his body.

254
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:38,800
When I woke up with this, I had a, I had a bag with me and there was, there was, well, I, what I think is my heart.

255
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:45,840
In the bag with ice, but next to it was another bag and it had those letters in it.

256
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,000
That's fucked up, man.

257
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:52,280
It's somebody who knew that I watched wheel of fortune every night.

258
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:55,480
Well, okay.

259
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,920
Well, that looks all right.

260
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:04,560
So one thing I also saw, uh, Marvin glass knows a lot more about us than we might've originally suspected.

261
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,640
Um, he knows a lot.

262
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,520
He knows everything about your history.

263
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,600
Oh shit.

264
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,040
Clark, I've got something to tell you.

265
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,560
I don't, you might already know.

266
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:20,040
All right, boys, let me actually start at the beginning.

267
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:28,560
We're not the first group of three to try to combat this kind of stuff.

268
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,560
What do you mean before us?

269
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,520
There was a group called K cell.

270
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,760
K cell was Kevin.

271
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,760
You see standing before you, your, your father adopted father.

272
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,320
Yeah.

273
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:43,600
What?

274
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:52,680
So it was Kevin man named Kyle and a woman named Karen, also known as an love.

275
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,160
What the and love killed your parents.

276
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:03,440
Clark stares in bewilderment and a little bit of like anger just at here in the name.

277
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:09,320
I don't know why Marvin glass turned the grip against itself.

278
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,040
And Karen was the only one to get away.

279
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:22,720
He made Kevin shoot Kyle and, and he essentially took over, took over his life, his soul in some way.

280
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:26,200
And Kevin was his soldier from then on out.

281
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:31,360
Marvin glass was looking for, for the metal sphere.

282
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,480
He has one.

283
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:36,960
That's what agent McKinley and Kennedy were trying to neutralize was a silver ball like that.

284
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,360
Yeah.

285
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,240
Why does he want them?

286
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,560
I don't know.

287
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,680
I saw something.

288
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,080
I saw something pretty terrible.

289
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,520
Just now, all these people want these fears.

290
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:50,880
We found one Marvin glass was one on one for years.

291
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,560
He has one.

292
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,840
He wants to know how it works.

293
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:58,240
Just now, just now I had a vision of something, something strange and terrible.

294
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:05,480
It was like one of those fears, but massive, gigantic, gargantuan.

295
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:14,840
It had arms coming out the side and a little tube coming up the bottom and up that tube.

296
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:23,400
I watched one of those fears go one of the small spheres and a, a huge light opened up in the ceiling.

297
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,600
It was like the ceiling was, was revealing itself.

298
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,440
So this thing could, could come through.

299
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:37,120
And all around I saw these letters, these words, it said planet juggernaut like that.

300
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,880
Fucking the bedding stuff we found.

301
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,520
Yeah, exactly.

302
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,240
Keith Clark.

303
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,200
Sorry, sorry.

304
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:51,920
The transition to my new body is a wrecked havoc on some of my neurons.

305
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,280
I don't even know if I have neurons really.

306
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,040
Shouldn't I have this asshole's memories?

307
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,520
Do I have this asshole's memories?

308
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:04,040
I'll try to access this asshole's memories.

309
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:18,800
While not being able to access the memories of Kevin, previous to you being inside of his body, you think that that might be a hint as to why you have, quote, the second sight.

310
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,120
Interesting.

311
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:24,600
Guys, I was just, I'm thinking about what we heard Stan talking about earlier.

312
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,480
Oh yeah.

313
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,120
Thinking about it more.

314
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:39,040
When I had Fergie's watch on, I remember, well, it clouded my mind cause I felt like I was going inside, inside, inside in the membrane, inside in the brain.

315
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,600
That's how Chick-fil-A makes their chicken.

316
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,920
Oh, that sounds good.

317
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,800
Uh, I remember it's coming back to me.

318
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:54,120
I, when I had it on one of the feelings I had was like, I felt like wet grass and dirt on my fingers.

319
00:19:54,120 --> 00:20:02,920
And I remember seeing a metal door, like buried almost slightly underneath this grass and, and, and dirt.

320
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:09,520
And it said, here lies the beans, scientists beyond measure, saviors of the world.

321
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:18,160
And as soon as I saw that, I think that's when I had ripped the watch off of my arm and went and thrown it into the safe.

322
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:22,560
So like, are you more capable than you've been letting on?

323
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,120
Are you a scientist without measure?

324
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,240
No.

325
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,440
Do you feel that within yourself?

326
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:44,320
I am almost positive that somewhere along the beans line, there's something I don't know.

327
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,560
It could be my parents.

328
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:51,120
It could be my grandparents, but it was somebody related to you that came in and solved their.

329
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,440
Uh, Silas and Mary Cole problem back in the day.

330
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,400
It was, it was Cornelius beans and somewhere down the line.

331
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:07,480
I don't know who would have been the scientist, but we, I don't know where to find whatever I saw in that, but I feel as if it's real.

332
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:11,200
And we, I think maybe there's something in that that we need to check out.

333
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,320
I might know a little bit, something about that.

334
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,120
What do you think?

335
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:19,200
Well, I know that I personally came from Cole's orphanage.

336
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,840
John Lee Pettymore, the third adopted me from there.

337
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,160
I don't know who my real parents are.

338
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:29,880
Cole's orphanage, new school under modern etiquette.

339
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:34,640
So Kevin, John, everything you're saying right now is going a little bit above my head.

340
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:40,720
You're adopted by John Lee Pettymore, but you're in Kevin's body, but you're in your dad's body.

341
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,200
The only, Oh, right.

342
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,880
John Lee Pettymore, the third is Kevin.

343
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,640
He was part of K cell remember, but here's the point.

344
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:51,600
I think maybe the beans adopted you too.

345
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,600
I think maybe we all spent some time in Cole's orphanage.

346
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,480
No, my parents are my parents.

347
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,680
How can you be so sure?

348
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,920
They were my parents, Keith.

349
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,440
How are you sure about anything?

350
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:04,600
You know what we've been through the past six fucking days.

351
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,520
How can you be sure of anything?

352
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,720
I'm not sure of anything.

353
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,080
I'm sure they were my parents.

354
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:15,960
Keith, they had to have been, you know, my daddy was my daddy.

355
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,000
And your daddy is your daddy.

356
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:21,360
We just came from different penises.

357
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,320
Then the ones what raised us.

358
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,360
Where were we?

359
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,040
My brother from another penis.

360
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:38,240
Where were we when we had that spell cast on us as children?

361
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,120
Oh, that was, that was at clankers at the daycare daycare.

362
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:42,440
Yeah.

363
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:42,760
Okay.

364
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,560
Well, why were we all at that same daycare together?

365
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,200
If we might not have all come from the same orphanage.

366
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,080
You ever think about that Clark?

367
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,080
I mean, here's the only daycare in town.

368
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,680
I just figured, yeah, that one's that's a little tough to say.

369
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:01,000
Cause it's not like there's not great childcare options and contention.

370
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,800
It's it's the bar.

371
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,600
It's the bar.

372
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,000
Like they're the only ones willing to do it.

373
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,200
I love cut up hot dogs and Bud Light.

374
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:10,600
I see.

375
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,520
That's that's a,

376
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,560
I'll always have a soft spot.

377
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:16,880
Yeah.

378
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,000
What are you going to ask someone who's not Harry clinker to watch your kids?

379
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,440
What would Harry say?

380
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,440
He's the best one for the job.

381
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:28,400
Obviously it'd be crushed 36.

382
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:34,880
John, do you shout out, John, do you have any, do you see anything else or that's a lot of information to take in, but I think

383
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:39,880
I know it's like an info dump, but Keith, I got to, I got to ask you something.

384
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,560
It's, it's kind of tough though.

385
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:42,320
Yeah.

386
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,520
Well, I've had a tough week, so I think I can handle.

387
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:54,200
You know, my, my memory has been pretty dang spotty lately, but one of the last things I do remember was we were

388
00:23:54,200 --> 00:24:01,720
standing in Glass's office and boy, it sounded an awful lot like he hired you to kill your brother.

389
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,640
And you, you, you asked where the money was.

390
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:12,080
Well, since, I mean, we're all working together again.

391
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:22,880
I don't know what the point in hiding this from you is anymore, but, uh, I didn't know that it was Marvin Glass hiring me to do this.

392
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:30,880
My, my niece, she found me and she offered me a million dollars to kill her dad.

393
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:39,920
And I don't know that I've talked a lot about Fergie, but, uh, it's not, it's common knowledge that him and I didn't get along

394
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,080
since, since we were boys.

395
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,280
In fact, I hated him.

396
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:52,200
And so when that opportunity rose, I never thought about killing my brother, but the chance to become a millionaire and get rid of that asshole.

397
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,200
I jumped at it.

398
00:24:54,320 --> 00:25:03,400
So I went and, uh, I didn't kill my brother, but I guess you could say if it wasn't for me, he'd still be alive today.

399
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:11,560
So, uh, when I saw my niece with Marvin Glass and the scientist lady, I knew what I got myself into.

400
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,560
Did you recognize that scientist lady?

401
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,640
Was she anybody to you?

402
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:18,960
Only person in that glass building I knew was my niece.

403
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,520
I had no idea she was affiliated with people like that.

404
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:32,960
Keith, uh, I happened to encounter your niece's, your niece's bedroom and she's getting up to all kinds of weird, impossible math.

405
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:40,080
Does that sound, yeah, she, she was, she was writing out equations that couldn't have been from this world.

406
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:43,440
Well, you know, if there's anything you want your niece to be into math, isn't that bad?

407
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,080
Yeah, it could be worse.

408
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,640
It could be one letter off.

409
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,360
Uh, no, the thing is, I don't know much.

410
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:57,440
I haven't been, I hadn't, I have not been in contact with my niece.

411
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:02,160
It seemed at the time that, uh, that, that scientist lady was maybe training her in some way.

412
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:07,520
I mean, I kind of got that idea too, but I was mostly just pissed off that I've, I think they were trying to screw me.

413
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:10,800
I don't think they had any intent on giving me that million dollars.

414
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:18,960
That's the reason I was even going to work for Marvin was to repay the debt of him rebuilding me.

415
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,880
And he said, he'd give me that million dollars.

416
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,040
Keith, did you know you was saved by fish men?

417
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:27,360
I, I, yes, I saw them.

418
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,520
And what do you think about, what do you think about that?

419
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,800
Uh, I don't know what you think made them fish, man.

420
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:39,960
Can we get, I just saw a reaction shot from Clark bishops, fish, man.

421
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:50,120
My already spinning head is spinning even while more wildly fish, fish, man, man with the face of fishes.

422
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:54,160
So I saw, I was much more concerned about getting out of glasses building.

423
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,520
I saw them and it freaked me the fuck out, but I did get help from a fish boy.

424
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,280
Uh, so they're not all bad.

425
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,880
They're doing some weird shit over in that glass building.

426
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:11,880
I assure you, I can't, I don't fucking know.

427
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,000
I got the, I got out of there.

428
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,600
I accepted, I accepted the proposition from Marvin glass and I came to the funeral.

429
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,400
That's all I know.

430
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:25,000
Fish boy, you were talking to a fish boy, Peter, little Peter.

431
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,200
Oh my God.

432
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:29,080
God, my God.

433
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:34,600
What are fish, what are fish people doing?

434
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:40,920
I don't know, but they apparently, I don't know how I got rebuilt other than the power of Marvin glass.

435
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,280
You keep saying rebuilt.

436
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,760
I mean, what does that even mean?

437
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,600
I died.

438
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,000
Yeah.

439
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:45,600
I'm back.

440
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,520
I said he was the new Charles.

441
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,000
You want to know how I got these scars?

442
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:53,760
That's a big one.

443
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,840
You got on your hand there.

444
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,320
Yeah.

445
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:55,760
Clark.

446
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,160
That'll come into play later.

447
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:01,160
Are you not going to give him credit for shouting out our favorite movie in the precinct?

448
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,360
The one we all used to watch together.

449
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,280
Ace Ventura, pet detective.

450
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:06,800
No.

451
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:07,840
Batman forever.

452
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:08,400
That one.

453
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,840
You guys, obviously you can see the scars.

454
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:17,720
I'm not exactly sure what's going on in here.

455
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:22,840
Uh, I have a slight idea, but, uh, I, I don't know.

456
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:28,120
I don't want, I don't really want to talk about it until I figure it out, but I don't, there's nothing you need to worry about.

457
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,160
I'm on your side.

458
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:29,680
I promise.

459
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:36,720
And that sounds, that sounds real suspicious, but I mean it, I promise we talked about this already.

460
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,840
John Kevin's eyes, narrow.

461
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:49,360
John, you mentioned that, uh, that those silver balls that everybody's apparently after that you said something about Marvin wanting to use it.

462
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,720
Do you know what that means?

463
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:59,080
Years ago when, when Marvin turned Kevin on Kyle, the thing you wanted to know was how the balls worked, what they did.

464
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:05,080
I haven't seen anything suggesting what that is other than making the big ball work.

465
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:13,880
Do you think that there might be some of those silver balls in the silver in the gun and the camera and the radio and the helmet?

466
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,000
That's interesting.

467
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:18,320
I hadn't thought of that Keith, but I mean, who knows?

468
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:21,560
We, we considered them pretty important, so we never cracked them open.

469
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:25,160
But I don't know that we should, but we've only got one correct.

470
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,680
We've got the ball, one silver ball, right?

471
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:32,800
We put our, it disappeared into our bag, but I think that bag is still, it wasn't ours.

472
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,400
The agents brought one.

473
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,080
We got one.

474
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,120
I think it's still in the skull of that lady, right?

475
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,360
No, John has it.

476
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:41,520
You do?

477
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,800
John just picked it up and he's had it ever since.

478
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,520
Is it at your house or?

479
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:53,600
No, I don't know how much that's my house anymore.

480
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:59,320
I mean, I still like Smokey, but, uh, here's the thing boys.

481
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,040
That was kind of always on my person.

482
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,920
I just had it in my pocket.

483
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,880
I didn't, it was a comforting wait.

484
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,200
I didn't know what it did.

485
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:15,600
Uh, so you're saying it was on the old John, it was on John, your previous John.

486
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:18,320
So Marvin has it.

487
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,440
Most likely.

488
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,280
Yes.

489
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:25,280
You know, a lot, a lot's happened in a real short amount of time.

490
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,160
Real, real quick for us.

491
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:27,600
Sure.

492
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,320
Absolutely.

493
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:32,800
It could get a little head spinning, but, uh, agent, uh, McKinley and agent Kennedy,

494
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:38,200
they, they tasked us with neutralizing the threat, I believe was part of their MO.

495
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,440
And then we were supposed to call them back there.

496
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,000
They're twisting in the wind right now.

497
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,920
As far as I know.

498
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:43,240
Yeah.

499
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,000
Shouldn't they be doing something?

500
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,520
Who do they work for?

501
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,600
Are they on the glass?

502
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,320
Well, they said the FBI, but who knows?

503
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:53,560
Also, it's been a hell of a week.

504
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,680
I had all my days of running together.

505
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,440
How long ago was it that we saw agent McKinley two days ago?

506
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:06,560
What did they, they, they said if we didn't call back in 48 hours, they'd call us.

507
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:12,320
You would assume based on the timing that it is right about now that they would be

508
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:15,000
calling the contention police department.

509
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,880
Um, and I'm all out of minutes.

510
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,880
I want to get you guys, I want to call drew real quick.

511
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,160
You've been in touch with drew.

512
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,240
He was, he said he, I have not in voicemail.

513
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,240
Yeah, but I want to call him and see if they'll answer.

514
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:29,600
You called him after you listened to the voicemail that he sent.

515
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:34,080
And I believe his phone went straight to voicemail.

516
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:34,480
Yep.

517
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,960
And I want to try it again.

518
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:43,840
Bring, bring, bring, bring, bring, bring, bring, and it does the same this time.

519
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,520
Well, so did they say they'd call the police department?

520
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,800
I think we were supposed to call them.

521
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:52,520
They gave us a number that we could, but they said if we didn't call within 48

522
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,200
hours, they'd be in contact with us.

523
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,240
I think that was the deal.

524
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:00,600
Hopefully they have their self, our cell phone numbers then I don't have any idea

525
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,840
where that card with their number would be.

526
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,240
I mean, we would just have their number.

527
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:10,160
I mean, what if we just all go in and start a fucking, you know, like hot wings

528
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:13,920
restaurant or something and let them take care of contention.

529
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,800
They were going to come back in two days.

530
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,600
We've got alibis, new lives.

531
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,440
We disappeared.

532
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,080
If they're working for glass, that's a hot wings.

533
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:26,960
Well, if they're working for glass, I don't think they would have given us that

534
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,160
bag that gets rid of the balls.

535
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,560
They would have taken it unless those balls get sent.

536
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,520
If they get put in the bag, they get sent to the thing that John saw.

537
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,480
I don't know why they would have left the bag with us.

538
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,880
That's an interesting proposition.

539
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,240
We would be doing their job for them.

540
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:42,040
If they're working for glass, we'd find some balls and keep putting them in the

541
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,240
bag and they keep going to the...

542
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:46,240
Now maybe, but it seemed like they was awfully scared of those balls.

543
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,040
What if we gave them a call?

544
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,520
We've got their card.

545
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,400
We got their number.

546
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,280
What's the worst that can happen?

547
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,360
We can try to decide whether we trust them or not.

548
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,160
What do you guys think?

549
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:04,240
Both of Joe and Clark don't know about that.

550
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,600
And Keith, I mean, who knows who they are though now.

551
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,520
It's going to be a couple hours till they get in contact with us.

552
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,640
They told us that we might as well give them a call.

553
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:18,920
See, I don't know that we have the upper hand, but if we have any sort of, if we're

554
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:23,000
doubting that we can trust them, you know, we can call them and see what they're

555
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:23,360
saying.

556
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:27,640
And we might try to be able to get something out of them because we know about

557
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,600
glass and everything.

558
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:32,280
We might be able to get something out of them before they can, you know, get to us.

559
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:36,440
Let's, let's, let's take a step back now fellas, now that we've laid all our cards

560
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,040
on the table.

561
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:41,440
What, what do we want to do to, to prevent calamity?

562
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:47,040
I mean, a lot has changed, but it sounds like the glass family has some real bad

563
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,080
designs on the town of contention.

564
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,400
I've seen things that make me think the world's in jeopardy.

565
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:57,280
You have the glass family after you had maybe the glass family is our, our first

566
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:57,840
thing.

567
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:01,520
The glass, the glass family thinks you're still one of them.

568
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,320
They might still think I'm one of them.

569
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:08,000
And that's thing is neither of us killed Stan Manstein.

570
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:12,680
No, I'm out of failed my mission of bringing Stan back, but I didn't kill him.

571
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:16,560
So I may, I wouldn't have to infiltrate the glass building.

572
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:21,560
I could just go in maybe under the guise of bringing the guy that killed Stan

573
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:25,240
Manstein in, and then we can, we're all three in there.

574
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:28,680
And if shit goes awry, then we can, uh, I liked that a lot.

575
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,760
You're going to use Clark Bishop as your Chewbacca.

576
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,080
Yeah, absolutely.

577
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:37,120
This is the man who killed Stan Manstein and we brought him and then we use him

578
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,200
to kill Marvin glass.

579
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,040
I like that.

580
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:41,800
I mean, fuck Marvin glass.

581
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:46,160
And I think I'm on board for this plan, but just for the record, I don't know if

582
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,200
we killed Stan.

583
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:48,640
Well, he's not here.

584
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:51,640
I don't know that he died, but he blipped out of existence.

585
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:52,080
Keith.

586
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:57,120
My task was to bring him back and that is seems like an impossible task.

587
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,080
Now it seems like I failed to do that.

588
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:03,040
So yeah, we'll just tell Marvin glass that you're the man who killed Stan

589
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,680
Manstein.

590
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:08,280
I think before we do this though, I would like to call the, uh, quote,

591
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:12,560
unquote FBI people back and just see what, see what they say.

592
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:18,440
Cause if you're talking about case cell, was that an FBI thing or do you know

593
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,360
what that means?

594
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,320
No, man, that was an FBI.

595
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,600
Well, maybe these, maybe these people know what the case cell is.

596
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:27,240
Maybe they're somehow affiliated with that.

597
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,000
Do we know who the case will work for?

598
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,080
It sounds like the case.

599
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:33,640
So was doing the same kind of stuff we were doing, right?

600
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:38,320
Except maybe they were more, I mean, prepared for it than we were.

601
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,200
And if these FBI guys are at the end of the day, we're still contention

602
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,240
police officers.

603
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:48,080
We're not, well, we're, I mean, maybe not anymore, but what do you think

604
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,440
about just giving them a call?

605
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,760
We don't have to meet up with them.

606
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,800
We don't have to tell them everything we know, but I'd like to see what they

607
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,360
think when we call them back.

608
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:59,200
Cause I think they're the ones that really made us knowledgeable about the

609
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,080
weird shit that's going down.

610
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:03,240
I mean, we saw it with our own eyes, but they're the ones that

611
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,560
confirmed that it's happening.

612
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:07,240
They're the ones who confirmed that somebody else knew about it.

613
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,680
I don't see that they've helped us a damn at all.

614
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,680
Well, they gave us the bag.

615
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,240
I don't know if it helped.

616
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,480
I mean, we could be helping them inadvertently, but you're right.

617
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,600
I mean, or I'm right.

618
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:20,640
It seemed like they were at least offering the branch to help ourselves.

619
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,200
What is the harm in calling them?

620
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:25,080
And if we feel like we can't trust them, we just go about our business.

621
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:28,360
We don't fuck with them, but I don't, I don't think there is a harm in calling

622
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:32,880
them, but they might break some of the element of surprise if we, if we're

623
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,880
trying to do a, a Darren raid on Marvin glasses, we don't have to tell them that

624
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,600
we're doing that we need, I'm saying just get in contact with them, see what they

625
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,360
have to offer and we go from there.

626
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,080
We'll have to put on objection to that.

627
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:47,480
We'll have to, yeah, we'll just have to put on our acting pants and make sure

628
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:52,000
that they don't know that we know things about them that you were in

629
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
theater in high school.

630
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,400
I remember, I think maybe you should be the one to field the call.

631
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,280
Oh no.

632
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:02,480
Whoever has the highest alertness.

633
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:05,160
I need you to roll alertness for me.

634
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,680
Read, read them off guys.

635
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:08,640
A couple of tins.

636
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,040
I'm sorry.

637
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:09,200
What?

638
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,640
Who has the highest alertness?

639
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,440
A 70.

640
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,240
Ooh.

641
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,440
All right, Joe, go ahead and roll alertness for me.

642
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:21,080
That's an 89.

643
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:27,000
89 continued speaking to your fellow police officers, whips his head

644
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,520
around every direction he can.

645
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,280
Clark does no such thing.

646
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:38,680
Uh, yeah, so we call, we call the FBI and we just see what they know.

647
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:43,520
I mean the, uh, the in heavy air quotes, FBI, I have to say we give them a little

648
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:47,240
bit of info, but we by no means tell them everything we know.

649
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,800
Well, let's run that down real quick.

650
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,200
Like what do we, what do we want?

651
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:53,280
So we're going to be calling them and telling them that we failed.

652
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:56,600
We, I mean, 48 hours has passed and we haven't neutralized the threat.

653
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,960
Is that what we should lead with?

654
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,000
Or I think so.

655
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,360
And then maybe though, well, maybe, or maybe we, you know, we

656
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,920
found the threat was much bigger.

657
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,040
I mean, both.

658
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:06,440
Yeah.

659
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:06,920
Yeah.

660
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,920
Or, yeah, it was something that there's no way we could have tackled

661
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,160
in 48 hours had even if we'd known.

662
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:15,680
I mean, that's why there's, that's why they said if you finish it in 48 hours,

663
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:16,560
good.

664
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,640
Otherwise call us.

665
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:21,480
Well, they might even still think that we're in contention dealing with that.

666
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:25,200
Cause I think we've moved on to bigger things outside of contention.

667
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,760
We can pretend to be still in contention when we call them.

668
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,520
I don't know if that'll do us any good.

669
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,720
I think we should just be straight forward with these people.

670
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:34,480
I don't know who the fuck they are, but they're not Marvin glass.

671
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,240
So I think they're probably better than what we're dealing with right now.

672
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,240
We're just, that's the thing.

673
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,880
We're hoping they're not Marvin glass.

674
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:45,560
I say we, I say we feed them one, one major line instead of all the details

675
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,920
and then see what their reaction is to it.

676
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,040
What is the major thing we talked to him about that?

677
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:52,920
Well, we'll have to, yeah, we'll conduct the conversation with.

678
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,360
Suave and effortless.

679
00:38:55,520 --> 00:39:00,000
Yeah, but what's the, what are we going to tell him?

680
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,720
We'll say like, we got that fool Marvin glass.

681
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,000
How do you feel about that?

682
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,320
Let's see how they react.

683
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:10,720
And then when they react appropriately, then we tell them we're lying.

684
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,240
Sorry.

685
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:14,080
No, actually we don't have them, but we could really use your help.

686
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:17,120
Well, if they're working for glass, they would know we don't have glass,

687
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,600
but I get the, I get what you mean.

688
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:28,720
You hear this absurd scream coming from on top of one of the crypts that is

689
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:34,160
nearby and surrounding you and looking over, you see this massive creature

690
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:37,200
begin to materialize in front of you.

691
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:43,800
And it is a six and a half to seven feet tall creature with long limbs.

692
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:49,840
And it is gaunt and it has translucent skin and it is wearing a black suit.

693
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:57,000
And it looks at Clark Bishop in the eyes and it says, hello, subject one,

694
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:02,440
five, two, two, five, one, eight, one, nine, five, five, one, eight,

695
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:06,480
please hand me the book, please.

696
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:43,120
How am I the only one trying to fool or how can I have enough

697
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:43,840
trow?
