00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:58,240
to be read by your local canine dj wolf the dog damn y'all i just can't stop thinking about how

19
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:05,600
that girl disappeared out of thin air but you know who's not disappearing anytime soon it's kudzu with

20
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:17,920
no backbone

21
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:43,920
so

22
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:50,720
i think tilde might be wrapped up in some some weird stuff that's been going around in town

23
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:57,920
can you give her a call uh mildred uh pulls out her phone and calls and you hear a

24
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,240
um

25
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,920
coming from upstairs uh john you would you would hear it like in the same room as you

26
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:16,240
there's some kind of huge bee in this room uh i what kind of phone does she have iphone

27
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:23,760
full stop all right is it locked yeah does she have any pictures of herself in the room

28
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,880
yeah all right i try to unlock it with a picture of her uh yeah you can unlock it hell yeah

29
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:34,560
um hey i hey i just answer and i'm like whoa she looks at keith and she's like

30
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,560
oh she answered she's right upstairs no mildred it's me it's john lee peter pennymore

31
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,840
i can't keep revealing my terrible secret

32
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:56,640
so she's gone i'm sorry to say mildred it seems like she is when will she be back we don't

33
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:04,480
rightly know i think around now is when clark starts to regain some of his faculties and he

34
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:10,640
goes over to mildred and said uh mildred uh yeah i don't i don't know where she went but you know

35
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,320
we're gonna find her we always find people we're looking for do you find john peters

36
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,640
that was yesterday we're working on it we actually are coming pretty close we think

37
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:28,480
uh she like reaches over to her ashtray relights that spliff and starts walking upstairs uh so in

38
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:33,600
until this room i want to do a couple things a has the camera reacted to being in here at all no

39
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,800
okay uh now that i've unlocked her phone i want to check her texts her facebook like messenger

40
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,440
anything i want to look at her communication see who she's talking to you know is she in a

41
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,480
facebook messenger group called like freaky death cult uh yeah she's in a freaky death cult no

42
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,280
basically what you would garner is that

43
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,400
i'm sorry there's so much tube technology

44
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,000
in this world

45
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,880
she was a pretty standoffish kid from what you can tell she clearly grew up maybe not clearly but she

46
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:18,880
grew up in this house with her grandma her parents are gone she's had a weird home life uh her

47
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:26,160
grandma raised her but was always stoned you would gather from her phone that she probably has uh

48
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:33,920
dabbled in in smoking some pot herself and uh you know normal kid stuff she's into tv shows and

49
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:40,640
you know movies and music and other things that people find uh enjoyable as hobbies looking

50
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:45,840
through her phone she seems like your typical teenager i don't know how she came across like

51
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:51,760
watching tv shows and movies and your typical enjoyable things yeah the kind of things that

52
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,040
people like wow how old a girl is she uh

53
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:03,040
mildred is sitting on her bed i feel like we were asking you and not mildred yeah

54
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:10,640
oh i definitely we saw her uh early high school freshman or sophomore probably cool probably

55
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:16,800
sophomore actually we'll go with sophomore she has a car hell yeah so she's pretty cool she's pretty

56
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,760
cool i'll do cash till he has a driver's license we should grab that we should grab that gun

57
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:27,920
before we forget okay so it seems like a troubled teen uh sneaking around her neighbor's abandoned

58
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:34,160
house find some spooky shit but i do you think she knew she would disappear or was she trying

59
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,720
to harm you she pointed it at you that's what i'm trying to say is i don't think she knew what this

60
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,680
was so she was gonna shoot me for entering her room she was gonna kill me somebody might have

61
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:49,840
gotten to her about having those things somebody besides julie maxwell purchased other items maybe

62
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:54,560
we should go back and find out who purchased those other items if there's a security footage

63
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,200
or anything like that if she said it was in the past week or so they might still have some that's

64
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:03,360
not a bad idea keith see if we can find some people snooping around that booth we've just

65
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,840
entered the room of like the mastermind of all of this and we're like she's a poor teeny and you're

66
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:18,240
like you'll never catch me alive did clark not mention that she said she twirled her mustache

67
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:25,120
it all happened real quick but she looks scared as all get out pointing that gun at me was it the

68
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:30,320
fear of a little girl about to shoot a police officer or a fear of a girl about to do something

69
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:37,360
metaphysical i think i think we i think we probably got both but i i would suspect that

70
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,880
she learned some things about what she had in her possession i think we should go back

71
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,120
to the metaphysical store hidden treasures forgotten treasures

72
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:53,520
i know they're closed but not for us uh they are closed but you see the same woman inside

73
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,960
she's like sweeping up give her a friendly way from outside and point to the door

74
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:04,160
i'm sorry um we're closed oh yeah man we're not here to shop we had some more questions related

75
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:11,280
to uh booth 504 oh oh okay i i guess come on in thank you man what what can i what can i assist

76
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:18,080
you with officers we were specifically wondering if you had any more records uh or receipts from

77
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:24,240
that booth you see that big book that she was going through and uh she looks at it walks over

78
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:28,560
and starts flipping through it well second question do you have any security cameras in here

79
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:37,760
yeah but they don't rightly work with they're mostly just the show the kids

80
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:45,840
yeah yeah and oh hey i want to come through on that roll it up uh 96 can i human her too

81
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:52,320
yeah let's not so um so yeah you you believe what you want to believe the truth is out there zack

82
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:58,400
and this old lady is a lying two-faced fuck she does have a face on the back of her head

83
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,520
as she's flipping through the through the big book gosh uh there were three items recently

84
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:14,640
bought from booth 504 there was a camera that was bought with a check and uh that was from

85
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:22,240
and she's done through julie julie maxwell another item was uh put on uh the tab uh by

86
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:28,880
marie jacobs marie marie has a tab uh yeah she come in here pretty often i'd say so what sort

87
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:34,640
of things does she usually buy well what was that item on the tab it's a radio yeah it says a radio

88
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:43,920
and then uh there was another item uh uh a helmet that was uh it was put on a credit card you have

89
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,880
a name on that card man it's uh the first church of contention this might be a strange question do

90
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:57,520
you remember all of these items being tubed um i didn't sell all of them i don't rightly remember

91
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:02,000
that's fine do you remember who from the church purchased that helmet i i wasn't here for that

92
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,880
but who would be purchasing things on the who has a credit card to the church do you think do you

93
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:12,560
know clark who would have that you religious clark probably not i don't think john lee is

94
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:17,280
but i think he definitely would have spent time around a church growing up what is the first

95
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:22,160
church of contention baptist Scientologist it's uh we're not it's just the first church of

96
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,880
contention we're not gonna call it one denomination is more evil than the other they're all pretty

97
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:32,000
equally dog methodists are all right methodists don't give a fuck they're chill

98
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,040
was there anything else uh no that was it hey well i think we got i wish we

100
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:50,480

101
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:56,720
julie maxwell a radio that went to marie jacobs and a helmet that went to the first church of

102
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:02,560
contention do you know anything about that helmet is it a bike helmet it just says helmet okay did

103
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:08,560
anybody else come in asking about these did julie maxwell maybe ask you about who had bought some

104
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:19,600
more of these things um no just inside i only asked because we found the uh dr marie jacobs

105
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,320
oh that's right what was her name on in julie's apartment uh it was in the yellow pages just

108
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:44,480

109
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:55,600

154
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:35,120
together or something we'll find out later something crazy so it bumps the top of the

155
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,840
cruiser like you didn't have to set it on the seat uh clark what do you do i'm already running

156

159
00:16:55,200 --> 00:17:07,200

160
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:19,120

161
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:26,080
all right the hat gets in my eyes and i have a really hard time getting the car started clark

162
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:36,240
uh roll a drive check as well 42 on a 50 nice so as you guys go off you see the white toyota

163
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:45,200
as it peeled off it actually ran a bit off the road up onto the curb and had to back up as to

164
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:51,200
like to avoid hitting a sign on the side of the road and then gets back on the road and as it

165
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:56,320
is going north on the road from forgotten treasures clark you are in position right

166
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:03,760
behind the white toyota and john lee pettymore you are taking up the rear right behind clark bishop

167
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:12,160
as you are driving there's an intersection approaching and the white toyota is going

168
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:17,120
to drive straight through the red light clark what do you do real fast my assessment of the

169
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:24,320
situation can i see if is there more than one person in the car roll me in a search

170
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:38,080
fail 61 i also wonder that i pass a 34 on a 40 uh keith you see there is one person in the driver's

171
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:43,920
seat of the white toyota cool clark how are you handling the situation from a driving perspective

172
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:51,680
there is traffic going horizontally i do it like a ambulance would so lights on siren on and just

173
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:55,840
cautiously but still trying to maintain as much speed as i can but still seeing how safe i can be

174
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:00,000
about the oncoming traffic if i'm if they're stopping i'm going but if they're don't look

175
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:06,240
like they're stopping i'm not going through okay yeah he is going to go through the intersection

176
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:12,160
and john lee pettymart full speed i peel around him and i'm not really looking okay i need you

177
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:21,520
both to roll another drive check for me fail on mine if i roll 70 on a 70 is that a fail no that

178
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:28,320
is a great success okay cool it's a really really quite good success very lucky the white toyota

179
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:37,120
swerves out of the way of the traffic as he goes through the intersection nimbly dodging a car

180
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:44,240
clark bishop you are about to hit a car coming in from the right too hot didn't see your sirens

181
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:50,560
didn't uh didn't hear you so you have to like hit the brakes yeah in order to uh avoid a collision

182
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:57,040
there as john lee petty more just like slides like through the intersection and flies through

183
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:02,000
it on the tail of the white toyota keith what do you want to do i'm gonna flash my gun at the

184
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:10,640
person that almost just hit us and point out and then i nod my head and i go yeah yeah then i say

185
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:18,240
hit it i do okay so now the pursuit is still heading north on that same road the white toyota

186
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:28,400
is going like 60 65 miles an hour on a 45 and gaining speed john lee petty morn it is up to you

187
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:33,920
what you want to do next i'm just still in hot pursuit you're basically right behind this white

188
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:40,800
toyota so what maneuvers are you going to take i assume my police cruiser has more power so i'm

189
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:45,200
just going to try to get ahead of him and make him stop or run off the road how close is he to

190
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:51,200
the white toyota how close are we to the white toyota i would say john lee petty more is roughly

191
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:56,720
10 yards 15 yards behind the white toyota and you guys are 20 yards behind his cruiser you

192
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:01,120
can just call him a channel okay i see that john has the lead on this one so i'm whatever he does

193
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,880
even if he does manage to get to the side or around it i'm gonna still kind of be taking up

194
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:09,680
the rear in case that car goes off i think we should try to get up close too because i can get

195
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:14,480
the shotgun out of the back and try to take out his tires okay because i got pretty good firearms

196
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,680
okay i'll do that i'll get a little closer if you can pull up to the side i'll try to get up

197
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:24,960
to the back and i'll be like cop loudspeaker just like pull over stop the vehicle okay six so i'm

198
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:39,120
going to roll okay so here's what happens john as you pull behind this uh this white toyota you see

199
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:46,080
a hand go out the driver's side window with a something that is on fire in the hand and he

200
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:53,200
throws a bottle molotov cocktail awesome and it is flying through the air i need you to

201
00:21:53,760 --> 00:22:00,320
roll against his throw on a drive check in order to avoid the molotov cocktail heading straight

202
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:10,160
for your windshield five as you swerve you manage to avoid the cocktail hitting your windshield

203
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:17,600
exactly but it does catch the the back corner of your car and and you're not sure whether or not

204
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:25,040
a fire has started or whether or not just the exterior of your car is on fire currently clark

205
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:34,080
you and keith see a small explosion in the back right of john's car and glass seems to just

206
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:40,160
shatter off in in that direction as you guys are pulling up closer this is the most alive

207
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:45,920
john has felt since his racing days holy shit did that guy just throw a molotov cocktail

208
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:50,000
i think he did dude we gotta take this guy out i already have reached back and picked up the

209
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,680
shotgun and i'm waiting to roll my window down until we can get close enough to him because i

210
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:59,760
don't want no fire in this car okay i think he had to slow down enough and john clearly like

211
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:05,040
swerved to the left and you guys pulled up right next to him so the two of you are side by side

212
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:10,240
with the white toyota right in between you right ahead of you clark is there anything you want to

213
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:15,120
do maneuver wise while you're driving or are you just trying to i mean always getting closer into

214
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:22,560
maybe his right side there's a passenger side now okay awesome so let's go ahead and do another

215
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:31,840
drive roll off all both of you and i'll roll for for the white toyota as well fuck 89 on a 50 90

216
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:39,360
on a 70 okay the white toyota failed his check as well so you're still in the same positions moving

217
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:45,440
forward but you are heading directly for a t so there's no straight there's only right or left

218
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:53,360
coming up and the white toyota is going to whip it to the right so as you guys hit this turn

219
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,920
let's do one more check to see if anything changes if he's with jostling and i was already on the

220
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:02,320
right can i try and t-bone him or i don't know if it'd be a t-bone but maybe like half pit maneuver

221
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:07,120
to hit his back side to get him spinning yeah absolutely i want to try to shoot out his front

222
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:11,600
right tire as well okay and how are you doing that hanging out the passenger seat with the

223
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:25,840
shotgun and just awesome okay so let's get those drive rolls a two on a 50 nice 63 on a 70 63 and

224
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,840
what are you trying to do i guess as we come up to that t and i see him turning right i'm just

225
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:35,280
going to try to do some late braking and pass him on the turn basically awesome roll the firearms

226
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:41,360
please keith 21 on a 70 awesome and you were aiming for a tire front right tire yeah as he

227
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:48,640
takes this right turn clark you try to fishtail him you make connection however he turns into it

228
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:57,200
and begins to avoid the fishtail maneuver however keith vigna blows his front right tire as he's

229
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:04,160
doing so which would pull him harder right hard right yeah so that is going to complete the fish

230
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:09,280
tail and make that a success and john you can yeah has i mean has this pretty much brought him

231
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:14,320
to a stop uh he's gonna be sideways here in a second yeah and probably just like right in the

232
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:20,640
middle of the street okay once we stop i'm gonna jump out have my shotgun trained on him and stand

233
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:25,760
there until you guys can move to get him out because i'm not trying to pop around so john

234
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:30,560
what are you doing where's your car going i'll just go around to the rear of his car since you

235
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:34,160
guys are in a position to go like to block him from the front we can just get them blocked in

236
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:40,320
basically yeah are are you picturing our car i'm picturing me my car and his car parallel facing

237
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,720
opposite directions oh okay i was picturing you okay then i'll get in front of him yeah and you

238
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:49,360
guys get behind him or whatever yeah that's good so i've got shotgun trained as soon as you get out

239
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:56,240
of the car you've got a shotgun in your hands and he is going to begin firing at you okay are you

240
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:02,480
going to attempt to take cover or fire back so if i was coming up to his passenger side i'm gonna

241
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:07,440
jump towards the back of his car so that he doesn't have a good aim on me and try to like get

242
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:12,400
by the trunk of his car and kind of take cover and try to i want to get a good shot on him but i'm not

243
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,320
i don't want to like shoot at him yet i don't want to try to kill him but i want to get at a good

244
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:22,000
angle where he can't hit me but i could if i had to get him absolutely so he he fires a few shots

245
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,880
breaks out the glass of his uh the on the passenger side of the white toyota and then

246
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:31,760
in the passenger backseat side he shoots out that glass too as he's trying to get at you

247
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:37,920
i believe that would make it john's turn john tries to remember his training like officers

248
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:44,480
are under fire so cops would just be like wasting this dude for sure yeah but but we we need him

249
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:50,800
yeah that's why i didn't just immediately blow his fucking head off can we uh can we tell from

250
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:55,280
the shots or see what kind of gun he's using is it just a pistol it's a pistol yeah so how many

251
00:26:55,280 --> 00:27:02,000
shots has he fired off at this point four couple i'll pop out of my cruiser and keep talking to him

252
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:09,280
through the intercom put down your weapon we just want to talk maybe you know about this goo can i

253

front he's in the driver's seat he is looking your direction he's kind of looking all around

262
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:08,080
but he just fired back through there and so he's panicky how would you feel if i was him bad

263
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:12,000
probably probably not good probably like a shouldn't have broken the law

264
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:18,880
um can i try to like open up the well shit that's stupid what do you do no that's what do you do i

265
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:24,720
fire off a warning shot of the shotgun to where maybe like a couple pellets hit like the side of

266
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:32,480
his ear or his head the rest just go like like a like a like a but not right at him okay so

267
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:39,680
you're firing away from him into the car yeah but you're not firing across his face bow i'm

268
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:46,080
not trying to like shoot directly into his head okay but like if a little spray gets on him

269
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,040
okay roll firearms for me i fail

270
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,880
and you had a shotgun so go ahead and

271
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:11,360
uh let's see is that essentially a called shot like yeah like near it like not trying to hit

272
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:16,800
someone is just as hard as hitting someone exactly where you want to also i am thinking this is like

273
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:23,040
buckshot not like a slug yeah yeah he just wanted to grace his face right with a couple pellets not

274
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:30,320
all the pain refreshing spray mist of pellets yeah wake him up a little bit it's so good

275
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,200
yeah so go ahead and roll 2d6 for me

276
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,680
shit okay um

277
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:52,240
so you uh you blast into this car you were trying to shoot to the right of him

278
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:58,000
but you really you just fired directly into the back of his seat there is a mist of red

279
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:08,640
going all over the front of the car as the horn begins to blare and the slumped body of charles

280
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:15,120
is leaning directly into the steering wheel his face making the horn incessant

281
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:22,880
john lee pettimore lets off a couple of panic shots towards the van when he sees all that

282
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:29,440

00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:40,320
where you are you think you you know your way around a wrist or a neck however no pulse is

302
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:45,280
being felt by you as i as i'm looking for the pulse i'm using my radio to call in an ambulance

310
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:34,640
all together that'd be interesting let's start it now or a fucking nightmare oh for sure you'd

311
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:41,760
have to be real intimate with all of them that'd be wild though i'm i'm barely i'm barely intimate

314
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:58,720
a road accident or something let's search his car yeah i want to search him to pat him down

315
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:04,800
check his pockets in the middle of the street a crowd begins to gather around you all i fire a

316
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:10,240
couple more shots into the air and tell them to disperse roll firearms what are we around up up

317
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:16,160
here 59 on a 60 how big of a crowd are we talking here it's not there's like like three hundreds of

318
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:21,280
people gathered there's like four people who stopped what they're doing to watch and a couple

319
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:26,320
cars like two cars have pulled over and they're just sitting there staring phones out do they

320
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:32,160
take off when i shoot in the air do you actually shoot yeah oh then yeah they leave okay uh-huh

321
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:37,440
one of the people just gets into somebody else's car and they they're nice enough to take them out

322
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:42,320
of this scary situation that's how you maintain law and order i cast obliviate on them so they

323
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:48,400
forget what they just saw harry potter universe canon now okay so as you guys are looking through

324
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:53,360
this car you see there's a there's a handgun in his hand in the seat next to him there's a

325
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:59,440
different handgun does it have any crazy um features no they both look relatively normal

326
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:06,160
handguns uh there's also a mag light sitting in the shotgun seat and in the back seat there's a

327
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:13,120
rifle a burner phone a wallet and some keys all in the back seat all in the back seat i want to

328
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:16,880
look at that burner phone too what numbers are stored in there i'm gonna grab the wallet as you

329
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:22,240
look through the burner phone everything has been deleted off of it there's literally no information

330
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:29,280
on it whatsoever and as you open up the wallet there's an army id for a billy harrison he's a

331
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:35,280
pretty nondescript dude pretty young he doesn't look like charles he's bald no it's not charles

332
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:42,080
pretty fit dude bald guy young guy probably in his uh late 20s early 30s wouldn't it say on the id

333
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:51,200
he's got shut up he's got pretty intense eyes he is 29. anything uh interesting about the keys

334
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:57,920
particularly if they have a storage unit it's a key ring with one car key on it does it seem like

335
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:03,520
this toyota was his can i check the glove box the keys to the toyota are still in the toyota

336
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:09,680
what is in the glove box there is almost nothing in the glove box there's like the manual for the

337
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:15,680
there's not like any interest no there's no registration on the one key on the one key ring

338
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:22,400
is there a make of the car did we check the trunk yet did we check the trunk yet it's a van right

339
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:28,160

340
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:32,000
for some reason i was picturing like a tundra i actually just pictured us chasing a ford bronco

341
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:38,080
this whole time if i did it by charles the guy just killed him we'll say dodge why not dodge

342
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:43,120
how about dodge on the key ring john lee pettymore i want to check the trunk too since i'm already

343
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:52,400

344
00:36:52,400 --> 00:37:00,720
harrison he looks exactly like billy harrison he is alive though yeah he's unconscious he's

345
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:08,640
unconscious and he is wearing a black t-shirt and jeans is there anything else yeah underneath him

346
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:16,400
also in the trunk is a police uniform a set of scrubs and a black suit this guy likes costume

347
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:21,600
parties can i try to wake him up is he tied up or is he just stuck back there conscious his hands

348
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:30,160

350
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:47,680
burner phone on him and he has a piece of paper two addresses on the piece of paper you recognize

351
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:54,640
them both immediately one is john peter's house and the other is the piston pig farm

352
00:37:55,360 --> 00:38:03,120
the keys that are in the ignition of the white toyota include a key to a room at the motel my

353
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:08,800
motel the one that keith vigna is staying at and there is a key fob for dirty dog grooming

354
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:16,960
charles donovan also has scratches all over his arms legs and face do they look like

355
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:24,000
scratches from a dog or a human those are the only two or like brushes brush if he was running

356
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:29,600
oh yeah are they claw marks i think that would be easy they're not claw marks okay i like what

357
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:35,520
you're thinking uh but no yeah his skin is definitely uh red and irritable looking as if

358
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:40,720
it has been scratched repeatedly in multiple places but not not breaking the skin like

359
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:47,680
they're not wounds a couple seem to have bled but mostly not and no discernible pattern no so

360
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:53,680
it doesn't look like he got scratched up by brush or something not really okay no well now what

361
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,440
there's a lot we could do actually uh let me look at the burner phone in his pocket

362
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:01,440
there is nothing on it yeah no it's it's wiped clean

363
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:07,760
shit not even like a recent calls list what was the last selfie he took

364
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:14,320
holding the molotov you should show it to his family no he wouldn't have any recent calls

365
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:21,360
there he would have deleted him by now keith you are slapping this bald man

366
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:28,480
in the back of the trunk and he's not waking up your slapping is not helping guys look what i

367
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:35,440
found who i found could we do a search rule to like more intensely search the vehicle sure

368
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:45,840
one holy shit 13 on a 20 i get it also not as good as him okay he starts the fuck out of this

369
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:51,280
car though maybe a tantalizing piece of information that might have escaped his lips before his chest

370
00:39:51,280 --> 00:40:01,280
was exploded john as you are looking over the stuff you decide to pull out dump them all on the

371
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:08,160
ground yeah you dump it all out in the middle of the road the police uniform that he has matches

372
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:15,840
the police uniform that the three of you wear here in contention okay and he has a badge on there

373
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:22,800
a real badge you would know that it's not but it looks and no other identification like it says

374
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:29,840
officer kissel is it a contention badge yeah is it pretty good yeah no this is like a pretty good

375
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:40,560
fake the set of scrubs has an id that says dr zebrowski and the black suit inside one of the

376
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:48,160
pockets has fbi credentials for an agent parks does the do the scrubs have a name of a hospital

377
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:54,880
on them no good question what do we have in contention just like a clinic correct and then

378
00:40:54,880 --> 00:41:01,280
the city has a hospital oh also with your search role sorry because you critically succeeded

379
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:07,840
as you're looking over charles's body helping clark discern the scratches that are all over him

380
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:18,240
you see that the scratches are in the pattern of of hands and it looks like a human human's hands

381
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:25,520
made all these scratches all over charles okay so i guess i would like to get drew looking up

382
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:30,720
all these credentials to see if there actually is a dr zebrowski somewhere in state following up on

383
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:37,040
the fbi credentials for agent parks see if that's a real person and then uh john is gonna go over

384
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:43,600
and start changing the tire on clark's cruiser nice it feels bad about that the ambulance arrives

385
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:48,160
on the scene before they get to either body i'm gonna have them take a look at my foot

386
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:54,640
you got anything for this yeah does this count as a hospital visit

387
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,240
can you roll to get some foot hit points back

388
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:09,840
yeah i like that go ahead and roll d4 or that's a d6

389
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:20,640
that's what you get uh they throw a band-aid at you now they um they have a splint with them that

390
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:25,600
you can throw on and it'll make walking much easier charles is dead so i'd like to direct
