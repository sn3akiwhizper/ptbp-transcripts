1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,280
Howdy, my friends and foes.

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,880
It's the titan of Tennessee, Wolf the dog.

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:11,420
And I am coming at you live from Groversville?

4
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:14,060
Now how the fuck did I end up here?

5
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:15,440
Wolf, dammit.

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,200
I guess I'll still do my best to give y'all

7
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:23,200
a wonderful show here at 694.2 PTBP.

8
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:26,460
This barn smells like shit,

9
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,080
but not that good kind of stank.

10
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,440
That bad stank.

11
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:35,240
Something weird is going on around here.

12
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,840
Anyway, this week's Howlin' with Wolf

13
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,240
is from at necro wang on Twitter,

14
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:45,320
who tweeted about the show and tagged at pretending pod,

15
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,740
which is a rad thing to do regardless

16
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:51,280
of if you have a necro wang, a bio wang,

17
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,680
or any sort of wang in between, they write.

18
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,660
Hello, Wolf the dog.

19
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,300
How are you today?

20
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:03,260
It's a true honor for you to read my words on your show.

21
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:05,700
May I take this moment to speak with you,

22
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,300
oh magnificent beast of the festering heap

23
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:13,620
about the king in yellow and his most radiant church.

24
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:15,960
Our king has feelings, Wolf.

25
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,180
He's happy when we're happy and sad when we're suffering.

26
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:24,060
He wants us to talk to him through prayer and through plays.

27
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,500
And he wants to talk back and stand before us.

28
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:32,340
So, my sewer surfing and delightfully grimy friend,

29
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,100
may I invite you to our king's gala,

30
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,260
yours truly, servant of our king in yellow,

31
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:44,260
Layered Christopher at necro wang on Twitter.

32
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:48,380
Well, Lord Christopher, servant of the king in yellow,

33
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:51,380
I'm sorry to say that my heart and soul

34
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:53,660
already belong to another.

35
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:56,480
They provide warmth when I am clammy.

36
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,960
They provide the densest of creams.

37
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:03,560
They devour those who would speak ill of them.

38
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,600
And they got a real cool radio show.

39
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,280
It's me, I'm my own god.

40
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,000
Suck it, king in yellow.

41
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,860
It's wolf in Greece for me, baby.

42
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,600
And hey, guess what?

43
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,240
If you want to write up something

44
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:21,920
for your Tennessean wolf to how, it's real simple.

45
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,160
Just tag at pretending pod on Twitter or Instagram.

46
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,200
It's as easy as that.

47
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:33,120
Or you can write up a five star review on Apple podcast

48
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,120
and send a screenshot to pretendingpod at gmail.com.

49
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,280
Easy, pleasey.

50
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,880
Or you can tag us on Facebook, I guess, if you have to.

51
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,460
And if you got sloppy wet mitts like me

52
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:51,300
and you hate trying to type handles on the internet,

53
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,160
release those worries, babies.

54
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,660
I put links to every single succulent smidgen

55
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:02,000
of our saucy socials in the super secret show notes.

56
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,280
Bet you can't find them.

57
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,720
Bet you can't click on them.

58
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,720
Ahem, Merriam-Webster defines a segue as

59
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,940
a transition made without pause or interruption.

60
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:19,680
And don't mind if I do because it's time for the news.

61
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,840
Last week here at 694.2 PTBP,

62
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,060
we released our second of two season one wrap up episodes

63
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:31,240
wherein we finished answering every single question

64
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:35,840
sent in by you, our lewd and lovely listeners.

65
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,860
But this week is going to be the start

66
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:40,960
of something new and horrible.

67
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:45,960
I am pleased to announce the coming of a guest handler.

68
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,520
After all, guests should be taken care of,

69
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:54,800
especially when they are named David Winters.

70
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,240
And Wolf does not simply introduce a new friend

71
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:03,240
without also introducing a brand spanking new tune.

72
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:08,300
So swallow your spit and prepare you for something scary.

73
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:12,580
This one is Brat Pit with Miss Merri.

74
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:16,580
["I Gotta Work In The Morning"]

75
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:47,580
What's up everybody, it's Zach.

76
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:03,340
I am here with Pretending To Be People.

77
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,820
We are starting a new one shot.

78
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:10,200
We are playing a scenario of a little game

79
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:15,200
called Delta Green and we are here with a guest handler.

80
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,560
That's right, we are here with a guest handler.

81
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:22,560
He is the rules lawyer on the Glass Cannon Network's

82
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,760
Androids and Aliens, a Starfinder podcast.

83
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:30,760
He is the dungeon master of New Game Who Dis,

84
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,940
Dungeon Crawl Classics on the Glass Cannon Network.

85
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:39,940
He is David Winters.

86
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,080
Hello, David.

87
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,200
Hello, hello, thank you for having me.

88
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,180
Thanks for coming on, man.

89
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,760
We're really looking forward to having you here.

90
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,060
We are really excited because for the first time

91
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:51,720
in our podcast history, we will be playing Delta Green.

92
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,560
Yeah.

93
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,960
Oh, funny how that happens, finally.

94
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,040
We're gonna see if we like it.

95
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,600
Yeah, we thought we'd try it out.

96
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:05,120
So it's up to you to convince us to enjoy this game.

97
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,480
That's not too much on your shoulders there, is it David?

98
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,960
No, not at all, but like I said pre-show,

99
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,140
I don't plan on there being much rules lawyering

100
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,080
from my direction at least

101
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,100
because I don't know the rules either.

102
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,220
So we're all just gonna.

103
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,540
Perfect.

104
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,160
Well, I think we're just gonna make this up as we go.

105
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,960
To at least one or two episodes of our show before this.

106
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,480
So you know what you're walking into.

107
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,280
More than one or two episodes.

108
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,520
I've made it kind of past the point of no return

109
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,360
on your show.

110
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,680
And in fact, your show is actually the only actual play show

111
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,140
outside of the GCN shows that I listened to.

112
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,300
Hell yeah, dude.

113
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,540
Yeah, this was a great connection.

114
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,920
And so when you pinged me and you're like,

115
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,020
hey, we should do this.

116
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:45,980
I was like, hell yeah.

117
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:48,080
Cause for the most part, when people ping me,

118
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,380
I say, hell no.

119
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:53,220
Very, very happy to be here.

120
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,040
We're glad you're here.

121
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,300
Yeah, this is exciting.

122
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,780
For those of you who are listening,

123
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,460
who don't know who we are,

124
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:01,500
if you came for David Winters,

125
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,700
we're just gonna let that one slide.

126
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:06,580
Okay, and then you don't know who we are.

127
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:07,940
And I'm Zach.

128
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:12,100
I am the normal handler of pretending to be people.

129
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:16,420
And I am here with three of my best friends

130
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,020
in the whole world,

131
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:21,940
who I get to spend time with role-playing, yay.

132
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:22,860
I'm Joe.

133
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:23,700
There it is.

134
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,040
Yeah, I'm Luke.

135
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,720
I'm like the serious one.

136
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,780
Yup.

137
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,040
The rules kind of pushing everybody through.

138
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,880
Yeah.

139
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,700
Good things.

140
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,540
Get that plot moving.

141
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:33,380
Flowing, you know.

142
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

143
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,040
I'm Thomas, I'm the dumb one.

144
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,160
We've all found our niche.

145
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,120
David, do you wanna tell us what scenario we're playing?

146
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:42,960
No.

147
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,780
Okay, sounds good.

148
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:46,280
And so we're playing a Delta Green scenario

149
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,400
that you'll find out what it is later.

150
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,920
No, I'll tell you, I'll tell you.

151
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:58,380
But you guys can't go researching this in between shows.

152
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,220
Research?

153
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,080
So that's, yeah, well, sorry.

154
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,560
That's really only a risk for like,

155
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,640
yeah, one of us, maybe.

156
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,400
Reading?

157
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,220
That's fair.

158
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,480
That's a very, very fair point.

159
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,400
I guess maybe I'm giving a little bit too much credit.

160
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,800
But Zach and I actually went through several iterations

161
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,240
of possible scenarios until we finally found one

162
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,680
that he was not familiar with in at least some capacity.

163
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,840
And at least according to him, the rest of you all,

164
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,680
you know, you said you can just run whatever.

165
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,920
They don't really research.

166
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:32,140
If Zach doesn't know it, there is no way that I know it.

167
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,080
Exactly.

168
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,360
He was very demeaning when it came to

169
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,160
describing your level of familiarity

170
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,200
with Delta Green scenarios.

171
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,560
But that's neither here nor there.

172
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,680
Speaking truth with love.

173
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:47,560
Well, I mean, you dove so into Delta Green

174
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,280
when we first started, you read all these scenarios

175
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,300
and you're like, I'm not gonna run any of them.

176
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:55,060
I'm immediately gonna start writing my own cool shit.

177
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:58,000
And so you ran us through that at home for a couple of years

178
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,720
and then we started recording that.

179
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:03,400
But yeah, basically we never wanted to spoil the surprise.

180
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,280
Which was rad.

181
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,880
We're all in it for the surprise, yeah.

182
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,200
Yeah, totally.

183
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,620
And you wrote a great 40 episode story.

184
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,160
I did, I wrote a great 40 episode story for season one.

185
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,240
113 episodes.

186
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,600
And so if you haven't checked this out, you can go back.

187
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,600
We have 113 episode long season one

188
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:30,760
that tells one continuous story

189
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,160
of a small town called Contention.

190
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:37,360
And then we also have one other short little game,

191
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,280
a little bonus in which we play

192
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:42,120
Call of Cthulhu's Bleak Prospect.

193
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,280
And we actually had the author run that game for us.

194
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:48,680
So Scott Dorward, the guy who wrote Bleak Prospect

195
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,700
came on and ran us through Bleak Prospect,

196
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,240
which was an excellent time,

197
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,280
which also tied into Glass Cannon

198
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:58,120
cause they ended up running Bleak Prospect as well

199
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,360
on new game Houdis.

200
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,240
So it was really fun hearing another group

201
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,960
play through a scenario in a completely different way.

202
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,360
They played it way different than we played it.

203
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,420
Oh, did Scott run you through that one?

204
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:14,520
Oh, no, they had their DM, their GM, Troy.

205
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,360
I'm totally kidding.

206
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,440
Oh.

207
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,360
I'm being caddies.

208
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,360
Oh, oh, oh.

209
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,420
Well, speaking of Call of Cthulhu though,

210
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,220
getting back to your original question,

211
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,460
what we're gonna be running through

212
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,900
is actually from the original source book

213
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,060
that came out in the mid nineties

214
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:37,460
before Delta Green was even a system.

215
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:38,620
You know, the original source book

216
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:41,260
to basically modernize Call of Cthulhu.

217
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:43,780
And this came out in the mid nineties, I think.

218
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:46,020
So this scenario actually takes place even before that.

219
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,060
We're in like the early nineties

220
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,060
and the scenario is called Convergence

221
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:53,260
and it takes place in a little town in Tennessee.

222
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:55,060
But the great thing about this though.

223
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,660
Shit, we actually all read that one.

224
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,060
Yeah, we're very familiar with this.

225
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:00,180
Oh, fuck dude.

226
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,580
Oh, shit.

227
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,340
Oops.

228
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,160
Convergence, contention.

229
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,340
It's basically a one-to-one rip off.

230
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:09,740
I'm a tenofile, so anything related to the state.

231
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,540
This is part of being professionals though,

232
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:16,720
is really just walling that off and playing it fresh.

233
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,540
And I know you're capable of it,

234
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,260
but no, I was gonna say,

235
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:24,060
Shane Ivey actually was really generous in this case

236
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,940
because they just ran their Kickstarter

237
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:29,120
for the next dozen Delta Green books that are coming out.

238
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,740
This is being reprinted in one of those early books.

239
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,180
This is one of the lowest stretch goals.

240
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:35,140
It was like their $70,000 stretch goal.

241
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:37,320
And he was nice enough to send over the draft

242
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,860
of the new version of it this week.

243
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:40,700
Cool.

244
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,520
Very cool.

245
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,540
You hear that listeners?

246
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,820
Yeah, that's what we're rolling with today.

247
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:45,660
I dig it.

248
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,480
Shall we?

249
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,320
Let's do it.

250
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,220
I think we shall.

251
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,720
Yeah, we actually have to play a game.

252
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,940
It's just not an hour of banter per episode.

253
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:55,060
I think that we're all much more comfortable

254
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:56,860
once we start playing the game.

255
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:57,700
Yeah.

256
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:02,700
It works the opposite of a lot of GCN shows

257
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,180
where we don't want to play the game,

258
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:06,700
do everything we can to actively avoid it.

259
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:09,020
We're really stressed out just talking to each other

260
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,060
and we're like, can I please be someone else?

261
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,980
Yeah, I want to hide in my character for a while.

262
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:15,620
Thanks to Christian to be a person.

263
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,120
That's the name of the show.

264
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:17,960
Nailed it.

265
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,400
I guess let me set the scene then.

266
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,240
Okey-dokey.

267
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,060
Oh, please.

268
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:23,120
I already told you basically the timeframe.

269
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,060
We're talking the early 1990s.

270
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,120
That's when I was born.

271
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:26,960
Me too.

272
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,800
In the early 1990s?

273
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,720
Yeah, me and Luke were both born in the early 1990s.

274
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,560
Great.

275
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,560
There'll be all sorts of cultural and technological stuff

276
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,960
that you have absolutely no frame of reference for

277
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,760
for this scenario, which will be fantastic.

278
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,600
Perfect.

279
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,920
Joe and I were born in 89, so we'll be all over it.

280
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,760
Yeah.

281
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,440
We'll flip you guys through this.

282
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,420
Don't worry about it.

283
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,260
We'll follow your lead.

284
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:48,560
You got a couple of old heads with you, so it'll be fun.

285
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,640
Let's imagine the scene initially.

286
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,360
It is a nondescript office building,

287
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,640
a low rise kind of in the outskirts

288
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,320
of a modestly sized Southern city.

289
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,000
And I already kind of said which state.

290
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,960
We're talking Tennessee.

291
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:05,260
Zoom in to the building and there's a long conference room,

292
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:07,720
presumably the largest conference room in the building.

293
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,320
It looks as almost if two walls had been knocked down

294
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,500
and two conference rooms are joined together.

295
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,440
There's a comedically long table

296
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,720
in the middle of this conference room

297
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,520
with about three dozen spinning office chairs.

298
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:22,560
Those kind of chairs that try to be comfy and soft

299
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,480
are made out of that like shitty fake leather.

300
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,100
And the table is that weird wood

301
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,280
that doesn't quite look like wood.

302
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:33,920
And the walls, that old fashioned wooden paneling,

303
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,880
the colors match a little bit too much.

304
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,840
It's if anything, a bit unsettling to you.

305
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,600
At one far end of the room, there's a large crest.

306
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,920
It's an FBI logo.

307
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,480
Now the other end of the room

308
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,900
is a pulled down projector screen.

309
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:50,020
And one of those overhead projectors,

310
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,940
which will be our first technological reference

311
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,380
for those of you who...

312
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:55,420
So you put a transparency on those

313
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:58,940
and it shines a light upward and out toward the wall

314
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:01,220
so you can blow up images and show them to a room.

315
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:03,620
And this real hot air blows out of it

316
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:06,580
and it makes this like strange but comforting smell

317
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,820
and you get real sleepy.

318
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:10,940
I have a memory from when I was like in the womb

319
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:13,300
of one of those being around me.

320
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,740
My dad was a youth minister when I was growing up

321
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:18,700
and he would use them to put on song lyrics

322
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:21,000
for people to sing along for the worship times.

323
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,540
And he would do such parody covers of popular songs

324
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:27,260
as eight days a week.

325
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:29,740
Ooh, I need your love, God.

326
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:30,860
Eight days a week.

327
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,940
Pretty good stuff.

328
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:34,780
Wow.

329
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,380
Hey, God.

330
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,940
You'll find it's like peeling an onion

331
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,460
with absolutely all of us.

332
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,420
Just a couple of shreks.

333
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:48,460
And all it took was a reference to an overhead projector

334
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,300
and we got...

335
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,700
And we got completely derailed.

336
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,020
That's fine.

337
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:55,900
The initial scene setting is over.

338
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:56,740
No, just kidding.

339
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:58,060
One last thing about the overhead projector.

340
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:01,580
If you looked right in the, like the bulb, you were fucked.

341
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,540
Oh yeah.

342
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,380
This is an oversized one

343
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,540
because this is a very large screen it's projecting to.

344
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,840
It's so big that that bulb is still on

345
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,980
from the previous meeting

346
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:12,400
and you can feel the heat radiating across the room.

347
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,700
It's almost like a space heater.

348
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:14,820
It's so hot.

349
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:18,460
It's mid September, middle of the afternoon.

350
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,820
You see beams of light slipping in from the outside

351
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:24,260
through those slightly ajar hanging kind of floppy curtains

352
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,500
that you open and close with the chain.

353
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,580
It's an old building.

354
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:29,380
You see little specks of dust in the air

355
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:32,120
as you just trail off staring at the specks of dust

356
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,740
almost in a trance.

357
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,020
Then suddenly you remember

358
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:36,660
you're not the only one in this room.

359
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,940
You look around and there's four people

360
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:42,620
seated around the comedically large conference room table.

361
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,060
And it's the four of you.

362
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,180
Tell me what you see.

363
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,300
Tell me who you are.

364
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:49,380
This is the opportune time for character introductions.

365
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,900
So let's see.

366
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,900
Who should I cold call on first?

367
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,420
Luke, you're not paying attention.

368
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:59,260
I saw you looking away from me.

369
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:01,380
I was looking at my character sheet

370
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,840
hoping that you wouldn't call on me.

371
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,680
Yep, sorry.

372
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,140
I'm calling on you first.

373
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:09,100
Luke, what do people see in front of them?

374
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:13,500
Tanner Tan, Daniel Dan Lewd Hyde.

375
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:19,580
A 38 year old man, kind of thinning hair,

376
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:24,200
small sunglasses, not quite matrix style,

377
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:28,180
but like Walmart matrix sunglasses.

378
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:33,180
He has some like tribal tattoos on his arm.

379
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,360
Doesn't really look like the kind of guy

380
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,340
that would get tattoos, but one arm is just covered in them.

381
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,880
In the early nineties, that's still really cool.

382
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,180
That would be very unique.

383
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:48,840
Yeah, he's just sitting there kind of looking around

384
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,140
pretty nervous actually.

385
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:54,820
He has only really been around this just a small amount

386
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,720
and he's not sure what to expect.

387
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,700
Hi.

388
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,540
Joe, you go.

389
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:01,740
Harlan Nash is sitting there next to you.

390
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,900
He's got curly black hair.

391
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,740
He's got an eye that's kind of has a mind of its own.

392
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:10,260
It's sort of lazy, but it's also kind of there.

393
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,340
It can look at you,

394
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:15,580
but it's sometimes just looking past you a little bit.

395
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:18,160
And he's wearing a black polo

396
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,160
that's tucked into some cargo pants, lots of pockets.

397
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,180
He looks kind of like he was lost in his own world

398
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,300
and he hears you say, hey,

399
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:28,100
and he kind of turns back to you.

400
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:31,520
Oh, hello there.

401
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,300
I guess we're gonna be working together.

402
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,140
I guess so.

403
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,220
Who are you?

404
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,060
Go for it Zach.

405
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:40,100
Tanner turns to a 63 year old woman

406
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:45,100
who wears every single year in the wrinkles on her face.

407
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,480
She has white hair and it's short cropped.

408
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:51,240
It's in like a flat top on top of her head,

409
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:55,860
very shaved close on the sides, very, very flat on top.

410
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:58,100
She's wearing a sleeveless blouse.

411
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,940
She has tattoos all over her arms

412
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:05,220
and the tattoos are the chemical compounds

413
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:07,100
of different substances.

414
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:11,980
And she also has just like a skull smoking a joint

415
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:16,340
and there's a coffee pot on her forearm.

416
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:19,580
And she's just got a bunch of different stuff.

417
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:21,780
She's got a tattoo on the back of her neck

418
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:23,300
that just says crystal.

419
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,940
She's a very intense looking person.

420
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:29,140
She's wearing platform Doc Martens

421
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:32,540
and that makes her probably like 5'11

422
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,740
in those platform boots there.

423
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:38,300
She's got a purse that's doubling as a backpack around her.

424
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:41,020
And as we zoom in on her eyes,

425
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:43,280
we see that they turn back time

426
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,320
and she's quite a bit younger.

427
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:49,820
And then we zoom out and we see a team of people

428
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,220
and she's wearing a helmet.

429
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:53,020
She's got dog tags around her neck.

430
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,700
She has an assault rifle in her hand.

431
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,560
It's got a holographic sight.

432
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,460
It has targeting lasers and sound suppressors.

433
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:02,280
She has six spare magazines and a chest rig,

434
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,340
a medium pistol and a holster,

435
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,300
two spare magazines and a chest rig,

436
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,740
two frag hand grenades, two smoke grenades,

437
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:11,460
two flash bang stun grenades, a combat knife,

438
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:14,360
flexible cuffs around this tactical body armor.

439
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:18,660
She's wearing a Kevlar helmet and she is ready to go

440
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:21,260
and you see her as she just screams,

441
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:24,020
get down, get down, get down!

442
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:28,240
And then we zoom back out and she's just this old woman

443
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,880
in an extremely clean studio apartment.

444
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,360
And looking around the apartment,

445
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,760
there's a children's drawing that's on the fridge.

446
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,640
There's a playpen that's pushed neatly into the corner

447
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:45,160
and the toys have all been collected and put away.

448
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:48,080
And Cindy, Cindy Woodabaga,

449
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,960
sits down on the toilet and takes a shit

450
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,680
and she pulls out her phone

451
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:58,120
and she Googles her own name, Cindy Woodabaga.

452
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:03,100
And all of these Google results come up of the trial.

453
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,280
So this is in the future?

454
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,880
Yeah, this is a great way to ensure your character survives

455
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,500
by including a moment where she's shitting

456
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:14,500
with a smartphone 25 to 30 years after

457
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,840
the setting of our current campaign.

458
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,160
No, she is 63 years old in the room.

459
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:21,240
So she's reading a newspaper article while she shits.

460
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:24,760
Oh, right, yeah, she's got a big newspaper

461
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,280
in front of her while she's taking a shit.

462
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,400
Sorry, ah.

463
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,960
And so she's holding this newspaper up

464
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:35,600
and her eyes narrow as she reads this article

465
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,920
about Cindy Woodabaga and she was on trial for murder.

466
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:43,240
She was on trial for murdering her husband.

467
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:48,040
The case was thrown out due to some mishandling of evidence.

468
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:52,600
And she finishes up, wipes, and puts the newspaper away

469
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,520
and heads off to this meeting.

470
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:57,640
And some fingers kind of snap in front of her eyes

471
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:01,440
and her partner, Jodine, DEA.

472
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,400
You're gonna have to excuse my partner, Agent Woodabaga.

473
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,220
Woodabaga.

474
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:11,220
Sometimes, you know, her eyes, they seem to turn back time.

475
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,880
She gets a little lost in her memories.

476
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,640
I assure you, she's a very effective field agent,

477
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,800
one of the best we have.

478
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:21,460
I've worked with her for quite a while now.

479
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:26,620
So, Jodine is dressed a lot like Harlan Nash,

480
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:30,820
except he's in a white polo with cargo pants.

481
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:34,600
And he even says, like, I like your polo.

482
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,540
Very professional.

483
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,220
Thank you.

484
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:42,540
He's 39, but he looks about 45, graying everywhere.

485
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:45,260
It looks like he's recently lost a lot of hair

486
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:47,100
in the last seven or eight months.

487
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:50,140
And he's about 5'5", so you can't really tell

488
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,420
when they're sitting at the table,

489
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,620
but if they sat up, Cindy Woodabaga

490
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:55,300
would just tower over him.

491
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:59,300
He says, again, I do wanna apologize for my partner.

492
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,980
Sometimes she just goes, you know.

493
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:04,620
It's the analytical investigative mind

494
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:07,560
that makes her such an effective crime fighter.

495
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:11,460
And you kinda just gotta roll with these unorthodox methods.

496
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,380
What's happening now is that her,

497
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,840
she looked, well, don't look too hard,

498
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,100
but look into her eyes.

499
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:20,720
Hey, how many of these have you guys been on?

500
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:23,080
This is my first.

501
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,060
This is my first in an official capacity.

502
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:30,260
It's, I've been exposed.

503
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:31,100
Me too.

504
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:32,900
What's that mean?

505
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:33,720
Which one?

506
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,820
That one, and it's like some chemical compound.

507
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:37,740
It's morphine.

508
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,860
That's interesting.

509
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:44,060
This one is Japanese for perseverance.

510
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,660
If you knew Japanese, you would know

511
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:48,740
that it's actually a Chinese symbol that says crab.

512
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:49,620
Yeah.

513
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:52,920
Which roughly translates.

514
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:58,140
I wanna play the Cindy scenario, actually.

515
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:58,980
Is that okay?

516
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,900
Can we go back to the flashback?

517
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:01,740
Sure.

518
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:02,820
Are you fully prepped there, Zach?

519
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:03,660
Oh yeah.

520
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:04,480
Can you run that?

521
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,320
I can roll up a quick character.

522
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,660
It did sound like he had enough equipment

523
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:07,820
for the rest of us.

524
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:12,380
She was on the DEA's FAST team,

525
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:16,060
which is the Foreign Deployed Advisory Support Team,

526
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:19,320
which was paramilitary units in far-flung areas

527
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:22,380
of the world where narcotics are grown and processed.

528
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:25,020
But that was a long time ago,

529
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:29,980
and now she is just a desk jockey with Joe Dean here,

530
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:33,700
but they got pulled into Delta Green about,

531
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,920
what, six months ago?

532
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,080
Yeah, I imagine pretty soon after.

533
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,620
Also, if you're new to us,

534
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:42,660
can you tell which one, new listeners, is the DM?

535
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:43,620
Pfft.

536
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:46,460
It's Luke.

537
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:48,420
Yep.

538
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,540
All right, so you're all there now.

539
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,460
You're in the room.

540
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:57,700
You snapped out of your dust-fueled sunlight trance.

541
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,100
This conversation happened.

542
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:02,060
The two of you that know each other, great.

543
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:04,680
You've also met the two new folks that are here as well.

544
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,320
Behind your chairs, you all have bags.

545
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,060
You just flew in this morning.

546
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:12,660
This is the FBI field office in Memphis, Tennessee,

547
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:17,580
and you were summoned here by an FBI agent, James Derringer.

548
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:18,960
You checked in.

549
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,100
This is, again, all pre-9-11, right?

550
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:23,200
So security, pretty lax.

551
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,340
You showed up, you flashed some random ID,

552
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,580
they give you a visitor badge,

553
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:29,660
and you were just strolling around an FBI field office.

554
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,460
And you went to this room,

555
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:33,180
but you've been waiting for a while,

556
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,260
and waiting, and waiting, and waiting.

557
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:37,700
And eventually, what seems like could have been

558
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:40,180
over an hour of waiting for this guy,

559
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:44,140
he finally busts into the room in a hurry.

560
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:47,140
You see this man, relatively tall, lean,

561
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:49,340
and with very deep set eyes.

562
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:53,180
And as he walks in, there's just a grimace on his face.

563
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:57,460
Just this almost persistent, I guess,

564
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,900
resting bitch face kind of thing going on with him.

565
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:02,580
What's the early 90s turn for resting bitch face?

566
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:03,620
Yeah, that's the problem.

567
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:06,180
I mean, we can't refer to pumpkin spice,

568
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:08,460
he's not sipping a pumpkin spice latte,

569
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:10,380
wearing Uggs or anything else.

570
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,220
I mean, they're...

571
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:13,420
He looks like a sour puss.

572
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:15,020
He looks like a sour puss, and he busts in,

573
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:17,660
and he's, oh, agents.

574
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:19,860
Thanks for finally making it.

575
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:24,820
I've got something that I need to keep off the FBI,

576
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:26,180
say, radar for a bit.

577
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:30,340
And I think your unique backgrounds probably can help.

578
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:32,940
Before I get too much into it, let me just show you.

579
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:35,980
So he rolls over a TV on a cart,

580
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:39,340
one of those big CRT, 30-inch TVs

581
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:42,780
that probably weighs 80 pounds back then,

582
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:44,780
cart with a strap over the top,

583
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:47,420
kind of reels that over, there's a VCR.

584
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,140
Agent Dean immediately runs over

585
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:51,780
to help him plug in cables.

586
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:54,420
Oh, I always get the yellow video mixed up

587
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,700
with the white audio. Channel three, channel three.

588
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:59,980
Oh yeah, Cindy looks over at Tanner and is like,

589
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:02,860
are we gonna watch some Magic School Bus, you think?

590
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:06,140
I don't think we will be.

591
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,300
Do you think so?

592
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:12,060
I'll tell you what, this isn't some Magic School Bus.

593
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:13,100
Hits play.

594
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:16,260
Security footage starts playing at a gas station,

595
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,100
it looks like.

596
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,940
It's just one of those overhead cameras

597
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:21,380
kind of angled at the cashier.

598
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:23,740
And cashier's just there kind of standing,

599
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:25,580
chilling, organizing some stuff.

600
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:29,300
And a young man approaches the counter looking agitated.

601
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,260
He says something to the cashier.

602
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,780
The cashier says something back.

603
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:35,100
You can't hear anything because there's no audio.

604
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,700
This is crappy, low resolution,

605
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:40,220
constantly looping security footage.

606
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:42,740
But he says something and then the cashier just stares

607
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:43,940
at him very blankly,

608
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:46,460
like not quite understanding what he's saying.

609
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:50,500
Then you see the young man wind up with his fist,

610
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,740
just like a normal punch,

611
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,540
going to punch this guy in the head.

612
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:57,700
He makes contact, but you can see from the impact,

613
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,700
the guy's head almost deflates.

614
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,980
His skull instantly shatters.

615
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:04,300
And as the punch continues to connect,

616
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,420
the head gets knocked cleanly off the body.

617
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,260
Holy shit.

618
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:13,100
So skull crushed, head pops off,

619
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,660
head hits the back wall, flops down.

620
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:18,180
The body's kind of there stumbling a bit,

621
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:21,740
blood squirting out of the stump, if you will,

622
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,460
that is his neck.

623
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:26,980
And then the body just falls and collapses.

624
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:31,900
The young man steps back with a look of shock.

625
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:33,660
And then steps forward,

626
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:34,980
hits some keys on the cash register,

627
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:38,340
pulls out all the cash he can, runs off screen.

628
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:40,060
Then you see him come back into frame,

629
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:42,420
basically as he's walking out of the gas station

630
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:44,220
with a bunch of pill bottles.

631
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:46,940
Money in one hand, pill bottles in his arms,

632
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:51,580
and then rushes off camera, presumably leaving the scene.

633
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:52,580
And that's actually gonna give us

634
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:54,540
our first roll of the evening.

635
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:58,540
Roll me some sanity for that neck you just saw.

636
00:27:58,540 --> 00:27:59,980
That was intense.

637
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:01,700
Fail, fail.

638
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:03,180
Pass, 39 on a 40,

639
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,900
but Jodine still definitely vomits

640
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,420
on the conference room floor.

641
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:10,140
Harlan fails, that's an 82 on a 50.

642
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:11,580
All right, if you pass, it's a zero,

643
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:15,460
but all you failures, one point of sanity damage.

644
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:18,620
So you see this, the tape ends.

645
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:21,620
Agent Derringer sees the vomit on the table.

646
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:23,100
It's like, ah, rookie.

647
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,020
I guess we all gotta start somewhere,

648
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:27,220
but we got pulled into this.

649
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:29,420
He held up six gas stations and drugstores

650
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:30,940
in the last two weeks.

651
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:33,380
First here in Tennessee, then he crossed state lines,

652
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:36,620
bringing us into it, into Alabama, then Georgia.

653
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:39,500
We eventually got him, took some bullets,

654
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,740
but we managed to get him, and we have him here.

655
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:43,660
He's downstairs and holding.

656
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:44,620
He's alive.

657
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:45,940
He's alive.

658
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,780
Took four MP5 bullets.

659
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:51,700
And that slowed him down just enough for us

660
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:52,580
to restrain him.

661
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:53,900
Center mass or?

662
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:56,140
Yes, four center mass bullets.

663
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:57,500
We got him.

664
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,380
We got agents downstairs watching him.

665
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:01,260
Let me warn you, first and foremost,

666
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:02,540
not everyone here is your friend.

667
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,740
Those agents down there in the room with them,

668
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:05,900
they're not part of this.

669
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,900
So be careful what you say in front of them.

670
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:11,740
Two, the reason you're here, this is a drug investigation.

671
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:15,460
The cover story is this kid went on a crime spree

672
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:17,540
because something went south with some drug dealers

673
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:18,780
he was dealing with.

674
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:22,100
He needed to score meds, some money to pay him back.

675
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,540
I don't think that's the case,

676
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:27,180
but that's how we can get DEA agents, a marshal,

677
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:29,180
someone who's good at tracking

678
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:32,340
and investigating, ATF agent as well.

679
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:34,580
But the whole point is you're keeping this

680
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:36,260
off the FBI's radar.

681
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:37,820
You've got about a week.

682
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:39,180
Be careful calling me here.

683
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:41,860
If I have anything for you, I will send you a courier.

684
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:44,660
I'll send someone out to you with any message,

685
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:46,420
but we're gonna need a password,

686
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:48,180
a secret phrase, if you will.

687
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:49,540
Any suggestions?

688
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:51,420
Bubble gum tree?

689
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:52,780
Bubble gum tree it is.

690
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:54,260
Yeah, that's strange.

691
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,100
ESPN.

692
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:59,620
I just got that.

693
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:02,780
I don't miss much college football anymore.

694
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:04,540
I'll brief you more once we get down there,

695
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:05,980
if you wanna check this guy out.

696
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:07,420
Do you have any questions for me now though,

697
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:09,540
before we go in front of those guards and stuff?

698
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,820
Harlan raises his hand.

699
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:14,140
Has anybody seen this footage other than you and us?

700
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:15,340
No.

701
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:18,100
So the agents downstairs, they don't know about

702
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,220
the strength that this man might possess?

703
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:22,260
Oh no, they know he's dangerous.

704
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,900
In fact, the three agents downstairs

705
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:26,740
were part of who apprehended him.

706
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:30,420
It was basically a roadblock in Georgia

707
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:31,540
when we finally stopped him.

708
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:32,780
He had stolen a car.

709
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:34,860
We managed to spike strip the car down,

710
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:36,500
got him out of the car.

711
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:40,140
Several FBI agents plus a state trooper shot at him.

712
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,780
That's when they finally got him.

713
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:44,460
But before they even got those four bullets into him,

714
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:48,500
he got to a trooper, grabbed his shotgun

715
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:51,660
and was able to basically bend it in half.

716
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:53,820
So these guys have seen his strength.

717
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:56,700
Bugs Bunny, Elmer Fudd, it is his shotgun.

718
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,620
That's what you're telling me?

719
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:58,460
Yeah.

720
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:00,060
They know if he gets out of his restraints,

721
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,100
they're in trouble.

722
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:01,940
Well, we can see-

723
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:03,100
Dad orders.

724
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,260
Well, sorry.

725
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,100
It was a little delay.

726
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:05,940
No, I just missed it.

727
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:09,780
Could you both sit down for a second?

728
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:10,620
Yeah, sorry.

729
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:11,460
You're getting very hyped.

730
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:14,780
I can't stop fiddling with this cables.

731
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:16,900
How many heads did he pop off?

732
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,780
It all started with his dad actually.

733
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:23,100
He went missing, gone from home for about two days.

734
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,660
This was eight days ago.

735
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:27,900
Boy went missing, showed back up two days later,

736
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,500
no clue where he was.

737
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,260
He was in a lot of pain.

738
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:32,580
Parents put him to bed.

739
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:35,820
Couple hours later, his dad heard his crying,

740
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:38,900
went to check on him, touched him on the shoulder,

741
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,980
asked him if he was okay.

742
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:44,180
Boy turns around, punches him right through the chest,

743
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:47,540
blows a hole about a foot wide

744
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:51,140
right through the center of his chest, dies instantly.

745
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:54,980
Kid hops up, runs out of the house.

746
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,820
That's when the crime spree started.

747
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:58,820
How old is the suspect?

748
00:31:58,820 --> 00:31:59,660
18.

749
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:00,500
What's his name?

750
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:03,540
His name's Billy Ray Spivey.

751
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:05,340
Just graduated from high school.

752
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:08,900
Recently applied for a job at the local Saturn Auto plant

753
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:11,580
about an hour south of his town.

754
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:13,740
Child of Rich and Angel Spivey.

755
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:16,780
Has anybody tested him for drugs?

756
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:17,620
PZP?

757
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:18,460
We're running tests.

758
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:20,900
Who's gonna have access to those blood results?

759
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,340
Just me to start.

760
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:24,020
Let's probably keep it that way for a minute.

761
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:24,860
Yeah.

762
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:28,060
To answer your other question, no drugs.

763
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:29,460
No drugs in his system.

764
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,020
Outside of the stuff he'd been stealing.

765
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:34,340
He'd been stealing pain meds at a lot of these pharmacies.

766
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:36,300
Was he taking them or trying to sell them?

767
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,780
Taking them.

768
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:38,740
A lot of them.

769
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:41,260
Did he have a previous criminal record?

770
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:42,220
No record at all.

771
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:44,660
No record at all.

772
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:46,140
That's why it doesn't make much sense.

773
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:50,300
Town he's from, Groversville, small town, 1200 people.

774
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:52,020
Itty bitty tiny town.

775
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:53,460
Not much crime there.

776
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:56,020
Even this whole drug angle's gonna look kinda weak there.

777
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:58,220
But it's what we gotta go with a lot better

778
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:00,820
than people running around with superhuman strength

779
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:02,400
punching people's heads off.

780
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,700
Generally the public doesn't like that.

781
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:06,380
Well before I started working with my new partner,

782
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:09,520
I did a little public relations.

783
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:13,220
We've got folks pretty well terrified of methamphetamine.

784
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:16,980
I think we can say this is some kinda strange super myth

785
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:18,660
my partner and I are investigating.

786
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:21,780
Especially if the blood results stay between

787
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:23,340
the three of us.

788
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:24,860
Well, and these two.

789
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:26,580
No, we're running all sorts of tests.

790
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:29,500
I'll show you a bit more when we get down there.

791
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,180
How do you have him restrained?

792
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:35,760
He is in a chair with dozens of sets of handcuffs,

793
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,480
various chains.

794
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,060
He looks basically like a mummy

795
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:41,660
wrapped into that chair with metal.

796
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:44,340
And he's heavily sedated right now.

797
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:46,060
That boy wakes up fully.

798
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:48,020
He's even gonna break through all those cuffs.

799
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:50,300
Well we better get to him quick then.

800
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,740
You wanna check him out?

801
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:52,940
Let's go look at him.

802
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:54,280
Y'all bust out of the conference room.

803
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,820
He takes you to an elevator.

804
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:58,180
You're on like the second or third floor now.

805
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:01,440
You go down, ground floor, basement,

806
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,860
and then the sub-basement of this building.

807
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:06,540
That's like the secure, secure part of the building.

808
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:07,940
That's where 15 years from now,

809
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,140
where all the servers will be

810
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:11,540
when they actually have real computers and stuff.

811
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:13,700
Right now that's presumably where they keep all the weapons

812
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:17,820
and the terrible superhuman strength murderers.

813
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:20,220
It's a good combo.

814
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:22,940
He leads you into a room though, heavy steel door.

815
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:25,420
You walk inside and it's exactly what he described,

816
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:28,780
which is the chair, guy bolted down into it,

817
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:30,940
and then three guys with assault rifles

818
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:32,380
pointed directly at him.

819
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:35,620
They're body armored up, a SWAT team basically,

820
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:36,920
trained on this guy.

821
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:41,420
And he's there, just in his chair, kind of loopy.

822
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:44,580
Do any of you have medicine over 20?

823
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:45,420
Nope.

824
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,260
No.

825
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,460
Nope.

826
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:50,280
Humint over 40.

827
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,120
Yes.

828
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:51,940
Yep.

829
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:52,780
Great.

830
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:53,620
With the Humint over 40,

831
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:58,500
it is the telltale signs of him being heavily sedated.

832
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:01,180
Almost half asleep, his eyes are droopy,

833
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:02,700
a little bloodshot,

834
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:07,420
and he's just kind of rocking back and forth in the chair.

835
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:09,500
Poor kid didn't know what he was getting into.

836
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:12,380
He thought that he learned something new

837
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:15,700
or just got caught up in it and then killed his own dad.

838
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,100
How could you say poor kid?

839
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:19,020
He murdered people. Can you fucking imagine?

840
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:21,260
Yeah, but from his perspective, he doesn't know.

841
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,260
What do you mean he doesn't know?

842
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:23,380
He did it.

843
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:25,460
Yeah, but if he was gone, missing for a while,

844
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:27,260
who knows what kind of state he was in

845
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:28,460
when he did all that stuff.

846
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,560
He was in three states, actually.

847
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:33,860
That is correct.

848
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:35,860
Why'd you do it?

849
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:44,500
Uh, it hurts, it hurts.

850
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:46,580
What hurts?

851
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:47,660
Everything.

852
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:49,300
I forgot you got shot four times.

853
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:51,140
That probably doesn't feel too good, does it?

854
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:52,620
That's not what hurts though, is it?

855
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:57,620
No, my arms, my legs, everything hurts.

856
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,540
Where were you?

857
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:04,420
Where were you when you went missing?

858
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:05,580
I don't know.

859
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:08,020
You fucking tell me right now, where were you?

860
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:12,140
She like shakes his face and Joe pulls her off.

861
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:15,660
I don't know where I was and then I came back

862
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:20,460
and it just, everything hurts so much and I'm so hungry.

863
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:22,820
Is that why you were stealing the drugs?

864
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:23,700
Because you hurt?

865
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:26,660
Yes, yes, nothing helps.

866
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:28,620
You know what from?

867
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:29,460
Are you sick?

868
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:33,420
I don't know.

869
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:35,100
I just want the pain to stop.

870
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,780
Harlan's gonna kind of part the crowd

871
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,820
and get real close to his face.

872
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:43,500
Can you remember the last thing you remember

873
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,260
before you don't remember?

874
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,420
Lights.

875
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:51,540
What kind of lights, street lights?

876
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:55,180
I don't, bright, I don't know.

877
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:56,700
You said you didn't know where you were,

878
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,820
but could you describe where you were?

879
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:04,900
No, I woke up in my car going to see my girlfriend

880
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:07,900
and I don't know.

881
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,820
What's your girlfriend's name?

882
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:12,780
Her name's Jane, Jane Allen.

883
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:17,260
I miss her, I haven't seen her in over a week now.

884
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:18,860
Maybe we should get Jane on the phone

885
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:20,540
and see what she knows.

886
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:22,460
We actually, we have had Jane on the phone.

887
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:24,260
She misses you and she wants to talk to you,

888
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:26,500
but we can't really let that happen unless,

889
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:29,020
unless you really fully answer all our questions.

890
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:32,900
I don't know what to answer, I just want the pain to stop.

891
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:35,300
Okay, well, did anything strange

892
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:38,180
or out of the ordinary happen in the week

893
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:40,940
leading up to you disappearing?

894
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:43,020
I don't think so.

895
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:45,700
You don't remember anything out of the ordinary?

896
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:48,020
No, I applied for a job.

897
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:49,180
At the Saturn plant?

898
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:53,500
Yeah, the sat, I just wanted to build cars like my daddy.

899
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,100
Where did your daddy build cars?

900
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,420
At the Saturn plant.

901
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:00,020
Just like your daddy, all right.

902
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:01,340
Just like my daddy.

903
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:03,180
So you went there and applied in person?

904
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,020
Yes.

905
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:06,260
Which is of course the only way to do it right now.

906
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:08,460
Correct, and where's he now?

907
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:12,580
Your dad, your father.

908
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:16,900
What'd you do?

909
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:19,460
What'd you do to your dad?

910
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:21,660
Rutabaga, Agent Rutabaga.

911
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:23,940
Harland's gonna put a hand on Rutabaga.

912
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:27,900
Hey, that's not necessary.

913
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,420
Hey, sorry, I just thought it would,

914
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:31,700
maybe they'll just like punch something out of him.

915
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,780
Yeah, but he killed his dad.

916
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:35,580
I don't feel sorry for this guy.

917
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:37,620
You don't have to feel sorry.

918
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:40,420
Sidebar, y'all, quick sidebar.

919
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:43,140
Have you ever fucking interrogated?

920
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:45,180
I'd like my colleagues to step into the hallway with me.

921
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:46,180
I follow.

922
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,380
What was your name?

923
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:48,740
You can call me Tan.

924
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:49,580
Tan.

925
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:50,420
Yeah, Tanner.

926
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:52,020
Yeah, what was your investigative background?

927
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:58,220
Well, I'm in the ATF,

928
00:38:59,100 --> 00:38:59,940
so-

929
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:01,100
Is this your first week?

930
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:04,260
In this kind of situation,

931
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:07,340
I ain't never seen punched in the heads off or nothing.

932
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:11,780
Mostly, you know, alcohol, tobacco, and firearms, really.

933
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:15,220
I'm sure at no time in the near future

934
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:18,180
will the ATF get involved in anything hairier than that.

935
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:24,180
I'm taking a trip to Waco later.

936
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:25,660
Uh-oh, uh-oh.

937
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:29,660
All right, so y'all know about,

938
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:32,540
yeah, yeah, well, you don't have to say it.

939
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:34,660
You know about the stuff, right, the spooky stuff?

940
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:35,620
I'm aware.

941
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:38,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's kind of scary.

942
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:40,180
Don't you think a kid punching a hole

943
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:41,660
through his daddy's chest

944
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:43,620
and then a cashier's head clean off,

945
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:45,780
is that normal to you or is that spooky?

946
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:46,940
It is spooky.

947
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:49,780
Yeah, so we're here to investigate the spooky shit,

948
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:52,740
figure out why it's happening,

949
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:54,100
and keep it fucking quiet

950
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:57,340
from all the people who don't know about the spooky shit.

951
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:59,740
It doesn't matter if you sympathize with this dude

952
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:02,340
for punching a hole in his daddy or not.

953
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:03,580
When you're investigating a perp,

954
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:07,380
you gotta use advanced psychology

955
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:09,300
to make him think you're on his side

956
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:10,460
or sometimes threaten him.

957
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:13,540
Okay, okay, I'm gonna try a second approach.

958
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:15,380
Yeah, Rutabaga, you need to calm down.

959
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:17,260
Rutabaga, and so she takes her bagpipe off.

960
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:18,860
Is that your speech impediment or your name?

961
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:21,260
No, my name is W, Rutabaga.

962
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:23,580
Yeah.

963
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:26,340
She takes off her backpack,

964
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:28,140
which is like a purse that she has

965
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:30,780
a bunch of random stuff in.

966
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:34,500
She grabs a cardigan out of it and some cheaters.

967
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,740
She throws the cardigan on over her blouse,

968
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:38,700
covering up all of her tattoos,

969
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:42,420
and throws on these little gas station glasses

970
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:44,180
with a long chain on them.

971
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:45,020
Cheaters?

972
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:45,840
Yeah, cheaters.

973
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,660
Yeah, like reader glasses.

974
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:48,500
Just magnified glasses?

975
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:50,780
Yeah, but they're not like, they're not real glasses,

976
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:52,320
they're not prescription, they're just cheaters.

977
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,440
She puts on this get up with her reading glasses,

978
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:59,440
not cheaters, and her cardigan.

979
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,680
She is gonna head back into the room

980
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,620
with a much different demeanor.

981
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:09,440
Well, hello there, Sonny.

982
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:13,480
I just wanted to talk to you, Billy Ray, for just a moment.

983
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,360
I hold the others briefly back at the door.

984
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:18,480
I'm like, as crazy as this seems, I seen it work.

985
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,520
Especially with a sedated boy like this,

986
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:23,560
he's probably not gonna know it's the same lady.

987
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,560
It's the real magic of this wild card.

988
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,840
Billy Ray.

989
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,440
Grandma?

990
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,320
Yeah, that's right.

991
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,160
Is that you?

992
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,280
That's right, it's good to see you again, boy.

993
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,560
But you're dead.

994
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,700
Well, the Lord works in mysterious ways.

995
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:47,320
I'm here to help you figure out what happened.

996
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,160
Okay.

997
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:53,160
So let's close your eyes nice and tight.

998
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:56,720
And she pinches both of his cheeks lovingly,

999
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,560
just like very soft, in a comfortable way.

1000
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:00,920
This isn't weird.

1001
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:05,920
And she says, now close your eyes and think real hard-like.

1002
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:10,640
Good.

1003
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:13,760
Good.

1004
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,160
Good.

1005
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:18,160
And she just wants to get him like in a relaxed state

1006
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,760
in order to hopefully just gain

1007
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:23,440
one more pertinent piece of information here.

1008
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,120
Sure, I like that.

1009
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:28,160
Give me a persuade roll with that.

1010
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,560
Okay.

1011
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:30,900
35 on a 60.

1012
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:31,800
All right, great.

1013
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:38,560
The lights everywhere, they cut me all over my body.

1014
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,480
Tiny little cuts everywhere.

1015
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:49,640
My legs, my arms, everywhere where it hurts, cuts.

1016
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:53,280
Does he have any like visible cuts that we can see?

1017
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,440
Give me a search roll.

1018
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,760
Past 10 on a 50.

1019
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,300
Yeah, 42 on a 70.

1020
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:06,480
22 on a 15.

1021
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,480
22? Crit success.

1022
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:08,380
Yeah, hell yeah.

1023
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:09,220
Great.

1024
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:13,000
So the whole time that he was talking,

1025
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:15,080
she was like turning back toward them

1026
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:19,800
and slowly like giving them the come here with her hand.

1027
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:22,720
So they all like creep into the room behind her

1028
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:26,440
as he's like talking with his eyes closed.

1029
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:31,120
And you're, yeah, you're just like looking at his wrists

1030
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,960
in his ankles and everything.

1031
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:37,320
He's wearing a pair of a jean cut off shorts,

1032
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,960
old beat up Chuck Taylors

1033
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:42,680
and a even more beat up Metallica t-shirt.

1034
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:45,120
But yeah, you look closely,

1035
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:47,960
especially Joe Dean with that crit success.

1036
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:50,320
You see the tiniest of incisions.

1037
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:54,840
They look almost like a relatively large needle poke

1038
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:58,240
that has been kind of healed over, almost laser like.

1039
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:02,960
Randomly spaced out all along his arms, all along his legs.

1040
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:05,200
Basically when you look very, very, very closely,

1041
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,100
they look almost like hair follicles.

1042
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:08,300
Mm.

1043
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:09,460
But bigger.

1044
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:11,860
Initially they didn't see him on their inspection.

1045
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:14,540
Can we pull back his collar on his shirt

1046
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:17,100
to see if they're on his neck and back?

1047
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:18,420
His pussy and his crack.

1048
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:26,120
Does he have tiny cuts on his pussy, David?

1049
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:28,820
The answer is yes.

1050
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:31,980
Yeah, all over him.

1051
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:35,340
Basically anywhere there's musculature on his body,

1052
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:38,980
there seems to be these random pricks.

1053
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:41,660
They're a little more concentrated in areas of heavy muscle

1054
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:45,420
like around his calves and thighs, biceps,

1055
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:48,500
and then a little less so in other areas like his hands,

1056
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:50,100
but it's all still there.

1057
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:52,120
Harlan is still kind of toward the back of the room

1058
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:55,140
and he wants to grab James Derringer

1059
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:57,260
and just pull him into the hallway real quick.

1060
00:44:57,260 --> 00:45:00,300
Has anyone X-rayed this boy?

1061
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:01,780
He looks around to make sure no one's listening

1062
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:03,920
because you still are in the hallway of an FBI building

1063
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:05,800
and wants to make sure no one is around.

1064
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:08,220
It's like, yeah, we're gonna run those tests too.

1065
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:09,920
We took tissue samples though.

1066
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:14,360
We did notice some of these operating sites.

1067
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:15,400
Took tissue samples.

1068
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:17,240
They've already been sent to a lab.

1069
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:19,200
I'll make sure to get the results.

1070
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,280
I will send someone with the results once I have them,

1071
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:23,960
but it could be a couple of days.

1072
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:26,440
And when you initially took these samples,

1073
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:30,680
was the rate of healing consistent with an eight day period?

1074
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:33,160
There's something odd about the boy's muscle.

1075
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:34,600
We're not sure what it is,

1076
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:37,520
but as far as we can tell from the tests we've done,

1077
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,520
his skeleton's been unchanged.

1078
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,080
It's only his muscle.

1079
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:43,720
We think the superhuman strength,

1080
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:48,160
if he were to say, try to pick up a car, he probably could,

1081
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:50,680
but then his bones would snap under the weight.

1082
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:54,820
So we think that's the limits of this boy's ability.

1083
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:56,320
That's all we know now though.

1084
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:57,880
We're gonna wait for the tests.

1085
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,720
Needless to say, we wanna be in the know

1086
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:01,800
as soon as those results come in.

1087
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,800
Of course, you're my eyes and ears on the ground.

1088
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,920
Joe Dean steps out in the hallway too.

1089
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:09,120
And I guess we'll say you catch him up quickly on that.

1090
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:14,000
Anyway, he says, is there a friendly doctor in town?

1091
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,660
Is there someone you could get into this sub-basement

1092
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:20,880
who could be trusted that could run some more expediated,

1093
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,520
perhaps radical tests?

1094
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:26,400
Not gonna be any faster.

1095
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:29,280
I have a friendly doctor on the case though.

1096
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:30,920
I'm not even leaving it to chance

1097
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:32,900
of some Miranda running these tests.

1098
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:34,600
That's part of why it's gonna take a little longer

1099
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,360
is I want fewer eyes on this.

1100
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:39,560
Well, how would you feel if we went in there

1101
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:41,680
with some tweezers and a magnifying glass

1102
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:44,160
and just dug around one of those injection sites

1103
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:45,480
and saw what we could see?

1104
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:48,260
See if we couldn't pull anything out?

1105
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:54,340
Boy's dangerous, but if you want to, you can go for it.

1106
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:58,660
I'm still in there rubbing his cheeks.

1107
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:02,460
Tan has wandered out into the hallway too.

1108
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:04,400
Also quickly gets caught up.

1109
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,340
Tan, here's the rundown.

1110
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:07,220
Oh, thanks.

1111
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:09,460
Have we given him any painkillers?

1112
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:11,600
Like try to put him at ease.

1113
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:13,420
Is he, he's on him right now?

1114
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:18,300
He's been robbing and popping pain pills this whole way

1115
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:19,140
and they ain't helping him.

1116
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:20,480
Well, I guess it can't hurt too bad

1117
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:21,740
to dig around in there then.

1118
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:24,020
This boy is on enough morphine right now

1119
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:26,220
to kill most people.

1120
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:29,200
I don't know that digging around is necessary.

1121
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,060
We've already, they've taken tissue samples.

1122
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:32,100
I assume you would have said

1123
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:34,340
if you found something in those samples, correct?

1124
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:35,580
They've taken tissue samples

1125
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:36,840
and they're gonna get all the results

1126
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:37,980
in a couple of days, right?

1127
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:39,500
But we could just see with our own eyes.

1128
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:42,240
I want to see what's in one of them holes.

1129
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:43,340
I mean, they would have told us

1130
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:45,180
if there was something in a hole, wouldn't they have?

1131
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:46,820
There's only one way to find out.

1132
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:50,780
I assume it takes a complicated series of phone calls

1133
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:53,740
and faxes, perhaps even hand sent letters to.

1134
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:55,700
So what are you gonna do then?

1135
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:58,020
Are you saying the phone calls and hand sent letters

1136
00:47:58,020 --> 00:48:01,900
for consent to operate on him in the basement or?

1137
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:03,500
Oh, no, no, no, none of that.

1138
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:04,340
I just meant.

1139
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:05,580
Oh, okay.

1140
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:07,120
Yeah, so Joe's question is

1141
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:08,420
they've already taken a tissue sample.

1142
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:10,220
Did they find anything in those sites?

1143
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:11,140
So we don't know yet.

1144
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:13,360
But we're not gonna know that for a while, right?

1145
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:14,420
It's muscle tissue.

1146
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:18,500
It looks largely similar to normal muscle tissue,

1147
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:21,440
but yeah, you're not gonna know for a couple of days.

1148
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:24,560
Your plan is to use a tweezer or magnifying glass.

1149
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:27,920
I'm just asking how they would have seen as much of that

1150
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:30,480
as you would in this moment, right?

1151
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,320
That's a question for him.

1152
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:34,720
Is that information included in that report

1153
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:35,640
that you have so far?

1154
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:38,760
Yes, there's probably nothing more you can learn.

1155
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:42,280
However, if you want to dig around in the wounds

1156
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:47,280
of an incredibly dangerous multi-state killer.

1157
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:48,120
Yeah, it's on the table.

1158
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:49,240
We could go digging.

1159
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:51,060
It's your funeral, as they say.

1160
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:54,920
Maybe there's a gooey duck in there.

1161
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:57,080
That would be an odd place for a gooey duck.

1162
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:01,120
You know, sometimes you get the genius

1163
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:02,320
of the grandma routine,

1164
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:04,360
and sometimes it's just shit like that.

1165
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:05,680
That's why I'm doing great.

1166
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:07,360
It's so random.

1167
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:12,280
I think I've got you up to speed here.

1168
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:14,160
The only other thing you need to know,

1169
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,080
he's not the only one that's reported

1170
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:18,360
going missing in Grover'sville.

1171
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:20,440
That's pertinent information.

1172
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:23,440
There's been a series of similar disappearances.

1173
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:25,480
How many is a series?

1174
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:26,960
It's mostly anecdotal,

1175
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:31,160
but we've heard from him in his delirium

1176
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:34,200
about this happening to some of his friends and stuff.

1177
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:35,040
It's strange.

1178
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:37,360
It's a weird town, to be honest.

1179
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:39,920
Small town, 1200 people.

1180
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:44,480
It's the butt end of a lot of UFO conspiracy jokes.

1181
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,800
You know, shows up in the tabloids.

1182
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,040
Weird place.

1183
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:49,600
And what is the name of that town again?

1184
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:50,440
Grover'sville.

1185
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:51,880
Grover'sville.

1186
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:54,520
The UFO conspiracy stuff,

1187
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:56,920
what does that date back to?

1188
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:59,040
No, it's been going on for years.

1189
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:02,320
You know, it's just random crackpot stories,

1190
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:04,880
moronic ideas.

1191
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:07,360
Place is just the butt end of regional

1192
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:09,240
and even national news headlines.

1193
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:11,120
You like that term butt end.

1194
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:13,240
Butt end.

1195
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:19,120
Did he give any names of people

1196
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:21,360
he knows that got disappeared too?

1197
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:22,440
Nah, I don't know.

1198
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:23,840
He's worried about his girlfriend.

1199
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:27,560
Yeah, do we have Jane Allen's contact information?

1200
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:29,440
Yeah, we can get that for you.

1201
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:31,800
Do you have some sort of portable telephone device

1202
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:35,520
or a telephone that I can call Jane on?

1203
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:36,920
I wish we had the government funding

1204
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:39,320
for those glorious devices.

1205
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:42,040
Well, the DEA car,

1206
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:46,080
we came down in here and it does have a car phone.

1207
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:51,080
Wow, you got one of those new ones.

1208
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:54,720
Well, there was definitely some pork,

1209
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,880
some graft in our budget this year.

1210
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:00,000
So yeah, we got some nice new cars.

1211
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,240
You don't need to borrow a car from me.

1212
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:05,040
No, we got a cool DEA car.

1213
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:09,320
Yeah, it's got a mounted machine gun on top.

1214
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:10,480
It can fly.

1215
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:14,480
Mostly just the car phone, but it shoots lasers.

1216
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:20,440
Well, I had requisitioned a 1992 white Ford Bronco

1217
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:22,000
if you're interested.

1218
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:25,440
Wow, I bet that baby could really move.

1219
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:28,720
Maybe we can take both.

1220
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,640
Yeah, let's take both.

1221
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:33,400
Maybe one could chase the other on the highway and see.

1222
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:37,360
We go there in the DEA car,

1223
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:40,600
but we leave the scene in the Bronco.

1224
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:43,240
Somebody has got a draft.

1225
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:46,680
The DEA car can drive itself.

1226
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:49,920
Right, it's got the car phone

1227
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:52,360
and also it's kit from that driver.

1228
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:58,160
So what do you want to do?

1229
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:02,680
So Cindy Woodabaga is still just like pinching cheeks,

1230
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:06,040
rubbing face of this Billy Ray Spivey.

1231
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:09,080
And after she gets all the pertinent information

1232
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:11,940
that she thinks she's attained from him,

1233
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:16,180
her face quickly changes back to the hardened face

1234
00:52:16,180 --> 00:52:17,020
you saw before.

1235
00:52:17,020 --> 00:52:21,220
And she gets real close in his ear and she just whispers,

1236
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:23,380
your grandpappy was a.

1237
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:29,340
What the hell?

1238
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:30,860
And she just looks into his eyes.

1239
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:35,180
She's trying to get like any pull on his mental state.

1240
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:36,420
I'd like to look into Zach's eyes

1241
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:37,980
and get a pull on his mental state.

1242
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:38,820
Yeah.

1243
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:45,940
Much like me,

1244
00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:47,940
Billy Ray just looks really confused right now.

1245
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:48,780
Yeah, that adds up.

1246
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:51,940
Basically I took the thing in Delta Green Creation

1247
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:53,860
where you have to take a disorder

1248
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:58,140
and hers is that she is just like drawn

1249
00:52:58,140 --> 00:53:00,940
to making people as uncomfortable as possible.

1250
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:02,860
Good disorder, very on brand.

1251
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:06,740
Do you guys think that I've done it so far?

1252
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:07,560
Yes.

1253
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:08,880
Okay, cool.

1254
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:13,640
I have a crippling gambling addiction.

1255
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:14,480
Nice.

1256
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:18,620
My character likes gambling, but it's not an addiction.

1257
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:20,640
I just do it all the time and I like it a lot.

1258
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,980
Yeah, mine's a problem because I lose.

1259
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:29,800
Well, I think I'm gonna give Jane a call,

1260
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:31,640
see what, or maybe we should just,

1261
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:33,520
does she live in in Grover's Ville?

1262
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:36,360
Maybe we can go just go there and talk to her.

1263
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:40,280
I agree that we should probably make way for Grover's Ville.

1264
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:43,200
Make way for Grover's Ville.

1265
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:45,340
Toot, toot.

1266
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:47,000
You're taking the DEA car

1267
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,720
and you're taking the White Ford Bronco?

1268
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:50,080
Right, we'll hop in the Bronco

1269
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:52,640
and then the DEA car will meet us there.

1270
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:53,480
Driving stuff.

1271
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:58,840
Very well.

1272
00:53:58,840 --> 00:53:59,660
Let's just keep pushing this bit

1273
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:02,080
until it's a mechanic you can't take away from us.

1274
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:07,760
We send the DEA car ahead of us in all scenes.

1275
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:13,920
Also, the DEA car is a brilliant detective.

1276
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:19,280
I did an adjusted scenario for five PCs,

1277
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:22,200
so I'm gonna have to make some tweaks, but.

1278
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:27,180
Yeah, I'll drive the Bronco down and follow the DEA.

1279
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:28,640
I'll ride with him.

1280
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:29,880
You might ride or drive.

1281
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:33,520
Well, on a scale of one to 100,

1282
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:34,800
how well do you think you drive?

1283
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:38,360
Oh, not any better than anyone normal.

1284
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:39,820
Oh, like about a 50?

1285
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:41,440
Oh, not even there probably.

1286
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:44,280
I don't know, what's standard these days?

1287
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:46,040
Well, the way it seems to me,

1288
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:48,040
a lot of these crazy drivers out here

1289
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:50,440
operate in no more than 20%.

1290
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:54,200
You know, if they didn't specifically

1291
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:56,440
read their driver's manual, so.

1292
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:58,420
Jodine, for seven or eight months now,

1293
00:54:58,460 --> 00:55:01,500
I've been saying, you are my ride or drive.

1294
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:03,020
So I'm gonna ride you drive.

1295
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:05,320
You wanna rock, paper, scissors to see who drives

1296
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:08,140
or do I like driving?

1297
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:09,500
If you wanna drive, that's fine.

1298
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:11,780
I've just got the basic training.

1299
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:14,180
Oh yeah, I've been told I'm slightly above average

1300
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:18,020
at driving, only a few tickets here and there.

1301
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:19,980
I'll, I guess, shotgun.

1302
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:20,820
Okay.

1303
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:23,260
Looks around at no one.

1304
00:55:24,460 --> 00:55:26,540
It's also worth reflecting upon the point

1305
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:29,460
that if base drive is 20, just statistically,

1306
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:31,580
you're gonna have a lot of fails and a lot of fumbles

1307
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:34,020
on a regular basis, so yeah.

1308
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:36,820
It does explain a lot of things in real life.

1309
00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:39,900
When I get in the Bronco, I check in the glove compartment

1310
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:42,820
for some driving gloves and I try to put them on,

1311
00:55:42,820 --> 00:55:43,660
but they don't fit.

1312
00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:46,740
Instead, you'll find a super advanced car computer.

1313
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:49,100
Oh my, no, he's in the Bronco.

1314
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:49,940
I know.

1315
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:50,940
I know.

1316
00:55:54,340 --> 00:55:58,820
The car stereo in the Bronco, it's got pretty good lows,

1317
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:01,260
but how are the highs, man?

1318
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:02,580
How are the highs, man?

1319
00:56:04,180 --> 00:56:05,740
How are the?

1320
00:56:05,740 --> 00:56:07,220
Yeah, I get it.

1321
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:10,540
Are there any orange juice boxes in this Bronco?

1322
00:56:10,540 --> 00:56:13,140
I wish I could get an orange juice box.

1323
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:15,260
I'd love to run away from the scene of the crime

1324
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:17,820
after brutally murdering my wife and this baby.

1325
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:21,380
Or in thaw of us need to calm down so we can keep going.

1326
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:23,660
That was so much better than your highs, man.

1327
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:28,940
I don't get any of this.

1328
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:32,900
I believe that to be true.

1329
00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:35,660
I made the glove gym.

1330
00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:38,180
Have you not seen The Simpsons?

1331
00:56:38,180 --> 00:56:39,020
No, never have.

1332
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:39,860
I'm pretty sure that's what it is.

1333
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:41,580
I was born in 93.

1334
00:56:41,580 --> 00:56:44,180
No, Zach and Luke are both 17,

1335
00:56:44,180 --> 00:56:47,040
so they don't realize things like smartphones

1336
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:49,240
when they weren't around back then.

1337
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:50,080
Yeah, right.

1338
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:54,080
You mean they talk to people without video

1339
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:55,840
at the same time?

1340
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:57,520
It's like young children today that are like,

1341
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:58,960
why are you putting the phone up to your ear?

1342
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:00,040
That doesn't make any sense.

1343
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:01,280
Why would someone do that?

1344
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:02,120
Are you stupid?

1345
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:03,360
You're going to block the camera.

1346
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:04,280
I don't want to look at you

1347
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:06,360
when I'm talking to you on the phone.

1348
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:11,760
If I'm calling, it's because I have a series of questions

1349
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:13,120
that need to be asked rapidly

1350
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:16,320
and it would take 15 fucking minutes in text.

1351
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:18,520
And you only video call when you need to finish.

1352
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:19,360
Exactly.

1353
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:22,040
So five hours away.

1354
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:23,840
If I need to see your face, you'll do.

1355
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:27,120
So like five hours away,

1356
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:30,240
this is the conversation we're having the whole way there.

1357
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:32,020
We're in separate cars.

1358
00:57:32,020 --> 00:57:33,520
It's five hours away.

1359
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:36,760
So Memphis is Southwest in the state.

1360
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:38,560
You're basically driving up through Nashville,

1361
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:42,640
going to kind of the East side of central Tennessee.

1362
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:46,320
Groversville is the county seat of Grover County, Tennessee.

1363
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:49,560
It's largely rural, a little bit of agriculture,

1364
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:53,120
not a heck of a lot because there's only a 1200 person town.

1365
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:54,520
However, there's a lot more here

1366
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:57,800
than there would be otherwise because it is the county seat.

1367
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:59,680
Dealing with assessments, taxes,

1368
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:01,860
the county courthouses here,

1369
00:58:01,860 --> 00:58:03,600
but really at the center of town,

1370
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:06,040
it's an intersection of two streets,

1371
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:08,200
one single blinking red light in the middle.

1372
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:10,440
That is the only traffic light even in town.

1373
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:13,240
There's not even a standard red, yellow, and green light.

1374
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:14,760
This town is so small.

1375
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:16,680
So like I said, town hall at the center,

1376
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:20,040
kind of nearby, you have a small combo sheriff station,

1377
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:23,760
part-time ambulance and largely volunteer fire department,

1378
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:25,920
a town library, a post office,

1379
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:29,000
an auto and body shop, and a pair of local banks.

1380
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,280
A little further out, more standard stuff.

1381
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:33,680
Grocery store, hardware store, pharmacy,

1382
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:36,800
a family video, pair of churches,

1383
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:40,920
24 hour diner and ice cream shop called the Mega Deuce.

1384
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:42,760
And then further out in town,

1385
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:46,960
you have a pair of unbranded gas stations, a bowling alley,

1386
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:49,240
a Dollar General, an auto zone,

1387
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:51,620
a bar called Murrells County Bunker,

1388
00:58:51,620 --> 00:58:54,160
and then the place where you'll be staying,

1389
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:57,320
Murrell's Shut Eye, a 12 room motel.

1390
00:58:57,320 --> 00:58:58,680
And someday if they're lucky,

1391
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:00,160
they'll actually get fast food

1392
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:02,760
or a real restaurant in this town.

1393
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:04,880
That's Groversville in a nutshell.

1394
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:06,700
What was the ice cream shop there?

1395
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:08,360
The Mega Deuce.

1396
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:09,740
The Mega Deuce.

1397
00:59:09,740 --> 00:59:12,500
I'm lactose intolerant, so that adds up perfectly.

1398
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:14,720
That's their slogan.

1399
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:18,180
One Mega Deuce, one Mega Deuce,

1400
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:19,940
and you'll be making a Mega Deuce.

1401
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:23,020
That's just good marketing.

1402
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:25,940
You trying to take a shit?

1403
00:59:28,820 --> 00:59:30,860
Come on down to the shit hole.

1404
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:33,100
You know in town,

1405
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:36,560
you're given the name of the sheriff before you left,

1406
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:41,680
his name is Dan Oakley, as in the sunglasses.

1407
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:44,640
You called ahead and you had booked rooms in advance

1408
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:48,000
at Murrell's Shut Eye, the motel, whenever you needed.

1409
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,680
Getting late though on the first day,

1410
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:53,480
this is probably about seven o'clock,

1411
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:55,400
first night getting into town.

1412
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:56,240
Where do you wanna go?

1413
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:58,520
Do we know where Jane lives?

1414
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:02,260
You do have her address, you can go check it out for sure.

1415
01:00:02,260 --> 01:00:04,360
I'm so deeply sorry, I'm about to piss my pants,

1416
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:06,000
I've been holding it for like 30 minutes.

1417
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:08,360
Back in like literally 20 seconds.

1418
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:09,360
Dude, just piss your pants.

1419
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:10,200
Yeah.

1420
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:12,040
Yeah, it's better radio though.

1421
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:15,120
Can we just keep talking?

1422
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:17,760
You're gonna cut all this or?

1423
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:20,000
Okay, I'm done.

1424
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,520
Oh, he did it.

1425
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:23,240
Oh, that's a lot.

1426
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:24,600
Why is it so sticky?

1427
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:27,000
I say we get all in the same car.

1428
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,560
I was gonna say we could call her,

1429
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:32,320
but I don't, I think maybe if we just drop in,

1430
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:33,600
she's probably not doing anything,

1431
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:35,360
there's not much to do around here.

1432
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:37,920
There was the possibility that she was missing,

1433
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:41,060
abducted by the burning operating laser lights

1434
01:00:41,060 --> 01:00:45,080
that inflict you with super strength, but endless pain.

1435
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:47,320
Well, hopefully that's not the case.

1436
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:49,080
I hope so too, Tan.

1437
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:50,600
Vroom, vroom, vroom.

1438
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:54,720
So do we leave the, we should leave the Bronco

1439
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:56,320
maybe at the motel?

1440
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:57,160
Merle's Shudai.

1441
01:00:57,160 --> 01:00:57,980
Merle's Shudai.

1442
01:00:57,980 --> 01:01:00,320
I'll hop in the DEA car if we wanna take one.

1443
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:02,680
What kind of car is the DEA car?

1444
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:05,400
It's a nice early 90s sedan.

1445
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:06,440
Yep, I got it.

1446
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:07,640
Hold on, I got the image.

1447
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:08,720
Is it a Lincoln town car?

1448
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:11,920
It is a 1992 Crown Victoria LX.

1449
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:13,360
Nice. Nice.

1450
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:14,280
She's gorgeous.

1451
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:15,640
Beautiful car. Gorgeous.

1452
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:16,480
Burgundy.

1453
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:20,300
Burgundy 1992 generation one Crown Vic,

1454
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:24,160
and then your 1992 Ford Bronco XLT.

1455
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:25,000
Very lovely.

1456
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,040
Yeah, those are your two cars.

1457
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:28,080
All right, you're gonna take the Crown Vic.

1458
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:31,760
You're gonna go to the Allen household.

1459
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:33,920
Jane Allen's house.

1460
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:34,740
You're not calling.

1461
01:01:34,740 --> 01:01:35,580
You're driving there, correct?

1462
01:01:35,580 --> 01:01:37,280
Just going, showing up.

1463
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:38,120
Cool.

1464
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:40,800
Do we want to run by the sheriffs first?

1465
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:42,060
That's probably not a bad idea

1466
01:01:42,060 --> 01:01:44,040
just to be in good graces with the locals.

1467
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:46,000
Be in good graces and also just-

1468
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,280
But should we even announce that we're here?

1469
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:49,100
Yeah.

1470
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:51,000
I mean, there's definitely an advantage

1471
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,200
to the element of surprise.

1472
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:55,080
I don't know if it's on this high school girl.

1473
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:58,160
She seems like probably just another victim at this point,

1474
01:01:58,160 --> 01:01:59,480
unless she's abducting people,

1475
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:01,380
taking them out to the woods,

1476
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:04,520
operating on them with supernatural light surgery

1477
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:06,440
and releasing them as pain monsters.

1478
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:09,120
Well, I think we have our primary suspect,

1479
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:10,640
so let's go find her and kill her.

1480
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:13,240
Yeah, actually, the more I'm talking about this,

1481
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:14,560
the more I'm talking to myself into it.

1482
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:16,160
We should bust that door down.

1483
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:18,880
I mean, we could do it in character or out of character,

1484
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:21,820
but I think Harlan's point to visiting Jane

1485
01:02:21,820 --> 01:02:24,680
was because he went missing when he was going to her house.

1486
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:26,120
So if she knew anything about

1487
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:27,400
what he had been doing that day,

1488
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:28,920
but also I kind of wanted to know

1489
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:30,300
where the kids hang out in town.

1490
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:31,140
Yeah, totally.

1491
01:02:31,140 --> 01:02:34,380
But maybe it's a mispronunciation of her last name,

1492
01:02:34,380 --> 01:02:35,220
Jane Alien.

1493
01:02:35,220 --> 01:02:36,040
Ooh.

1494
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:36,880
It's right there.

1495
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:39,040
It's up to you guys.

1496
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:40,440
Do you want to do Sheriff first or Jane first?

1497
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:41,520
Well, let's go talk to Jane

1498
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:43,560
and then we can swing by the Sheriff's office.

1499
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:45,660
Yeah, we can tell him it was on our way into town.

1500
01:02:45,660 --> 01:02:48,240
Jane probably also is closest to this case

1501
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:49,080
and you're right.

1502
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:51,640
If we need to hide any of the, you know,

1503
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:53,680
it's not called Delta Green yet, right?

1504
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:54,520
Or it is?

1505
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:55,340
It is.

1506
01:02:55,340 --> 01:02:57,380
But it's a little more underground

1507
01:02:57,380 --> 01:02:59,260
and cell-based and whatnot.

1508
01:02:59,260 --> 01:03:02,780
Presumably you all are from a particular cell,

1509
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:03,600
the two of you?

1510
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:06,620
Yeah, you told us which cell that would probably be,

1511
01:03:06,620 --> 01:03:07,780
lore-wise.

1512
01:03:07,780 --> 01:03:09,980
Does somebody else want to say it out loud first?

1513
01:03:09,980 --> 01:03:12,420
Oh yeah, well, I'm Agent Nan, obviously.

1514
01:03:12,420 --> 01:03:14,260
Cindy Woodabaga is Agent Nan.

1515
01:03:14,260 --> 01:03:17,140
Yeah, and I'm her partner, Agent Nephew.

1516
01:03:17,140 --> 01:03:18,140
Right, yeah.

1517
01:03:18,140 --> 01:03:19,460
So we're in Ncell.

1518
01:03:19,460 --> 01:03:22,840
Yeah, Ncell, which isn't a funny word in the early 90s.

1519
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:23,680
Not yet.

1520
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:25,760
It's not a funny word now.

1521
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:30,040
It's a dangerous, poor, random hole.

1522
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:30,880
Yeah.

1523
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:37,000
May as well, like, come up on Delta Green's, like,

1524
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,920
keywords to, like, look into.

1525
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:40,080
Yeah.

1526
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:41,280
Or they just skip that one.

1527
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:42,640
There's only 25 cells.

1528
01:03:44,980 --> 01:03:49,040
It's like skipping the 13th floor on elevators and stuff.

1529
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:52,240
L-M-O, we got them all.

1530
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:53,880
Yeah, could we be T cell for Tennessee

1531
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:56,060
instead of N cell for Nashville?

1532
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:01,120
All right, so you drive to Jane Allen's house

1533
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:02,080
outside of town.

1534
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:04,560
It's a slightly nicer house than many of the others,

1535
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:07,320
about a mile outside of town.

1536
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:08,260
Again, it's a small town,

1537
01:04:08,260 --> 01:04:10,280
so that only takes a couple of minutes.

1538
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:13,040
You roll up to a nicer two-story house,

1539
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:16,080
well-manicured lawn, couple cars in the driveway.

1540
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:19,200
Definitely looks a lot nicer than a lot of the other houses

1541
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:20,760
that you've driven by on the way out here.

1542
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:23,240
Nice enough to have a secret alien laboratory

1543
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:24,080
underneath it?

1544
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:25,960
Quite possibly.

1545
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:27,520
Mm.

1546
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:28,360
What do you do?

1547
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:33,280
Good knock.

1548
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:34,480
You tap on your microphone loudly.

1549
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:38,520
You just take, okay, so now say what you want to say?

1550
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:40,360
Ding dong.

1551
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:43,400
You are an enigma, Agent Dan.

1552
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:46,240
Ah, yes, let's go knock on the door or ring the doorbell.

1553
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:50,920
Why not both?

1554
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:53,080
Yeah, I'd knock on the door and ring the doorbell.

1555
01:04:53,080 --> 01:04:54,420
Okay, several times.

1556
01:04:54,420 --> 01:04:59,420
A woman comes to the door, an older, middle-aged woman.

1557
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:03,560
Oh, why hello there, who are you?

1558
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:07,000
We're with a federal agency looking into the disappearance

1559
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,800
of Billy Ray Spivey and I believe your daughter,

1560
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:12,240
Jane Allen, might have been involved

1561
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:13,480
and we would like to speak to her.

1562
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:14,680
Can she come out and play?

1563
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:16,800
No, play.

1564
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:17,640
I'm sorry, I-

1565
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:19,600
No, she can't.

1566
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:20,920
She's not here.

1567
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:21,760
Where is she?

1568
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:25,320
Well, she's gone, she hasn't been around for a bit.

1569
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:26,840
When was the last time you saw her?

1570
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:30,680
Ah, dear, about three weeks ago.

1571
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:31,960
What is your name, ma'am?

1572
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:33,200
My name's Nancy.

1573
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:34,240
Nancy Allen.

1574
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:38,080
Like the author from Springfield, Missouri.

1575
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:42,880
Yes, no, yeah, she's gone, you know.

1576
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:44,800
You've reported this to the sheriff, of course.

1577
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:47,400
Well, why would I need, she's fine.

1578
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:49,520
But you don't know where she is?

1579
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:52,440
No, she's come back.

1580
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:53,880
Does this happen often?

1581
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:55,200
She's done this before?

1582
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:59,040
No, no, my husband, he's always at work.

1583
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:00,560
He's, you know, it's just me here.

1584
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:02,400
I'm just taking care of, I'm just waiting.

1585
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:04,520
And this doesn't seem odd to you

1586
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:06,280
that she would disappear.

1587
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:08,320
It's not usual for her to do that

1588
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:11,940
and you're relatively unconcerned about it?

1589
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:14,940
You can roll human, anyone that wants to.

1590
01:06:14,940 --> 01:06:15,940
I'll do that also.

1591
01:06:18,060 --> 01:06:18,900
89.

1592
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:19,720
Fail. Fail.

1593
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:20,560
Fuck, I fail also.

1594
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:21,820
Hold on. So I get on a 60.

1595
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:25,300
39 on a 60.

1596
01:06:25,300 --> 01:06:26,460
Oh, nice.

1597
01:06:26,460 --> 01:06:30,380
Well, Joe Dean, she seems to be telling the truth

1598
01:06:30,380 --> 01:06:33,460
and is pretty forthcoming and honest

1599
01:06:33,460 --> 01:06:35,660
and doesn't actually seem to be that concerned at all.

1600
01:06:35,660 --> 01:06:37,500
The rest of you can't get a good read.

1601
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:39,420
Has this ever happened before?

1602
01:06:39,420 --> 01:06:41,340
Has she disappeared for any amount of time?

1603
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:42,860
No, not really.

1604
01:06:42,860 --> 01:06:44,780
She's an independent girl. It's fine.

1605
01:06:44,780 --> 01:06:48,740
Was she like on her way to a certain place

1606
01:06:48,740 --> 01:06:51,580
or did she say she was going somewhere?

1607
01:06:51,580 --> 01:06:54,540
Any clue of what might've happened?

1608
01:06:54,540 --> 01:06:56,100
It just, you know, it happens sometimes.

1609
01:06:56,100 --> 01:06:58,780
People just, they go places and they come back.

1610
01:06:58,780 --> 01:06:59,620
It's fine.

1611
01:06:59,620 --> 01:07:03,260
Have you heard any of her friends going missing too?

1612
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:07,700
Does she live here?

1613
01:07:07,700 --> 01:07:09,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1614
01:07:09,220 --> 01:07:13,540
Has she gone missing for upwards of three weeks before?

1615
01:07:13,540 --> 01:07:14,380
She said no.

1616
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:16,780
For the third time, no.

1617
01:07:16,780 --> 01:07:18,860
For the third time, no.

1618
01:07:18,860 --> 01:07:19,900
Nancy.

1619
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:23,260
I feel like I'm repeating myself.

1620
01:07:23,260 --> 01:07:25,020
It's just such a weird story.

1621
01:07:25,020 --> 01:07:27,860
Like, I feel like I'm getting something wrong here.

1622
01:07:27,860 --> 01:07:29,100
Why don't you care?

1623
01:07:29,100 --> 01:07:32,580
Yeah, I feel like you should carry more information

1624
01:07:32,580 --> 01:07:33,900
about your daughter.

1625
01:07:34,820 --> 01:07:37,300
I'm just very easy going.

1626
01:07:37,300 --> 01:07:38,140
That's all.

1627
01:07:38,460 --> 01:07:39,580
I'm a cool mom.

1628
01:07:39,580 --> 01:07:40,420
Oh yeah.

1629
01:07:40,420 --> 01:07:41,740
I'm a very cool mom.

1630
01:07:41,740 --> 01:07:42,580
I had a cool mom.

1631
01:07:42,580 --> 01:07:43,420
So cool.

1632
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:47,100
Yeah, I had to really pull myself through.

1633
01:07:47,100 --> 01:07:49,180
Well, you know, like I had to get myself to high school

1634
01:07:49,180 --> 01:07:51,300
and then pay for my own college and everything.

1635
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:54,620
Cool mom isn't always so cool at the end of the day.

1636
01:07:54,620 --> 01:07:56,500
You know what I mean?

1637
01:07:56,500 --> 01:07:57,820
Just something to think on.

1638
01:07:57,820 --> 01:07:58,860
I don't.

1639
01:07:58,860 --> 01:08:00,620
I've always wanted to be the cool mom.

1640
01:08:00,620 --> 01:08:03,620
Is that some sort of thing they do in like the Northeast?

1641
01:08:03,620 --> 01:08:06,100
Are you from up in Pennsylvania maybe

1642
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:08,580
and you were trying out like the parenting technique,

1643
01:08:08,580 --> 01:08:11,820
some sort of Philadelphia experiment or something?

1644
01:08:11,820 --> 01:08:14,500
Oh no, we got wine moms all over the country.

1645
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:16,260
No, I'm born and bred.

1646
01:08:16,260 --> 01:08:17,700
Born and bred in Grover'sville.

1647
01:08:17,700 --> 01:08:20,060
You were born inbred?

1648
01:08:20,060 --> 01:08:20,900
Expand on that.

1649
01:08:20,900 --> 01:08:22,020
Yes.

1650
01:08:22,020 --> 01:08:23,740
That was not a slip-up.

1651
01:08:23,740 --> 01:08:25,940
I don't think you actually said born inbred.

1652
01:08:27,300 --> 01:08:29,100
Oh, you're gonna have to rewind that.

1653
01:08:29,100 --> 01:08:29,940
Inbred.

1654
01:08:29,940 --> 01:08:30,780
Rewind that and listen again.

1655
01:08:30,780 --> 01:08:32,620
Ah.

1656
01:08:32,620 --> 01:08:34,940
For those of you playing along at home.

1657
01:08:36,100 --> 01:08:40,580
Is Mr. Allen home?

1658
01:08:40,580 --> 01:08:42,700
Is there a Mr. Allen here?

1659
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:44,340
No, he's just at work.

1660
01:08:44,340 --> 01:08:45,180
Where does he work?

1661
01:08:45,180 --> 01:08:46,020
Town hall.

1662
01:08:46,020 --> 01:08:47,660
He's one of the aldermen running the town.

1663
01:08:47,660 --> 01:08:48,540
Just so busy.

1664
01:08:48,540 --> 01:08:49,500
Work, work, work.

1665
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:50,580
What is his name?

1666
01:08:50,580 --> 01:08:51,460
Work, work, work.

1667
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:52,300
Allen.

1668
01:08:52,300 --> 01:08:53,120
Allen.

1669
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:53,960
Allen.

1670
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:55,980
His last name is in fact Allen.

1671
01:08:55,980 --> 01:08:57,540
It's Bradley Allen.

1672
01:08:57,540 --> 01:08:59,620
Maybe we ought to go talk to him.

1673
01:08:59,620 --> 01:09:01,620
Maybe he cares.

1674
01:09:01,620 --> 01:09:04,220
Have you seen him recently or has he been gone

1675
01:09:04,260 --> 01:09:06,140
for an extended period of time at this point?

1676
01:09:06,140 --> 01:09:07,180
He's been working.

1677
01:09:07,180 --> 01:09:08,020
For how long?

1678
01:09:08,020 --> 01:09:09,020
He's been working real hard.

1679
01:09:09,020 --> 01:09:09,860
Good.

1680
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:12,960
I don't know.

1681
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:13,780
Years.

1682
01:09:14,980 --> 01:09:16,320
Yeah.

1683
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:18,860
Do you mind if we come in and look around?

1684
01:09:18,860 --> 01:09:19,900
Yeah, sure.

1685
01:09:19,900 --> 01:09:21,860
Yeah, you seem pretty chill.

1686
01:09:21,860 --> 01:09:23,460
All right, let's go ahead.

1687
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:24,900
Can you show us to Jane's room?

1688
01:09:24,900 --> 01:09:25,720
Sure.

1689
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:27,180
Maybe she has like some letters

1690
01:09:27,180 --> 01:09:28,860
that she's written from her.

1691
01:09:28,860 --> 01:09:29,680
Sure.

1692
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:32,980
She is going to walk you all upstairs.

1693
01:09:32,980 --> 01:09:35,780
Harlan wants to be clocking pictures as we go.

1694
01:09:35,780 --> 01:09:38,540
Can I get a sense of which one Jane looks like?

1695
01:09:39,980 --> 01:09:44,980
Jane is a late teenage year girl,

1696
01:09:44,980 --> 01:09:49,100
minor amount of acne, very pale.

1697
01:09:49,100 --> 01:09:50,140
One of those people with almost like

1698
01:09:50,140 --> 01:09:52,300
uniformly colored skin tone,

1699
01:09:52,300 --> 01:09:56,980
just like kind of this off-white eggshellish almost color.

1700
01:09:56,980 --> 01:09:58,800
Oddly, in all the photos,

1701
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:01,540
she has almost identically the same smile.

1702
01:10:01,540 --> 01:10:03,580
She's one of those people that whenever they smile,

1703
01:10:03,580 --> 01:10:07,700
it's exact same look every single photo.

1704
01:10:07,700 --> 01:10:11,500
I have the exact same photo in all of my pictures.

1705
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:12,860
I look like Zach.

1706
01:10:14,060 --> 01:10:15,600
Fucking woof, dude.

1707
01:10:18,580 --> 01:10:19,840
Zach, Zach same.

1708
01:10:20,780 --> 01:10:21,620
I liked it.

1709
01:10:21,620 --> 01:10:22,440
Every time.

1710
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:24,720
It was good.

1711
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:25,620
It was good.

1712
01:10:25,620 --> 01:10:28,720
So Cindy sees a picture where Nancy Allen

1713
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:31,940
is looking particularly good in a family photo.

1714
01:10:31,940 --> 01:10:32,780
And she's like,

1715
01:10:32,780 --> 01:10:35,160
wow, you're dressed to kill in this one.

1716
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:36,880
Thank you.

1717
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:38,000
It means a lot.

1718
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,160
Once we get to her room, I...

1719
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:41,320
Sometimes it works.

1720
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:46,440
Ever done it?

1721
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:51,040
You're really dressed to kill.

1722
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:52,880
It's funny you say that because I killed someone.

1723
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:55,880
I killed my daughter in this dress, yeah.

1724
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:58,700
Hairs all blown out, yeah.

1725
01:10:59,620 --> 01:11:00,460
Is anything missing from her room?

1726
01:11:00,460 --> 01:11:03,500
Any clothes or nothing?

1727
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:05,340
Yeah, let's do a quick search.

1728
01:11:05,340 --> 01:11:06,420
One more question about her.

1729
01:11:06,420 --> 01:11:09,420
Does she look like she's been taking care of herself?

1730
01:11:09,420 --> 01:11:11,920
Or has she been wearing these clothes for like three weeks?

1731
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:13,180
I take care of herself.

1732
01:11:13,180 --> 01:11:17,100
Houses in pristine condition, cleaned, smells fresh.

1733
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:20,660
Jane Allen's room, bed made, window open.

1734
01:11:20,660 --> 01:11:23,020
It's not sunny anymore cause it's later in the day,

1735
01:11:23,020 --> 01:11:26,680
but it looks like a freshly cleaned kids room.

1736
01:11:26,680 --> 01:11:28,720
Do you think she might've went out the window?

1737
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:31,480
That was my first thought.

1738
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:32,320
Exactly.

1739
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:34,480
I think she might've said goodbye to her mother

1740
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:35,600
and then just left.

1741
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:37,240
But did she leave out the window?

1742
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:40,320
You want to give me those search roles?

1743
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:41,160
Yeah.

1744
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:44,160
I got a 33.

1745
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:47,000
Oh, I also succeed.

1746
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,360
I succeed also.

1747
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:50,200
Critical success.

1748
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:54,720
With your successes, you see a largely standard kids room.

1749
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:56,240
There's nothing really out of place

1750
01:11:56,760 --> 01:11:58,920
as far as clothes or anything else goes.

1751
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:00,360
Her desk is there.

1752
01:12:00,360 --> 01:12:01,200
It's September.

1753
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:02,680
She just started her senior year of high school.

1754
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:05,960
So you see kind of her freshly purchased books

1755
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:08,080
and other material, but she's been gone for three weeks

1756
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:10,460
basically since like the start of the semester.

1757
01:12:10,460 --> 01:12:12,260
But with that critical success,

1758
01:12:12,260 --> 01:12:16,160
you find a business card on that desk on top of the books.

1759
01:12:16,160 --> 01:12:19,760
And that business card says Scott Adams,

1760
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:23,200
watch the skies, exclamation point.

1761
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:25,100
And it has an email address.

1762
01:12:25,100 --> 01:12:30,100
And the email address is watchtheskies at aol.com.

1763
01:12:30,460 --> 01:12:31,980
What the hell does this mean?

1764
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:35,060
["I Can't Get High"]

1765
01:13:01,980 --> 01:13:05,060
["I Can't Get High"]

1766
01:13:31,980 --> 01:13:35,060
["I Can't Get High"]

1767
01:14:01,980 --> 01:14:05,060
["I Can't Get High"]

1768
01:14:31,980 --> 01:14:34,980
["I Can't Get High"]

1769
01:15:01,980 --> 01:15:04,980
["I Can't Get High"]

1770
01:15:31,980 --> 01:15:34,980
["I Can't Get High"]

1771
01:16:01,980 --> 01:16:04,980
["I Can't Get High"]
