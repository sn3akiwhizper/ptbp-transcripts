1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,680
Welcome one and all, it is your only good boy radio DJ Wolf the Dog, and I'm hoping

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:11,640
y'all give me some of them good pets for giving you that good news.

3
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,880
Well it's usually bad news but y'all get it.

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:21,860
Remember to keep those radios tuned to 694.2 PTBP if you want to give Wolf the Dog the

5
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:27,400
emotional support he needs to keep on going and trudging through the eternal hellscape

6
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,960
that is news and contention.

7
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:36,000
My producer informs me today that we are celebrating being on air for six months.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,560
That's crazy as hell y'all, I thought it'd only been a few days here in contention time.

9
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:46,560
But as we all know, time is an illusion my babies.

10
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:51,640
But what isn't an illusion is my favorite segment, Howlin' with Wolf.

11
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:56,680
This week's Howlin' with Wolf comes from a listener named James W. who emailed us at

12
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,840
pretendingpaw.gmail.com.

13
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,480
Seems they were able to find some audio that is addressed to the police department here

14
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,480
in contention.

15
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:11,240
Well howdy boys, my name's Jim Hammer.

16
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,760
I'm the mayor of Texas.

17
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:19,840
I just wanted to say I've been listening to your radio program and I wanted to extend

18
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,920
my help to some boys out there who are doing some good in the world.

19
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:29,800
If you ever need anything, I could give you a place to hide.

20
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,320
Got an underground bunker system out here.

21
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:38,760
Ted Cruz is currently hiding in there from some vigilante justice groups, mostly coming

22
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:44,360
after him for that beard he's growing, but you know, also being the zodiac killer and

23
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,360
whatnot.

24
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,520
But anyways, come on down if you need help.

25
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,160
I could maybe even pardon you for your crimes and such if you need it.

26
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:56,000
Just remember you got a friend out here in Texas.

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Bye!

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,320
Thanks Jim Hammer, mayor of Texas, for reaching out.

29
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:10,720
Hey Jim, no reason, but if your good sweet boy Wolf the dog got himself in some hot water

30
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:17,480
here in contention, is there any room in that bunker for a little dog like Wolf?

31
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:24,160
This week we have a special presentation here on 694.2 PTBP, Condensions newest and

32
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,140
only radio station.

33
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:34,480
We are going to broadcast a recap episode with listener Q&A from a podcast called Pretending

34
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,480
to be People.

35
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:42,240
They have asked me to point out that their show is serialized and there will be spoilers

36
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,120
in this discussion.

37
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:49,960
So head on back to episode one, when I was but a wee baby my babies.

38
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:56,520
But first and always, it's kudzu with no backbone.

39
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:16,680
It's kudzu with no backbone.

40
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:25,720
It's kudzu with no backbone.

41
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:31,640
It should be working I think, I'm going to turn this here now.

42
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:39,320
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me,

43
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:44,040
in no backbone.

44
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:47,800
In no backbone.

45
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,400
Hello everyone and welcome to Pretending to be People.

46
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:57,360
I am sitting in this room with Thomas, Luke, Joe, and Justin.

47
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,200
For the first time all five of us are in the same room.

48
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,560
And today we are releasing a special presentation.

49
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:09,600
Thank you so much Wolf for having us on your program.

50
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:17,400
We are here to release a Q&A episode from questions that we've received from listeners.

51
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:22,960
And the reason that we are doing this, one, obviously to connect with the community.

52
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:28,920
You guys are growing out there and we really like interacting with all of you.

53
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:33,040
Very excited about what's in store for the show.

54
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:40,440
And we are here to release this Q&A episode as a sort of thank you.

55
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,960
Thank you and a kind of launch for our Patreon.

56
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,960
A taste.

57
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,160
Yeah, a taste of what you're going to get on the Patreon, extra content.

58
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,840
But we were kind of blown away by the response we've gotten so far to this podcast.

59
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,280
It's burned my mind, honestly.

60
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,040
So we want to give you guys more.

61
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:00,360
It's made me just so rock fucking hard.

62
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,420
I can't explain to you guys.

63
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:06,280
It's really difficult to be around Zach now because of his raging erections.

64
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,880
It's visible at all times.

65
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:11,080
I like it that way and it's all thanks to all of you.

66
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:16,280
His wife has tearfully confessed to me that she can't be seen in public with Zach anymore.

67
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:21,400
His head has visibly grown too.

68
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:25,480
There's too much blood in the dick and some of it rushes back up to the head.

69
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,920
I've had to get new hats.

70
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,800
It's been an issue.

71
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,320
But with your Patreon subscriptions, you can buy new hats.

72
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,320
Hopefully.

73
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,320
That is the goal.

74
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,480
We are trying to raise money for new hats for my giant fucking head.

75
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:43,480
Luke, you are the only one who's complained to me in public about people coming up to

76
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,640
you about the podcast.

77
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,640
It's not a complaint.

78
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,640
It just happens.

79
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:52,400
No, literally somebody talked to us and you were like, it's so annoying when that happens.

80
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,880
I don't think I said so annoying.

81
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,360
It has happened quite a bit.

82
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,840
But I do go out more than the rest of you.

83
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:02,600
Luke will take pictures with you for sure if you see him out.

84
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,600
For five dollars.

85
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,600
No.

86
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:09,800
Not only for me, but the rest of the crew if you want them in, we'll put that on the

87
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,800
Patreon.

88
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,800
We'll figure it out.

89
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,420
Yes, we are launching a Patreon.

90
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:19,480
This is honestly, to be completely frank, it is to keep the show going.

91
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,480
That's true.

92
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:26,120
I and we spend so much time working on this show to give you guys the quality content

93
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,200
that we think that you deserve.

94
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:34,280
Real quick, Zach completely makes this podcast what it is.

95
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:38,880
His editing, his attention to detail, all the work he puts into this makes it the podcast

96
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,580
you love.

97
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:45,760
So not to get too NPR on you guys, but we need to make it a job for him.

98
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,760
It needs to...

99
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:50,160
He puts many, many hours into it.

100
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:56,880
We take a little bit of time out of our days to edit a little bit, but it's mostly Zach

101
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,200
doing this for you and for us.

102
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,440
It's a joy.

103
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:04,480
And on top of doing all the technical editing stuff, he's running the game and writing the

104
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,480
game.

105
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,740
So he's pulling triple if not quadruple duty.

106
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:09,740
It's so much fun.

107
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:10,740
I really enjoy it.

108
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,740
I want to keep doing it.

109
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:16,720
I want to make this campaign something special.

110
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,820
We've run some really fun campaigns in the past with this group, and I really think that

111
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:25,680
this one can take the cake and really we can make some memorable moments.

112
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,360
But it takes a lot of time.

113
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,360
It does.

114
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,360
It does.

115
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,600
We would really appreciate you guys supporting us and check it out.

116
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,700
We'll put a link in the episode notes.

117
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,440
I can't believe I just said that.

118
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,440
That's...

119
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,440
All right.

120
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,440
Well...

121
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,440
We're like a real podcast now.

122
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,200
Yeah, I think we're making a podcast now.

123
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,200
All right.

124
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,840
Well, let's get to some questions.

125
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:52,720
I was certainly blown away by the amount of questions that we received.

126
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,320
And the level of insight in the questions.

127
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,320
Absolutely.

128
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,320
Y'all are smart.

129
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:03,960
With that being said, let's start with a question from D. Tratara on Instagram.

130
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,960
You know, just some listener I've never met.

131
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,620
No one we know.

132
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,120
He lives in Canada, apparently.

133
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,520
What a weirdo.

134
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,520
Yep.

135
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,520
He asks...

136
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,680
I wouldn't have liked to stand next to him at your wedding.

137
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:21,280
He asks, what do you think of the notion that technological advancement has rendered selfhood

138
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,760
artificial, therefore making one's identity changeable and plural?

139
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,760
Now, I did...

140
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,480
Can I actually field this one?

141
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,480
Yeah.

142
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,480
Go for it.

143
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,480
Dakota?

144
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,480
Yes.

145
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:41,840
I asked Dakota to elaborate, and he said, well...

146
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:46,080
It's evident digital technologies affect both the social and cultural spheres.

147
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,160
As individuals present themselves across different social media platforms, they are able to construct

148
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:56,800
various versions of themselves, i.e. bringing to the mainstream postmodern ideas, such as

149
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,880
the self being constituted by multiple discourses and structures.

150
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,280
Simultaneously, the technologies that allow for us to enact ourselves in cyberspace also

151
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,880
allow for greater monitoring of our activity.

152
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:12,640
Thus, the projection of ourselves that we voluntarily put out across these sites can

153
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:18,340
be aggregated into a quote data double of ourselves, providing those with technological

154
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:22,900
means to collect such data and a complete picture of who we are.

155
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:26,260
How many times did you come while you were jacking yourself off there, Dakota?

156
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,260
This...

157
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:29,260
Hopefully at least once.

158
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:34,220
Is the question he's asking like, are we the same on the podcast as we are in real life?

159
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,420
Go ahead and answer that one.

160
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,180
I would say, yeah.

161
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:39,220
We're very bad cops in real life, too.

162
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:44,380
No, I mean like, our like personalities, like, yeah, I don't think we really tried to change

163
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:45,500
anything up for it.

164
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,980
Like we just brought what we have to the table and...

165
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,580
Well, you do that voice.

166
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,100
Luke's character voice is pretty intense.

167
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,100
His famous character voice.

168
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,700
Hit us with that Keith Vigna voice.

169
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,700
What's up, everybody?

170
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:01,580
Oh, man, it's like he's in the room.

171
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:02,580
Where's Luke?

172
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:05,060
I'm Keith Vigna now.

173
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,340
Follow up question.

174
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,700
Will you ever do a character voice?

175
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,020
If I get a new character?

176
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:13,660
I think that's coming pretty soon.

177
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:18,540
And it'll sound like this.

178
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:19,540
I'm working on it.

179
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:21,740
Yeah, I think that's a good starting point.

180
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:24,580
Dakota also asked, what do we...

181
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:25,580
We've got an...

182
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:31,140
It seemed like, yeah, while I was in it at a point, it seemed like a good time to burp.

183
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,140
Absolutely.

184
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:36,700
We've got another question from fucks up invoker combos.

185
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,700
What does that mean?

186
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,900
It's gotta be a video game thing, but I don't think I play those kind of video games.

187
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:45,180
All right, well, he would love to know, or she would love to know, they would love to

188
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:49,380
know how Zach prepares for scenario campaign and session.

189
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,620
Luke, do you want to take this one?

190
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,260
Yeah, I'll take this one.

191
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,260
He doesn't basically.

192
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,260
No, no.

193
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,300
How does he approach making a new story?

194
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,740
How far ahead does he plan?

195
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,840
How much is fleshed out before they start playing?

196
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:04,100
How much does he prepare between sessions and how much is improvisation?

197
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:07,700
So I'll start it out.

198
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:11,100
The answer to this question is, dude, I really have no idea.

199
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,620
All I know is that he does a lot.

200
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,220
So I'll hand it over to...

201
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,220
We should ask Zach about this.

202
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,220
Zach would know about this.

203
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,220
Oh, wait, real quick, Joe.

204
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,220
Joe, what do you think?

205
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,220
What do you think?

206
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:23,140
It's pretty obvious that Zach would be the one to answer this.

207
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,880
I agree.

208
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,020
Isn't this podcast about subverting expectations?

209
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:32,220
Hey, Justin, do you want to hop in on here real quick and what do you think?

210
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:36,260
Zach Facebook messaged me and he says he spends very little time on this.

211
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:39,260
He just wants that Patreon money for him.

212
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:42,260
Okay, to actually answer the question.

213
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:49,580
This is kind of a big question, I would say, but I will tell you that before we started

214
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,580
recording...

215
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,580
You're a big boy.

216
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:56,420
I am a big boy with big answers for big questions and my name's Zach.

217
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:57,420
Big butch boy.

218
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:00,140
Are you ready for this big butch boy to answer your big butch questions?

219
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:01,140
I want to hear it.

220
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,140
Okay.

221
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,140
Oh, God.

222
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:05,140
I'm working on my new character voice.

223
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,860
I love that new character voice.

224
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:12,920
After our last campaign finished up, I knew I had at least two months to start writing

225
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:17,800
something new and we had realized at the end of playing our last campaign that we wanted

226
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:21,900
to record our next one for posterity's purposes.

227
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:29,980
I began writing and I took inspiration from a lot of different things, but I knew that

228
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:33,420
what we know is small town life.

229
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:37,420
I feel like we consume a lot of content from that setting.

230
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:38,420
We've watched Smallville.

231
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,420
Exactly.

232
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,420
We know.

233
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,380
I'm from Ozark, Missouri.

234
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:47,860
That's number two, is that we live in Missouri and I wanted to play a campaign in that setting.

235
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:48,860
We'd never done that before.

236
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:53,620
Delta Green is mostly a game where you're dealing in government agencies and really

237
00:12:53,620 --> 00:13:02,740
highfalutin stuff that is very redacted and you have to have a high clearance to get that

238
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,740
information.

239
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,460
I wanted to play with small town cops.

240
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:09,340
I thought that would be really fun and it turns out-

241
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,340
It was.

242
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:14,380
With that being said, I began to build a plot.

243
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:20,220
I knew that I wanted to mix in rules from Pulp Cthulhu with this campaign because I

244
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:24,220
read the source book and it fucking blew me away.

245
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:29,780
I was so into it from the very beginning, actually two years ago or maybe a year ago

246
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:36,260
when it first came out, I, for my birthday, ran one of the scenarios from the back of

247
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:41,940
the Pulp Cthulhu book and it was a shit show.

248
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:46,620
Thomas and Justin were both there and we just drank too much.

249
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:52,220
It was a birthday celebration but I think Justin and Thomas' characters ran off-

250
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:54,100
To meet Ernest Timmingway.

251
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,100
Because he owed-

252
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,100
Oh, is it that one?

253
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,100
Yeah.

254
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,100
Oh, that was a good time.

255
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,100
It was a good time.

256
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:00,420
People were very upset.

257
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,420
The hotel?

258
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,420
I was too drunk to realize how-

259
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:03,420
Yeah, I was there.

260
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,940
Me and Zach, or me and Thomas got-

261
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:06,940
You and I had a really great time.

262
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:09,100
We got very upset.

263
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:13,660
We wanted the story to go a certain way that no one else maybe did in the room.

264
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,320
We were just like, wait, why are we here?

265
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:19,700
Of course it's to fuck around for 15 minutes each turn while we're really drunk.

266
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:24,100
Okay, so that's how good Zach is at this shit.

267
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:27,680
When you're really drunk, we kind of forgot that it was a DM situation.

268
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,720
We were just being these assholes.

269
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:34,480
It was an extremely fun game, but I fell in love with Pulp Cthulhu right then and there

270
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:40,560
from having all the different talents and the sanity losing skills that would arrive

271
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,000
with sanity loss was really cool.

272
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,800
I wanted to throw those in.

273
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,800
I started writing this campaign with the items.

274
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,800
That's interesting.

275
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:55,920
I really liked the rules for the different magical items, but I wanted to put it in a

276
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,400
more delta green setting.

277
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:04,600
I started with the items that were in the trunk and I built the story out from there.

278
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:10,960
There are about 35 characters that live in contention and in the city.

279
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:15,120
They are all independent of each other with their own motives.

280
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:21,960
I changed their wants and needs and motives based on everything that happens with these

281
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,160
three police officers.

282
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:28,440
Basically I have a doc sheet where I have all the different characters listed and then

283
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:35,520
I change how the actions of these boys affect them week to week to decide how the story

284
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,440
should progress the next week.

285
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:42,240
As you've seen, I have what I learned from good friends of Jackson Elias.

286
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,200
They call them bangs, I think.

287
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:49,540
Somebody calls them bangs, which are basically just things that you throw in into a scenario

288
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:53,600
and you force your players to deal with them.

289
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,920
So I've basically wrote out all these different characters and what they're going through

290
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,680
and then I write bangs each week.

291
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,400
What's an example of a bang that's happened so far in the story?

292
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:08,480
So far in the story, obviously spoilers in this episode.

293
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,200
If you haven't listened to any of the podcasts up to this point, then...

294
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,200
Stop listening.

295
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,360
Yeah, go back to episode one.

296
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,160
This is a chronological show.

297
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,720
Should we record a little tag saying that right for the start?

298
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,200
I'll have Wolf the Dog do it.

299
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,200
Nice.

300
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,200
Yes.

301
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,800
No.

302
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,000
I'll make Justin do it.

303
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Oh shit.

304
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,760
Wolf's gone Hollywood.

305
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,400
I think we still keep him in the basement, so...

306
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,400
So spoilers.

307
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,400
Right.

308
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,400
Where were we?

309
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,400
You can't let him see the full moon.

310
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,400
An example of a bang.

311
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:44,360
An example of a bang is the body of John Peters falling onto your car.

312
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,360
Oh yeah.

313
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,520
So that was going to happen no matter what we do.

314
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,520
Yeah.

315
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,520
Yeah.

316
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:55,360
It's like in storytelling it's like, would it be more realistic in this super unrealistic

317
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,480
setting for that body to fall not on one of your cars?

318
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:03,480
Probably, but it's a game and it's a story and it's way cooler if it falls on your fucking

319
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,480
car.

320
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,280
Oh, and that's not something I've ever even questioned as a player.

321
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,280
Sure, yeah.

322
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,280
Totally.

323
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,920
So that is basically how I prepare.

324
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:16,760
The scenario has seeds that I wrote two years ago, before the campaign started, probably

325
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,760
two years ago.

326
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,240
When do you think?

327
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,240
What month of...

328
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,200
Okay, so we started recording in December of 2017.

329
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,200
2017.

330
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,200
Oh my god.

331
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,200
Yeah, right?

332
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,200
Yeah.

333
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,200
Okay.

334
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,200
It's been a while.

335
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,840
So we started, yeah, recording in December of 2017, so I probably started writing this

336
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:39,440
in October of 2017 and some of the things that I've written have not come up yet in

337
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,440
the show.

338
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,440
Wow.

339
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,440
Well, I'd hope so.

340
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,480
So I have a lot planned.

341
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:51,160
I have a lot of moving parts that I deal with and that is how much is fleshed out before

342
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,300
they start playing.

343
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:58,040
So for each session I try to brush up on what the people around them in their area might

344
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:01,680
be doing and then if they try to go somewhere that I'm not ready for, I throw a fucking

345
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,680
dead body on their car.

346
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,160
Yeah, you...

347
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,240
Oh, did you guys want to go to the mill?

348
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,240
Really kept us away from that mill.

349
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,640
Oh, did you want to go to the mill?

350
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,440
Kept going to the mill and then it came up.

351
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:17,040
You can abandon any responsibilities at any point in time and go anywhere, but I tried

352
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:20,160
to make the responsibilities pretty top priority.

353
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:26,040
That is what I've realized now that it's just like, if he does that, just go to the mill.

354
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,040
Just go to the mill.

355
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,640
Oh, oh, Chief Maggie's house is on fire.

356
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,640
She's burning alive.

357
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,720
Brian, care, we're going to the mill.

358
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,600
One thing I, it's not really, it kind of has to do with the question, but like as far as

359
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:43,760
like preparing for stuff, me and Joe and Thomas, you know, when we would be recording an episode,

360
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:49,640
like we would go back through and like see what we'd done prior to recording that episode.

361
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:54,880
So before we record, Zach usually writes up a little, uh, overview of what we did last

362
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,840
time and that he has us be sure to read that before we start recording for the next session.

363
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,480
That helps keep it all fresh in our mind.

364
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:07,240
I sent an overview to everyone of everything that happened and I sent individual overviews

365
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:10,120
for times when they were the only one in the room.

366
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:14,200
And usually we would read those as soon as we got to your house and then we would record

367
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:19,080
the next session and Joe, Joe would read them three times.

368
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:24,160
This also brings up something that is kind of one of the reasons I thought we should

369
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,840
have an episode like this.

370
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,760
We recorded this, like he said, we started in December, 2017.

371
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:36,700
The episode you just heard was recorded in November or December, 2018.

372
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:41,400
We did this all over the course of the year, so if there's ever any time where we don't

373
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:45,860
know what's going on in the podcast, like you're like screaming at your microphone or

374
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:46,860
not your mic.

375
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,220
Oh, you're just making excuses now.

376
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,220
Oh, okay, cool.

377
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:54,500
Uh, so I thought this whole Q and a would just to be about excuses.

378
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:58,420
Here's why we're so sorry.

379
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:04,100
There would be a significant time gaps between recording Thomas moved away for like three

380
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,700
months after recording the first sessions.

381
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,900
I was just gone for a while.

382
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:12,720
If there's ever anything super frustrating that you hear that's like, why the fuck don't

383
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,240
they know that it's probably just because they're stupid or why are they making that

384
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,780
super outdated cultural reference?

385
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:23,960
That was a personal, like I was listening to episode like we, we do some editing on

386
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:27,140
our own tracks and I was listening to myself once and I was like, well, that's a fucking

387
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,920
meme from like October.

388
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,920
Like that's bullshit.

389
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,920
Stale.

390
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,920
Stale.

391
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:37,200
And the last episode, I think we mentioned like, yeah, it's a kid from mid nineties and

392
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,200
I'm like, that happened a little while ago.

393
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,200
That was a while ago.

394
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,200
Yeah.

395
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,200
I still haven't seen mid nineties.

396
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,200
It's fine.

397
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,200
It's a, it's a.

398
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,960
Oh wait, no, the one I really need to see is eighth grade.

399
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,960
Yes.

400
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:46,960
And I haven't seen that one either.

401
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,800
It was May 7th, 2019 right now when we're recording this and we haven't seen eighth

402
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,800
grade.

403
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,800
Yeah.

404
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,800
I have seen both of those.

405
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,800
I'm sorry listeners.

406
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,000
But anyway, let's go to another question.

407
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Which rules are they using from pulp and which are native to Delta green?

408
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I'll field this one.

409
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:09,400
We are playing Delta green mechanics except for we have abandoned the bonds mechanic and

410
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:13,680
we have picked up the luck rules from pulp Cthulhu.

411
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:21,240
We are planning, Ooh, spoiler, spoiler alert for the next episode.

412
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:25,880
We are going to add in some talents from pulp Cthulhu.

413
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,320
Oh, very cool.

414
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,240
I'm very excited about this.

415
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,240
That's exclusive to us too, listeners.

416
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,240
Let's move on.

417
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,840
We've got a question from crush 36 real quick.

418
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,840
Shout out to crush 36.

419
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:37,840
Awesome.

420
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,840
Awesome fan.

421
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:39,840
Best fan.

422
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,840
Thank you so much.

423
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:47,120
Crush 36 created a subreddit for pretending to be people and it has freaked me out in

424
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,880
a very good way.

425
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,920
I once said when we first started recording, I think maybe the very first episode we were

426
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:58,760
talking about goals of this podcast and we thought, I think that we would make it maybe

427
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,880
10 episodes in probably before we stopped.

428
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:07,560
However, that didn't happen and someone made fan art and it was, I was about to say, we

429
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,120
had our first fan art.

430
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,640
Crush did a sketch of Clark and boy was that cool to see.

431
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,400
It was, it was pretty awesome.

432
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,400
That was really awesome.

433
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,640
Like a Mr Leahy meets Dale Gribble.

434
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,640
Yeah, it was good.

435
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,640
Oh my God.

436
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,640
Yeah.

437
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,680
Very, very similar to what I had pictured for sure.

438
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,680
Oh wow.

439
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,680
Yeah.

440
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,680
Very similar.

441
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,680
I pictured him a little fatter.

442
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,680
That was the only difference.

443
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,800
I pictured him a little younger, but I really liked the image I saw.

444
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,120
I was like, Oh shit.

445
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,760
He got, he got the balding thing.

446
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,760
Perfect.

447
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,760
That's exactly what I was picturing.

448
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,760
As far as that goes.

449
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:41,160
Taylor said that she pictured Clark Bishop with hair, but I guess she did role play with

450
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:44,600
a, uh, a younger, a younger Clark Bishop who probably had hair.

451
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:49,480
Well, also I just pictured Clark Bishop as Kenneth from 30 Rock as Jack McRae.

452
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,480
No, that's Drew.

453
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,480
That's Drew.

454
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,480
That's Drew.

455
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,480
That's Drew.

456
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,480
Fat.

457
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,480
What's his name?

458
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,480
Shit.

459
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,480
Jack McBrayer.

460
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,480
Yeah.

461
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,480
Well, okay.

462
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,480
So if, if, if Andy Richter had Jack McBrayer's personality, that's what I'm thinking of.

463
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,480
Yeah.

464
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,480
That is incredible.

465
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,480
Yeah.

466
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,520
It was when I, when I saw that on the subreddit, I was like, dope.

467
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,840
We have fan art now.

468
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,840
Like that's, that's fucking wild.

469
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:16,840
It blew me away and made all of the time and effort that I put into this really feel like

470
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,840
it's heartwarming.

471
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,840
It was extremely heartwarming.

472
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,840
Yeah.

473
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,840
Shout out to crush 36.

474
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,840
Sorry.

475
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:28,760
Crush 36 asks how far from the original storyline and vision have the boys wandered?

476
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:33,840
Did major plot points have to get sacrificed to the altar of improv?

477
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,640
Yes.

478
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,640
A lot.

479
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,960
Um, next one.

480
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,160
Thanks for the question.

481
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,160
The answer is a lot.

482
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,160
Uh, no, for real.

483
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,160
Yeah.

484
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:48,000
Is there anything you can tell us about that without being too spoiler?

485
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:52,400
Because I mean, obviously as players, that's something I really want to know.

486
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,400
Okay.

487
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,480
Here is the truth.

488
00:23:55,480 --> 00:24:02,800
We got together for a session zero two months after I had began writing this entire campaign

489
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:06,680
and we got together, we had already been talking about characters and we'd already been talking

490
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:11,360
about setting, but we were going to meet and record on mic, which I think we have recorded

491
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:16,360
still us talking about what the characters were going to be, what the setting was going

492
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,360
to be.

493
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,720
We built the town.

494
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,720
We built the town.

495
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:23,800
I had a list of different kinds of businesses that would exist in a small town and we went

496
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:31,160
through and I came up with a long time just town building, like just world building, world

497
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,160
building.

498
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,160
Yeah.

499
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,160
Which is God so much fun.

500
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,160
Was that okay.

501
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,400
Uh, Oh God.

502
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:40,000
This would be a more informed question if I could remember the name of the system.

503
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,480
But do you know that, uh, that sci-fi RPG where everybody builds the world together.

504
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,560
That's like the original one, right?

505
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,560
The old school one.

506
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:51,120
You can die during this is a pretty light one where everybody kind of roll some things

507
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,360
and all the players help build the system.

508
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,440
I was wondering if it was inspired by that at all.

509
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,440
It super wasn't.

510
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:03,240
Uh, I've just been, I've just been listening to a lot of different people talking about

511
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,240
playing RPGs.

512
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:10,480
I've been listening to a lot of different actual plays and I really took from them the

513
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,920
idea of coming together for a session zero and world building.

514
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:19,400
You also mentioned at the time that it would help us to have a familiarity with the area

515
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,400
kind of built in.

516
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:25,720
And it is awesome cause right now I'm looking at the map of contention hung up on the wall

517
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,040
in the room that we're recording in.

518
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:31,480
We've posted a few times on social media, the map of contention, but we did have one

519
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,480
drawn out.

520
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,320
Uh, it's, it's huge.

521
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:39,040
The map that Zach made and he would point to where things were going on for us in the

522
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,040
episode.

523
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,040
Yeah.

524
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,700
Cause the map was really important to me from the beginning.

525
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:46,900
If you're playing in a small town, I thought it'd be really fun to see where everything

526
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:47,900
is.

527
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:48,900
Pages, clinkers.

528
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:49,900
Yeah.

529
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:50,900
All these different places.

530
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:57,980
And uh, thankfully we have Justin who plays Wolf the dog and does the soundtrack for pretending

531
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:00,540
to be people real quick.

532
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:02,100
Give it up for Justin.

533
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:07,580
You guys are too sweet.

534
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:12,260
Somebody did ask the question, Oh, Brendan DePinto on Facebook asked, how long did it

535
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:14,020
take to create the map?

536
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:18,740
And so, I mean, I made the original sketch of the map, but recently a couple of weeks

537
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:24,740
ago for those listening, but like two days ago for us, we posted the map of contention

538
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:26,460
that Justin made.

539
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:32,020
So basically I had Zach just send me a high res copy of the map, like taking a picture

540
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:33,380
of it.

541
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:39,780
And then I taught myself Adobe illustrator so I could make said map as a high resolution

542
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:44,520
as possible because I really like whenever he would post stuff and he'd be like, this

543
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,140
is where this episode is taking place.

544
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:52,160
But I also wanted it to be like higher quality and a little more character added into it.

545
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:57,380
So it took me like six hours or so to make it something like that cause I was also trying

546
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:58,620
to learn a program.

547
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,580
The splashylvania logo.

548
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:02,260
It's the best thing on there.

549
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,260
So fucking cool.

550
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:09,320
If you haven't looked at it yet, zoom in on that because basically I took the like water,

551
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:14,360
the wave aesthetic and like added that in and then just added these big, huge vampire

552
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,960
chompers on top of it.

553
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:16,960
It's incredible.

554
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:17,960
It gets me going.

555
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:24,720
And it was really fun to create little icons for all of these weird places and contention,

556
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,320
kind of like a video game map almost is what I was thinking.

557
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,720
And that's, that's exactly what it is.

558
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,720
And it's like perfect.

559
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,560
I think about this like a video game.

560
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:38,400
I mean that's, I mean all video games essentially come out of the tabletop, like early RPGs.

561
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:44,240
So right back to the major plot points that have gotten sacrificed.

562
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:50,200
In that session zero, we were talking about the map and I was telling you guys about the

563
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:54,400
piston junkyard because I knew that was going to be a place that we were going to go to

564
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,160
pretty much right away.

565
00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:02,200
Speaking of bangs, very first bang in the whole show is a call from Julie Maxwell says

566
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,680
there's a dead body in the piston junkyard.

567
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,680
That's a bang.

568
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,680
Boom.

569
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,000
And so the story begins.

570
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,140
During that session zero, I said, yeah, and there's a junkyard right here and it sits

571
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:16,080
on an old mine.

572
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:23,920
And Thomas said, Oh, is the super dark evil at the bottom of the old mine?

573
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:28,120
And I said, no, I have to write that.

574
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:31,920
It would have made things a lot easier for us if I had just shut up.

575
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:36,880
So then I rewrote the entire campaign idea.

576
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,200
I had not even thought about that.

577
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:45,280
Because the evil was at the bottom of the mine, but now it's not.

578
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,280
And I like that.

579
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:53,360
So good job, Thomas, for punching up the whole campaign during session zero.

580
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:59,760
So stuff like that, obviously, but once we got into the show, like I said before, I have

581
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,200
all these different moving parts.

582
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:06,480
So they basically interact with a fully working town in my mind.

583
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:11,080
So that was a kind of improv out of the campaign.

584
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,760
Has anything that major happened in the campaign?

585
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,760
Well, yeah.

586
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:19,680
I mean, we have to mention Keith's pants every once in a while, just to remind people how

587
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,680
big they are.

588
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,680
But I'm saying it's no.

589
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:24,320
That's plot points that we came up with organically, but like, have you...

590
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:28,280
Not even a plot point, that's just a bit.

591
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:32,000
But nothing you've planned has been super changed by our actions?

592
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:38,320
Every single thing that you do changes where the story goes, because I don't have a story

593
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,320
in mind.

594
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:43,320
I only have people and people who want things.

595
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,820
And so the story isn't already written.

596
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:48,820
You guys are the ones basically making that happen.

597
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:49,820
So cool.

598
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:55,480
I will say the most affected is every little thing that you mentioned about your characters.

599
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:59,960
Every little detail goes into my little book about your backstories, which you've given

600
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:04,680
me basically full realm to just go haywire on.

601
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:07,680
It's kind of like the real book you keep on all of us as friends.

602
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,680
Exactly.

603
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:11,440
Which I heard that you found.

604
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,400
And Thomas told me all about it.

605
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,400
I was flattered.

606
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,400
Thank you so much.

607
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,400
I liked what I read in there.

608
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,400
Okay.

609
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,400
Well.

610
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,840
You were so complimentary of all of our feet.

611
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:26,080
That's why I don't take my shoes off at Zach's house.

612
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:34,960
I just don't think about him that much myself, but I'm so glad you've noticed.

613
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,720
He likes the smell.

614
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,680
You guys were just born with great feet.

615
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,680
What can I say?

616
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,680
Thanks.

617
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,680
You too.

618
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:45,820
I am going to need a heat break and a pee break if that's okay.

619
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:47,320
Let's go ahead and take a break.

620
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:52,360
We will be right back after this word from our sponsors.

621
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,680
This is Al from Al's Tires.

622
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:56,160
I don't want to waste too much of your time.

623
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:59,180
We have good tires and good service at good prices.

624
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:01,960
Come on down and see us if you feel that's appropriate.

625
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,320
Thank you.

626
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:07,180
Here at Burgatory, we put three simple things into every meal we serve.

627
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:12,300
Quality ingredients, service with a smile, and unquestioning faith in our undying Lord,

628
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,620
Jesus Christ.

629
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:17,160
We cook our patties the old fashioned way, medium or above.

630
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,740
It's all undefined gray area here at Burgatory.

631
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:22,420
Time is running out to indulge in our monthly specials for May.

632
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:27,280
We're celebrating Cinco de Mayo with our seven layer dip and the Holy Guacamole burger.

633
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:33,560
Don't forget to tell your amigos, Burgatory, come spend some time with us.

634
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,600
Al from Al's Tires here again.

635
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,400
Just wanted to let you know we're located just outside of contention on rural route

636
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,400
six.

637
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,180
If you pass the tiger sanctuary, you've gone too far.

638
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:46,840
Come on down and see us if it's not too much out of your way.

639
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,480
Thank you.

640
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,480
All right.

641
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:55,200
And make sure to get the product that was featured in that last advertisement.

642
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,640
I love that product.

643
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,840
I use it all the time.

644
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,080
It's an extremely good product.

645
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,080
I'm using it.

646
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:04,160
I'm either wearing it or using it right now.

647
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,740
Product make me happy boy.

648
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:08,540
That product makes me extremely happy.

649
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:10,360
I don't buy product.

650
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:14,600
We got a question from the Robert Shippey on Instagram.

651
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:19,040
He asks, Luke, why?

652
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,600
Because it's fun.

653
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,600
I love it.

654
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,600
If I didn't do it, I wouldn't be doing this.

655
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:30,600
Luke, you know other people exist, right?

656
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,600
Yeah.

657
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:39,000
I try not to do anything that is too detrimental to anyone else's fun.

658
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
You never do anything detrimental to our fun.

659
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:46,200
I'm playing a game to have fun and I'm going to do it for fun.

660
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,280
It's only added joy to the group dynamic.

661
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,720
I'm not playing a Dr. Denny Dennison.

662
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,160
That guy was much more disruptive to the group.

663
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,880
He was.

664
00:32:55,880 --> 00:33:02,840
Luke's last character was named Dr. Denny Dennison, AKA Worm Fingers.

665
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:07,800
I hated pretty much everything about him.

666
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,640
I was a doctor for a cult.

667
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:18,600
I had a scat fetish that was developed through the game.

668
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,440
I didn't plan it that way, but it happened.

669
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,160
You really ran with it.

670
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,160
Overall, just really creepy, terrible character.

671
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:31,880
I actually specifically remember the first time that you acted out your scat fetish.

672
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:38,680
You actually stood up in my kitchen in the dining room and you stood up and fully charade

673
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:46,920
played out your interaction with a toilet and then I think perhaps masturbating to completion.

674
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:50,880
And then he shat on your cat.

675
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,520
All that's true until the cat thing.

676
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:57,360
He was a doctor for a cult and that's all you need to know.

677
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,160
So obviously that comes with the territory.

678
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:09,600
So yeah, Keith Vigna is a pretty tame character for most of the characters I've played.

679
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,760
Keith is pretty tame.

680
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:16,880
I like playing a character that is not all there.

681
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,640
I think you're doing it very well.

682
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:24,760
I remember specifically when we were coming up with character ideas, you had this giddy

683
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:30,040
fucking look on your face and you came up to me and you're like, I'm playing an idiot.

684
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:33,280
And I was like, all right, well, which is easy for me to do.

685
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:39,800
If the losers don't know, Luke is literally right now, he's saving up for a system of

686
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,800
a down tattoo.

687
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,800
That's not a joke.

688
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,120
Yeah, that is completely true.

689
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:46,520
He was also his high school valedictorian.

690
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,520
I was.

691
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:51,360
He went to school with a bunch of dumb asses.

692
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,360
That's not true.

693
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:55,880
I graduated a class of like 453 I think.

694
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,560
I thought you were going to say like four or five.

695
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,840
453, top of my class.

696
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:02,960
Like you didn't know whether there were four or five people in your graduating class.

697
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:07,560
I'm book smart, not smart.

698
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:11,160
That's not what you are.

699
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:15,720
We've got another question here from, I don't know how to say this, maybe oomph.

700
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,720
I like oomph.

701
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:24,040
OMF dash on Reddit asks, did Zach offer up insane options selling coke, killing your

702
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:27,520
brother, thinking the guys wouldn't do it?

703
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:31,280
I love the fact that the guys are kept in the dark on these solo side missions.

704
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,280
Second question.

705
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,400
Oh no, sorry.

706
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,400
Not second question.

707
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,920
I love the fact that these guys are kept in the dark on these solo missions.

708
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:38,920
It started over.

709
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:39,920
I already did.

710
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:40,920
Yeah, he had it.

711
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,440
That's the whole thing over again.

712
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:48,600
Do it.

713
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,200
Luke's the producer now.

714
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,200
Look at me.

715
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,200
I'm the captain now.

716
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,080
He's like, I could just tell you didn't get what you needed, so you needed to do it all

717
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,080
again.

718
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,080
Zach, do it.

719
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,080
Do it.

720
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,080
Again.

721
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,080
Do it.

722
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,080
Do it better.

723
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,080
But do it, yeah, do it good this time.

724
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:07,280
Do you know that we all demand perfection of ourselves as our characters and you're

725
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,480
just here flubbing these fucking pre-written questions?

726
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:16,120
Did Zach offer up insane options, selling coke, killing your brother, thinking the guy...

727
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,840
Matt Besser's Bjork.

728
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:20,320
It's Matt Besser's Bjork, sorry.

729
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,960
TM TM.

730
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:28,140
So basically, yes, I offered them up thinking that they would make things more interesting,

731
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,360
that's for sure.

732
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:33,960
I didn't know that they would perhaps follow through with these things or whether they

733
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,920
would help each other do them.

734
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:44,600
Thomas, I certainly expected to at least ask for Keith Vigna's help to sell the cocaine

735
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:48,960
perhaps, but I really didn't know.

736
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,040
You misinterpreted our character development.

737
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,040
Clearly.

738
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,720
I don't really listen to the show.

739
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,080
No, why would you?

740
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,080
Because I don't think...

741
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:00,560
I like to think that we're all friendly with each other, but I don't think that Keith and

742
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,200
Jon are friends, really.

743
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,820
Not the best friends, for sure.

744
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:09,860
And also, now that I'm saying it out loud, he's the worst person you could bring in on

745
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:11,580
a drug deal.

746
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:16,960
But on this particular drug deal, he might have been a pretty interesting addition, which

747
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,300
is, I guess, why you did that.

748
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:22,740
Clark wouldn't do it, Keith would, but he'd probably fuck something up, so I think it

749
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,780
was smart for you to just do it by yourself.

750
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:28,220
I also just wanted five million dollars for my character.

751
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:29,580
To no doubt.

752
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:30,980
And not 2.5.

753
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:32,700
I certainly...

754
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:33,700
That's wrong, right?

755
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,060
Well, you brought Drew in, and he's probably...

756
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:36,060
That would be four people.

757
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:38,340
I think Drew was probably the best option to bring in.

758
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:43,180
I mean, you alluded to the fact that it would have been a much different encounter if Keith

759
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:46,780
Vigna would have been there when the Duke came to sell cocaine.

760
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:47,780
That would have been awesome.

761
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:48,780
I should have asked Keith for help.

762
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:50,380
Oh, well, yeah, because that was my brother.

763
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:52,100
Yeah, it turns out.

764
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:58,100
So we can actually get into the question now that someone asked, do the players ever listen

765
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:02,260
back to the podcast, or is that something you don't do to keep yourselves in the dark

766
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:04,260
about the things you don't know?

767
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:06,380
I mean, that's up to you guys to answer.

768
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:10,180
I definitely don't listen to the other guy's stuff, except just recently, Zach gave us

769
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:15,500
permission to hear some of our solo mission stuff, because we were kind of far away from

770
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,500
it in playtime.

771
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,500
Exactly, yeah.

772
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:22,980
It wasn't going to affect our roleplay at that point, and it was really, really cool.

773
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:25,020
I think we kind of left it up to Zach.

774
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:29,220
We were like, is it okay to listen to this?

775
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:34,820
I think, for the most part, what we had recorded so far, he was like, it's fine.

776
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:39,020
There were certain weeks where I'd say, don't listen to the dreams that other people are

777
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:42,340
having, and then other weeks where I'd say, yeah, yeah, yeah.

778
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:47,940
It came out in-game recently that Jon had done that drug deal, Marvin Glass clearly

779
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:53,060
accused him of it, and you guys immediately bought into the idea at that point.

780
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:55,420
Same with me of killing my brother.

781
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:59,060
I'm pretty sure no one had any clue that Jon was in on that.

782
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:00,540
I think he denied that pretty well.

783
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:01,540
Well, that was the thing.

784
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:04,700
Up until recording this right now-

785
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:05,700
Well, that.

786
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:08,900
I mean, in the last episode, where Jon's just like, no.

787
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:09,900
Yeah.

788
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:10,900
Well, yeah.

789
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:14,660
Up until recording this, we didn't ... Recording anything else up until this right now, we

790
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:16,580
had no clue what each other were doing.

791
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:17,580
During the recording.

792
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:18,580
Right.

793
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:22,180
That's something Zach requested, but it's also, I find it a lot of fun to be in the

794
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:23,180
dark about what you guys are doing.

795
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:24,180
Oh, yeah.

796
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:25,180
It is super fun as a player.

797
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:26,900
It leads to a bunch of really great roleplay moments.

798
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:31,580
That was like ... Now, I do know that Coke Deal and you guys know that-

799
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:33,660
Well, that it was your brother doing the Coke Deal.

800
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:34,660
Right.

801
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:35,660
Yeah, exactly.

802
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:36,660
That was a reveal.

803
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:37,660
We were all excited.

804
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:38,660
Yeah.

805
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:39,660
It surprised us all.

806
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:40,660
That one hit everyone.

807
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:41,660
Yeah.

808
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:42,660
That was cool.

809
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:43,660
It was awesome to know that.

810
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:47,500
I think, Zach, you mentioned in the future, going into it, we're going to do-

811
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:53,100
We got a little lax as we're releasing episodes, but I think it'll be more closed.

812
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,100
Yes.

813
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:59,220
As we move on forward, it's going to be just as closed as it was last time in the sense

814
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:04,860
that while we're recording sessions, you guys won't be able to listen to each other's side

815
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,380
parts.

816
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:13,300
Within the context of the game, I think everyone's pretty well aware of the deaths of Keith Vigna

817
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:16,380
and Clark Bishop and-

818
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:17,380
With the look-

819
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:18,380
What?

820
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:19,380
What?

821
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:20,380
What?

822
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:21,380
Zach, what?

823
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:28,860
And I mean, to be completely frank, John Lee Pettymore is in the den of Marvin Glasp, so

824
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:32,060
do you think he's going to last super long?

825
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:33,060
We'll see.

826
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:37,660
However, I have made- I basically like all things with this story.

827
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:44,060
I folded in what happens into the future, and so the fact that these guys have listened

828
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:48,900
to certain things, I will make sure that story-wise, it makes sense that their characters know

829
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,900
them, if that makes sense.

830
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:53,540
You'll figure it out next week or the week after.

831
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:58,660
The only thing you specifically expressed regret about is that we listen to some of

832
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:00,940
Clark's recent things.

833
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:01,940
Yes.

834
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:08,060
Clark being inducted into the circle of knowledge is something that Thomas and Luke now know,

835
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:12,400
but the characters they're playing do not, so that is one of the things that I am going

836
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:19,340
to attempt to figure out a way to let their characters know while folding that into the

837
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:20,340
plot.

838
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:23,940
If we're getting much closer to when we're actually recording, that'll be a lot easier

839
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:27,620
to manage, it'll just be a matter of you'll be saying don't listen to their section this

840
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:28,620
week.

841
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:29,620
Yep, exactly.

842
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:36,700
Because I mean, we had 27, 28 episodes recorded until just now that we had to get through,

843
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:39,260
so that's weeks of stuff.

844
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:42,900
I hope we're still good at role-playing.

845
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,540
I've kind of lost interest in it, honestly.

846
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:46,540
Yeah, it's not my bag anymore.

847
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:50,140
I'm more into Red Dead and Apex right now.

848
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:51,500
Obviously, yeah.

849
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:52,780
Weaving.

850
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:55,140
What hardware and software do you guys use?

851
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:57,620
We actually just upgraded our microphones.

852
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:59,020
Yeah, this very episode.

853
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:02,580
This here very episode you're listening to, we got ourselves some new microphones.

854
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:05,180
Should we say out loud what it is or should we wait for the sponsorship?

855
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:09,180
No, until we know that they don't suck, and until they give us money, we shouldn't.

856
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:10,180
No, let's tell them.

857
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:12,660
So we're super excited about that.

858
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:18,180
Hopefully it'll cut down on the editing time for me and also make the listening experience

859
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:19,180
better for you.

860
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:21,660
Oh, don't do that.

861
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:28,700
To answer the actual question, these are Samsung, not Samsung, Samsung Q2Us.

862
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:30,980
Just for this episode.

863
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:34,380
Yeah, that's not what we recorded on until this point, though.

864
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:35,380
No, previously-

865
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:37,340
So that can be a fun mystery for you.

866
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:43,100
No, I will tell you, previously we were recording on the shittiest SM58 clones.

867
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:44,760
Yeah, they were knock-off.

868
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,220
They were trash mics.

869
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:48,660
And that's what I've got right now because I forgot mine in my house.

870
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:54,660
I'm glad you love the audio quality, you fucking peasants.

871
00:42:54,660 --> 00:43:00,500
So hopefully we'll be able to take it up another notch in the old quality section.

872
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:09,620
Software-wise, we record into a Tascam Digital Porta Studio 2488 Neo that I have had in my

873
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:15,500
home for four years that belongs to Justin's dad.

874
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:20,020
Yeah, he wants it back sometime, probably.

875
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:23,700
My dad, every six months, will be like, where's my Porta Studio at?

876
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:25,020
What's he doing with it?

877
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:26,500
He's not doing anything with it.

878
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:29,780
He just is like, what if I want to record a whole jazz album by myself?

879
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:31,220
What if I want a podcast?

880
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:32,660
Justin, what's your dad's name?

881
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:34,020
He can come over here and record it.

882
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:37,100
Don't dox Justin, yeah.

883
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:38,100
Justin Jr.?

884
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:42,580
Shout out to Justin Jr. for letting us use his equipment.

885
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:46,300
Justin's his dad's senior, and it's always been that way since birth.

886
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:47,300
That was weird.

887
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:53,340
It really gets into the time travel aspect we've just begun to get into on this podcast.

888
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:54,340
Thank God.

889
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:58,300
Justin is one of the dudes from the camera.

890
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:02,180
And then software, I use Audacity to edit free and easy.

891
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:03,180
Yep.

892
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:07,460
Recently, Joe turned me on to Acid Pro 7, is that what it's called?

893
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:09,060
I think it's 7.

894
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:10,300
They might have 8 out now.

895
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:11,300
I can't remember.

896
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:17,420
It's an acid pro, and I got it in a humble bundle, is that what it's called?

897
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:20,820
I used acid when I was a kid.

898
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:21,820
And then the program is pretty cool too.

899
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:22,820
That makes a lot of sense.

900
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:23,820
Wowee.

901
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:24,820
Advanced.

902
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:32,700
Can you regale us with a story from your childhood?

903
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:39,860
I also, when I record my Wolf the Dog parts, I use Reaper, which is really excellent and

904
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:44,860
low priced if you want a pro quality digital audio workstation.

905
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:45,860
And you're always on acid.

906
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:47,380
And I'm always on acid.

907
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:48,380
Which really helps.

908
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:49,380
I'm never not on acid.

909
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:51,540
We're going to take this moment to shout out microdosing.

910
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:52,540
Microdosing.

911
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:56,540
Brought to you by the Tanini B people.

912
00:44:56,540 --> 00:45:01,580
That humble bundle that did the acid pro, they've done that twice now, and both times

913
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:04,380
it's been a ton of really great audio programs.

914
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:06,780
I'm very excited to jump into it.

915
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:10,060
And we have colored microphone covers.

916
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:11,060
Mine's orange.

917
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:12,060
Mine's red.

918
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:13,060
Mine's green.

919
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:14,060
Mine's blue.

920
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:15,060
And mine's black.

921
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:16,060
Justin's is black.

922
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:22,340
All right, and just another reminder that this episode is going to be our release for

923
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:27,340
the Patreon that we are starting for this podcast to keep us going.

924
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:31,380
So hop on there, we'll put a link up on all the social media sites.

925
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:36,060
If you don't follow us on Instagram or Twitter, we're at PretendingPod on there.

926
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:40,540
And like we said earlier, Crush 36, did I get that right?

927
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:41,540
Yes, you did.

928
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:48,160
Crush 36 created a subreddit for us called r slash pretending to be people.

929
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:52,660
And in case you need to know the details of the Patreon, what we're going to do is donate

930
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:57,980
one individual donation at the highest level of the NPR donation level.

931
00:45:57,980 --> 00:46:05,200
And then we're going to share the benefits with everyone who subscribes to our Patreon.

932
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:11,680
So $5 gets you the max NPR subscriber benefits.

933
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,480
We still have to talk to Terry about that.

934
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:16,280
That's our plan right now.

935
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:20,400
So hopefully you're all very interested in that.

936
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:23,800
Otherwise Luke gave $1,000 to NPR for nothing.

937
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:25,240
Which that's fine.

938
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:27,880
I got some socks out of it.

939
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:28,880
It was a...

940
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:29,880
A mug?

941
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:30,880
Some socks.

942
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:31,880
It was a...

943
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:32,880
Do you have a sock pun?

944
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:35,840
No, I have NPR socks that are...

945
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:38,280
It's Calamari Shapiro.

946
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:39,840
And it's Ari Shapiro's head on a...

947
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:40,840
Calamari is squid.

948
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,280
Oh, it's not made out of...

949
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:43,280
Okay.

950
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:44,280
I thought you meant scatman.

951
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:47,740
It's Calamari Shapiro and it's Ari Shapiro's head on a squid.

952
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:48,840
It's an actual NPR joke.

953
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:49,840
I actually have those socks.

954
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:51,640
Those are things you actually have, not a...

955
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:52,640
Yeah.

956
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:53,640
Okay.

957
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:57,280
BF Evans 19 asks, do you approach playing a recorded session differently than when you

958
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,280
play off mic?

959
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:02,420
And he also asked, has there been any aspect of podcasting that has surprised you or been

960
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:04,340
particularly interesting?

961
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:09,980
And I noticed as soon as we all put on headphones, we became more respectful of each other's

962
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:10,980
storytelling process.

963
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:11,980
That's a great point.

964
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:15,740
We didn't jump on each other's trains of thought as much.

965
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:19,280
Let me just jump on that too.

966
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:23,940
In the podcast, sometimes we do talk over each other a little bit, but not near as much

967
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:26,300
as we would if it was not being recorded.

968
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:27,300
Totally.

969
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:31,220
When everybody else's voice is right in your ears, it is harder to do.

970
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:36,140
And I still notice when we edit our tracks that we do it a lot.

971
00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:37,940
It happens, but...

972
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:40,980
The thought process behind it is very similar though.

973
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:49,620
I just try to not be an asshole and not always succeed, but try not to be an asshole to my

974
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:50,620
fellow players.

975
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:53,480
Yeah, it's not like we're all your best friends.

976
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:57,180
I'm still trying to play the game or enjoy the game.

977
00:47:57,180 --> 00:47:59,420
I think that's as far as it goes.

978
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:04,020
As far as playing or making jokes and stuff like that, I don't...

979
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:06,980
Yeah, the bare bones of it are no, there's no difference.

980
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:11,060
We're all joking with each other and pushing each other to do funny things.

981
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:15,860
I mean, the reason we did this is that we thought we're great.

982
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:18,460
You should hear it.

983
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:21,460
There's a hell of truth to that though, that we all realized we had something special going

984
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:24,140
on in those sessions we didn't record.

985
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:25,180
We super enjoyed it.

986
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:26,180
We all mixed together.

987
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:31,060
And it was the first group, I think, with all of us that we were like, I want to play

988
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:34,020
with this group as long as I possibly can.

989
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:41,740
Speaking of which, we also had BFEvans19 ask, what are your backgrounds in tabletop gaming?

990
00:48:41,740 --> 00:48:45,260
Which I think we covered a little bit at the very beginning of episode one.

991
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:47,580
But that might be not in everybody's mind.

992
00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:49,020
That was a while ago.

993
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:52,060
So something we might not have covered in that episode though, actually, is I think

994
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:56,500
almost all of us come to tabletop gaming through podcasts.

995
00:48:56,500 --> 00:49:00,140
That's what made me want to play these kinds of games.

996
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:01,140
Absolutely.

997
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:02,140
Not me, honestly.

998
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:03,140
Yeah, not me either.

999
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:04,140
Uh, definitely me.

1000
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:08,500
I was, uh, I got turned on to it all by Critical Role and I'm still a huge fan of theirs.

1001
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:13,180
Um, yeah, I saw them and decided that that was something I wanted to do.

1002
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:17,260
And then I mentioned this on the first episode, but Thomas kind of out of the blue, I don't

1003
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:19,620
think you knew that I was watching that.

1004
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:24,220
Just if I wanted to do a D&D game with some mutual friends.

1005
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:26,420
And yeah, it was just lucky, serendipitous heaven stance.

1006
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:29,820
And that was 2016?

1007
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:30,820
Kind of.

1008
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:31,820
Oh, I looked it up at the time.

1009
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:32,820
I think something like that.

1010
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:33,820
Yeah.

1011
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:38,620
Kind of when role playing was just, you know, it was becoming this very accepted deal, popular.

1012
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:41,580
We're not, we're not, uh, ostracized.

1013
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:42,580
Yeah.

1014
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:44,580
We're cooler than you.

1015
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:51,540
Well, I mean, like for me, I, I played, I said this in the first episode, but I played

1016
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:56,420
a D and D twice in high school, played it with a guy that was super serious with a group

1017
00:49:56,420 --> 00:49:58,100
that was not serious.

1018
00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:01,780
He did not invite us back to play with him.

1019
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:07,580
And I, uh, always was like, anyone that was playing it, I was like, if you have room for

1020
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:08,580
somebody, I'll jump in.

1021
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:12,820
But most people have like groups that are pretty set up and yeah, so I never really

1022
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:19,580
had the chance until I met, shout out to Alex, Alex, uh, he invited me to play with

1023
00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:20,580
you guys.

1024
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:24,900
I think it was me, Alex, Taylor, Zach and Thomas at the time.

1025
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:27,940
Alex is the most handsome man we know he is.

1026
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:33,100
And I wish he was still here after me, Luke and Zach.

1027
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:37,780
But uh, yeah, that's all for, yeah, and just, he's top six, top six.

1028
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:38,780
Wow.

1029
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:40,780
It wasn't about handsomeness.

1030
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:42,780
Me and Joe got fucking thrown under the bus.

1031
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:43,780
You ugly fucks.

1032
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:47,220
It was just about who's friends with Alex, not.

1033
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:52,620
If you guys would, if you guys would like to see pictures of Joe or Justin, you can

1034
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:56,500
find them on our Instagram at at pretending pot.

1035
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:57,500
You be the judge.

1036
00:50:57,500 --> 00:51:04,820
Oh, also if we get to 500 Patreon subscribers, there is a special boudoir picture of Thomas.

1037
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:05,820
Oh no.

1038
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:11,460
Oh, this is recently taken and it started my birthday off with a bang.

1039
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:12,460
Bang.

1040
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:13,460
Uh, yeah.

1041
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:15,460
Anyway, invited by Alex to play with them.

1042
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:20,180
I played one session or one campaign, I guess with them.

1043
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:22,360
Uh, it was super fun.

1044
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:26,300
We did it again and then now we're doing it again.

1045
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:27,300
Yeah.

1046
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:32,980
Uh, Justin here actually once texted me at 11 PM on a weeknight and was like, Hey, you

1047
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:36,260
know that Delta green thing that I've been talking to you about?

1048
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:40,900
And I'm like, I'm super down if, if, if you'll have me.

1049
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:46,840
And uh, he had me, um, and yeah, no, he, uh, he hit me up and I went over there and we

1050
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:49,780
roleplayed, we played a shotgun scenario.

1051
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:54,740
Uh, our friend Sam ran us through it as the first handler I ever had.

1052
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:55,740
Shout out to Sam.

1053
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:56,740
Shout out to Sam.

1054
00:51:56,740 --> 00:51:57,740
Got me into roleplaying.

1055
00:51:57,740 --> 00:51:59,700
Uh, Justin invited me over.

1056
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:07,060
The two of us played agents and we played through the scenario, uh, last things last.

1057
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:09,380
That scenario is fucking awesome.

1058
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:12,660
And it completely got me kickstarted into this game.

1059
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:13,660
Yeah.

1060
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:19,460
I, uh, I remember getting invited not by Sam actually, but by Tyler who was living with

1061
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:20,460
Sam at the time.

1062
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:28,260
Uh, no, Tyler, uh, Tyler Thrasher people might know him from Tyler Thrasher art.

1063
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:30,700
No curiosity.

1064
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:41,260
And as Zach's glares at me, dead face, I was just resting, I'm sorry.

1065
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:42,860
You show your fucking mouth, Thomas.

1066
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:44,740
How did you get into roleplaying Justin?

1067
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:49,980
Well, my friend, my friend Tyler Thrasher, uh, invited me and he's actually going to

1068
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:56,260
be Tyler Thrasher beam.

1069
00:52:56,260 --> 00:52:57,260
They got married.

1070
00:52:57,260 --> 00:52:58,260
He took his hand.

1071
00:52:58,260 --> 00:52:59,260
They hyphenated it.

1072
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:06,160
Uh, he invited me and I did, this was maybe a year before I invited Zach and I was super

1073
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:08,540
into the idea, but I was kinda like, yeah, I don't know.

1074
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:12,460
It seems like it can seem impenetrable from the outside.

1075
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:15,780
Like like Luke said, people have these groups and you're like, I don't know if I'll fit

1076
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:16,780
in.

1077
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:17,780
I don't know what to do.

1078
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:21,380
It's like there's all these rules and rule books, but he made it really accessible and

1079
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:23,020
fun.

1080
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:26,720
And me and Zach had started hanging out and I was like, you're going to love this.

1081
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:31,540
There's a performative aspect to it, but it has all this like cool like world building

1082
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:36,360
and story stuff and all this other stuff and I just knew Zach would be hopefully super

1083
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:37,360
into it.

1084
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:40,900
And then that kind of started off a lot of this stuff, which is really interesting.

1085
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:44,880
And everything you just described is to me the strength of Delta green over a lot of

1086
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:47,660
other role playing systems.

1087
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:53,000
And also the strength of Zach as a DM is, well, I would say mostly the strength of friendship

1088
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:56,120
That's what binds us all together.

1089
00:53:56,120 --> 00:54:02,400
Because like the most fun thing is getting to create this wacky, crazy story with friends

1090
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:07,640
where we don't have to play on the tropes of normal storytelling because we don't, at

1091
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:11,120
the end of the day, have tons of control over where the story goes.

1092
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:13,280
I mean, we roll dice all the time.

1093
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:14,760
What do you mean, we?

1094
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:16,920
And that's the beautiful thing about all role playing.

1095
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:17,920
Yes.

1096
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:24,920
Like for instance, in the hotel motel, Rosemary was going to slit Keith's throat open and

1097
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:30,320
Joe rolled a critical success on a persuade and that's what kept her from literally just

1098
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:32,800
like murdering Keith right in front of you guys.

1099
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,320
Keith, say thank you.

1100
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:35,320
Thanks, Joe.

1101
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:36,320
I regret it.

1102
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:39,320
I regret it to this day.

1103
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:42,920
Well, I'll think about that in the future.

1104
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:49,680
Well, I mean, also, I mean, in the last episode, like me shooting at the Kevin and missing,

1105
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:53,400
it's like that could have could have gone completely everything.

1106
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:54,560
Everything could always turn out different.

1107
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:55,680
Like crit success.

1108
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:56,680
It's awesome.

1109
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:57,680
Absolutely.

1110
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:58,680
Crit fail.

1111
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:04,600
You have something in your mind that you want to do and it's not up to me or to Zach whether

1112
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:05,600
it happens.

1113
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:07,340
It's up to purely a dice roll.

1114
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:12,980
Another thing, like another example would be when you guys asked about Julie Maxwell

1115
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:17,640
in the hospital after her drunk driving incident and I said, yeah, let me roll for it real

1116
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:25,320
quick to see if she's healthy and then rolled a 100 and she's so she died completely.

1117
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:28,620
I mean, yeah, the dice changed the game.

1118
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:30,460
It's so much people.

1119
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:31,460
Yeah.

1120
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:33,820
Pete, I'm getting really fired up about this.

1121
00:55:33,820 --> 00:55:36,980
I'm tired of people on Twitter saying the dice don't change the game.

1122
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:37,980
I understand.

1123
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:42,860
They think that we write the scripts ahead of time and then have recorded them and mostly

1124
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:48,180
we do, but that's not for them to say and it's rude that they keep saying it.

1125
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:49,180
Okay.

1126
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:50,180
Let's see.

1127
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:51,180
What's the next question?

1128
00:55:51,180 --> 00:55:52,180
It's rude.

1129
00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:53,180
It's rude.

1130
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:58,460
I got a question from Lil Sleepy on Instagram has an important question.

1131
00:55:58,460 --> 00:56:02,980
What is Clark Bishop's favorite Eagles song?

1132
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:03,980
It's gotta be Desperado.

1133
00:56:03,980 --> 00:56:04,980
Desperado.

1134
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:11,800
Why don't you come to your sand sales?

1135
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:21,020
You've been out riding fan sales for so long now upon a band.

1136
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:23,900
Thomas, what do you think Clark Bishop's favorite Eagle song is?

1137
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:24,900
Desperado.

1138
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:28,060
How did you know?

1139
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:29,540
It's just a hunch.

1140
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:35,940
I think Keith Vigna's favorite Eagles song is Life's Been Good by Joe Walsh.

1141
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:36,940
Canonical.

1142
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:41,500
Joe Walsh was in the Eagles, so it's technically an Eagles song.

1143
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:46,120
I also played it when we were on cocaine earlier in the season.

1144
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:50,900
This is a little bit on the spot, but what is your character's favorite song?

1145
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:52,500
So I was actually going to bring this up earlier.

1146
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:58,060
Somebody asked about how we craft our characters and for me, a lot of times it's trying to

1147
00:56:58,060 --> 00:57:02,660
think about what music they would listen to and I did not do that for Clark, so I can't

1148
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:03,660
do it this easy.

1149
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:06,140
I never knew you'd do that for any character.

1150
00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:07,140
I love that.

1151
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:08,260
It's a really cool approach.

1152
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:09,900
What do you think it would be though?

1153
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:10,900
I don't know.

1154
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:11,900
I'd have to think about it.

1155
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:17,260
My old character Dash was this ex-military guy and I dove deep into like Three Doors

1156
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:25,060
Down and all those bands you hear in military commercials to get into that character.

1157
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:26,060
Wait.

1158
00:57:26,060 --> 00:57:34,280
I'm trying to think of what Clark Bishop's favorite song is.

1159
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:37,820
It would be something that would show up on an easy listening radio station.

1160
00:57:37,820 --> 00:57:40,100
It would not be terribly good.

1161
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:44,260
Just like easy listening, serious radio.

1162
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:46,780
The truth is that I bet Clark doesn't care about music much.

1163
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:49,700
I bet that's not part of his life and his recreation.

1164
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:54,500
He's the kind of guy who says, oh, I don't really care for music.

1165
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:55,940
It's like, what?

1166
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:56,940
What do you mean?

1167
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:58,540
I hear it when I hear it.

1168
00:57:58,540 --> 00:58:01,260
He's more of a podcast guy.

1169
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:07,220
So I really like that you think of what your character would listen to before you create

1170
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:12,380
it and John Lee Pettymore was not created like that at all, but he is named after the

1171
00:58:12,380 --> 00:58:15,660
Steve Earle song Copperhead Road.

1172
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:19,740
The very first line in that song is my name's John Lee Pettymore.

1173
00:58:19,740 --> 00:58:23,700
Same as my daddy and my daddy before.

1174
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:29,140
I missed, I constantly over the recording of this got mistaken whether or not it should

1175
00:58:29,140 --> 00:58:34,060
be John Lee Pettymore the third or the fourth, but canonically with the song, it should be

1176
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:35,060
the fourth.

1177
00:58:35,060 --> 00:58:36,060
All right.

1178
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:37,060
Well, from here on out.

1179
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:40,980
That's John Lee Pettymore's musical background and that is also a song John Lee Pettymore

1180
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:41,980
would love.

1181
00:58:41,980 --> 00:58:42,980
So.

1182
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:43,980
Yeah.

1183
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:44,980
Right.

1184
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:45,980
So you're the fourth now, right?

1185
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:46,980
You're like, you've always been the fourth.

1186
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:51,260
I'm pretty sure it started out as the fourth and I switched to the third fucking shit

1187
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:52,260
up.

1188
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:53,820
I can't believe you did that.

1189
00:58:53,820 --> 00:58:54,820
Me either.

1190
00:58:54,820 --> 00:58:59,740
Well, thankfully it's not a huge deal.

1191
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:06,260
Keith's would be, uh, his favorite genre of music is what can he sing at karaoke?

1192
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:10,780
Uh, so he likes cheeseburger in paradise.

1193
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:12,820
He loves the Doobie brothers.

1194
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:18,140
Pretty much any, any, uh, like yacht rock he's really into, but yeah, I would say cheeseburger

1195
00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:19,940
in paradise, probably Keith's.

1196
00:59:19,940 --> 00:59:27,460
And then I want to ask, what would Wolf the dog's favorite song be?

1197
00:59:27,460 --> 00:59:28,660
It's obvious.

1198
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:31,500
I think I know what it is.

1199
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:32,500
It's kudzu.

1200
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:33,500
It's kudzu.

1201
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:34,500
Are you sure?

1202
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:38,380
I don't think he likes it very much.

1203
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:40,980
That's his purgatory.

1204
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:48,060
I imagine Wolf the dog sits in a corner and just listens to a low hum and he just turns

1205
00:59:48,060 --> 00:59:54,700
on whenever like the radio signals are active.

1206
00:59:54,700 --> 00:59:57,180
Also shout out to kudzu.

1207
00:59:57,180 --> 01:00:03,100
If you haven't gone and listened to them on bandcamp or on Spotify now to Spotify and

1208
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:09,820
bandcamp, they have more songs than no backbone and they have better songs and no backbone

1209
01:00:09,820 --> 01:00:10,820
on us.

1210
01:00:10,820 --> 01:00:14,740
Oh, almost all those songs are better than the backbone, but ours is just, we picked

1211
01:00:14,740 --> 01:00:15,740
the worst.

1212
01:00:15,740 --> 01:00:16,740
Yeah.

1213
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:17,740
Ours is just good for a podcast.

1214
01:00:17,740 --> 01:00:19,900
And I don't care that you think it's the worst.

1215
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:22,060
I'm going to use it as the theme song.

1216
01:00:22,060 --> 01:00:25,020
And they said, no, please take one of our other songs.

1217
01:00:25,020 --> 01:00:27,180
All this stuff is way more jazzy, funky.

1218
01:00:27,180 --> 01:00:28,180
It's a little...

1219
01:00:28,180 --> 01:00:31,460
They're a pop punk band.

1220
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:33,620
Little jazz trio named kudzu.

1221
01:00:33,620 --> 01:00:36,860
No, but go check them out.

1222
01:00:36,860 --> 01:00:37,860
They're great.

1223
01:00:37,860 --> 01:00:38,860
They are amazing.

1224
01:00:38,860 --> 01:00:42,620
One of the best bands out of a really great town for local music.

1225
01:00:42,620 --> 01:00:43,620
Absolutely.

1226
01:00:43,620 --> 01:00:46,920
We do have a lot of great, great bands out here.

1227
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:50,960
We will mention them later on in the podcast.

1228
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:57,120
So guys, thank you for listening to this Q&A episode.

1229
01:00:57,120 --> 01:01:01,320
Basically this is our announcement for the Patreon that we're going to do to keep the

1230
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:02,700
show alive.

1231
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:04,720
We really want to keep the show alive.

1232
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:05,720
Yeah.

1233
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:07,580
We're really happy doing it.

1234
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:12,620
We really enjoy doing it and you know, if we don't make it, that's fine.

1235
01:01:12,620 --> 01:01:16,900
We'll just keep recording and I'll send all the edits to the boys and we'll have a really

1236
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:19,700
fun home game.

1237
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:22,900
With lots of cool...

1238
01:01:22,900 --> 01:01:40,140
So with all that being said, we did say this was a recap episode and we did do some recapping

1239
01:01:40,140 --> 01:01:42,380
within answering some of the questions.

1240
01:01:42,380 --> 01:01:50,940
We did some spoilies and whatnot, but I am here today to finish this episode with a full

1241
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:57,620
recap of everything, maybe not quite everything, but everything that's happened in the show

1242
01:01:57,620 --> 01:02:00,960
so far.

1243
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:03,100
Keith Vigno wears large pants.

1244
01:02:03,100 --> 01:02:04,820
He wears suspenders as well as a belt.

1245
01:02:04,820 --> 01:02:08,220
Drew has lots of gum showing like his top lip is receding.

1246
01:02:08,220 --> 01:02:10,500
Dogs are howling in the old neighborhood.

1247
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:12,100
It's the chief's birthday.

1248
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:14,340
Drew brought her a yellow journal.

1249
01:02:14,340 --> 01:02:16,420
Now you have all three colors.

1250
01:02:16,420 --> 01:02:18,020
Clark got her a box of chocolates.

1251
01:02:18,020 --> 01:02:21,180
John gives her two thirds full bottle of cheap bourbon.

1252
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:23,420
Keith Vigna didn't get the chief a birthday present.

1253
01:02:23,420 --> 01:02:27,060
She did, however, receive a box with a single rose, a white hard hat and a black silk bow

1254
01:02:27,060 --> 01:02:28,580
tie before leaving town.

1255
01:02:28,580 --> 01:02:29,660
I'm so sorry.

1256
01:02:29,660 --> 01:02:31,140
Is it going to be this detailed?

1257
01:02:31,140 --> 01:02:32,420
No, it's absolutely not.

1258
01:02:32,420 --> 01:02:35,720
Julie Maxwell called in to report a dead body at the piston junkyard and then crashed your

1259
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:38,580
car driving drunk and was pronounced dead at the city hospital.

1260
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:43,580
The body found at the piston junkyard had a brand on the back reading, this is a fool.

1261
01:02:43,580 --> 01:02:47,840
Councilwoman Carrie Page's dog is missing and she is pissed.

1262
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:50,460
Jimmy Sanders saw an oil spill while tripping on mushrooms.

1263
01:02:50,460 --> 01:02:54,700
Mildred Mitchell, that old kooky pot head, saw a bright flash of light from across the

1264
01:02:54,700 --> 01:02:56,540
street in John Peter's house.

1265
01:02:56,540 --> 01:02:58,540
John Peters is missing.

1266
01:02:58,540 --> 01:02:59,540
Herdy at a long...

1267
01:02:59,540 --> 01:03:00,540
The farmer?

1268
01:03:00,540 --> 01:03:01,540
God damn it.

1269
01:03:01,540 --> 01:03:02,540
Herdy at a long...

1270
01:03:02,540 --> 01:03:03,540
That's the one thing we didn't address.

1271
01:03:03,540 --> 01:03:04,540
That's such a bummer.

1272
01:03:04,540 --> 01:03:05,540
We didn't mean to do that.

1273
01:03:05,540 --> 01:03:06,540
I completely forgot.

1274
01:03:06,540 --> 01:03:09,700
I haven't listened to Night F Fiddle in so long, but that's my bad.

1275
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:12,500
It's just conscious, subconscious, weird thing.

1276
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:13,500
My bad.

1277
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:14,500
Sorry, I made it confusing.

1278
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:15,500
Just a plain ass name.

1279
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:16,500
John Peters is missing.

1280
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:18,260
Herdy at a long stay in the hospital a couple years ago.

1281
01:03:18,260 --> 01:03:24,400
Two people came to John Peters' house, packed a trunk into their white Toyota and took off.

1282
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:26,540
The officers went to Chief Maggie Cook's house.

1283
01:03:26,540 --> 01:03:27,540
She wasn't there.

1284
01:03:27,540 --> 01:03:30,780
They went to Klinker's, the bar run by Harry Klinker with a daycare in the back.

1285
01:03:30,780 --> 01:03:33,940
When Keith was a child, he liked to cut up hot dogs on white bread.

1286
01:03:33,940 --> 01:03:38,180
Julie Maxwell had a restraining order put out against Leo Piston back 15 years ago for

1287
01:03:38,180 --> 01:03:39,900
killing her sister Ashley.

1288
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:44,040
John found the chief's blue notebook, but her red and yellow notebooks were missing.

1289
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:47,700
Some idiot at the city hospital fucked up and put Julie Maxwell in the morgue.

1290
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:50,060
She came to and started screaming.

1291
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:54,120
County said that the body from the junkyard had the organs of someone who died 200 years

1292
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:56,700
ago but the skin and hair of someone who died yesterday.

1293
01:03:56,700 --> 01:04:00,900
Charles, a drunk man and friend of the missing John Peters, went to the police station to

1294
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:04,640
get answers before pulling a gun and running away upon hearing the sound of a car crash

1295
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:06,060
in the parking lot.

1296
01:04:06,060 --> 01:04:08,620
Kathy Piston shot Keith Vigna in the foot.

1297
01:04:08,620 --> 01:04:12,580
He snooped around her property until trying to stow away on her school bus full of homeless

1298
01:04:12,580 --> 01:04:13,580
people.

1299
01:04:13,580 --> 01:04:16,300
He heard himself falling from the emergency hatch in the back.

1300
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:21,060
John Lee Pettymore seems to believe some hooded robot man gave him a message.

1301
01:04:21,060 --> 01:04:26,340
The crash in the police station parking lot was a stolen black SUV t-boning George Piston's

1302
01:04:26,340 --> 01:04:30,020
truck while it sat parked in the police station lot.

1303
01:04:30,140 --> 01:04:34,980
Julie Maxwell, back from the dead, kidnapped Leo Piston and took him to Splashylvania.

1304
01:04:34,980 --> 01:04:38,460
She shot Leo Piston at the top of the two-fanged plunge.

1305
01:04:38,460 --> 01:04:41,440
Officer Clark Bishop then shot and killed Julie Maxwell.

1306
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:45,300
The two bodies were slammed into the ground by an unseen force before disappearing.

1307
01:04:45,300 --> 01:04:48,460
Officer John Lee Pettymore took a weird picture of the missing John Peters.

1308
01:04:48,460 --> 01:04:52,420
Drew Andrews, upstanding citizen and police station secretary, translated the binary that

1309
01:04:52,420 --> 01:04:55,100
the hooded robot man gave John.

1310
01:04:55,100 --> 01:04:58,020
It said, I killed the chief's pops, John.

1311
01:04:58,020 --> 01:04:59,180
Keith is in a wheelchair.

1312
01:04:59,180 --> 01:05:02,880
The officers broke into John Peters' storage units and found lots of things.

1313
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:07,480
One thing they found was so smelly they decided not to open it until back at the station because

1314
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:10,100
they wanted the station to smell bad.

1315
01:05:10,100 --> 01:05:12,900
They took everything back to the station in a U-Haul.

1316
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:17,620
In the nasty plastic trunk, a woman's head, split in half with a small sphere in the middle,

1317
01:05:17,620 --> 01:05:20,680
sat upon what was likely her own chopped up body.

1318
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:21,940
John pocketed it.

1319
01:05:21,940 --> 01:05:25,620
The officers went to the woods, found a patch of land that had been burned to the ground,

1320
01:05:25,620 --> 01:05:29,700
realized they were being watched, freaked out, wrecked the four-wheeler, ran into trees,

1321
01:05:29,700 --> 01:05:36,460
and overall just super fucked up, including Clark flying a drone into himself.

1322
01:05:36,460 --> 01:05:40,860
Then they went to Julie Maxwell's, wore her taxidermy, found a circled yellow pages

1323
01:05:40,860 --> 01:05:45,300
ad for Dr. Marie Jacobs and a receipt from Forgotten Treasures, a local flea market.

1324
01:05:45,300 --> 01:05:49,400
They went to Forgotten Treasures and found the camera Julie Maxwell purchased was from

1325
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:51,160
Mildred Mitchell's booth.

1326
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:52,560
They went to Mildred's house.

1327
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:55,620
She didn't know about the items recently sold at her booth.

1328
01:05:55,620 --> 01:05:59,080
She assumes her granddaughter, Tildy B. Mitchell, was selling things at her booth.

1329
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:03,480
Tildy B. Mitchell came downstairs, freaked out when she saw cops, and ran into her room.

1330
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:07,920
But when Clark busted in, Tildy B. pointed the strange gun at him and then disappeared

1331
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:09,400
in a massive flash of light.

1332
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:15,520
Is it realistic that Tildy B. was selling the things at a flea market and not on Etsy?

1333
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:18,960
They went to Forgotten Treasures and bullied the nice lady there until she put her own

1334
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:22,220
life in danger by telling the cops about the drunk man who threatened her.

1335
01:06:22,220 --> 01:06:26,440
Upon leaving, the white Toyota they had been searching for peeled out onto the road after

1336
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:27,920
a short, dangerous pursuit.

1337
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:32,220
Keith Vigna gunned down Charles Donovan, John Lee Pettymore fired warning shots into the

1338
01:06:32,220 --> 01:06:37,120
air as well as Clark's tires, and they found a bald man tied up in the trunk.

1339
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:40,240
Keith took the ambulance with the unconscious bald man to the clinic.

1340
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:44,120
Officers Bishop and Pettymore headed to the suburbs to chat with Dr. Marie Jacobs when

1341
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:49,520
they saw an unkempt man, who we now know as James the mill worker, frantically vacuuming

1342
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:50,640
his lawn.

1343
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:52,200
This ended in tragedy.

1344
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:55,760
But Clark, John, and James all made it out with their lives.

1345
01:06:55,760 --> 01:07:00,780
Our brave and heroic contention police officer, Keith Vigna, was made unconscious by Billy

1346
01:07:00,780 --> 01:07:05,760
Harrison, the man found tied up in the trunk of Charles Donovan, the drunk who threatened

1347
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:10,840
the woman at Forgotten Treasures, both of which told officers they were friends of John

1348
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:11,840
Peters.

1349
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:15,520
Dr. Marie Jacobs seemed to be up to no good.

1350
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:19,960
Officers Bishop and Pettymore found man-sized fecal matter in the litter box, and the doctor

1351
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:26,360
yelled, Salem, prompting something to begin running up the stairs from the basement.

1352
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:32,840
The talented and beloved contention police officer, Keith Vigna, found himself sans uniform,

1353
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:35,220
weapon, and cruiser at the clinic.

1354
01:07:35,220 --> 01:07:37,240
He had to call his partners to pick him up.

1355
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:41,400
Meanwhile, officers Bishop and Pettymore detained Dr. Marie Jacobs and her blood-covered

1356
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:46,280
husband Doug Jacobs in a cell at the contention police department.

1357
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:50,760
Officer Vigna and the two other idiots busted into the deceased Charles' room at Hotel

1358
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:53,920
Motel, guns drawn in sans warrant.

1359
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:59,200
There they found a woman dressed similarly to her favorite TV character, the Fonz.

1360
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:04,360
The woman we now know as Rosemary whipped a knife out at Officer Vigna after these so-called

1361
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:06,580
peacekeepers pulled their guns out.

1362
01:08:06,580 --> 01:08:11,700
The party had Rosemary pinned down until the brilliant Keith Vigna engaged her in hand-to-hand

1363
01:08:11,700 --> 01:08:14,820
combat resulting in a hostage situation for the copper.

1364
01:08:14,820 --> 01:08:20,100
Vigna, an officer of the law, proceeded to brag about killing her coworker, but the sweet-talkin'

1365
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:24,860
officer Bishop managed to keep her from killing him there on the spot.

1366
01:08:24,860 --> 01:08:29,580
When the old, wiry lady made a run for it over the railing and into the parking lot,

1367
01:08:29,580 --> 01:08:33,900
all three officers unloaded their weapons from the second-floor corridor, bringing her

1368
01:08:33,900 --> 01:08:36,620
down before she could get into her vehicle.

1369
01:08:36,620 --> 01:08:41,980
The officers patched her up and sent her to the hospital with Lauren, the only decent

1370
01:08:41,980 --> 01:08:43,980
officer left in contention.

1371
01:08:43,980 --> 01:08:47,940
The officers planned a sting operation to catch Billy Harrison, the stranger running

1372
01:08:47,940 --> 01:08:51,320
about contention who's wearing an official police uniform.

1373
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:54,820
The sting operation was actually a good idea, but the FBI was watching and stepped in on

1374
01:08:54,820 --> 01:08:55,820
the whole thing.

1375
01:08:55,820 --> 01:09:00,500
Agents Kennedy and McKinley were in town looking for a black Nike bag with nothing in it.

1376
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:04,660
The federal agents have agreed to meet the contention squad tomorrow morning, December

1377
01:09:04,660 --> 01:09:06,460
4th at the police department.

1378
01:09:06,460 --> 01:09:09,900
When the party met up at the station to figure out what to do with their illegal seizures,

1379
01:09:09,900 --> 01:09:14,180
Drew was uncommonly not at his desk, replaced instead by a note telling them he went to

1380
01:09:14,180 --> 01:09:15,600
the chief's house.

1381
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:19,780
Officers Bishop and Pettymore hauled off the undocumented loot to their individual residences

1382
01:09:19,780 --> 01:09:22,220
while Keith went to the chief's house to check on Drew.

1383
01:09:22,220 --> 01:09:26,100
Officers Bishop and Pettymore were soon called to the chief's house after it had exploded,

1384
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:31,100
leaving the unconscious Officer Vigna and Drew Andrews on the cold yard.

1385
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:36,100
That explosion also left behind the burned bodies of Harold Dorsey, Chief Maggie Cook,

1386
01:09:36,100 --> 01:09:40,540
and an unkempt man with a bullet hole in his head and his face in a pile of foot meat.

1387
01:09:40,540 --> 01:09:44,940
That man we now know as James the Mill Worker.

1388
01:09:44,940 --> 01:09:47,780
Officer Bishop learned that the chief's car had been in the mill on the other side of

1389
01:09:47,780 --> 01:09:50,060
the city since the night of December 1st.

1390
01:09:50,060 --> 01:09:54,260
The County Coroner reports that during the investigation of an active crime scene, Officer

1391
01:09:54,260 --> 01:09:59,100
John Lee Pettymore of contention slipped and shoved a possible murder weapon into the

1392
01:09:59,100 --> 01:10:04,020
eye socket of the deceased Chief Maggie Cook, fumbling and digging around atrociously as

1393
01:10:04,020 --> 01:10:09,140
the charred bones themselves began to crumble to no longer be a part of the situation.

1394
01:10:09,140 --> 01:10:10,140
No.

1395
01:10:10,140 --> 01:10:15,880
Officer Vigna broke into Officer Pettymore's house to find some cocaine for personal use.

1396
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:20,860
This is cocaine they stole from a storage unit after finding the key at the home of

1397
01:10:20,860 --> 01:10:23,820
a missing person, that missing person being John Peters.

1398
01:10:23,820 --> 01:10:28,080
The fire at the city hospital has now claimed the lives of more than 20 individuals.

1399
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:30,460
The names of the deceased are not yet being released.

1400
01:10:30,460 --> 01:10:34,780
More importantly, however, the officers take a while to order breakfast, finally deciding

1401
01:10:34,780 --> 01:10:39,980
on Bishop's big bean breakfast from beans on beans.

1402
01:10:39,980 --> 01:10:44,580
The officers are also dealing with a situation where an Officer Bishop seems to be in more

1403
01:10:44,580 --> 01:10:46,300
than one place at a time.

1404
01:10:46,300 --> 01:10:48,740
He has no recollection of this.

1405
01:10:48,740 --> 01:10:54,860
The FBI agents come in, use the Nike bag by dropping in a small silver sphere, making

1406
01:10:54,860 --> 01:11:00,100
sure not to touch it, and then recruit the officers into some unknown organization by

1407
01:11:00,100 --> 01:11:04,140
giving them a phone number and telling them to eliminate the threat and keep it all out

1408
01:11:04,140 --> 01:11:05,140
of the news.

1409
01:11:05,140 --> 01:11:07,540
It's all probably fine.

1410
01:11:07,540 --> 01:11:08,540
Flashback!

1411
01:11:08,540 --> 01:11:12,060
Clark found himself locked in the public library with Gerald Fingerson as the sky turned completely

1412
01:11:12,060 --> 01:11:13,060
dark.

1413
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:15,900
The doors were locked by a cloaked figure who began chasing after a tall man in a suit.

1414
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:20,420
That sadly was not the worst of it because Clark got back home only to find his reality

1415
01:11:20,420 --> 01:11:26,780
shattering, eventually remembering the confession of the woman who killed his parents.

1416
01:11:26,780 --> 01:11:31,340
Back in current times, the officers went to the Daily Fuh after Gary Daley called in to

1417
01:11:31,340 --> 01:11:33,900
report information about the Chief's disappearance.

1418
01:11:33,900 --> 01:11:37,820
They learned the Chief arrived to her home accompanied by James the mill worker and another

1419
01:11:37,820 --> 01:11:40,060
man who held them at gunpoint.

1420
01:11:40,060 --> 01:11:43,820
The gunman was an all black and had a scar over his eye.

1421
01:11:43,820 --> 01:11:48,620
Gary Daley saw this man because he was following Harold Dorsey, the writer from the city who

1422
01:11:48,620 --> 01:11:51,260
took Drew to the Chief's home.

1423
01:11:51,260 --> 01:11:56,440
The officers, always utilizing their time efficiently, spent a while asking Gary Daley

1424
01:11:56,440 --> 01:12:02,180
about the art he has hanging in his restaurant.

1425
01:12:02,180 --> 01:12:03,180
That was relevant.

1426
01:12:03,180 --> 01:12:09,260
John Lee and Don D. Pettymore gave us a glimpse into the accident that propelled John into

1427
01:12:09,260 --> 01:12:10,960
a life of civic duty.

1428
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:14,840
They were chased by a couple of giant, gaunt, suited men that seemed to vanish when the

1429
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:19,640
pair of Pettymores came across John's nemesis, Large Eddie, roughing up Don's car in the

1430
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:21,520
parking lot.

1431
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:26,720
The altercation ended with a deliriously concussed John Lee Pettymore seeing his second cousin

1432
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:32,340
father figure scorch Large Eddie's fist with only his hand.

1433
01:12:32,340 --> 01:12:35,400
Back in the current timeline, the officers went to the First Church of Contention which

1434
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:40,400
was hosting a lunch for anyone who needed it made by the pastor's wife and children

1435
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:42,480
served by the youth group.

1436
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:48,160
The officers, well, Keith, broke into Pastor Adam Kane's office, stole the motorcycle

1437
01:12:48,160 --> 01:12:52,400
helmet he bought from Mildred Mitchell's booth at Forgotten Treasures, and learned

1438
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:58,360
that he is working on legislation to allow motorcyclists to ride without helmets.

1439
01:12:58,360 --> 01:13:02,940
Turns out, maybe Keith is a monster to be around because his dad was a dick who clearly

1440
01:13:02,940 --> 01:13:05,040
preferred Keith's older brother Ferguson.

1441
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:07,040
Or he's played by Luke.

1442
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:09,120
That's not an excuse.

1443
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:11,700
Pastor Vigna is the worst person in contention.

1444
01:13:11,700 --> 01:13:16,440
While playing on their family sprawling estate, Keith and Ferguson heard the sirens blaring

1445
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:21,040
as strange, gaunt men in suits appeared to fall from the sky and were shot down by the

1446
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:23,680
Bean's personal security.

1447
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:27,880
Later that night, William Beans gave Ferguson a watch and told him about a prophecy that

1448
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:29,900
says he will save the world.

1449
01:13:29,900 --> 01:13:33,420
Back in whatever year it is now, the officers took the pastor's helmet to the police station

1450
01:13:33,420 --> 01:13:37,620
and locked it up with the other items from the booth at Forgotten Treasures.

1451
01:13:37,620 --> 01:13:41,620
The light on the camera was green, so John took a picture of Keith outside the station.

1452
01:13:41,620 --> 01:13:51,260
Unsurprisingly, the Keith was not of Keith, the picture was not of Keith, but of two men

1453
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:57,780
in a strange room that lacked color.

1454
01:13:57,780 --> 01:14:01,140
On the way to the mill on the other side of the city, John saw something strange in the

1455
01:14:01,140 --> 01:14:07,460
sky causing a fiery three car wreck on the main longitudinal drag of contention.

1456
01:14:07,460 --> 01:14:12,280
A minivan was run off the road by Officer Pettymore, a former teen sprint car racer

1457
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:17,360
who was banned from the circuit after an accident that left multiple bystanders hospitalized.

1458
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:23,220
The minivan flipped and caught fire.

1459
01:14:23,220 --> 01:14:26,320
Officer Bishop pulled a young boy from the fiery wreckage.

1460
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:28,820
The boy is at the clinic in critical condition.

1461
01:14:28,820 --> 01:14:33,860
The minivan then combusted, killing the driver and other passenger who were both trapped

1462
01:14:33,860 --> 01:14:35,180
in the vehicle.

1463
01:14:35,180 --> 01:14:40,020
Officer Vigna made it out with a concussion, a broken nose, and the memories of a particularly

1464
01:14:40,020 --> 01:14:43,900
traumatic childhood Christmas.

1465
01:14:43,900 --> 01:14:48,060
A vocal group of the contention population are protesting and letting these officers

1466
01:14:48,060 --> 01:14:49,540
know how they feel.

1467
01:14:49,540 --> 01:14:53,620
Drew apologized to the officers for not passing along critical information like calls about

1468
01:14:53,620 --> 01:14:58,260
missing persons, animals in the ponds and creeks, and a voicemail from the feds.

1469
01:14:58,260 --> 01:15:02,020
Doug, Dr. Marie Jacobs' husband who is currently inhabiting the body of their cat Salem, showed

1470
01:15:02,020 --> 01:15:08,340
the officers the animals are hiding in the water because the oily substance cannot get

1471
01:15:08,340 --> 01:15:10,420
them in the ponds and creeks.

1472
01:15:10,420 --> 01:15:15,660
Randy Angst, dentist, estate salesman, and historical society member, also lover, revealed

1473
01:15:15,660 --> 01:15:19,540
some interesting information to the officers about the picture from the odd camera John

1474
01:15:19,540 --> 01:15:24,700
found in Julie Maxwell's car as well as about Cole's orphanage.

1475
01:15:24,700 --> 01:15:28,380
In James the Millworker's house, they found a cache of guns hidden under the coffee table,

1476
01:15:28,380 --> 01:15:32,140
a bunch of cleaning supplies and random materials, and a small enclave behind an oil painting

1477
01:15:32,140 --> 01:15:36,620
of a rose, a few loose tiles in the kitchen where something buried has been dragged out,

1478
01:15:36,620 --> 01:15:42,300
and a 12-foot deep pit under a trap door with two corpses and an officer Clark Bishop at

1479
01:15:42,300 --> 01:15:43,300
the bottom.

1480
01:15:43,300 --> 01:15:44,540
I always am.

1481
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:49,760
A heavy artillery weapon is being fired into the house from the front yard.

1482
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:53,460
Then we had combat from the time the robot man blasted the door from its frame to when

1483
01:15:53,460 --> 01:15:57,620
the robot man almost cut Officer Bishop's arm off to when the robot man froze at the

1484
01:15:57,620 --> 01:16:01,540
command of Officer Pettymore to when the robot man's torso flew out the window, gripping

1485
01:16:01,540 --> 01:16:03,940
the throat of Officer Vigna.

1486
01:16:03,940 --> 01:16:05,540
Skyrockets in flight, baby.

1487
01:16:05,540 --> 01:16:07,260
Show me armogato.

1488
01:16:07,260 --> 01:16:10,980
Thank beans he poked that Terminator top in the eye just in time to escape before the

1489
01:16:10,980 --> 01:16:15,940
metal fella exploded like fireworks earlier in the evening.

1490
01:16:15,940 --> 01:16:20,020
The officers then cleaned themselves up after fighting a large robot man with feelings,

1491
01:16:20,020 --> 01:16:21,020
perhaps?

1492
01:16:21,020 --> 01:16:27,220
Keith Vigna found a single piece of music called The Rise of the End in the bench of

1493
01:16:27,220 --> 01:16:28,780
the stringless piano.

1494
01:16:28,780 --> 01:16:33,260
Clark Bishop found in the flipped-over coffee table blueprints for Calm Comfy Campground,

1495
01:16:33,260 --> 01:16:37,900
a suspiciously planned-out set of seven buildings, six encircling a large one in the center that

1496
01:16:37,900 --> 01:16:39,980
sits on Lake Calm.

1497
01:16:39,980 --> 01:16:45,120
A similar design was found drawn on a piece of paper in the pocket of one of the two corpses

1498
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:49,060
they found in the pit under the trap door that Bishop fell into.

1499
01:16:49,100 --> 01:16:52,660
Sitting in James the Millworker's house, the officers remember that he died in Chief

1500
01:16:52,660 --> 01:16:57,160
Maggie Cook's house with a bullet in his head, face down, and a plate of foot meat.

1501
01:16:57,160 --> 01:17:01,000
They also remember the contents of the present that she received from an unknown source the

1502
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:04,980
night she took off, the red rose, the white hard hat, and the black silk bowtie, all of

1503
01:17:04,980 --> 01:17:10,540
which were present in this home in a painting on a suit of armor and worn by a statue, respectively.

1504
01:17:10,540 --> 01:17:17,220
After undressing the bottom half of the still-standing robot man, the gang finds a logo on the smooth

1505
01:17:17,220 --> 01:17:18,500
pelvic area.

1506
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:21,780
It is an M made out of four double helices.

1507
01:17:21,780 --> 01:17:26,740
They voted and decided to store the legs in Keith's cruiser trunk.

1508
01:17:26,740 --> 01:17:28,780
Keith's cruiser's trunk.

1509
01:17:28,780 --> 01:17:32,740
After officers Bishop and Vigna had the most uncomfortable dinner since the last supper,

1510
01:17:32,740 --> 01:17:35,140
some really plot-heavy shit went down.

1511
01:17:35,140 --> 01:17:37,580
Keith Vigna was approached by his niece, Frances Beanes.

1512
01:17:37,580 --> 01:17:41,380
Upon accepting her proposal, the two are driving east, away from contention.

1513
01:17:41,380 --> 01:17:46,340
John Lee Pettymore and Drew Andrews bonded over a shared fortune after a smooth transaction,

1514
01:17:46,340 --> 01:17:51,020
and Clark Bishop saw an impossibility out of his own window and then woke up in an unfamiliar

1515
01:17:51,020 --> 01:17:53,700
place with an unfamiliar face.

1516
01:17:53,700 --> 01:17:58,820
Officer Keith Vigna convinced a woman to murder Ferguson, his handsome and well-dressed brother.

1517
01:17:58,820 --> 01:18:02,440
He then murdered that woman and stole the watch that was passed down from William Beanes

1518
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:06,940
off of Fergie's corpse, then he laid in his bed at Hotel Motel.

1519
01:18:06,940 --> 01:18:10,780
Officer John Lee Pettymore and Drew Andrews were being held hostage by Rosemary, who works

1520
01:18:10,780 --> 01:18:14,460
for Marvin Glass, after she killed two of the Pettymore cousins.

1521
01:18:14,540 --> 01:18:16,860
Clark Bishop was inducted into the Circle of Knowledge.

1522
01:18:16,860 --> 01:18:19,900
There, he ran into a mysterious woman from his past.

1523
01:18:19,900 --> 01:18:25,700
Clark then headed back to contention in a cab from the mill on the other side of the city.

1524
01:18:25,700 --> 01:18:29,580
The officers met back at the contention police station early in the morning of December 5th,

1525
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:35,020
along with Drew and their new partner in crime, Rosemary, an actual member of the Glass crime family.

1526
01:18:35,020 --> 01:18:40,260
In the station, an FBI agent named Trent Chad was sorting through contention's paperwork.

1527
01:18:40,260 --> 01:18:45,100
Clark shot him with a dart, and agent Trent Chad became very impressionable.

1528
01:18:45,100 --> 01:18:49,380
With agent Trent Chad's newfound pliability, the officers worked out ways in order to convince

1529
01:18:49,380 --> 01:18:53,700
the public as well as the feds that the local authorities have everything under control

1530
01:18:53,700 --> 01:18:54,700
in contention.

1531
01:18:54,700 --> 01:18:58,900
The officers found their cells holding Dr. Marie Jacobs and her cat man to be empty.

1532
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:02,900
Upon checking the security footage, they confirmed the black ooze slammed the two jailbirds into

1533
01:19:02,900 --> 01:19:05,820
the ground of their cells before disappearing entirely.

1534
01:19:05,820 --> 01:19:09,200
Keith blurted out that the camera will be ready to use at 1 p.m.

1535
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:13,360
They checked the evidence room and saw a single green light beaming from the old glass tube

1536
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:15,660
covered radio.

1537
01:19:15,660 --> 01:19:19,600
The officers grab the strange gun and camera and head off to the city with Doug, who is

1538
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:21,880
in the body of agent Trent Chad.

1539
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:23,880
Rosemary is driving separately.

1540
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:27,100
There is a severe lack of traffic and human life in contention.

1541
01:19:27,100 --> 01:19:31,860
The town is loud, though, with plenty of animals filling up the ponds and creeks.

1542
01:19:31,860 --> 01:19:35,880
The officers stock up on weapons and throw on body armor at Clark Bishop's house.

1543
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:39,220
Keith brings his very small, very powerful gun.

1544
01:19:39,220 --> 01:19:42,480
On the way, they call Harry Klinker and basically tell him everything that's been happening.

1545
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:44,320
Harry says Gary didn't come home last night.

1546
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:47,120
Pettymore asks if he's been acting weirder than normal.

1547
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:51,020
Harry says not really, but that he's been meeting with his group more often than usual.

1548
01:19:51,020 --> 01:19:54,920
Harry clarifies that it's a group of spiritualists and metaphysics thinkers, including Gary,

1549
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:58,040
Dr. Marie Jacobs, and Mildred Mitchell.

1550
01:19:58,040 --> 01:20:03,600
They call Gary daily, and Gary says he's hanging out with Mildred Mitchell.

1551
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:10,880
It would have been way better if they were Harry and Gary Derry.

1552
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:14,660
They call Gary daily, and Gary says he's hanging out with Mildred Mitchell at her house, says

1553
01:20:14,660 --> 01:20:16,920
that she's having a bit of a breakdown.

1554
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:19,920
Gary describes the group as a...

1555
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:22,800
Sorry.

1556
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:26,720
Vape break, bro.

1557
01:20:26,720 --> 01:20:30,280
They call Gary daily, and Gary says he's hanging out with Mildred Mitchell at her house, says

1558
01:20:30,280 --> 01:20:32,040
that she's having a bit of a breakdown.

1559
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:34,640
Gary describes the group as a sorcerer's guild.

1560
01:20:34,640 --> 01:20:36,880
Gary says it's been years since they'd sorcered anything.

1561
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:37,880
Harry Potter fanfic.

1562
01:20:37,880 --> 01:20:38,880
Jesus.

1563
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:39,880
Dude, keep coughing, you'll get higher, bro.

1564
01:20:39,880 --> 01:20:40,880
You don't cough those crystals up.

1565
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:41,880
I'm sorry.

1566
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:50,000
You don't have your pen in here, do you?

1567
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:53,620
He also mentions Carrie Pages, who got the protesters all riled up.

1568
01:20:53,620 --> 01:20:56,440
She might have had something going on, and she had a lot of power.

1569
01:20:56,440 --> 01:21:00,360
Clarke worries that this is all his fault, since he couldn't find her dog.

1570
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:03,800
Gary mentions that Mildred keeps staring at a picture that she thinks somehow changed.

1571
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:07,800
It's a picture of the founders of the town, and she is dead certain that Silas Cole looks

1572
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:09,440
different than he did before.

1573
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:11,560
Gary thinks he looks the exact same.

1574
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:16,260
Mildred keeps saying he's not as attractive as he used to be, and now he's dumber looking?

1575
01:21:16,260 --> 01:21:20,720
She also says that in a reflection and a piece of glass in the picture is Tildy B. Mitchell.

1576
01:21:20,720 --> 01:21:24,680
Pettymore asks if Gary would describe his grandfather as a wizard.

1577
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:26,560
Gary says definitely.

1578
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:30,720
Gary explains further that Gary was always afraid to let them know, as he thought it

1579
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:32,240
might have some sort of reaction.

1580
01:21:32,240 --> 01:21:35,540
Gary's grandfather gave him a book, and it had three pages left in it, and he was to

1581
01:21:35,540 --> 01:21:47,840
read those pages after tearing them out of the book and then spill blood upon your heads.

1582
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:51,280
When Gary did that, the words danced like magic on the page and came off like sparks.

1583
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:53,360
It was the most beautiful thing he'd ever seen.

1584
01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:57,000
It surrounded you guys in this light, and he did it because the three of them are the

1585
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:58,600
key to everything.

1586
01:21:58,600 --> 01:22:01,680
Gary only knows that he'd done his part, and the rest was up to them.

1587
01:22:01,680 --> 01:22:05,380
Gary's grandfather didn't tell him exactly what happened, but that, quote, fortune would

1588
01:22:05,380 --> 01:22:07,040
be on your side.

1589
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:11,800
As the phone call comes to a close, Gary mentions that Mildred hates you guys, and you should

1590
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:13,600
probably avoid her.

1591
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:18,520
They get to the city, and Rosemary leads them into a parking garage below a massive skyscraper.

1592
01:22:18,520 --> 01:22:22,460
There's an elevator door, and John Lee Pettymore, Keith Vigna, and Clark Bishop get into the

1593
01:22:22,460 --> 01:22:23,460
elevator.

1594
01:22:23,460 --> 01:22:28,580
The wall on the other side of the black onyx walled elevator opens into a dark room.

1595
01:22:28,580 --> 01:22:31,580
The boys walk in, and the door behind them shuts.

1596
01:22:31,580 --> 01:22:32,900
Nice.

1597
01:22:32,900 --> 01:22:36,100
Hell yeah.

1598
01:22:36,100 --> 01:22:41,300
There, they meet Marvin Glass.

1599
01:22:41,300 --> 01:22:43,900
How many of you can make yourself burp?

1600
01:22:43,900 --> 01:22:44,900
Nobody.

1601
01:22:44,900 --> 01:22:45,900
Everyone's shaking their head now.

1602
01:22:45,900 --> 01:22:47,900
Oh my god, that's disgusting.

1603
01:22:47,900 --> 01:22:48,900
Stop.

1604
01:22:48,900 --> 01:22:49,900
There.

1605
01:22:49,900 --> 01:22:50,900
Stop it.

1606
01:22:51,460 --> 01:22:53,460
Stop it.

1607
01:22:53,460 --> 01:22:57,140
I don't like that.

1608
01:22:57,140 --> 01:22:58,140
You love it.

1609
01:22:58,140 --> 01:22:59,140
This is good content.

1610
01:22:59,140 --> 01:23:01,220
If you guys don't subscribe to the Patreon, then-

1611
01:23:01,220 --> 01:23:03,940
That will continue.

1612
01:23:03,940 --> 01:23:06,840
There they meet Marvin Glass, someone with a massive frame.

1613
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:11,700
It is completely gaunt, no muscle or fat, skin stretched across long bones.

1614
01:23:11,700 --> 01:23:16,420
They're in a fitted black tuxedo, and the spotlight shows off a bright red bowtie and

1615
01:23:16,420 --> 01:23:20,140
only reaches to illuminate the lower half of that person's face.

1616
01:23:20,140 --> 01:23:22,620
The skin on the chin is almost translucent with no hair.

1617
01:23:22,620 --> 01:23:25,180
It has two thin, bright red lips.

1618
01:23:25,180 --> 01:23:31,140
Not even quite lips at all, just red lipstick encircling a round hole above the sharp chin.

1619
01:23:31,140 --> 01:23:32,140
And he says-

1620
01:23:32,140 --> 01:23:40,180
I'm so sorry, but real quick, in an episode of 30 Rock, Jonathan says to Liz, your mouth

1621
01:23:40,180 --> 01:23:43,660
looks like somebody kicked a hole in a bag of flour.

1622
01:23:43,660 --> 01:23:46,500
God, that's incredible.

1623
01:23:46,500 --> 01:23:47,940
All right.

1624
01:23:47,940 --> 01:23:48,940
Anyway.

1625
01:23:48,940 --> 01:23:56,460
Basically accuses John Lee Pettymore of buying lost cocaine off of Ferguson beans.

1626
01:23:56,460 --> 01:23:57,460
Never.

1627
01:23:57,460 --> 01:23:58,460
Yeah.

1628
01:23:58,460 --> 01:24:05,340
And there is some confusion over Rosemary's obsession with getting the gun.

1629
01:24:05,340 --> 01:24:09,740
Marvin Glass also says that it's good to see Keith, you know, everyone's favorite fuck

1630
01:24:09,740 --> 01:24:12,460
up that he hired to murder his own brother.

1631
01:24:12,460 --> 01:24:14,500
And Keith denies, but-

1632
01:24:14,500 --> 01:24:16,620
I deny both of those things.

1633
01:24:16,620 --> 01:24:17,620
Yeah.

1634
01:24:17,620 --> 01:24:20,420
He casts and fills the room and all the officers fall unconscious.

1635
01:24:20,420 --> 01:24:26,700
I trust my fellow officers, this is stupid, as I hope they trust me.

1636
01:24:26,700 --> 01:24:30,600
You guys woke up in metal cages hanging from the ceiling and outlined the smokey, dimly

1637
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:31,600
lit room.

1638
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:36,820
There are three other cages next to yours, each inhabited by a person stripped down to

1639
01:24:36,820 --> 01:24:37,820
their underwear.

1640
01:24:37,820 --> 01:24:38,820
Okay.

1641
01:24:38,820 --> 01:24:40,420
I wrote way too much for this.

1642
01:24:40,420 --> 01:24:41,420
Yeah.

1643
01:24:41,420 --> 01:24:42,420
This one can be-

1644
01:24:42,420 --> 01:24:43,420
It's going back to how the first one was.

1645
01:24:43,420 --> 01:24:44,420
Yeah, it is.

1646
01:24:44,420 --> 01:24:49,900
I've had a theory about why Rosemary was so into that gun for so long now.

1647
01:24:49,900 --> 01:24:53,620
We can talk about it off mic after this.

1648
01:24:53,620 --> 01:24:56,300
Don't talk at- don't talk off mic.

1649
01:24:56,300 --> 01:24:59,460
I'm just- I'm just talking to you.

1650
01:24:59,460 --> 01:25:04,540
Fifteen feet below is a crowd of 20 or so fancily clad individuals, each parking in-

1651
01:25:04,540 --> 01:25:05,540
This is too much.

1652
01:25:05,540 --> 01:25:06,540
It's way too much.

1653
01:25:06,540 --> 01:25:07,540
I was about to say-

1654
01:25:07,540 --> 01:25:09,020
That's how you described it to us in the episode.

1655
01:25:09,020 --> 01:25:11,180
All the other stuff was very concise.

1656
01:25:11,180 --> 01:25:13,300
This is also going to be the one that they just listened to.

1657
01:25:13,300 --> 01:25:14,300
Oh yeah.

1658
01:25:14,300 --> 01:25:16,300
And then you guys got it from there.

1659
01:25:16,300 --> 01:25:17,300
What?

1660
01:25:17,300 --> 01:25:18,300
Okay.

1661
01:25:18,300 --> 01:25:19,300
That was a-

1662
01:25:19,300 --> 01:25:20,300
Dude better than that.

1663
01:25:20,300 --> 01:25:21,300
Zach, that was good.

1664
01:25:21,300 --> 01:25:22,300
Do you want to record it?

1665
01:25:22,300 --> 01:25:23,300
Yeah.

1666
01:25:23,300 --> 01:25:24,300
I think on this-

1667
01:25:24,300 --> 01:25:29,700
I think that was a really- that was a really solid run through.

1668
01:25:29,700 --> 01:25:30,700
Yeah.

1669
01:25:30,700 --> 01:25:31,700
Let's lay one down.

1670
01:25:31,700 --> 01:25:36,260
And then the episode last week happened and you guys are caught up to what's happening

1671
01:25:36,260 --> 01:25:38,500
right now.

1672
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:44,140
So thanks for joining us for this Q&A and recap episode of Pretending to be People.

1673
01:25:44,140 --> 01:25:49,960
We'll be back next Monday with your regularly scheduled programming that Wolf the Dog just

1674
01:25:49,960 --> 01:25:53,300
loves giving to you every week.

1675
01:25:53,300 --> 01:25:58,700
And I will say we did have one other question that asked if we've played any interesting

1676
01:25:58,700 --> 01:26:02,540
systems other than Delta Green and Pulp Cthulhu.

1677
01:26:02,540 --> 01:26:05,380
And we have plenty of other questions to answer too.

1678
01:26:05,380 --> 01:26:11,540
And we're going to get to all those on our first Patreon only episode that will come

1679
01:26:11,540 --> 01:26:12,920
out next month.

1680
01:26:12,920 --> 01:26:16,140
So look forward to that.

1681
01:26:16,140 --> 01:26:20,820
If you want the bonus content, we gotta get the bonus.

1682
01:26:20,820 --> 01:26:28,820
Yeah if you want the tent, give us the poles baby.

1683
01:26:28,820 --> 01:26:29,820
Exactly.

1684
01:26:29,820 --> 01:26:30,820
Yep.

1685
01:26:30,820 --> 01:26:45,220
Wow, thank you so much to Pretending to be People for that sweet, sweet content.

1695
01:27:32,900 --> 01:27:38,260
We've been having some difficulties with the switchboard down here, so I'm going to have

1696
01:27:38,260 --> 01:27:44,460
to premiere a brand new song for y'all this week, here with a certified banger so hot

1697
