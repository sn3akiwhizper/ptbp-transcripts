1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,920
What's good, people of the internet and the radio waves

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,220
and other people that I throw my sounds at on accident

3
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:12,620
through my vibrations and gyrations.

4
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:17,280
It's your sound wave sommelier, Wolf the dog.

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:21,280
I'm thrashing about live from 694.2 PTBP,

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,960
the most beloved radio station this side of the Milky Way.

7
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,360
Give me a scoop of that space cream.

8
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:34,360
And now, speaking of you all loving me,

9
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,760
today's Howlin' with Wolf is from Mistress Yachty,

10
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,440
who tweeted about the show and tagged at Pretending Pod.

11
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,760
Did you know both thumbs are explicitly built

12
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,600
to tweet about this show and tag at Pretending Pod?

13
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,080
Mistress Yachty knows, they write.

14
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,600
Good morrow, Wolfie, how fair ye.

15
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,320
I have stumbled upon a strange box

16
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,520
in the cellar of Duke Arthur,

17
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:03,680
out of which your lovely voice comes.

18
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,600
Quite strange indeed.

19
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,680
Nonetheless, your so-called cast of broads

20
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,940
is very entertaining while I weave blankets

21
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:14,480
for the coming winter.

22
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,780
I pray you are not one of the wolves

23
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:20,320
that come to prey on us in our dark days.

24
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,680
Cordially, Mistress Yachty.

25
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,800
Well, Mistress Yachty, I cannot guarantee

26
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:31,460
that I won't join some of those feral pups out on a hunt.

27
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:36,240
It brings me back to my less omniscient days.

28
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,120
But whether or not I devour you this coming winter,

29
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm still glad you wrote in to us.

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,380
Toodles, Mistress Yachty, for now.

31
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:49,200
If you wanna write up something for your wolf to howl,

32
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,080
be like Mistress Yachty.

33
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,280
Tag at pretending pod on Twitter or Instagram,

34
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,760
tag pretending to be people on Facebook,

35
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:00,520
or write a five-star review on your podcast app of choice

36
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,200
and holler about it.

37
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,240
Wanna see what Luke looks like?

Check out the merch store.

47
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,320
And you wanna know where to find all those links?

48
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,720
Say it with me, no matter where you are.

49
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:41,600
The links are in the show notes.

50
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:45,680
And if anyone asks why you just said that out loud

51
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,680
to no one in particular, tell them it's time for the news.

52
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,920
Last time, the can crew was arrested

53
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:58,600
for the murder of the mayor of Grover's Gorge,

54
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,560
Sandro the Turtle.

55
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,840
With the trial in the gang's immediate future,

56
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,600
Vernon Covington, the landlord,

57
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,560
led the cuffed crew to the It Pit,

58
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,640
a horrible underground holding cell filled with a few inches

59
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:18,640
of bodily fluid mud and a specifically strange symbol

60
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,840
scrawled ceaselessly on its dimly lit walls.

61
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,360
As Vernon Covington pushed the party

62
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,120
through the open metal cellar doors,

63
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:32,360
Cal Colorado was able to pull the landlord along

64
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,840
down into the awful mess.

65
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,480
There, the city action news team attacked,

66
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,480
leaving their foe face down and still in the yucky yuck.

67
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,400
Of the It Pit.

68
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,240
Taking us now to that terrible scene.

69
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:54,240
It's Altagirl with My Life is Great and It's All My Fault.

70
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,800
And it's all my fault

71
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:03,800
Cause my life is great

72
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,800
And it's all mine

73
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:10,800
Cause my life is great

74
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:15,800
And it's all my fault

75
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:40,800
I love being in all the blood and cum.

76
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,360
So you guys have had a week to look over this symbol.

77
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,560
What do you make of it?

78
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,560
It looks like whoever drew it talks like this

79
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,200
and needs serious help.

80
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,120
This came out of the mind of a very disturbed child.

81
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,160
I was just going through some like old notebooks

82
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,920
from when I was a kid and came across this

83
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,480
and was like season two, baby.

84
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:23,680
That would be a great like a tagline for this podcast.

85
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,720
Made by her.

86
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,520
This came out of the mind of a very disturbed child.

87
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,480
I might've turned 30 this year, but I take it.

88
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,480
You're still a baby.

89
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:36,200
That's why I make a pretend to be people with my friends.

90
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,720
Like Thomas.

91
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,720
Thomas loves you when I talk like this.

92
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,520
Zach, I don't, but I love you.

93
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,520
Today at work I had to write an email

94
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,400
that was all about rum

95
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,600
and I just couldn't stop making cum jokes.

96
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,120
And everyone clapped.

97
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,080
It's crazy.

98
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:12,520
They all stood up and cheered for me.

99
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:16,000
They chanted, cum, cum, cum, cum.

100
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,480
I had some of the copy that I wasn't gonna put in there

101
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,520
was young, dumb and full of rum.

102
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,600
And she's like, that is so gross.

103
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,920
What about like rum in my mouth?

104
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,080
Yeah, that's actually good.

105
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,040
Rum in my mouth is also great.

106
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,760
I thought you meant like you made a movie poster

107
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,640
for the cum diary.

108
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,040
Nice.

109
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,640
Yeah, I really thought you were switching rum to cum.

110
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,160
Cum with rum, which is a little cheekier.

111
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,840
Cum tug tugger.

112
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,680
There's something there.

113
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,600
Yeah, cum.

114
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,920
It's cumbling outside, like rumbling.

115
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,960
Okay, let's play.

116
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,800
Classic.

117
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,720
That's how it's pretending to be people.

118
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,320
The vape hit in the background.

119
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,920
I was gonna point out on this symbol

120
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,120
that you mentioned that this was a hammer.

121
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:07,760
I think that could also be like a lectern

122
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,000
or like a music stadium.

123
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,840
I like that, yeah.

124
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,840
But it could be a hammer too,

125
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,640
especially with the square up there.

126
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,920
It just looked more like that than an upside down cross,

127
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,760
which is literally one of the examples.

128
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:19,120
Or if you zoom in, it's a basketball goal.

129
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,960
Yeah.

130
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,800
Because there's a little hoop.

131
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,480
I don't think there's any use in trying

132
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:27,120
to put any meaning into this fucking stupid scribblings.

133
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,200
I like to think the episode starts with the four,

134
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,720
no, you said stupid scribblings.

135
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,720
I like the episode starting with the four of you.

136
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,040
That's not the part I don't say about.

137
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,440
Just standing, like the episode starts with the four

138
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,200
of you just standing there, staring at the wall.

139
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,440
Beck, do you think it looks a little bit

140
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,480
like a basketball goal?

141
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,160
Ah, yeah, dude.

142
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,960
I like to think of it as a hammer.

143
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,680
It could be also like a music stand

144
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,560
or like, I don't know, man.

145
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,560
I think we almost killed a guy just a second ago.

146
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,000
Yeah, I enjoy looking at shapes and clouds,

147
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,840
but this is neither the time nor place.

148
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,800
Like I was seeing red for a second there, guys.

149
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,240
I'm sorry I lost my cool dudes.

150
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,480
I'm sorry I couldn't help.

151
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:14,000
I went somewhere else when I got in this pit.

152
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,720
Maybe I'm getting too old for this.

153
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,800
Where did you go?

154
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,160
In my mine palace.

155
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,480
Oh, what's that?

156
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,520
Don't you have one?

157
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,080
Mine's a tree house in the woods.

158
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,760
I have a real palace, but I mean,

159
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,920
it's just like a big house, I guess, like an estate,

160
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,960
but you have one in your mind?

161
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:33,520
Do you know how to get out of the pit?

162
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,280
She looks up and one of the doors is open

163
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:41,040
and she's like, well, they do normally keep that shut.

164
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,200
So there's potential here.

165
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,080
I sort of have an idea about that.

166
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,000
Okay.

167
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,480
We need to get them here, at least in my plan.

168
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,800
We should probably vote on it, talk it over.

169
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,240
I was thinking I got that clicker

170
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,680
that opens all the windows in that place.

171
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,480
Is there a clicker for these handcuffs?

172
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,280
Well, we should probably search this corpse, right?

173
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,320
Not corpse, but-

174
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,360
Almost lifeless body.

175
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,680
But this shell, yeah.

176
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,240
This shell of a human.

177
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,720
Yeah, and because Julius Summers

178
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,160
has his hands in front of him,

179
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:18,160
he's pretty easily able to go through and find a key

180
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,960
to unlock all of your handcuffs.

181
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,480
I use it.

182
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,680
Thank you, Julius, for setting us free.

183
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,440
Now here's my proposition.

184
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,760
Oh, that feels so much better.

185
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,840
Okay, yeah, what's up?

186
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,600
Stevie, we'll need your blessing for this,

187
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:35,600
but what if we just scream and yell for help?

188
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,240
Say he attacked us

189
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:40,800
and tried to put Faith Godel in the it pit.

190
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,800
Yeah, I mean, I don't wanna be stoned to death, so-

191
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,400
Would you not be hailed as a leader of the people?

192
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,220
I was gonna mention,

193
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,440
it seemed like you even had maybe a vendetta

194
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,360
against this guy.

195
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,560
There may be like other people who feel that way,

196
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,200
and this is gonna be like a,

197
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:01,440
hail Godel, the wicked landlord is dead situation.

198
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,160
Whoa, I didn't even think of-

199
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,120
Yes, a Godel come back to the people to save them

200
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,040
from the grip of the horrid landlord.

201
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,360
Okay, but I've been missing for a year.

202
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,040
Does that mean that they would assume

203
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,920
that I was down here the whole time?

204
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,720
We could use that?

205
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,520
I don't think so.

206
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,520
Everyone saw you.

207
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,520
Oh, right, duh.

208
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,280
Oh, shit, yeah, that's my bad.

209
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,640
That's true, Cal, yeah.

210
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,480
I think we-

211
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,440
I swear.

212
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,680
Wait, no, but they saw Stevie.

213
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,440
They didn't see Faith.

214
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,440
The problem is you look very similar.

215
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,280
Wait, hang on, like let your hair down.

216
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,400
Let's see if like you're a totally different person.

217
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,360
Yeah, take your glasses off.

218
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,920
Boing, boing, boing, boing.

219
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,320
Classic 90s rom-com.

220
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,160
Julius, put your boner away.

221
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,120
Now that his hands are free, he does.

222
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,520
Yeah, his pants got ripped open in a fight,

223
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,680
so he tucks it back in.

224
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,680
How far down did we fall into this pit?

225
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,760
That's a great, I was wondering that the whole time.

226
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,880
Is this like just deep enough

227
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,760
that we couldn't quite reach the top or?

228
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,760
No, I think it's 10 feet.

229
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,680
Oh, we could just-

230
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,520
We can just climb out.

231
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,360
Force ourselves out.

232
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,960
We need no subterfuge.

233
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:17,400
I've got the strongest base.

234
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,240
You guys could just hop off my shoulders.

235
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,080
That's true, you're like a mighty tripod.

236
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,120
Or do you wanna like continue with your plan though

237
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,880
and like it makes it look like we're like hapless

238
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,760
and don't wanna be.

239
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,320
Oh, I think it's still a good idea,

240
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,320
but it wouldn't be necessary for our escape.

241
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,680
Right, I'm saying like should we wait in this hole

242
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,280
for people to see us in this hole

243
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,800
and that we didn't like run away when they-

244
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,160
Oh yes, and then in that case,

245
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,440
we should scream and call for help

246
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,920
because I don't want to wait in this hole

247
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,120
any longer than I have to.

248
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,560
Just a counter argument, what if they don't care?

249
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:54,040
That is, I mean, yeah, that's kind of in Stevie's court.

250
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,840
Like how do you think this plan works?

251
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,800
On like a scale of one to 10?

252
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,520
Yeah, I'd call it a coin flip, honestly.

253
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,200
The alternative is they come back

254
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,520
and find us with our jailer.

255
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,720
Right, they're gonna see us like this either way.

256
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,920
I think we need a good cover story.

257
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,680
On a scale from one to 10, a coin flip is a five, just-

258
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,720
That's good to know for the future.

259
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,960
I don't like Zach's dick.

260
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:19,400
Do I have like, do I have my phone on me?

261
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,240
Yeah.

262
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,040
While we're just like talking about this,

263
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,160
Julius gets his phone out and turns the flashlight on

264
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,480
and looks at what's actually down here

265
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,120
that we couldn't see before.

266
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,440
How big a room are we in?

267
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,640
Do you want it in meters or yards?

268
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,160
How many of my arm spans would it take

269
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,480
to hit the next wall?

270
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,780
Oh, probably like 10.

271
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:43,620
Holy shit.

272
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,320
Yeah, like 20 yards by 20 yards-ish.

273
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,560
How many Volvos could you fit in this bag, boy?

274
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,400
Oh.

275
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,220
Like the station wagon.

276
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,760
Probably four.

277
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:54,020
Yeah, easily six, probably six, yeah.

278
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:57,700
Like all standing, like car edge style.

279
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,540
Car nose down.

280
00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:59,940
Like car sardines, yeah.

281
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:02,140
Yeah, you could really shove more in there, huh?

282
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:06,300
After Julius kinda like flashes his flashlight

283
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:09,980
around a little bit, he is kind of like pushing Cal

284
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:13,540
to stand in front of one of these symbols

285
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:17,100
and he like flips over to TikTok.

286
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,660
Cal, do you wanna just,

287
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,700
I could just get like a still image

288
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,220
to put in the TikTok later

289
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:29,360
or do you wanna describe anything?

290
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,980
No, and Cal like leans down to help lift Stevie Gotel's foot

291
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:34,860
up over the pit.

292
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:37,900
I get that with the symbol in the background.

293
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,740
I know we're in like viscera,

294
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:44,220
but is there any remains that are more intact around here?

295
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,900
Is there anybody else in here?

296
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,720
Is this a pit that's been holding other prisoners?

297
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,860
So there's like 40 other, no.

298
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,420
There's no one else down here.

299
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:54,440
They were all cheering wildly.

300
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:59,340
Priti Press, Priti Press, Priti Press.

301
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,420
Oh, hey guys.

302
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,800
No, there's no one else down here.

303
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,500
And really with the viscera,

304
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:11,020
it's more of a leftovers kind of situation down here.

305
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:13,220
Great show, great show.

306
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,860
Just a lot of hot shirtless dudes on the cover

307
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,700
of down here, what?

308
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,740
You never watched the leftovers, did you?

309
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,300
Oh, I'm thinking of left behind.

310
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,060
Nick Cage right there on the front.

311
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,880
Nope, I didn't.

312
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:31,620
There's like, there's no-

313
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,460
Well, you nailed it.

314
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:33,620
It's hot shirtless dudes.

315
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,180
God's jealous.

316
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,580
He left them all behind.

317
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:43,420
You guys are looking around

318
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:48,420
and there are no like intact human bodies down here,

319
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:53,460
but there are seemingly pieces of body parts down here.

320
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,300
And as you pick through, you also,

321
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,140
I mean, if you're,

322
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:00,620
are you like picking through at this point or?

323
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:04,020
No, I was kind of looking for bodies that had clothing

324
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:07,700
and doing a like red or a yellow versus green kind of thing.

325
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:08,660
Oh, okay, yeah, cool.

326
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,120
Everybody roll search.

327
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,740
40 on a 70, pass.

328
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:19,820
I pass my search with a 26 on a 40.

329
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:20,660
Cool.

330
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,780
Cal passes with a nine.

331
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,180
Three passes.

332
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,920
Three pieces of information.

333
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:27,580
One.

334
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,660
Oh, we can't just make them up.

335
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,500
Julius.

336
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,020
Yeah, you each write down three things

337
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:36,820
and we'll decide which of the six are the best.

338
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:37,660
Yeah.

339
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:38,860
Yeah, so as Julius is like,

340
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:42,020
basically just like getting a full TikTok film

341
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:45,520
of what's all in here and then he stumbles on.

342
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,000
It's like a ear.

343
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,180
It's like a weird,

344
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:54,040
it's like a, oh, it's not a human ear though.

345
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:59,040
And it seems to have fur on the outside of it.

346
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,440
That doesn't quite narrow it down.

347
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,720
Does it, it's human ear shaped?

348
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,720
No, it is shaped like a dog or a wolf's ear

349
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:13,760
and it has been severed from the head that it was on

350
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:17,200
and it's kind of sticking out from within this

351
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:21,360
just layer of disgusting gloop that's down here.

352
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,360
And Beck Wilder, as you're going through,

353
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,560
just kind of looking around with your cell phone light,

354
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,380
you see that.

355
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:29,880
Or maybe the light on his camera

356
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,160
that he's whipped out at this point.

357
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,000
They took the camera away from him?

358
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,840
They took the camera away from him.

359
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,660
Oh no.

360
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,500
Remember they put it in a bag.

361
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,340
It's the worst anyway.

362
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:39,160
Right, in my mind the bag was on his back for some reason.

363
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,440
The camera bag was in Vernon Covington's possession

364
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,200
and so it is just right above you.

365
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,040
Outside of.

366
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:47,880
Like he set it down outside the doors.

367
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,400
He set it down outside the stores that he came down.

368
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,440
Fucked with some prisoners.

369
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,600
Oh, okay.

370
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,840
So it's just right up there.

371
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,680
I'm glad that.

372
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,520
You can smell it, Beck.

373
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:58,640
Fucker is, he's not quite dead.

374
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,600
Mostly dead.

375
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,560
Yeah, we'll see.

376
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,000
Yeah, we just left him face down in this muck, right?

377
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,280
Face up, but pretty rough.

378
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,600
Face up in the muck.

379
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,120
I turn him face down.

380
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,880
He says nothing at all.

381
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,640
He's almost dead.

382
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,960
He can't even freaking talk.

383
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:17,880
One day.

384
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,880
Little red jumpsuit apparatus just for Thomas.

385
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,760
And so you see Beck Wilder,

386
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:29,560
a piece of cloth actually sticking up out of the muck here.

387
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:34,560
And as you grab it, it seems to be some sort of like,

388
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:38,400
yeah, it's a jumpsuit and it's.

389
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,240
Is it red?

390
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,080
It's red.

391
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,400
Monochromatic.

392
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,080
Oh, holy shit.

393
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:43,920
Damn.

394
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,960
Your brain just made a connection on accident.

395
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,160
I wish, but it's not.

396
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,720
It is a monochromatic jumpsuit.

397
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,560
We went over this.

398
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,480
It's a gray scale jumpsuit, but.

399
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,720
Also not quite the word, but better.

400
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,600
It's almost a gray scale jumpsuit.

401
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,200
It's a gray jumpsuit with a color like a stripe.

402
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,160
Purple.

403
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,600
Oh shit, it's purple.

404
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,920
A third color.

405
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,760
And anyone.

406
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,560
Cal vomits like in suspense.

407
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,800
Anyone who's either one of you.

408
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,760
I got it in my notes.

409
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,600
The purple Jackalope, purple ribbon Jackalope Fox

410
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,960
removed it from that Jackalope and walked away.

411
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,860
We weren't supposed to see the purple ribbon.

412
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,400
Dang straight.

413
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,040
That Jackalope was supposed to die in this pit.

414
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,160
Hey dude, you remember that second Jackalope we saw?

415
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,360
It had a purple ribbon just like this.

416
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,040
And that Fox dude like took it off.

417
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,840
He was condemned to death,

418
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,280
perhaps for killing a frog comptroller.

419
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,600
That was a joke.

420
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you got it.

421
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,240
That was good.

422
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,000
Thank you, Stevie.

423
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,600
Yeah, that was solid.

424
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,760
Stevie, what does the purple mean?

425
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,840
This is where they kept,

426
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:14,080
I guess they kept, I was expecting this place to be full.

427
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,160
This is where they kept the twenties.

428
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,560
The twenties?

429
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,760
Yeah, it's what they call them.

430
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,040
But yeah, everyone just kind of referred to them

431
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,800
as the twenties.

432
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,120
Did they have...

433
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:26,960
Meaning what?

434
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,240
Furry ears?

435
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:33,240
No, I have absolutely no idea what that's about.

436
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,880
That's really strange.

437
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:39,880
And as she says that, Cal, you find the matching ear.

438
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,600
So it's like the other ear from the one that Julius found.

439
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,400
And do any of you have like biology, any science,

440
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,560
any animal knowledge?

441
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:53,360
If not, I'll take a intelligence at like a negative 20.

442
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,320
I'll try that.

443
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,160
I'll try that too.

444
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,720
Cal holds the ear up close to his face

445
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:02,020
and peers into it for some whisper of its secrets.

446
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,000
And fails.

447
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,800
He drops the ear back into the book.

448
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,080
You said a negative 20?

449
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:08,920
Yeah.

450
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,040
That's a 49 on what would be a 50.

451
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:11,880
Nice.

452
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,160
I got a 91, so I don't win.

453
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,960
So they're holding up these things

454
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,160
and you walk up with the...

455
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,640
I hold the ribbon between them.

456
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,880
Uh-huh.

457
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,240
You like pop up your head in between them

458
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,480
and put them on either side of you.

459
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,640
And yeah, when Beck pops up his head,

460
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:31,000
it's very clear that, yeah, it seems to...

461
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,700
It's like fox ears, but they're bigger.

462
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,500
Yeah, like they are the ears of a fox,

463
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,220
but it would be a massive fox.

464
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,220
So you're just really leaning in

465
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:45,400
for the furry demographic this season.

466
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,320
Always have been.

467
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:51,020
We got fox people, folks.

468
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,100
It's dead.

469
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:52,940
Oh, duh.

470
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,540
Yeah, that's why we have its ears.

471
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:59,460
Okay, actually, because all three of you

472
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,180
succeeded on your rolls,

473
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:03,140
I'm gonna go ahead and give you one final thing.

474
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:06,180
So Cal, yeah, right?

475
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:08,420
Yeah, a little extra, yeah.

476
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,660
Because I thought of something.

477
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:17,660
Cal, with the detached fox ear in one hand,

478
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:19,860
as you pulled it out,

479
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:23,820
you see that there's actually a small piece of paper

480
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,540
sticking up out of this muck

481
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:28,040
where it had clearly been buried

482
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,540
and you might not have even found it

483
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:32,580
if you hadn't gotten the second ear,

484
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:35,620
but underneath you see this little bit

485
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,060
of paper sticking out.

486
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:39,220
Guys, look, paper.

487
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:41,620
I look to see what's on the paper.

488
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:42,460
No, you don't.

489
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:43,540
I'm standing right over it.

490
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,100
I just called your attention to it.

491
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:46,920
Yeah.

492
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,760
Shut the fuck up.

493
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,780
This is my paper.

494
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,540
I'm looking at it.

495
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:52,860
From across the room, Julius stares.

496
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,000
I dive for the paper.

497
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,580
I kick back in the jaw.

498
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:04,780
I read the paper.

499
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,940
Yeah, as you pick it up,

500
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:10,060
you're gonna have to kind of get some of the muck

501
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:12,180
and gunk off of it.

502
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,000
Julius, come here.

503
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,460
Read this nasty paper for me.

504
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:18,900
Yeah, I go over and I try to read it

505
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,520
after I scraped some muck off.

506
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,260
It's like a small business card

507
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:25,460
in the shape of a big guitar pick.

508
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:27,860
And it says the occult

509
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:32,020
and unnatural investigative journalism association.

510
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:35,780
Shout out to Intrepid T over on Discord,

511
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:38,420
one of our $10 and up patrons

512
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:41,100
over at patreon.com slash pretending pod

513
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,340
for giving us the occult

514
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:47,020
and unnatural investigative journalism association.

515
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:47,860
Dope.

516
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:48,840
What do you think about that, Cal?

517
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,440
Ouija.

518
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,280
What?

519
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,480
Ouija.

520
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,360
O-U-I-J-A.

521
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,700
No, that obviously spells Ouija.

522
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:58,540
Oh, yeah.

523
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:01,060
It can't be Ouija.

524
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,740
Before I put it together in my head,

525
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:04,380
I was like, oh, it doesn't mean anything.

526
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:05,220
So it'd be funny to say like,

527
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,420
Ouija.

528
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,240
O-U-I-J-A.

529
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,080
O-U-I-J-A.

530
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,020
And I'm like, wait.

531
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,820
Do you think that Intrepid T

532
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,140
knew what they were doing when they wrote this?

533
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:14,960
Nope.

534
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,800
One of our listeners.

535
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,640
He looked into that.

536
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,100
Yeah, undoubtedly not.

537
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,940
A Bob Ross situation.

538
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,300
It's so wild he picked out that collection of words.

539
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,340
Did he even know?

540
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,940
Oh shit, this is not my, this campaign note.

541
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:31,700
This is our original campaign notebook full of notes.

542
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,440
What's it say?

543
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,520
That page wasn't very interesting.

544
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,000
Yeah, before we recorded, it was all pretty boring.

545
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,680
We went to a green box.

546
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,520
Nice.

547
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,320
Bright light and immense noise.

548
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:47,320
The dust begins to crawl, then fly.

549
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,920
The cave is full of lice.

550
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:55,160
The cave is full of lice is fucking horrifying sentence.

551
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,000
It is.

552
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,680
What, have you ever heard of this cow, Peck?

553
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,080
Well, I mean, it's, you know,

554
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,520
a well-known band of kooks, of course.

555
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:08,020
They investigate Bigfoot and other nonsense.

556
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:10,160
They think the moon landing never happened.

557
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:13,080
I mean, but do we like have proof, you know?

558
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,300
Like, did you see it?

559
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,140
Yes.

560
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,960
A nice moment of levity in a horrifying dark room

561
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,560
of terror and smelly nonsense.

562
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,480
So like, it's crazy that I'm here

563
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,840
to answer all these questions,

564
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,440
but the 20s are what we called them

565
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:37,440
because it was roughly, you know how Greg got got?

566
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,520
He was Greg and now he's Fox.

567
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,160
Right, by the mind control.

568
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,280
Yeah, it's kind of like mind control.

569
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,880
But basically when he does it,

570
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:53,080
there's probably like a 20% chance that it just,

571
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:56,020
and she points at the walls around you.

572
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:58,100
It just kind of does this to you.

573
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,100
It makes you a role-playing podcaster

574
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,340
with the mind of a child.

575
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:07,060
Essentially, yeah.

576
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:09,360
Yeah, I mean, you just talk and talk and talk,

577
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,800
but nothing of substance ever really comes out,

578
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:15,340
just yammering on and on about some tower,

579
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:17,420
getting God back to heaven.

580
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:19,420
It's just, they just talk and talk.

581
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:22,460
Is there any left?

582
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:25,660
I mean, I thought that we were gonna be surrounded.

583
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,940
I was ready for a different kind of fight, honestly,

584
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,600
when we got down here.

585
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,940
Don't worry, in a very real way, they're still with us.

586
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:32,100
Let's get out of this pit.

587
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:32,940
Yeah.

588
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:35,360
Yeah, my camera's up there, dude.

589
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,960
We're the fucking can news crew, guys.

590
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,200
Let's go get our camera.

591
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,080
Julius puts his back up against the wall near the hole

592
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:47,700
and puts his hands down, ready to lift people up and out.

593
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:52,700
Okay, we're gonna need a strength check on both accounts.

594
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:57,700
Each time, I'm gonna make sure Luke passes his

595
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:00,780
before you have a good shot at yours.

596
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:02,020
Fail on the first one.

597
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:07,060
29 out of 50, pass on the second one.

598
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:11,860
Should he get a plus 20 since he's lifting with his legs?

599
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:13,140
Fail on the third one.

600
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,660
And also, great question.

601
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:16,980
Well, what we're gonna do here-

602
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:20,700
Also, both my fails would have still failed with 20 more.

603
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,420
I meant plus 30.

604
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:27,860
Yes, both my fails would have still failed with a plus 30.

605
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:30,160
I got 90s and 80s.

606
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,860
Because you guys have time, not a ton of time,

607
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:37,420
but you do have time, whoever is last is gonna be the one

608
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:40,020
who might get stuck, and that's gonna be

609
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:42,580
the difficult place to be in.

610
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:44,740
I mean, it would be me, right?

611
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:47,740
If you were the one lifting everyone up out,

612
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:48,860
like helping everyone up out,

613
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:50,300
then you would be the last one

614
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:52,940
that they're gonna try to pull you up.

615
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,260
I think that's the plan, though.

616
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:58,420
So, with enough time, only 10 feet up, a wall behind you,

617
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:03,140
you're easily able to get Beck, Cal, and Stevie

618
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:05,420
up out of the it pit.

619
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:07,340
They're all three looking down at you

620
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:12,340
in this vile, disgusting, absolutely wretched,

621
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:15,660
like it's hard not to throw up while you're still down.

622
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:16,860
And we just walk away.

623
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,220
You can't get used to it.

624
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:22,860
To get a little higher up, I would like to sit Vernon

625
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:25,260
up against the wall and stand on his shoulders

626
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:28,100
to have a couple more feet closer to the wall.

627
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,500
That's fucking role playing.

628
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:32,600
That is Liam Neeson, Ra's al Ghuling,

629
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,140
being aware of your surroundings,

630
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:37,180
and that will get you out of here without rolling.

631
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:38,020
Hell yeah.

632
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,780
But we probably need to try to roll.

633
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:41,660
Should we roll to retrieve him?

634
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:45,620
That is gonna be a difficult retrieval, I believe.

635
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:46,460
Fucking leave him in there.

636
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:47,500
I think we should leave him.

637
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:50,380
I think this is the best place for him right now.

638
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:52,300
He's far away to where when he screams,

639
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,700
nobody might hear him,

640
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,180
because we're gonna shut the door behind us, for sure.

641
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:59,540
Well, we are, but also back to the potential plan.

642
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:02,580
Should we run screaming into the town now,

643
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,100
saying help, help, help.

644
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:07,780
As opposed to what's sneaking out of here, I guess.

645
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:09,940
Or casually strolling in and saying,

646
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:13,060
we kicked that guy's ass, fuck you.

647
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:15,980
The former does seem like the better,

648
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:18,300
if those are the only two choices.

649
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,860
I don't like to fool the public.

650
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:22,700
In fact, it's my stated mission to never do it.

651
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,420
But our very lives depend on it,

652
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:26,820
and so does the information we carry in our minds now,

653
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:28,600
and on Beck's precious camera.

654
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:31,220
Oh, as Beck just caresses.

655
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:33,620
Oh yeah, it's out of the bag and back to filming.

656
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:36,580
What if instead of either of those,

657
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:41,480
remember we were invited to a certain someone's GIZ?

658
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,580
Greg?

659
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:45,200
Do you think we could just go to Greg's

660
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,480
and see if we can't get some help?

661
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,960
I mean, he probably wouldn't know

662
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,920
what was happening with us.

663
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,240
If he's just at his house,

664
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,980
he hasn't been paying attention to anything,

665
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:58,440
so he wouldn't even know that we're heading to trial,

666
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,960
and she looks at her phone, and she's like,

667
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,320
in like half an hour.

668
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,280
Did we ever ask if we have cell phone reception?

669
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,720
I'm not sure if you did ask, but I do have to pee.

670
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,440
What if this whole fucking time

671
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,200
we could have just called 911?

672
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,560
I feel like we did, but I don't wanna say that we did,

673
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,580
in case he thinks maybe we can.

674
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,520
We've had fucking five bars this whole time.

675
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,600
We're getting texts from like, where are you?

676
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,560
I'm using my flashlight,

677
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:29,080
just like not looking at anything else on the screen.

678
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:31,040
Your battery is draining to nothing.

679
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:36,280
I'm gonna go with a solid, there's no way, but.

680
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,560
We wouldn't have had a reason to

681
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,040
up until we got sentenced to death,

682
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,840
so right now exploring that option is probably.

683
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,040
The giant statues are just cell towers.

684
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,360
That fucking 5G.

685
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,500
Turning everybody into freaking werefoxes.

686
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,880
Zach, I remember the thing that I thought of

687
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,680
that was maybe important, and then I forgot.

688
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,920
It was pretty important.

689
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,280
I hit a breaking point.

690
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,480
Oh, I had a question too for you.

691
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:02,160
Yeah, right when we got down in there, huh?

692
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,740
We'll do a breaking point for you now.

693
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:04,660
What was your question?

694
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:07,120
I was looking on my phone to see

695
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:10,280
what I wrote down as my phobia or whatever.

696
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,480
This is what I had.

697
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:15,720
I literally, Julia Summers, phobia.

698
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:18,480
Big pits of blood, flesh, and shit.

699
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,600
And then I looked to see if I had a different note,

700
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:25,160
and the next one was grip colon in a different note,

701
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,840
and I just never wrote it down.

702
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:29,240
With no number, amazing.

703
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,880
But I knew it was something to do with that,

704
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,180
and that makes sense.

705
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,020
Good to go.

706
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,280
It's from July 5th.

707
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,120
Grip.

708
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,000
Oh.

709
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,120
Grip.

710
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:42,940
Grip.

711
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:43,780
Okay, cool.

712
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:45,320
Well, let's have Luke and Thomas

713
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,780
take off your headphones real quick,

714
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:48,320
and Joe, let's.

715
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,440
Forget how we're doing it this season.

716
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,760
This season, we're just kinda deciding

717
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,680
what it's gonna be.

718
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,680
Oh, good, cool.

719
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,220
Between the two of us.

720
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:57,880
Well then, I've got a few options.

721
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,160
Yeah, hit me with them.

722
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:02,600
Just viscera and gore and gross gore.

723
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,440
Gross gore.

724
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,640
Like beyond just blood.

725
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,560
Yeah.

726
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,680
Or crazy designs.

727
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,160
I like, I.

728
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:12,360
Joe, the player, loves investigating crazy designs.

729
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,200
Yeah.

730
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,020
Yeah.

731
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,760
Or if you got something else.

732
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,240
Yeah, yeah.

733
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,440
I think that.

734
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:23,520
It was literally the fight response

735
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,640
was what made me, my sanity broke,

736
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,320
and I had a fight response,

737
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,820
if you want it to be fight related.

738
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:29,660
Okay, yeah, yeah.

739
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:31,140
It was the least likely thing I had put.

740
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,240
I rolled a one to get it.

741
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,200
Okay, yeah.

742
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,040
What about?

743
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,320
What about like men wearing suits?

744
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,640
Oh, because of the landlord, you mean?

745
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,480
Yeah.

746
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,300
Oh, yeah.

747
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,560
Or like, I guess that's a little strange,

748
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,400
maybe, I don't know.

749
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,480
Or heights, you could also do heights.

750
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,320
Like falling?

751
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,140
Yeah.

752
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:50,320
But I like either of the first two

753
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,760
that you came up with, so I'll.

754
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,360
I like the ones you said, though.

755
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,300
I mean.

756
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,140
I'll defer to you.

757
00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:00,240
I'm between the heights, the suit,

758
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,400
and the blood, because I don't.

759
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I agree with you.

760
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,760
Every time we look at this diagram,

761
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,880
if we ever look at it again.

762
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,340
We'll all cut out heights.

763
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:10,920
Okay, so suits or viscera?

764
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,560
I mean, let's just roll for it,

765
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,640
because either one.

766
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,480
Yeah.

767
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,160
One, two, three is blood.

768
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,020
Four, five, six is the other one.

769
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:20,740
It's a four.

770
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,160
Okay, so men in suits.

771
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,260
Men wearing suits.

772
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:25,020
I mean, that's great.

773
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:27,200
That's good for Beck as a character.

774
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:32,200
I will say, as soon as we have decided that,

775
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,760
you're gonna need to.

776
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,560
Am I gonna have to fight every person in a suit?

777
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:39,080
Well, you're gonna need to work on maybe Julius and Kal.

778
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:39,920
Oh, fuck.

779
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,840
I forgot I was surrounded by men in suits.

780
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,480
Yeah, they both wear those,

781
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,280
and so does everyone you work with.

782
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:52,920
I was picturing just running into maybe some of the Godels.

783
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,320
Nope, it's everybody around me.

784
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,160
Ouchie, ouchie.

785
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,200
Shit.

786
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,440
So, okay, then I need to clarify with you right now,

787
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,560
like how extreme is this?

788
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,800
Is it a phobia, would you call it?

789
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,640
Yeah.

790
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,460
I'm scared of the suit.

791
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:09,520
Yeah, scared of the suit, I suppose.

792
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,340
Yeah.

793
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:12,320
And then if I have them remove their jackets,

794
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,360
would that be enough for me?

795
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,520
Yeah, I think so.

796
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:17,600
Yeah, removing of the jacket is gonna be enough.

797
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,760
It takes the power away.

798
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,560
Okay, but okay, yeah.

799
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,460
But okay.

800
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,480
I just don't know how, like, when I go.

801
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,520
I mean, literally, let's say as soon as you get up out

802
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:33,600
of the pit and you're looking at them for the first time,

803
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,600
and they're also covered in this stuff,

804
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:39,180
like he was when you attacked him,

805
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:41,480
you're gonna need them to change

806
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,900
how they look pretty quickly, yeah.

807
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:46,040
But it's, yeah, it's just an uncomfortable thing for me.

808
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:49,680
Like, it's not gonna make me lash out at them, per se.

809
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,760
No, but I think that you need

810
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,800
to be pretty intense about it.

811
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,920
Cool, yeah, I get that.

812
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,000
I just mean, like, if I run into my,

813
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,280
like, if I run into his thief, if I run into Typh,

814
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,760
am I gonna be angry with him?

815
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,040
I think you're just gonna be weird.

816
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:02,880
Exactly, that's what I mean.

817
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,200
Yes, weird, stilted, like, no eye contact,

818
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:09,200
not cool-ass fucking Beck like you used to be.

819
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,240
I'm all about it.

820
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:13,080
Women in non-binary, women in non-binary people

821
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,600
in suits are fine.

822
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,540
I dig it.

823
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:17,480
You should check the recording,

824
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,440
make sure we're still recording after the lights blinked.

825
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,040
We are still recording after the lights blinked.

826
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:26,120
Luke, you can take your ears out.

827
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,600
Ooh, I was making little beats, you know?

828
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,540
I was like, damn, I would never listen to this shit.

829
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,040
Man, it is.

830
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,920
Dude, it is going nutso.

831
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,040
Gettin' it out there.

832
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,560
You should be quiet and try and get a good take-a-one

833
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,120
that you can then loop whenever you need to.

834
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:42,960
Yeah.

835
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,820
Wow, that was a good one.

836
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,500
Needs to, like, hit our house.

837
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,000
Famous last podcast.

838
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,940
That was a really good one.

839
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,600
That was really good.

840
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,920
Good job, Thomas.

841
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:11,400
Thinking about thunder and lightning

842
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,080
brought me to thinking about Thor,

843
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:15,080
which brought me to thinking about Norse mythology,

844
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,920
which brought me to thinking about Neil Gaiman,

845
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,400
which brought me to thinking about Sandman,

846
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,240
anybody's favorite?

847
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,080
Yeah.

848
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:20,900
Yeah.

849
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:21,740
Yeah.

850
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:22,580
Yeah.

851
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:23,400
Yeah.

852
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,240
Yeah.

853
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,080
Yeah.

854
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:25,900
Yeah.

855
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:26,740
Yeah.

856
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:27,580
Yeah.

857
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:28,420
Thinking about Sandman,

858
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:30,860
anybody started watching that on Netflix?

859
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:32,540
I have not, but I want to.

860
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:33,380
Is it good?

861
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:35,740
I watched the first episode only, but I loved it.

862
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:37,800
I thought it was a really cool first episode

863
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,140
and it makes, I've never read the book,

864
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:41,940
so I'm intrigued as to what is gonna happen.

865
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:44,200
I definitely want to watch it.

866
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,060
I just like, when it came out, I was like,

867
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:49,080
I'm not in the mood to watch something like this

868
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,220
because I wanted to watch something stupid.

869
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:52,460
I wanna see it too.

870
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:55,140
Yeah, so often I just wanna watch something stupid.

871
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:58,860
Is his name Morpheus or Morby?

872
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,740
It's not Morbius.

873
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,420
I read the description and it was something like that.

874
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:03,260
Morbius sounds right,

875
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:05,240
cause he is the God of like dreams,

876
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:08,060
which is in real life, who Morbius is.

877
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:09,100
In real life?

878
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:14,580
Did Neil Gaiman quickly write the books

879
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:16,860
based off the Morbintime meme

880
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:19,180
and then they produced a show and released it?

881
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:20,220
You're thinking of The Matrix.

882
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,060
Maybe.

883
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:21,880
Oh, well.

884
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:26,880
Oh, Morpheus slow down the river of live streaming.

885
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:30,800
Whoa.

886
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,520
Yeah, Joe's eyes just went white

887
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,800
and he floated in the air for a second

888
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,260
and he said that weird shit.

889
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,720
I think it was a prophecy.

890
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:42,600
That's just a little Rocky Horror picture show for you.

891
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,080
All right.

892
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,720
We're all out of the hole at this point.

893
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,560
All four of you are out of the hole,

894
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:52,800
looking down at the slumped body

895
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,100
of Vernon Covington, the landlord,

896
00:36:55,100 --> 00:37:00,000
which Julius Summers has just used along with your help

897
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,180
to get up out of the it pit.

898
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:04,760
Wow.

899
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,040
Did you hear that crackle in the headphones?

900
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:11,860
It was good.

901
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:12,700
That was wild.

902
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:13,680
Whoa.

903
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,200
Yeah, you're gonna have plenty of options

904
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,720
of thunder samplings.

905
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:22,040
And Beck looks up from his camera,

906
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:25,040
looks at Cal and Julius,

907
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:29,460
but with something different in his eyes.

908
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:35,040
Hey, what's up, what's up, what's up fellas?

909
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,380
It sure is hot today.

910
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:40,980
Boy, howdy, you guys look like you're real hot.

911
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,840
Would you guys want to take off your coats, please?

912
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,760
Is it hot in here?

913
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,480
Much to you, Beck.

914
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,800
Yeah, yeah, thanks Cal.

915
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,800
Julius, please.

916
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,520
It's covered in shit and blood.

917
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,680
I was planning on removing it anyway.

918
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,960
Yeah, there you go.

919
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:57,800
They're dirty.

920
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,340
That's it.

921
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:02,260
Julius is like, yeah, gross, and takes his off.

922
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,100
Yeah.

923
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,960
Yeah, cool.

924
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,320
Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.

925
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,160
Yeah.

926
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:12,280
Okay, so we were talking about whether we're going to

927
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,680
like come out all.

928
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:18,080
Yeah, whether we're going to go to Greg's GIZ

929
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,400
or whether we're going to come out and say like,

930
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,720
hey, what's up, we're back.

931
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,340
We're ready for our trial now, please.

932
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:27,360
Or we can get the fuck out of here.

933
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,480
Stevie, do the people of Grover's Gorge

934
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,960
know about the It Pit?

935
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,600
Yeah, the people of Grover's Gorge know about the It Pit.

936
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,440
All of them?

937
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,260
Yeah.

938
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:37,800
Do they know what it's like in there?

939
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,920
Yeah, I think they do, Cal.

940
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,340
Guys, I think we need to decide

941
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:45,580
what we ultimately want to do

942
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:48,820
before we go down any of these avenues, aren't we?

943
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:50,540
Yes, let's make a five-year plan.

944
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,940
Stevie, we were talking like in the hole,

945
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:57,900
like is there a chance that we're looked favorably upon

946
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,580
because of this landlord situation?

947
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:01,660
Like maybe he's an asshole and everybody was like,

948
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:02,740
thank God he's gone.

949
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:05,380
Yeah, I mean, Fred definitely won't like it

950
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:08,940
when he gets back, but we should have time hopefully

951
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:11,940
until, I mean, they definitely told him

952
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:13,280
that Sandro died.

953
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:16,220
Like they definitely told him that Sandro died, so.

954
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:19,100
Like, and he would come back for that turtle.

955
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:24,100
Yeah, so he would definitely come back for that turtle, yeah.

956
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:26,940
Was that just a turtle

957
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:30,260
or was that turtle functionally the mayor of this town?

958
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:32,300
Not functionally the mayor of this town,

959
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:35,660
but pretty importantly, the mayor of this town.

960
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:37,420
In like a community pride sense

961
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:40,340
or in some weird dark forces way.

962
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:42,300
Yeah, it's gonna be that second one.

963
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:45,300
I'm gonna sound really out of control here

964
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,540
while I'm talking, but just know

965
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:50,420
that this is really out there.

966
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:55,340
I did see a spirit or dark energy come out of the turtle.

967
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:56,300
Quiet, Julius.

968
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,860
Stevie was just about to tell us

969
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:59,920
about the spooky shit going on with the turtle.

970
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,760
Yeah.

971
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:01,600
Yeah.

972
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,060
No, no, that's go on.

973
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:10,340
I didn't, you saw, you saw it?

974
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:15,300
It had a, looked human almost.

975
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:20,300
It was, I mean, it sounded like it was talking too,

976
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:25,840
but not anything, not real words

977
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,840
or words that I could understand.

978
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:33,840
And when I saw it, I got this taste in my mouth,

979
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:37,240
just salt, salty, saline.

980
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,120
You saw God?

981
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:42,360
Beck's eyes are wide looking at Julius.

982
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:46,160
I, dude, like I saw like something too,

983
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,640
but it like wasn't that, dude.

984
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,480
I mean, what?

985
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,440
But it's God?

986
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,760
Yeah, I mean, I didn't.

987
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:57,320
And she kind of looks down at the ground

988
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:01,560
and is like, I kind of always thought that it wasn't real.

989
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:04,200
Like there was some other explanation for all of this,

990
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:08,040
but I'm starting to fucking freak out, man.

991
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:11,600
Stevie, Stevie, Stevie, calm down, calm down, Stevie.

992
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,920
Listen to me, look at me, look into my eyes.

993
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,400
She looks up at you.

994
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,780
That's not God, God is a woman.

995
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:24,240
She only loses two sanities, she's reassured by this.

996
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,880
No, right, that's not God, but then what is it?

997
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,340
Okay, but it is God because it did all this shit.

998
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:32,820
It did everything.

999
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:36,060
I mean, it's like, it's like gave him all the power.

1000
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:38,820
It's like, what did you, you saw it too, Beck?

1001
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:41,840
I mean, like I saw something like come out of the turtle

1002
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:44,020
and like go into Chuck.

1003
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:45,460
Did you see it go into Chuck?

1004
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:47,460
To me, I didn't like quite see like,

1005
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:49,500
it didn't look human to me exactly.

1006
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,780
And like, I didn't hear anything

1007
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:53,780
unless I didn't ask the right questions.

1008
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:56,820
There's no such thing as the right questions.

1009
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:58,140
I didn't like hear anything.

1010
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:00,940
Dude, like to me, it was just like,

1011
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:02,600
somebody like shot a super soaker

1012
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,000
out of the turtle into Chuck.

1013
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,060
What did you see, Cal?

1014
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:09,140
Hold on, hold on, you're both talking so fast, it's crazy.

1015
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:12,400
Now someone, I thought the turtle leaped to its death,

1016
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,140
but someone shot a super soaker at it?

1017
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:18,700
I mean, it looked like maybe that was what I saw.

1018
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:20,720
You remember how it like leapt off the edge, right?

1019
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:21,560
Yes.

1020
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:23,860
So then the super soaker came out up from beneath

1021
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:25,860
like where that, like where it would have

1022
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:27,960
probably like impacted is what like,

1023
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:30,340
I like inferred or whatever.

1024
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:33,300
And it like shot up and over and like into Chuck.

1025
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:38,000
The humanoid talking, tasting energy went into Chuck

1026
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,020
and he exploded through the glass.

1027
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:41,700
See, I didn't see like a humanoid thing.

1028
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:43,780
I just saw like a super soaker blast, dude.

1029
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:46,280
Boys, I need you to look at my fingers, please.

1030
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,300
How many fingers am I holding up?

1031
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:49,860
Five.

1032
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:51,580
Yeah, I'm counting five, my dude.

1033
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:53,400
Okay, I just needed to be sure

1034
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,500
you could still be trusted with the news.

1035
00:42:56,580 --> 00:43:01,420
I mean like, yeah, dude, that's my biggest regret

1036
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:03,160
is that I didn't film this.

1037
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,300
I was startled.

1038
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:06,340
You didn't get a date.

1039
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:09,100
Remind Joe, I think I said that there was something else

1040
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:10,260
that startled me at the time, right?

1041
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:14,380
Well, you were shooting the deep healing that was happening.

1042
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:17,140
I think even Julius grabbed your camera or something.

1043
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:18,420
There was some reason that I remember

1044
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:19,940
it like jostled down to the ground.

1045
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:21,340
It was a failed roll, yeah.

1046
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:22,580
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.

1047
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:24,980
Yeah, like it's not there, dude.

1048
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:26,180
It's not in the footage.

1049
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:27,640
Fuck.

1050
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:28,620
I got the aftermath,

1051
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:30,900
because you remember when Chuck went through that window?

1052
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:33,740
Like that was why he got pushed through that window.

1053
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:35,900
Because of God, who is a turtle?

1054
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:38,280
I'm not sure about the God thing.

1055
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:40,660
God turtle, Godel, God, is there something in there?

1056
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:41,940
God turtle.

1057
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:44,420
Cal, you fucking figured it out, my dude.

1058
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:49,400
God turtle, Godel, God turtle, God turtle, God turtle.

1059
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:50,460
Go back, back, back.

1060
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:52,300
But still.

1061
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:56,340
We don't want to reveal our position just yet.

1062
00:43:57,940 --> 00:43:59,500
Stevie.

1063
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:00,340
Yeah?

1064
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:02,060
Is that why you're named Godel?

1065
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:03,380
I don't think so.

1066
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:05,220
You're the Godel.

1067
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:15,380
I never put that together.

1068
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:17,540
God turtle, God turtle, God turtle.

1069
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:21,940
Let's mark that hypothesis as a maybe.

1070
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:24,300
No potential.

1071
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:25,540
I mean, it's probably ancient times

1072
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:27,900
they've been worshiping the Godel turtle.

1073
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:31,460
Turtle, turtle, God total, God total.

1074
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:32,540
It's ancient, man.

1075
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:35,220
God damn it, that does follow linguistic principles.

1076
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:39,540
It makes sense.

1077
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:41,420
Stevie, like maybe you're figuring this out

1078
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:42,260
for the first time.

1079
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:44,100
Yeah, I think we cracked the code here, dude.

1080
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:46,860
I think we did, I think we figured it all out.

1081
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:48,040
This is amazing.

1082
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:54,700
Either way, we have to get out of here.

1083
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:56,740
And here it's Godel's all the way down.

1084
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:02,140
Oh my God.

1085
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:03,580
Total, total.

1086
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:07,380
Do we have enough incriminating footage

1087
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:11,620
and usable, good quality television to leave?

1088
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:14,380
I mean, I got a bunch of footage of that viscera pit,

1089
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:17,900
like that's, nobody's supposed to have like that

1090
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:19,420
on their property.

1091
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:20,820
If we can even leave,

1092
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:23,740
it might be time to start preparing our defense.

1093
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:26,380
Stevie, do you think you could get us out of here?

1094
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:29,300
If we stay, I can try.

1095
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:32,900
And if we leave, I'll try to help.

1096
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:34,800
Should we stay or should we go?

1097
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,980
Now, we have to decide.

1098
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:42,980
Personally, my vote is stay and risk our lives

1099
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:45,780
for great programming.

1100
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:47,340
If we stay, there could be trouble.

1101
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:48,180
Yeah.

1102
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:50,900
So, do you know what my uncle will say?

1103
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:52,100
There could be double, dude.

1104
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:53,340
There could be double.

1105
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:54,260
Why would your uncle say that?

1106
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:57,360
Yeah, why would he get upset because we're alive?

1107
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:59,560
The same reason I'm getting upset

1108
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:01,820
thinking about leaving this place.

1109
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:06,820
Which is what, you're not done getting your fucking story?

1110
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:09,060
You're willing to risk all of our lives for it?

1111
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:10,000
Precisely.

1112
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:10,840
Oh.

1113
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:11,680
Oh.

1114
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,100
Yeah, I mean, I-

1115
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:15,260
We have the story, Julius.

1116
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:16,580
But I'm sure there's more.

1117
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:17,940
There's a real part of Beck

1118
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:20,500
that is a little bit Julius in here,

1119
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:24,260
that this is footage that nobody's ever seen before.

1120
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:26,460
What else could we maybe get?

1121
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:30,500
I mean, guys, this is the story of the century.

1122
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:33,340
Only if we get it out of here.

1123
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:36,820
But the more we get, it could be its own canned show.

1124
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:38,220
Screw episodes, dude.

1125
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:40,460
We could do a whole documentary special

1126
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:43,660
and you'd win the Pulitzer for this, dude.

1127
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:45,780
I feel like I've lost some grip here.

1128
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:47,420
This is a very bad idea.

1129
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:50,300
Beck, you should know, this is a very bad idea.

1130
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:52,220
No, yeah, for sure, for sure, for sure.

1131
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:55,220
Cal, you know how in your house you've got

1132
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:58,760
pictures of you with famous people?

1133
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:01,860
You could be one of those people

1134
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:04,860
that people have pictures of in their house.

1135
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:07,020
I am one of those people, Julius.

1136
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:08,620
Do you wanna be one of those people?

1137
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:10,340
Because you won't if you die here.

1138
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:12,160
And I won't if I leave with all we have.

1139
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,780
With this amazing footage we already have,

1140
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:17,680
we have a treasure and you are getting greedy for more.

1141
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:18,520
I am.

1142
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:20,660
And I won't follow you to this death.

1143
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:22,760
Julius just looks at Beck.

1144
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:25,020
Beck does, part of him really still wanna stay in film,

1145
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:28,000
but I mean, I guess this place isn't going anywhere.

1146
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,380
Like, could we come back with maybe like?

1147
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:31,660
We can come back with.

1148
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:33,220
A bigger crew or whatever?

1149
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:35,260
An armed federal escort.

1150
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:39,180
We will report on this place when it is raided

1151
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:40,620
by the federal government.

1152
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:42,780
What we have now is enough to make that happen.

1153
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:44,620
Julius just kind of nods his head.

1154
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:47,660
He absolutely still would like to stay and shoot more,

1155
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:50,100
but he knows that this is a team

1156
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:52,500
and that he has basically been outvoted

1157
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,080
and so he's not gonna argue anymore.

1158
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:55,740
Okay, the best way getting out of here

1159
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:58,420
is gonna be around the back of this factory

1160
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:00,020
and then we're gonna get into the trees.

1161
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:01,240
We're gonna take the tree line

1162
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:03,460
all the way to the big plant wall.

1163
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:06,700
We're gonna have our fucking teeth in that wall

1164
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:09,980
as we just crouch and kind of shuffle our way

1165
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:12,740
as quietly and as smoothly as possible.

1166
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:15,500
Across this plant wall all the way to the door.

1167
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:17,900
Possibly like walking, like you're sitting.

1168
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:20,340
I think that that would probably keep us

1169
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:22,480
out of the view of the most people.

1170
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:27,900
Kal is like silently composing a personnel complaint.

1171
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:33,300
Julius is a little bit happier knowing that he can leave

1172
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:35,540
with at least a cool escape TikTok.

1173
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:39,820
Is she suggesting further east?

1174
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:41,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1175
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:44,140
So just further east, just straight into the forest

1176
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:46,820
is where she pointed, like straight into this tree line,

1177
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:48,820
this thick tree line that's on the far east side

1178
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:51,640
and then going as far south as possible,

1179
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:53,300
like staying in the trees the entire way

1180
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:56,860
down to the plant wall and then walking across the plant wall

1181
00:48:56,860 --> 00:48:58,900
over on the south side that you came in

1182
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:00,900
and finding that door and then getting out.

1183
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:01,740
The door that we came in.

1184
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:02,940
The door that you came in.

1185
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,220
So we're going east into the woods

1186
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:06,340
and then south using the woods as cover.

1187
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:07,280
Got it, got it.

1188
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:10,400
Is there anywhere we could raid a supply closet

1189
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:13,400
or something for extra onesies?

1190
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:14,800
I like the green ones myself.

1191
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:17,080
The green ones would be in the lab

1192
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:19,360
or in the super nice GIZs.

1193
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:21,840
It is not important, just the nearest ones.

1194
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:24,720
Yeah, I mean those would be here in the factory

1195
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:28,720
but I think we're risking a lot by trying to go in there.

1196
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:31,100
That'd be like a whole other episode probably.

1197
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:33,200
Where are the GIZs to here?

1198
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,400
All the way across, like on the far other side,

1199
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:39,080
like the full west side or like the green,

1200
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:43,120
like all the EEs live on the super far west side.

1201
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:46,160
Did they leave some of their EE cummings in that pit?

1202
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:47,400
Oh, thank God.

1203
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:51,440
Yeah, there was punctuation fucking everywhere.

1204
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:57,160
Oh, it fucking influenced so many terrible Instagram poets.

1205
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,280
I like the ones where they grab that newspaper

1206
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:02,640
and black out a bunch of words

1207
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:05,280
and just leave some of them that make a poem.

1208
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:06,120
I haven't seen that.

1209
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:06,940
That's kind of nice.

1210
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:07,780
That's fun.

1211
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:11,040
I like the one where this guy takes a piece of bologna

1212
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,540
and pokes a bunch of holes in it

1213
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:16,620
and then slaps it on a page and then that's the poem.

1214
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:19,820
Do you think he'd poke the holes first or afterward?

1215
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:21,860
Well, some of them don't work.

1216
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:23,180
So I think he just does it.

1217
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:26,020
That's how you know.

1218
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:28,540
I definitely thought you were just riffing that.

1219
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:30,700
No, it's a thing I've seen.

1220
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:35,220
Well, I've seen a guy take bologna and poke holes in it.

1221
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:36,460
I was like, oh, that's good.

1222
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:37,460
What's mine gonna be?

1223
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:38,620
Yeah.

1224
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:43,020
This footage now from Beck's camera

1225
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:44,900
is like when you're watching a documentary

1226
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:47,020
and shit hits the fan and it pans around

1227
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:50,380
and you see the boom operator is rolling out.

1228
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:52,900
You guys are in front of me and it's hazard.

1229
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:54,020
It's shaky cam.

1230
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:54,860
It's shaky cam.

1231
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:56,420
It's some Blair Witch Cloverfield.

1232
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:57,260
Going through the woods.

1233
00:50:57,260 --> 00:50:59,180
Oh, and these woods are pretty intense.

1234
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:00,380
We all look a little panicked.

1235
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:02,740
People do not traipse through these woods.

1236
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:05,000
So it is thick brush.

1237
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,500
Is Julia still almost dead?

1238
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:07,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1239
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:08,220
He's at two hit points.

1240
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:11,180
So literally he's barely breathing.

1241
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:14,020
He's able to make all these points and stuff,

1242
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:15,900
but he mostly got hit in the face.

1243
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:19,220
My head, I am bruised eyeballs.

1244
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:23,780
Internal brain hemorrhaging probably.

1245
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:24,620
Oh, that explains it.

1246
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:25,460
Yeah, it's not.

1247
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:26,740
I'm gonna die of a blood clot

1248
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:29,140
and we don't get any help soon.

1249
00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:32,120
You look over at Julius and one of his eyes

1250
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:33,940
is completely filled with blood

1251
00:51:33,940 --> 00:51:36,720
and it's starting to drip from the wrong corner,

1252
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,180
like not from his tear duct.

1253
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:41,440
This crazed half dead man who can barely walk

1254
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:42,980
is like, we gotta stay here.

1255
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:43,820
Yeah.

1256
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:44,660
Yeah.

1257
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:45,980
Exactly.

1258
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:48,060
And Cal, for some reason,

1259
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:49,780
like argued it in a good face

1260
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:52,340
instead of just being like, no, you idiot.

1261
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:53,180
Like, do you?

1262
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:54,000
We need to kill you.

1263
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:54,840
What?

1264
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:56,540
You could like push him over and kill him.

1265
00:51:56,540 --> 00:51:57,580
Yeah, like.

1266
00:51:57,580 --> 00:52:01,140
There's a 50-50 chance that a punch would kill him.

1267
00:52:02,140 --> 00:52:03,700
Or, you know.

1268
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:04,540
I can't punch him.

1269
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:11,060
It's actually a 66% chance now that I think about it

1270
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:12,860
because it's D4 minus one.

1271
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:14,580
Wait, so nope, that's, fuck.

1272
00:52:14,580 --> 00:52:15,860
That'd be 33% chance.

1273
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:18,340
That's 50-50 if it's a D4 minus one.

1274
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:19,260
But I have two.

1275
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:20,100
Yeah.

1276
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:21,760
Oh, so one, yeah, you're right.

1277
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:22,600
Fuck.

1278
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:23,780
Anyway, don't punch me.

1279
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:29,140
Julius with his brain not working as well right now.

1280
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:30,180
I'll take a minute.

1281
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:31,020
It's a weird one.

1282
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:34,580
This would be a really bad place to drive a four-wheeler.

1283
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:36,400
I don't understand the reference.

1284
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:37,460
Julius doesn't either.

1285
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:41,060
He's, his brain's just starting to shut off.

1286
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:42,340
Stevie pats you on the back.

1287
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:45,260
She's like, it's okay, grandpa, we're almost out.

1288
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:47,220
What else do we see?

1289
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:49,700
Oh, shit, I mean, oh no.

1290
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:50,540
He's Frank Gotthold.

1291
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:52,100
Ah, fuck, Julius Gotthold.

1292
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:53,340
I mean, Caesar, I mean.

1293
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:54,660
I mean, fuck.

1294
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:57,060
Oh yeah, we're walking.

1295
00:52:57,060 --> 00:52:59,740
We finally get to the big plant wall.

1296
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:02,180
And okay, guys, it's shimmying time.

1297
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:03,940
This is when Julius pulled his phone out to.

1298
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:06,020
Shimmy, shimmy, y'all, shimmy, y'all, shimmy.

1299
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:09,320
I'm gonna get in behind and TikTok them walking

1300
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:10,860
however they're gonna be walking.

1301
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:12,420
Yep, not being weird about it.

1302
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:16,640
This is the point where we need to be really sneaky.

1303
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:19,700
So I need everyone to roll stealth.

1304
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:23,380
40 on a 40.

1305
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:24,880
Wow.

1306
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:27,180
You got a 65 on a 40.

1307
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:28,500
I'm sorry, a 30.

1308
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:31,020
Fail.

1309
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:32,740
I only have 10% in stealth.

1310
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:34,500
And I got a three.

1311
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:35,860
Oh yeah.

1312
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:37,580
Wow.

1313
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:40,900
I thought that I would just kind of give an alertness check

1314
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:43,500
for just like all of Grover's gorge.

1315
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:47,780
And Luke, will you check out what I rolled there?

1316
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:52,560
He rolled a 100.

1317
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:54,060
Oh, fuck yeah.

1318
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:58,180
So they are all taking a big long blink.

1319
00:53:58,180 --> 00:54:00,520
Literally in my head, I was like, what do I give them?

1320
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:03,620
Like 80% as an entire city?

1321
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:05,820
Like for someone to see.

1322
00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:08,740
We're only in part of the city and the part

1323
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:09,660
that's best to hide in.

1324
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:11,980
Well, then it's a great thing for everyone

1325
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:14,260
that I rolled a 100 just now.

1326
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:15,100
Holy shit.

1327
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:17,060
As you guys hit the door,

1328
00:54:17,060 --> 00:54:22,060
creak it open and take one last look out at Grover's gorge.

1329
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:26,300
You all actually notice why all the residents

1330
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:28,540
are not paying you any mind.

1331
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:31,980
You see Chuck Bidwell, bright blue eyes,

1332
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:34,060
face lined by the sun,

1333
00:54:34,060 --> 00:54:39,060
topped by a tight flat top of salt and pepper hair stocky,

1334
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:43,500
the muscle of his youth turned fat.

1335
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:48,500
And Chuck Bidwell wearing his green polo

1336
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:54,220
is absolutely drenched, wet, soaking

1337
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:57,940
as he walks through Grover's gorge.

1338
00:54:57,940 --> 00:55:00,620
You grab the door, close it shut.

1339
00:55:03,260 --> 00:55:05,540
Click on the other side.

1340
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:07,380
And you guys are standing,

1341
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:10,340
looking out at the massive gorge

1342
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:13,020
that you saw when you arrived.

1343
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:16,620
Fog is filling up this enormous gorge.

1344
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:18,460
And you see that the train,

1345
00:55:18,460 --> 00:55:22,660
the single steel train car is sitting

1346
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:24,740
on your side of the gorge.

1347
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:26,860
Just how it was the last time you were here.

1348
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:30,620
Cal sees Julius tick-tocking all of this.

1349
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:33,700
And he says, Julius, put that fucking phone away

1350
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:34,780
and get on the train.

1351
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:41,700
Julius gets up flush with the train

1352
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:45,620
and is gonna tick-tock you guys walking into the train

1353
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:47,260
and then get in the train.

1354
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:49,060
And he saves it in drafts

1355
00:55:49,060 --> 00:55:52,080
with his six other tick-tocks he's taken

1356
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:53,320
since he's been here.

1357
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:58,640
Cal takes a big like stress bite out of his lasagna.

1358
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:07,840
What's up everybody?

1359
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:08,800
I'm Zach.

1360
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:10,400
And I hope you're enjoying season two

1361
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,400
of Pretending to Be People so far.

1362
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,000
We're having a ton of fun.

1363
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,120
And that fun isn't going to stop,

1364
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:18,640
but it is gonna slow down a bit.

1365
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:20,600
Putting the show out mostly weekly

1366
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:24,000
for almost three years now has been my pleasure.

1367
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,520
And I'm tired.

1368
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:29,840
It's been affecting my mood for the past month or six,

1369
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:31,040
which sucks.

1370
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:35,600
And I want this show to continue to be a pleasure to create.

1371
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:38,040
And I don't want the quality of the show to suffer.

1372
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:39,440
So in order for that to happen,

1373
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:40,640
we're going to move

1374
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:43,240
to an every other Friday release schedule.

1375
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:46,320
Now the goal is to get back to weekly episodes.

1376
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:49,520
So I've reached out to someone who can help lighten my load

1377
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:50,800
on the editing side of things

1378
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:52,760
by cleaning up the tracks of debris

1379
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:54,400
before I finish them off.

1380
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:57,120
But that process will take time to smooth out

1381
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:58,960
and it will expedite the process,

1382
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:00,400
but it'll still take time and money.

1383
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:04,200
So with our eyes set on getting back to weekly,

1384
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:07,600
we've got two new Patreon goals.

1385
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:10,920
The first is at $5,785,

1386
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:15,720
which is of course $69,420 over the year.

1387
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:16,760
At this first goal,

1388
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:18,520
pretending to be people will move

1389
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:20,440
from every other Friday releases

1390
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:22,440
to three episodes per month,

1391
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:26,720
dropped on the first, 11th, and 21st.

1392
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:30,200
The Patreon goal to go back to weekly releases

1393
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:35,200
is set at, you guessed it, $6,942 per month.

1394
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:38,640
And when we hit the PTBP radio frequency,

1395
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:40,240
we'll be once again swaddled

1396
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:43,960
in Wolf's warm and weekly embrace.

1397
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:45,160
But with the sad news,

1398
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:48,600
I also bring three fun announcements.

1399
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:51,640
First, we recently recorded another side story

1400
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:52,560
for season two,

1401
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:57,320
and we had another mind-blowingly talented guest.

1402
00:57:57,320 --> 00:58:01,320
Becca Scott joined us for a four episode

1403
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:04,000
modern Delta Green operation set in the city.

1404
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,160
She was fantastic.

1405
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:08,040
We were fantastic.

1406
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:10,600
I'm seriously, I'm so excited for y'all to hear it.

1407
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:12,200
It's nasty.

1408
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:16,480
Second, the Den of Sin will be live on Tuesday, October 25th

1409
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:19,760
for a very special Halloween episode.

1410
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:22,880
We'll be following Clark Bishop, John Lee Pettymore III,

1411
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:27,520
and Keith Vigna as kids at Clinkers Daycare

1412
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:29,760
as they go trick or treating in contention

1413
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:32,040
on what could not so canonically

1414
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:34,640
be their last Halloween ever.

1415
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:37,680
And the edited podcast episode of that game

1416
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:41,160
will be out before the November Den of Sin,

1417
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:44,080
which is the third and final cool thing.

1418
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:46,520
And November Thomas is going to kick off

1419
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:51,520
his Oops All Pettymore's Patreon campaign

1420
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:54,440
with a Pettymore family Thanksgiving.

1421
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:58,040
Joe, Luke, and I will all be playing members of the fam

1422
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:02,760
for the run, and we are really fucking excited about it.

1423
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:08,800
Okay, seriously, thank you so much for listening.

1424
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:11,880
This is a wildly cool thing to be a part of,

1425
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:14,080
and I really hope it continues to be fun,

1426
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:16,920
and rad, and sick, and twisted, because I like it.

1427
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:19,920
["My Life Is Great"]

1428
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:22,920
["My Life Is Great"]

1429
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:41,480
But it is a little gummy, you know?

1430
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:42,960
If you wadded it up, it'd be...

1431
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:44,960
No, it's a very long gummy.

1432
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:45,800
But it's thin.

1433
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:47,880
You can only fold a fruit by the foot

1434
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:49,840
on itself eight times before.

1435
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:51,480
Oh my God, is that true?

1436
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:52,320
Yeah.

1437
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:53,160
I think it needs a square, right?

1438
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:54,000
Yeah, any loser.

1439
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:56,880
Make them fold eight times.

1440
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:01,840
If you fold a fucking nerd.

1441
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:05,480
And I say, hey, do you want to see how much I can bend you?

1442
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:07,320
Did it just lightning?

1443
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:08,240
Shut up, nerd.
