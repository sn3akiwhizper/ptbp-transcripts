1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Good evening to all of those who join me in this dimension we call home.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,700
It is I, Wolf the Dog, DJ Extraordinaire and also Enjoyer of Slop.

3
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:18,900
And I'm here to sling some sound directly to your ear canals.

4
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:24,600
The radio station is called 694.2 PTBP.

5
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:29,400
The time is now and forever ago simultaneously.

6
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:34,300
And the best part of the show has arrived and it is starting.

7
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:40,800
Now, this here howlin' with Wolf is from Ben Feliciano in Denver, Colorado.

8
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,000
Who tweeted about the show and tagged at Pretending Pod.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,700
A thing you can do too if you wanna rule.

10
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,600
Like, rule, not rule.

11
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,700
You know, Ben Feliciano rules.

12
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,100
And he writes,

13
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,500
Hey Pretendy Friendies.

14
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:01,400
I'd like to howl at my bandmates in Younger than Neil.

15
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:10,100
Listening to and talking about RPG podcasts is one of the many ways we pass the time at rehearsal or in the tour van.

16
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:14,000
Besides trying to guess who farted by scent alone.

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,500
We're no kudzu with no backbone but we do like making ska punk.

18
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,500
A genre more dead than half the townspeople of the first season.

19
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,600
And PTBP.

20
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,800
If it's not too much to ask.

21
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:33,100
On May 5th through the 27th of 2023.

22
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:42,300
I'd love to meet any fellow Denver fans at the opening of my first solo art exhibit at Memento Mori Art Gallery.

23
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:46,700
I'll be there on opening night and periodically throughout the month.

24
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:51,600
Visit BenFeliciano.art for more details.

25
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,500
Woof the dog.

26
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00,500
Praying for you but more importantly to you.

27
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,400
Do you hear me, wolf?

28
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,100
Do you smell the blood on your altar?

29
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,100
P.S. Should I try different candles?

30
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,900
Maybe you're not a fan of lavendar.

31
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,800
Thank you dearest Ben.

32
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,600
And I do hear you.

33
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,400
I do smell you.

34
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,700
And I do see you at all times.

35
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,600
You're my favorite Ben so far.

36
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:27,600
Even if you use the worst scented candle of all time.

37
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:32,100
You make music, you make art, and you love little old me.

38
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:35,100
And what's not to love about all of that?

39
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,400
Remember y'all.

40
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:42,100
Go to old Ben's art show if you can and tell everyone there that wolf sent you.

41
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:45,400
If you want to write up something for your wolf to how.

42
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,100
Tag at PretendingPod on the internet.

43
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,400
Fuck Al Gore.

44
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:55,400
Or write up a five star review on the podcast app of your choice and make me aware of it.

45
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,300
Oh, hey, you.

46
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,600
Yeah, you.

47
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,000
You seem cool.

48
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,100
So I'll let you in on a little secret.

49
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:11,200
You can help support this show and make sure it keeps happening by exchanging five US dollars

50
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:17,500
for shitloads of bonus content over at Patreon.com slash PretendingPod.

51
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,100
There's other cool shit on the internet, too.

52
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:24,500
And for a fair amount of it, the links are in the show notes.

53
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:31,000
Lose your muse and choose to refuse an excuse to those whose blues cruise through the...

54
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,900
What's that?

55
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,200
No news?

56
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,700
Are you for real?

57
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:35,400
Ugh.

58
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:42,800
My producer is telling me the boys, almost all of whom are in their early thirties now,

59
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,000
except Luke who is seventeen years old.

60
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,200
I guess these dude kids do a fine job of reminding themselves where they were before

61
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,600
things really get going.

62
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,500
Welcome back, y'all.

63
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,800
And get ready for the world to unfurl.

64
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:06,500
It's Alter Girl with My Life is Great and it's All My Fall.

65
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:15,500
My life is great and it's all my fault.

66
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:26,000
Cause my life is great and it's all my fault.

67
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:33,500
Cause my life is great and it's all my fault.

68
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:46,600
I always get the, those like panda cookie things, you know what I'm talking about?

69
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,600
They're like, I don't know, regular kind of cookie on the outside and then filled with

70
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:54,100
panda with like chocolate and they're shaped like pandas.

71
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,100
Whoa.

72
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,100
That sounds good.

73
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,600
They're super good, but they're always out of them.

74
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,300
And so now I learned, if you ask, the lady will go in the back for you.

75
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,400
What kind of cookie is the outer cookie?

76
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,100
I will load it up and show you.

77
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,700
That works in a lot of stores if they have it.

78
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:14,000
Yeah, but I like never thought to do it cause I like, I would always like peek in the back

79
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
to see what was back there.

80
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,500
And it's just like people that like look at you, like don't look back here.

81
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,500
Like okay, I won't.

82
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:26,600
I also picked up a sea salt flavored soda and it was really good.

83
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,600
I know.

84
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,600
They're called Hello Panda.

85
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,600
Wait, I guess soda water.

86
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:37,800
It's like, yeah, just like, I don't like cracker cookie kind of thing on the outside.

87
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,800
Okay.

88
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,800
Yeah.

89
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,800
Yeah.

90
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,800
It's not what you think.

91
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,800
It's not salty flavored, but it's like sea salt because it's like sea salt ice cream.

92
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,600
So it's kind of a creamy soda.

93
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,840
It was really good.

94
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,840
Is it a little salty?

95
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,840
I'm sorry.

96
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,000
Is it like sea salt ice cream or is it called sea salt ice cream?

97
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,860
No, it's called sea salt soda.

98
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:54,860
Is it a little?

99
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:57,000
So it's like a cream soda with a little salt.

100
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Yeah.

101
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,600
There wasn't a whole lot of saltiness to it, if any.

102
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,400
Like I think it was just what the flavor profile was closest to.

103
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,680
You thought disappointed Thomas and I are?

104
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,680
I was too.

105
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,680
Except that it was really good.

106
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,680
Yeah.

107
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,680
Yeah.

108
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,680
We're like, Joe, why didn't it suck?

109
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,680
Hey Joe, what's your problem?

110
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,680
Why aren't you talking shit on the thing you liked?

111
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,680
I always get the mango milk tea things.

112
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,680
Ooh.

113
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,680
That sounds good.

114
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,680
Yeah.

115
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,680
Whereas sea salt soda is almost inherently misleading.

116
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,680
Yeah.

117
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,360
Yeah.

118
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,360
It sounds like a fucking prank.

119
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,360
It's not your fault, Joe.

120
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,360
Yeah, it does.

121
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:38,160
Welcome to episode 26 of season two of pretending to be people.

122
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,580
We are back at it after a fair amount of time away.

123
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,480
We were off in holy cow farmland.

124
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,480
That's right.

125
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,480
Yeah.

126
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,480
It's shit.

127
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,480
And for like four episodes.

128
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,480
And before that we left you on a proverbial cliff.

129
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,480
What?

130
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,480
What?

131
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,480
Who's that?

132
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,480
Who's here?

133
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,480
Who is it?

134
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,480
Who is here?

135
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,480
Who is she?

136
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,480
I don't even know.

137
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,480
Say the Borat thing, Zach.

138
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,480
Oh, I think we're live streaming.

139
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,480
No.

140
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,480
Nope.

141
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,480
Nope.

142
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,480
Nope.

143
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,480
Nope.

144
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,480
Just recording.

145
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,480
It's your friendly neighborhood Taylor.

146
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,480
Tell us a joke or a fact.

147
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,480
Oh, whoa.

148
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,480
See you, Taylor.

149
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,480
Wow.

150
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,480
What a weird fact that she said.

151
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,480
She left a dust cloud like Taylor shaped.

152
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,480
Yeah.

153
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,480
She just zoomed away.

154
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:20,120
And a Taylor shaped hole in the door.

155
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,120
And my heart.

156
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,840
All the way through the house.

157
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,840
Aw.

158
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,840
Oh, wait.

159
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,840
Did you get that looked at?

160
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,280
It hurts.

161
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,160
That's way, Taylor is way bigger than just your heart.

162
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,800
A lot of you has a hole through it right now.

163
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,680
I think we're about the same size.

164
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,840
I can see the plug, like the plug that shot out and hit the wall.

165
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,840
In her shape.

166
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,840
You're all crust.

167
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,640
We could try to just squish it back together like a puzzle piece.

168
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:51,160
That reminds me of a scene in Kung Pao Enter the Fist where he punches a guy's stomach

169
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,160
out.

170
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,160
And he's like, what?

171
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,160
And then he's like, okay, you can pass.

172
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,880
I was thinking of the scene in the first episode of The Boys.

173
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,880
Oh, yeah.

174
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,880
Shit.

175
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,720
There's not much rippable there.

176
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,680
I was just picturing just the outline of Luke.

177
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,880
Oh, that's why you said just the crust.

178
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,880
Just the crust.

179
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,880
Like a cookie cutter.

180
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,880
Yeah.

181
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,880
I missed it and I thought you were saying that I was made out of crust or something.

182
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:18,560
I thought it was more like it had already scabbed over and I was like, weird take.

183
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,880
Weather or earth or pizza.

184
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,880
Just the Luke crust.

185
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,440
Just the Luke crust.

186
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,720
And like dong.

187
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,120
I think that's a realistic interpretation if they like stood like Michelangelo style

188
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,960
and like he blasted Taylor through it.

189
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,960
Yeah.

190
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,960
Yep.

191
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,960
The Vitruvian.

192
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,960
Luke.

193
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,960
Man.

194
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,960
What would be a pizza?

195
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,240
Like a Vitruvian.

196
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,240
The Vitruvian.

197
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,760
Last we left off, the can crew was out of sorts.

198
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,760
Yeah.

199
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,760
Yeah.

200
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:48,480
Y'all done did a dang thing that people say that you're not supposed to do, but something

201
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,800
that we here at Pretending to Be People really enjoyed it.

202
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,800
We're fond of it.

203
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,800
Yeah.

204
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,800
If you split up.

205
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,800
Split the crew, baby.

206
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,440
You can solve more of the mystery.

207
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,000
That's exactly right.

208
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,240
For the Discord, spoiler chat, not for us who don't get to listen to those parts for

209
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,760
like potentially a year and a half.

210
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,200
There's still a lot of the first season that I haven't heard.

211
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,200
Same.

212
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:18,880
I went back through it for a lot of the Pennymore arc and respected a lot of choices more that

213
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,920
other people had made because I understood them.

214
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,920
Yeah.

215
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,240
We had some cliffhangers there.

216
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,600
Julius was off on his own.

217
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,600
I said sayonara.

218
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,600
Peace.

219
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,600
Bye bye.

220
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,600
We said deuces.

221
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,600
Goodbye.

222
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,600
Top notch.

223
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,700
Top gun.

224
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:38,020
I'm really happy with all the decisions that were made and what we're about to get into,

225
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,600
which we've already recorded.

226
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,600
Spoilers.

227
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,760
I was going to say, who are you starting with?

228
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,800
A little behind the scenes here.

229
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,960
I think we're going to start with Luke, which we recorded a couple of days ago.

230
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,960
It was good.

231
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:55,000
So we'll all not be in the room then and then.

232
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Okay.

233
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,360
Well, should I leave the room for you to record them then?

234
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,760
I'll leave the room now.

235
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:09,120
Actually, yeah, that is what we need is a moment maybe as players together to talk about

236
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,120
this.

237
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,960
I'm not sure you guys are allowed to talk about that right now.

238
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,960
I think we got to.

239
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,960
You're the DM.

240
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,960
You can.

241
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:19,880
We have to reconvene.

242
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,520
You know the difference between an alligator and a crocodile?

243
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,520
No.

244
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:27,480
You'll see one later and you'll see the other after a while.

245
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:32,400
Speaking of which, we'll see you guys later while we cut to Julius.

246
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,400
After crocodile wild.

247
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:40,560
Alligator later.

248
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,080
Maybe they've made a box around me with their space time bending powers.

249
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,680
They have a certain eldritch hate fuck factor about that.

250
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:53,880
Also Mr. Mime undoubtedly, canonically fucked Ash's mom and is his father.

251
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,640
That's some big dick energy.

252
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,640
Is that real?

253
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,640
Okay.

254
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:05,160
Last Google is Mr. Mime Ash's dad.

255
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:11,420
Ever since Ash caught him in It's Mr. Mime Time, Mr. Mime AKA Mime as he's been nicknamed

256
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:14,080
has been living with his mother in Pallet Town.

257
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,080
Wow.

258
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,400
So he's like a stepdad.

259
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,720
It's Mr. Mime Time, huh?

260
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,280
Well, I'll be beating off to that later.

261
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,400
That was enlightening.

262
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,400
And now...

263
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,400
You ready to get into it?

264
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,400
Let's do it.

265
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,760
There have been Luke Luke.

266
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,440
Hey, I'm here with Luke.

267
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,440
I'm here.

268
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,440
I'm Luke.

269
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,440
Is Thomas here?

270
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,440
Nope.

271
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,440
Is Joe here?

272
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,440
Not a chance.

273
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,440
Is Justin here?

274
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,440
Um...

275
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,440
Oh, he is.

276
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,440
He's hiding in the closet.

277
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,440
That's right.

278
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,440
Play with your keyboard.

279
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,120
Man, let's get those tones.

280
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,120
Do what?

281
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,840
Oh, he said he's beating off to Mr. Mime.

282
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:53,040
Okay, yeah, just be quiet.

283
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,240
Just play the music again.

284
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,520
There have been some gaps in this story.

285
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:05,240
Strangely, at our table, we've always accounted for each character's time with a completionist's

286
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,240
mindset.

287
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:13,600
But there's a very specific gap that I think that we should address, and that is what did

288
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:20,400
Julius Summers get up to the night of June 18th.

289
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:31,280
Let's go back now to that wild night at the foundry, as a sweaty, writhing mass of interns

290
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:37,120
drool chant and breathe all out of their slack-jawed maws.

291
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:51,600
And the screen, once again, fades to black with the sound of shots, being slurped greedily

292
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,600
from the now saliva-covered, bare stomach of Julius Summers.

293
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:03,920
But this time, instead of cutting to the next day, let's take a look at later that night,

294
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,440
as Julius exits.

295
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:09,120
Well, I guess I should just ask you, Luke.

296
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,160
What's up, man?

297
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,960
How does Julius Summers exit the foundry that evening?

298
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,400
Amongst the excitement, Julius decides to dip.

299
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,480
One of the interns rips their shirt and throws it on the ground.

300
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:29,760
Julius grabs that and cleans his stomach up a little bit, wipes some of the liquor and

301
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,400
drool and other fluids off.

302
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:39,680
And you hear the interns are like, basically, it's like ramping back up as another new

303
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:48,320
initiate into the news conglomerates, foundry regulars here in the city, hops onto the bar

304
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,040
and takes your previous position.

305
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,440
Julius stumbles out the front door of the foundry, looks around.

306
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:56,800
He's alone.

307
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,480
It's late.

308
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,680
The sun's down.

309
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,880
It's not quite up yet.

310
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,720
And he just starts walking down the road.

311
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,240
He gets just out of eyesight of the foundry.

312
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:13,600
He stands up completely straight, looks his head over to the right, opens his mouth and

313
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,720
just vomits.

314
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:21,760
But not like his body is telling him to, but like he's telling his body to.

315
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,080
Yes.

316
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:30,480
He throws up, starts walking, not stumbling at all, completely above the influence.

317
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,400
It's a text alert.

318
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,080
He pulls his phone out and looks.

319
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:40,480
It's a text from a number that's like 62266 or something like that.

320
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,880
And it says, it's Bernie.

321
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,560
Yeah, exactly.

322
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,280
It's one of those.

323
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:53,040
It's like, looks like an automated text, but it just says Z, like a lowercase Z.

324
00:14:54,080 --> 00:15:00,560
Julius looks at it, understands, puts his phone back in his pocket and

325
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,000
starts to jog.

326
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:08,960
When he gets to the main road, he pulls his phone out and calls a car.

327
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,520
Where does this car end up?

328
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:17,760
Well, the driverless car with the giant camera on top pulls up.

329
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,960
He gets in the back.

330
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,680
What is that?

331
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,440
It's like a self-driving car.

332
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:21,680
Oh.

333
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,800
You know, like the ones with the giant camera.

334
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,840
It's like a prototype.

335
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,920
They're running in the city.

336
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,960
That sounds cool.

337
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,680
He gets in that cause he doesn't want anyone to know.

338
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,040
No, of course not.

339
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:38,240
The car drives for a little while and eventually he sees off in the distance

340
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:48,160
a very tall space needle shaped tower with a flashing light at the top.

341
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:48,400
Yeah.

342
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:58,080
Not quite fully a space needle height, but a poor attempt at the monument up there in

343
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,080
Seattle here in the city.

344
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:10,240
And as you drive up, the car stops in the parking lot where there is shit pouring down.

345
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,120
There is a slight uneven level to this parking lot.

346
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:25,840
There's one other car in this lot and it is a slick, sleek, chic, clean, black, matte

347
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,960
Jaguar XE is the only other car.

348
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,040
Who the fuck mows their lawn at a reasonable time of day?

349
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,560
At 4.30 in the morning when we're recording this.

350
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,240
Oh, that's fun.

351
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,680
We've never dealt with that before.

352
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,280
It's weird.

353
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,040
Should we 30 seconds of silence just engage?

354
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,080
I think so, yeah.

355
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,440
Okay.

356
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:49,840
All right.

357
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,080
We'll see if that works.

358
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:59,040
It's the only other car in the lot and your driverless car has now parked.

359
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:04,400
Julius gets out of his car, looks over at the Jaguar, looks up at the zeitgeist.

360
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,200
I hope the elevator is broken.

361
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:14,000
And he starts heading towards the zeitgeist and he's going to run up those stairs because

362
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,400
he knows he's going to meet somebody at the very tippy top.

363
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,920
At the very tippy top.

364
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:26,080
And as you approach, we see the lovely ground all around this area.

365
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:26,640
It's lovely.

366
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,840
Oh, it's so lovely.

367
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,400
Untouched even, unbroken.

368
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,160
Man, there's no holes around here.

369
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:38,320
As if really no one's hung out around here, at least in a digging capacity.

370
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:45,920
And you walk into a jar door at the bottom of the zeitgeist.

371
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,200
Do you even check if the elevator is down?

372
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:49,760
No.

373
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,520
He's getting the leg workout in.

374
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,000
And he goes up how many flights of stairs?

375
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,200
What a rude question.

376
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,440
Okay, you kept that.

377
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,480
I think it was like eight.

378
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:05,440
He starts running up countless flights of stairs.

379
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,040
So many.

380
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,400
Less than 10 probably.

381
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,680
And once he gets, there's like one more flight of stairs.

382
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:16,160
He finally maybe starts feeling a little something in his legs,

383
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,000
but he's a little disappointed with such a meager workout.

384
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,040
I mean, are your thighs like, do you have a chafe issue with these big boys?

385
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:30,800
No, the pants that he's wearing, all his pants that he owns are specifically tailored.

386
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,760
Reinforced.

387
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,240
Right.

388
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,440
To not chafe his legs because he's going to be working out.

389
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:44,080
Whether it's in athletic gear or a suit, there's a high probability he'll be getting leg day in.

390
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,440
And you open up the door into the top of the zeitgeist,

391
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:52,720
this old and decrepit room in a large circle.

392
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:59,840
You kind of see around the rounded corner of this kind of internal bar and the windows,

393
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,840
some of which are no longer there around the outside.

394
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:08,880
And standing and kind of up against where there was a window once.

395
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:15,040
You see a woman familiar to you wearing a black suit, white shirt, black sunglasses.

396
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:22,640
And a tattoo runs out of her sleeve and down her hand.

397
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,920
It's like a scaly tail that reaches down and around.

398
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,840
She turns holding a package in her hand that's closest toward you.

399
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,320
Mr. Summers, you made it very quickly.

400
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:44,480
Yeah, I was on my way out of initiation or whatever you want to call it.

401
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,840
With the crew, how is that going?

402
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,520
Exceedingly well.

403
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:50,720
Good.

404
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,000
I'm learning a lot about TV stuff.

405
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:04,160
Well, as long as that TV stuff continues to carry the weight of what you texted me about earlier,

406
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,480
the Godel farm.

407
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:11,360
And I mean, do you think there's anything going on with this Kaylee Silver woman?

408
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,400
They're trying to play it off.

409
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:17,280
Like, you know, maybe she snapped or something, but there's something more to it.

410
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,560
We'll get something soon.

411
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,680
I can feel it.

412
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,960
It's only been a day.

413
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:27,200
I mean, I did see some farm wrestling, but other than that, nothing too crazy.

414
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,160
She looks at you with a wry smile and is like,

415
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:36,160
well, I just want you to remember that with the pressure that we're putting on the Godel company,

416
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:41,680
we're going to likely have to deal with some Godel-owned pigs here in the city.

417
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:47,680
And for each one that, I don't know, let's say doesn't have a job anymore,

418
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,160
it's going to earn you quite the promotion.

419
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,320
Let's race through the ranks.

420
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,120
She smiles.

421
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,560
What's in the package?

422
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,800
Don't worry about what's in it.

423
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,760
Needs to be delivered.

424
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,400
7251 West Shift Street.

425
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:05,600
In exchange, you'll receive a package as well.

426
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,120
We'll be in contact when I need to retrieve it.

427
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,480
Sounds good.

428
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,040
Do you want me to leave first or?

429
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,920
No, it'll take too long getting down the stairs.

430
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,400
Let me go.

431
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:22,480
And with that, Julia Summers bounds down the stairs,

432
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:28,640
back out of the zeitgeist through the bit of woods down to the parking lot

433
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,240
where the driverless car is waiting.

434
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:37,520
He goes into the app and sends the car home and he's getting a run in.

435
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,040
You pull up 7251 West Shift Street.

436
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:44,560
It's like, how far would you be willing to run right now?

437
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:51,440
When he pulls it up the walking direction, say two hours and 17 minutes,

438
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,840
45 minutes.

439
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,400
Yep.

440
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,360
A bit out of breath.

441
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,920
It's been a long fucking day.

442
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,960
It's late.

443
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,400
He's feeling like maybe a beer made it into him.

444
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,160
And you come across this old, old house.

445
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:15,440
It's seemingly like built by someone with a specific image in mind

446
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,760
of what they wanted their home to look like.

447
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,920
It's not like any of the other older homes in the area.

448
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,920
A lot of ranch style houses around here.

449
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,800
And this one is kind of a mix between that older look

450
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,280
with almost like a modern architecture to it.

451
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:35,840
The yard is absolutely filled with all sorts of oddities.

452
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:43,520
Massive sculptures of birds of prey and reptiles.

453
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,960
Other seemingly decorative objects.

454
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:56,080
All of which look extremely old and handpicked.

455
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,040
Julius doesn't really care.

456
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:04,960
He's there to give and get and then get out.

457
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,480
Where do you go?

458
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,280
Up to the front door.

459
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,320
Knock on the door, knock on the door.

460
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,120
Your mailman just walked up.

461
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,320
That's good timing.

462
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,520
Let's get him.

463
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,680
Do you want to be a guest?

464
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,880
That's a scary question.

465
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,040
Be my guest.

466
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:35,920
You can, uh, you know, put our, put our service to the test.

467
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,760
We can check him before we wreck him.

468
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,760
Julius thinks and then laughs.

469
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,600
David Spade.

470
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:47,840
Who is it?

471
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,800
I've got a package.

472
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:57,120
The door opens and you see a man with a short beard, flannel shirt,

473
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,120
cargo pants, rugged boots.

474
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:03,360
He's got just like stained with dirt all over his shirt,

475
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:09,280
all over his hands wearing a bit of like a gray brown cowboy hat.

476
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,480
Just a bit of one apparently.

477
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,120
He's wearing a faded gray brown cowboy hat.

478
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,640
And you see behind him in the entryway,

479
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:21,280
there is a shovel leaning up against the wall within view

480
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:25,760
that is glinting in the morning light shining in through the door.

481
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,720
He quickly takes the package from you.

482
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,800
Julius grabs it away.

483
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,840
You first.

484
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,960
Oh yes, of course.

485
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:37,280
My, uh, my deepest, uh, sincerest apologies.

486
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,640
Let me grab that for you.

487
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,800
And he closes the door.

488
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,880
You hear a bit of a rummage.

489
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,320
He rummages to completion.

490
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,960
And then he comes back to the door, opens it up

491
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:56,240
and hands you a bag, a tote bag.

492
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,520
Julius grabs the bag, hands over the package

493
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,400
and then kind of like gestures to the yard.

494
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,480
And it's like, so like, what's, uh, what's all that?

495
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,240
Oh, do you enjoy the pieces?

496
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,160
They're interesting.

497
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:10,720
Yes.

498
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:10,960
Yes.

499
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:16,800
I, uh, I, every single time I drive back or leave my home,

500
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:21,760
I get to look at them and be reminded of all the wonderful things.

501
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,560
He gets an off distance look.

502
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:32,560
He's gone in the, in the sunrise as he's off on my mini expeditions.

503
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:37,360
But Julius looks down at his watch and back up at this guy.

504
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,120
And he's still smiling.

505
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:43,520
He nods his head and, uh, is gonna head out.

506
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,840
Yes, have an excellent morning, sir.

507
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:51,120
Julius is going to walk away and, uh, he's going to look in the bag.

508
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,200
Oh, he looks in the bag?

509
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:53,440
Yeah.

510
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:58,160
Since if it was a package, he was going to not unwrap it, but it's in a bag.

511
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:58,960
He's going to look.

512
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,200
Yeah.

513
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,320
There's a piece of parchment.

514
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,480
He's going to read it.

515
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:13,120
Uh, it is this parchment that has a language on it that you've never seen before.

516
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:17,280
And do you have any skills?

517
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,400
I guess I need my character sheet.

518
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,040
Okay.

519
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,240
Do I have any skills?

520
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:26,640
I do.

521
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,200
What specifically?

522
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:38,000
I'm looking for a SIGINT or a specific language or archeology, history.

523
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:41,120
Julius has a 70 SIGINT.

524
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,680
Oh, oh, does he?

525
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,240
Interesting.

526
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:44,720
Okay.

527
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,480
Uh, and with this, uh, 70 SIGINT, let's roll baby.

528
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,400
61 on a 70.

529
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,800
61 on a 70.

530
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,520
It tells you two things.

531
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:06,880
One, this is a stone rubbing and two, you've never seen this language before, but you think

532
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,320
you might know someone who can help you out with it.

533
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,640
Julius makes a note of it.

534
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:21,280
In fact, he takes a picture of it on his phone, puts it back in the bag, kind of how it was.

535
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:26,320
And then, um, Julius is going to jog home.

536
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:32,000
He can leave it on the kitchen counter for his handler, who is his roommate.

537
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,000
Let's go now to July 6th.

538
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,200
Let's pick up exactly where we were with Julius Summers.

539
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:52,800
As you walked up through the hall, the Cannes studio, you hear Tife whistling.

540
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:05,280
You open up the door and you see your uncle Tife Raylan standing behind his desk.

541
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:10,800
And you see two other people sitting at chairs on either side, closer to you.

542
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,200
Both kind of turned back looking at you.

543
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:19,040
You see cops, one tall kind of spindly, one short ball jacked.

544
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,720
And they all look at you.

545
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,120
Julius fucking my baby boy.

546
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,160
What's up, Neff?

547
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,200
How's it going?

548
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,640
How you living?

549
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,400
Oh, forget about it.

550
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,320
Come hungry for you.

551
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,800
We got some stuff we need to take care of.

552
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,520
Where's your boys?

553
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,160
Where's Beck?

554
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:36,800
Where's Cal?

555
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,680
I'm the only one that's going to be here.

556
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,720
Why is that?

557
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,400
I thought I told you to bring the whole team down, baby.

558
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,600
They're not going to do what you want them to do.

559
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,160
And what is that that I want them to do?

560
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,000
Give up on the Godel company.

561
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:52,640
Give up?

562
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,320
Give up?

563
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,080
No, no, absolutely.

564
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,320
I would never give up on the Godel company.

565
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:04,480
And you see Officer Riley and Officer Wiley sitting in these chairs, smiling real big,

566
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,400
kind of laughing to themselves.

567
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:11,520
No, no, we are absolutely not giving up on the Godel company.

568
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:16,400
The Godel company is what's taking us into the future, baby boy.

569
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,200
Come on, Neff.

570
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:17,840
Come on.

571
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,400
Let's go.

572
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,240
Let's go.

573
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,920
It's promotion time.

574
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:25,920
Now, you have some videos on your phone, I believe, Julius.

575
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,640
Photos, videos, stuff like that.

576
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,280
Yeah.

577
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,400
Let's see that phone.

578
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:36,080
Before I show you any of this, I, you know, I have some demands.

579
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,440
Okay.

580
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:37,840
Okay.

581
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,400
Calm down.

582
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:42,960
Demands of one thing, requests or another for our new promotion man.

583
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,000
Okay.

584
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:51,760
Well, and Julius reaches into his pocket and pulls out a list that is written on a napkin

585
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,360
from where are we?

586
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,080
We're at the kids bar.

587
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,760
I need a personal assistant.

588
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:08,400
And I want a fully catered breakfast buffet every day from the day goal for the whole

589
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:08,800
staff.

590
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,480
Interesting.

591
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:10,880
Wow.

592
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,840
That's a weird one.

593
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,200
I'm not done.

594
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,880
I want your, I want your private executive bathroom.

595
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:21,120
Oh, come in, come in.

596
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:26,640
And I want you to pay for it to get remodeled by the team at Bedeagle.

597
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:31,120
I want full control of what gets played on can.

598
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:32,960
Wow.

599
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,840
That's a big one.

600
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,560
I want Cal to be the lead anchor.

601
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:36,880
Okay.

602
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,800
That's kind of doable more so.

603
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:44,240
I want Beck to get any equipment or really anything that he asked for.

604
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,640
Yeah, to a certain monetary amount.

605
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,200
Sure.

606
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,480
I want the title of executive producer.

607
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:50,880
Okay.

608
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:55,600
I want a free pass from all the cops.

609
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:04,000
Um, the, the, the short jacked one immediately stands up with like almost bald fists and

610
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,520
is like, um, uh, sorry, sorry.

611
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:10,720
Um, what did you just say?

612
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,880
I don't want to get pulled over for speeding.

613
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,080
Oh, okay.

614
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,840
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

615
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,160
Um, no speeding is fine.

616
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:20,960
Fine, fine.

617
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:21,440
Sure.

618
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,040
But what did you call us just then?

619
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,040
Was it cops, right?

620
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,680
I said the cops, city PD.

621
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,400
Julia starts to sweat a little bit.

622
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:38,400
He slowly kind of sits back down and says, uh, yeah, that's what I fucking thought.

623
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,600
Uh, I, I want hush money.

624
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,840
I want them to pay me not to show this.

625
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:48,960
How much, how much do they pay you money?

626
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,080
No, no, no.

627
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,760
I'm not in it for the money, dude.

628
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,480
Come on, man.

629
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,760
This is, this is the future.

630
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,320
Julius.

631
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,400
We're talking about a whole new world, man.

632
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,560
We're talking about a million dollars.

633
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,680
I mean a bonus, a signing bonus.

634
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,960
Is that what we'll talk about it later?

635
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,560
We'll get the details down later.

636
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,280
Now, listen, this is important.

637
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,320
This is an important one.

638
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:14,160
I want a Tony little's gazelle freestyle glider home fitness exercise machine with the workout

639
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,080
DVD in my office.

640
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,400
Is that like hard to find?

641
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:18,880
I don't know.

642
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:23,200
I remembered it and it's good for your thighs.

643
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:25,600
Okay.

644
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,320
I'm almost done.

645
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:33,280
I want to travel and fitness show that runs after the five o'clock news.

646
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,200
And I want to call it summer's vacation.

647
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:42,080
He laughs like I just laughed at that one and is like, that actually sounds like a great

648
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,440
pitch and we can at least.

649
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:43,840
Yay.

650
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,520
We can talk about that for sure.

651
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:45,920
Okay.

652
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,960
And then this one, I will not concede on this one.

653
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:54,880
I want the marbles re-installed in the walkway of the entrance and he pulls out a marble

654
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,160
from his little pocket.

655
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:56,640
Of course.

656
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,040
Yeah.

657
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:01,600
And he flicks it over towards one of the gobs.

658
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:06,160
The tall spindly one kind of catches it as he's reaching out to catch it.

659
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,560
Julius pulls out two pistols.

660
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,120
Oh my God.

661
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,120
Oh my God.

662
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,560
And shoots at both of the gobs.

663
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,280
Oh my God.

664
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:15,840
Okay.

665
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,320
Shit.

666
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:16,640
Fuck.

667
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:21,120
What's your, what's your, uh, what's your dexterity?

668
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,880
My dexterity is 75.

669
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,440
Okay.

670
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:23,920
Yes.

671
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,000
You also caught him by surprise.

672
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:32,560
So you get to go first and that is after your surprise round.

673
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:36,560
So let's start with a deeply surprising round.

674
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,720
That's a five, that's a five.

675
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,240
Okay.

676
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:46,720
All right.

677
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,200
Roll a d10 for each of the shots.

678
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:50,800
Gets these two dudes.

679
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,800
A two and a 10.

680
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,880
A two and a 10.

681
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,600
Okay.

682
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,160
You flick this marble in the air.

683
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:04,080
Wilson Wiley, the tall spindly cop reaches up to grab it and you fire directly through

684
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:07,920
his hand with one of your shots as the other one.

685
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:14,560
Hits the marble, which embeds itself directly between the other guy's eyes.

686
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,040
Yup.

687
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,640
And he has to roll constitution.

688
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:24,880
He does stay conscious, uh, but he's lying flat on the ground at this point.

689
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:33,360
Blood is like spraying out around where the marble has embedded itself and type is freaking

690
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,280
the absolute fuck out.

691
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:44,080
But Wilson Wiley immediately dives for cover behind the desk with Tife and flips it on

692
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:44,640
its side.

693
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:53,920
Tife's enormous solid wooden desk is now in between you and Wilson Wiley, the tall spindly

694
00:34:53,920 --> 00:35:01,440
cop and Tife Rayland, your uncle, while Richard Riley lays on the floor.

695
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,680
Tife yells out to you with his turn.

696
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,920
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

697
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,520
Come on, Julius.

698
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,200
What the fuck?

699
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,840
I ain't going back to Barstow.

700
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:16,800
And with that, it's Richard Riley's turn and on the ground.

701
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,240
He moans back up to the top of the order.

702
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,280
It's your turn.

703
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,920
Tife, if you're not armed, you better not arm yourself.

704
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,280
This is not over.

705
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,920
And then he starts running towards the desk towards Wilson.

706
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,520
And he wants to, in his mind, he's going to hop the desk, catch Wilson's head between

707
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:41,040
his legs, spin, and then land on the ground with his gun aimed at Tife.

708
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:41,600
Okay.

709
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:47,440
You were super close, so this is just going to be a melee attack, but I need you to roll

710
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:51,520
an athletics first to successfully dive over the desk.

711
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,020
Uh-oh.

712
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,160
I rolled a 90.

713
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:00,960
90 is not going to do it.

714
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:07,680
So as you're running up, Wilson Wiley just kind of stands at the last possible moment,

715
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,600
throws his hands up as kind of a block.

716
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,640
His hands are the only thing up above.

717
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:18,640
And so they're kind of grabbing on either side of the inner thighs and just kind of

718
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,160
like holds you right there.

719
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:24,240
And you're like sitting on top of the desk at this point in time.

720
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:28,640
And the two of you are grappling each other, essentially at this point.

721
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,920
And it's Tife's turn.

722
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:33,680
You can now see him as you're looking down directly at him.

723
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:38,800
And he just kind of sits back and he's like, I don't have a fucking gun, Julius.

724
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,480
What the fuck, man?

725
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,280
I'm not going to-

726
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,080
Good.

727
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,440
Yeah, duh.

728
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,920
And it's Richard Riley's turn.

729
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:52,960
You hear just kind of this like, ugh, and he's slowly getting himself off the ground

730
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:58,240
behind you, but that's going to take his entire turn to just kind of like right himself at

731
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:58,880
this point.

732
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,240
And it's back to you.

733
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:07,360
So Julius is sitting on the overturned desk with Wilson's hands basically clenched between

734
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,240
his legs.

735
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:08,740
Yeah.

736
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,920
He's going to shoot Wilson right in the face.

737
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,640
Jesus Christ.

738
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:20,960
Okay, so because you're within distance of him, he's going to roll unarmed combat against

739
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:21,840
your firearms.

740
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,340
Okay.

741
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,440
I got a 19.

742
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,960
I failed with a 77.

743
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,080
Oh, so-

744
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,680
So how do you execute this man?

745
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:39,520
Julius is sitting on the overturned desk with Wilson's hands clenched between his thighs.

746
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:45,120
Julius spreads his legs, lets Wilson's hands free.

747
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,160
Julius is like, whoa, whoa, whoa.

748
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,480
And then just shoots him right between the eyes.

749
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:56,080
He's literally like fumbling for his gun and can't get it out of his holster.

750
00:37:56,080 --> 00:38:03,440
And as you're firing, he's like, and his gun goes off as well.

751
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:13,200
Typh is there with a bullet through his shin and he's like, whoa, no, what the-

752
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,040
Oh my God, he's dead.

753
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,080
Oh, he's fucking-

754
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,600
As he's throwing up, he's about to pass out.

755
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:22,240
And he's like, I'm about to pass out, man.

756
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:32,800
Yet he just continues to vomit as Richard Riley is finally standing, slowly looking

757
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:38,000
up with you just executing his partner.

758
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,720
That's probably good, right?

759
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:41,600
For him?

760
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,720
He fires at you.

761
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:52,480
And he puts a bullet right into your shoulder for three points of damage.

762
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,920
How many hit points do you have?

763
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,200
I was at six.

764
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:55,760
Oh, God.

765
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,360
So yeah, he is down to three hit points and it hurts.

766
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:09,040
With that, you need to roll a constitution check in order to stay conscious as you take

767
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:14,240
half of the hit points in damage that you currently have.

768
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:20,320
With a 24, you stay with it and it is your turn once again.

769
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,760
This dude behind you has just shot you through the shoulder.

770
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:29,200
There's a dead man in front of you and Typh is puking his brains out with a hole in his

771
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,480
shin to the left of you.

772
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,240
As soon as Julius gets shot.

773
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,840
God damn it.

774
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,240
I thought you're fucking dead.

775
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:42,480
You turn around and you see a dude with a marble deeply embedded, so deeply that if

776
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:49,520
you miniaturized yourself to the point to where each hair on an eyebrow was the same

777
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:55,120
height as you and then you walked across his forehead, you would have no trouble traversing

778
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:55,760
the terrain.

779
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:04,400
Julius looks at the guy who just shot him, looks over at his uncle.

780
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:05,840
Fuck.

781
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:14,240
And he walks up to Richard Riley and is going to just try to punch the marble into his brain.

782
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,360
Finish what he started.

783
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,760
Okay, so he's going to put up a fight here.

784
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,080
We're going unarmed combat against each other.

785
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,960
He succeeds with an ought six.

786
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:27,440
83.

787
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,040
Oh shit.

788
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:29,200
Okay.

789
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,480
With one arm.

790
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,040
I mean, he got shot through the left shoulder.

791
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:36,240
He rolls a two, so that's only one point of damage.

792
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:42,960
As you go to punch him, he just grabs your arm, kind of throws you back and throws a

793
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,800
left hook at you at the same time.

794
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:52,640
Your nose has recently been like completely obliterated and then healed by some sort of

795
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,440
wild tech.

796
00:40:54,240 --> 00:41:01,520
You immediately feel your nose kind of like bust back open as you go to two hit points.

797
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:06,880
You once again have to roll a constitution check to stay conscious as the world around

798
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:11,200
you vibrates and your stomach just nope.

799
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,480
The vibration is gone.

800
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:19,520
Your stomach feels like fucking steel and you've never, ever been more focused.

801
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,320
Crit success.

802
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:21,920
Your turn.

803
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,720
Let's go.

804
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:23,520
Julius shoots him.

805
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,320
He gets punched in the face.

806
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:33,920
No thoughts go through his mind other than this has to end and he just unloads his clip

807
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:34,960
into this guy.

808
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:35,360
Okay.

809
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,960
We're on against each other once again.

810
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,960
59, which is a pass.

811
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,960
26, which is a pass.

812
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:52,000
And as you both go for your guns at the exact same time, you kill him, your back is up

813
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:52,560
against the wall.

814
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,760
It's unceremonious.

815
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,560
You wanted to do the fun marble thing in your mind.

816
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:01,440
You're like still bummed that you didn't quite finish him off in that way, but you

817
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,360
know, you were about to fucking die.

818
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:03,860
Yeah.

819
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:07,280
Julius's vision is kind of tunneling in a little bit.

820
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,640
He's losing some blood.

821
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:16,960
His face is on fire from his re-broken nose and who knows probably facial bones as well.

822
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,200
Julius walks over to type.

823
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,840
Oh, what the fuck, Julius?

824
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,840
Julius, seriously, you can't.

825
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,920
We were onto something, Julius.

826
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,080
We were, we were onto something.

827
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:36,800
What you want and what I want.

828
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,440
I don't match up.

829
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:43,840
I have one more thing on my list of demands.

830
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,080
Whatever you want.

831
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:47,440
Whatever you want, Julius.

832
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,960
Whatever you want is yours.

833
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,320
Tell me I'm a real Raylan.

834
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,120
I'm a real Raylan?

835
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:55,120
No, you're not a fucking Raylan.

836
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:59,840
A Raylan wouldn't shoot anybody with his cold blood like this coming in my office shooting

837
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:00,240
cops.

838
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:01,840
What is it?

839
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:04,240
Why am I going to have to call the police?

840
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,080
Everything's fucked now, man.

841
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:06,960
Everything's fucked.

842
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,400
You fucking ruined everything.

843
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,000
You fucking ruined everything.

844
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:17,520
Julius holsters the gun that he emptied the clip on, pulls out the one that he still has

845
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:21,360
bullets in, puts it up against type's head.

846
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:22,400
Are you fucking serious?

847
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,560
Tell me I'm a real Julius.

848
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,600
Tell me I'm a Raylan.

849
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,360
Is that what this is about?

850
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:29,280
Tell me I'm a fucking Raylan.

851
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,760
You've lost your grip is what, Julius.

852
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:36,480
Tear runs down Julius's face as he pulls the trigger.

853
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:44,560
The body of Typh Raylan slumps down into a pile of his own vomit.

854
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:49,840
Immediately, the body of Wilson Wiley farts.

855
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,480
God damn it.

856
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,560
I'll never get used to this stench of death.

857
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:07,120
Roll grip.

858
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,000
No, that's not going to do it.

859
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,840
That's an 89 on a 25.

860
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:20,400
For murdering unarmed family member.

861
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,920
I'm going to go ahead and say D4 plus one.

862
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:24,420
Yeah.

863
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:27,440
One plus one.

864
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:28,240
Two grip.

865
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,560
And that puts me past a breaking point.

866
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:31,840
Hey, that's fitting.

867
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:35,200
What should we go with?

868
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:39,760
We've got a fucking mess is the situation that you're in.

869
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:41,760
It's a giant mess.

870
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:47,440
Julius just killed his uncle who, you know, whether they got along, he still killed his

871
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:48,560
uncle that he loved.

872
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:58,000
And so Julius, instead of dealing with the horrific situation in front of him, goes somewhere

873
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:58,500
else.

874
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,080
Just leaves?

875
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:02,240
No, in his mind.

876
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:03,680
Oh shit.

877
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:08,160
He doesn't see the dead body of Typh Raylan.

878
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:10,400
He doesn't see two dead cops.

879
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:18,160
He sees interesting little figurines reminiscent of-

880
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,720
The sculptures from the front yard.

881
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:23,920
And the vomit.

882
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:24,880
A water feature.

883
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:25,380
Of course.

884
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:26,880
The blood.

885
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:27,600
A little pond.

886
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:31,920
He sees little koi fish swimming in it.

887
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,760
Oh, Typh wouldn't like this.

888
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:36,880
Oh no, no.

889
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,000
He likes it a lot neater.

890
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,640
I gotta get this stuff out of here before he sees it.

891
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:49,440
And Julius starts cleaning up the office to get out the sculptures.

892
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:57,120
All right, roll forensics to clean up the murder scene that you just created.

893
00:45:59,200 --> 00:45:59,920
An 81.

894
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:01,920
So that's not gonna cut it.

895
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,440
That's not gonna cut it.

896
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:04,560
That's not gonna do it.

897
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:09,280
You've gotten the sculptures where?

898
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:11,360
How are you getting rid of these sculptures?

899
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:12,960
Are they in the bathroom?

900
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,240
The executive bathroom?

901
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,440
They're in a-

902
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,760
Well, Typh has his closet-

903
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:18,320
Shower.

904
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:24,720
Well, Typh in the office has his closet full of suits in case he needs to change for a

905
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:27,360
different occasion or if he works late.

906
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:32,720
So Julius gets the sculptures and puts them in the shed.

907
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:34,260
Yep.

908
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,640
Which is the closet there.

909
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:37,040
Yep.

910
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,640
He kind of likes the water features.

911
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:41,760
He thinks maybe they're not too bad, so he leaves those.

912
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:46,400
Plus he doesn't know how he's gonna fill it in or something.

913
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:47,440
Yeah, it's too much.

914
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:52,080
Julius, he wants to meet back up with his friends, honestly.

915
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:52,960
He's had a hard day.

916
00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:01,200
Julius walks out of the office confident that he's at least gotten rid of the sculptures

917
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:06,080
that some people might think are a little gaudy or ugly, but they're hidden away in

918
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:06,960
the shed.

919
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:15,360
He walks out of the office, goes downstairs, and then once he sees the marble entrance

920
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:16,560
without the marbles-

921
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:17,280
Yeah.

922
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:18,960
He kind of comes back to-

923
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,240
You hear a voice from behind you.

924
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:24,820
Julius?

925
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:26,240
Julius?

926
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:28,800
And you turn around and it's the intern.

927
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:36,720
Can I get you a coffee or anything?

928
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:40,480
Can you drive me to the Natcher Hole?

929
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,080
Okay, where's your car?

930
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:51,200
Roll Persuade.

931
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,240
41 on a 60.

932
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,640
He fails deeply and he's just like,

933
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:03,600
Oh, oh, fuck, okay, okay, fuck.

934
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:11,200
All right, and he turns around and you see kind of the office has a mass all kind of

935
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,200
in hushed tones speaking to each other.

936
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,400
People are on their phones.

937
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:22,320
People are taking pictures and video as Jeremy kind of walks toward you nervously looking

938
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:23,280
back at everyone.

939
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,600
Okay, okay, we're going to the Natcher Hole.

940
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:30,640
All right, see you guys.

941
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,560
Let's go you.

942
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:35,460
Yeah.

943
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:45,040
Stevie!

944
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,000
Stevie!

945
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:46,480
Over here!

946
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:47,280
It's us!

947
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:47,920
It's us!

948
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:48,960
It's Cal Colorado!

949
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:55,200
Cal Colorado and Beck Wilder, the two of you are in Cal's vehicle, which is a-

950
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:57,280
Sweet Mercedes C-Class.

951
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:01,920
And you are sitting at the northeast corner of-

952
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:03,200
The Natcher Hole.

953
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:04,320
Oh, look at that.

954
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:06,880
I pointed at each of them and they were like,

955
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:10,400
Hey, I just took notes on this actually.

956
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,320
30 more seconds to silence.

957
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:22,240
I was going to comment that your house is so perfectly still.

958
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:24,800
Like that was a real silent silence.

959
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:25,200
Thank you.

960
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:32,240
I mean, if we heard it shift like the foundation or something, like during the 30 seconds of

961
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:34,480
silence, that would be very unsettling.

962
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:37,360
I don't know why I was just like, Oh, you're probably wrong.

963
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:40,160
Well, that's kind of our thing, right?

964
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,240
We're supposed to be at the south gate.

965
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,640
Are we parked at the northwest corner?

966
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:51,760
My notes say northeast side of the Natcher Hole.

967
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:53,440
What south gate are you talking about?

968
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:54,880
SG, the Natcher Hole.

969
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:58,560
SG, we think, is for Stevie Gotel.

970
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:00,240
Well, now that we've seen her-

971
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:02,400
I was going to say, it's been a while.

972
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,240
Scratch, scratch, scratch all that.

973
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:06,320
Yeah, that's the part where I look dumb.

974
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:07,760
That's fair.

975
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:10,640
I do that for me.

976
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:13,120
To be fair, the Natcher Hole used to be a stadium.

977
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:16,320
So having a south gate isn't the most ridiculous thing.

978
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:17,280
No, it's absolutely not.

979
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:21,920
Let's go back to what Thomas said.

980
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:26,160
Let's go to the south gate.

981
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:30,160
I used to work at a church called South Gate.

982
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,880
Oh, this is probably pretty triggering for you.

983
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,320
Yeah, I was the janitor.

984
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:35,360
That sounds like a nice job.

985
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:37,680
It was lovely as the nighttime janitor.

986
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:38,960
Yeah, nobody's around.

987
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,400
You're in a neat big building.

988
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:43,680
I was also like solidifying my lack of faith at that point.

989
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:46,720
So it was a nice setting.

990
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,480
Did you just piss on the pews and be like,

991
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,240
well, they were clean when I got done with them.

992
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:51,280
Did you play the organ?

993
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,000
There was no organ, unfortunately.

994
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,480
I grew up in a church with an organ.

995
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,480
Very fun, but not that one.

996
00:50:58,480 --> 00:50:58,980
Bummer.

997
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:01,200
You want to call for Stevie?

998
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:01,700
Stevie!

999
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:04,640
Stevie, Stevie!

1000
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:05,200
Stevie!

1001
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:06,000
Stevie!

1002
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:06,400
Stevie!

1003
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:07,200
It's us!

1004
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:07,920
Hey, hey!

1005
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:09,200
Cal Colorado!

1006
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,600
You guys are at the northeast corner of the Natcher Hole.

1007
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:13,520
Exactly where we're supposed to be.

1008
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:13,840
Exactly.

1009
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:16,400
To catch the crooked cops.

1010
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:18,560
Got all cops.

1011
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:20,480
You saw Stevie, this scrawny little dude

1012
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:24,720
wearing cigarette legged jeans and an oversized black hoodie.

1013
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:28,000
They have earbuds plugged into their ear holes

1014
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:33,040
and a thick wall of dark wavy hair covers their eyes, nose, and top lip,

1015
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:38,640
only revealing a black lipstick covered bottom lip, pierced with a small hoop.

1016
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:42,720
It's a good thing our trusted comrade and colleague Stevie Gotel is here

1017
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:47,120
to help us apprehend these men who are meeting the mysterious and criminal SG.

1018
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:48,400
The SG, yep.

1019
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:50,800
As written down in their notes.

1020
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:57,280
Beck, I'm so glad Stevie's here to help us find the nefarious SG.

1021
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,200
I thought that meant South Gate.

1022
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:00,960
I did too, to be honest.

1023
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:05,600
I have many fond memories of coming to this Natcher Hole with my father.

1024
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,600
We'd always come in the South Gate, the people's gate.

1025
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:10,880
He insisted we sit in the bleachers.

1026
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:14,320
I wasn't around when it was still a ballpark.

1027
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:18,320
I was actually at the game where the sinkhole ate Lefty Rodriguez.

1028
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:20,640
Well, he wasn't very good.

1029
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,000
He insisted on batting right.

1030
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:31,440
If you could both roll at a negative...

1031
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:35,840
Well, I'll just give you a negative 20 for the conversation that you're having.

1032
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:39,120
I fail.

1033
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:40,000
I crit fail.

1034
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:44,640
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

1035
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:46,320
Stevie, Stevie, where did they go?

1036
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:47,840
Oh, shit.

1037
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:50,240
Stevie?

1038
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:51,920
Stevie?

1039
00:52:51,920 --> 00:53:00,480
As you're looking around, Cal, you look out of the driver's side window and you see that there is

1040
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:09,120
blood on the street next to your car and then it's going in a line back around.

1041
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:13,440
And then at that very moment, you see Stevie coming back around the front of the car

1042
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:20,080
with some sort of contraption in their hand and they are spilling out blood.

1043
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:23,200
They finally connect the circle.

1044
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,240
Oh, I hate blood.

1045
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,240
I slam on the gas.

1046
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:36,240
You described her making the circle for too long.

1047
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:41,600
I'm just gonna sit here and let you trap me?

1048
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:46,000
Well, I mean, I am going to finish what I was doing because you failed.

1049
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:47,200
You check.

1050
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:57,840
And so Stevie is muttering something under their breath and as you go to hit the gas

1051
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:04,320
and the blood finally meets back up around this Cadillac, I need you both to roll power.

1052
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:09,600
Critical success.

1053
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,280
33 on a 60.

1054
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,640
I pass a 30 on a 75.

1055
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:23,920
Immediately, the two of you are standing in front of a large estate.

1056
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:31,280
You're standing on a sort of synthetic, almost bouncy material, like a sidewalk.

1057
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:35,520
And there's a row of homes in front of you.

1058
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:41,040
And one of these homes is slightly larger, slightly nicer than the rest.

1059
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:43,200
Absolutely gorgeous architecture.

1060
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,760
Well kept garden.

1061
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:46,480
Well kept.

1062
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:55,280
What's the first thing that goes through Cal Colorado's mind?

1063
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:55,920
Oh my God.

1064
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:56,560
What the fuck?

1065
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:05,040
And in that moment, as you speak with each word that comes out of your mouth,

1066
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:11,440
the reality around you sort of loses its shimmer, loses its sharpness.

1067
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:17,680
It's almost like you're speaking away the reality that you're currently in.

1068
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:18,560
This isn't happening.

1069
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:19,440
This isn't happening.

1070
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:20,720
I'm in my C class.

1071
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:21,920
I'm in my C class.

1072
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:22,960
That's where I am.

1073
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:27,120
And as you say that, you are sitting in your C class.

1074
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:33,120
You're looking over at Beck and Beck's eyes are kind of like rolled back in his head.

1075
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:34,240
I started slapping him.

1076
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:36,640
Beck Wilder, you feel the slaps?

1077
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:38,800
Beck, Beck, come back.

1078
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:39,200
Come back.

1079
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:41,120
You're in the C class.

1080
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:43,040
I'm in the C class.

1081
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:45,520
You are Beck Wilder.

1082
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:46,640
I'm Beck Wilder.

1083
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:48,800
The best damn camera man in the world.

1084
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:51,040
I'm the best camera man in the world.

1085
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:52,960
What the fuck?

1086
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:54,960
Is Stevie still around?

1087
00:55:54,960 --> 00:56:00,480
In the rear view mirror, you see Stevie Gautilus slipped into the back seat of the Cadillac,

1088
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,080
seemingly while you were out.

1089
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:05,760
However, they are out currently.

1090
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:11,760
Eyes kind of rolled back, but like they might come to at any moment.

1091
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:12,900
Stevie?

1092
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:14,420
Stevie?

1093
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:16,160
Cal, hit her.

1094
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:22,880
I open my driver's side door and I pour my coffee out on part of the blood circle and

1095
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:25,760
try to disperse, like make it no longer complete circle.

1096
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:26,160
Cool.

1097
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:26,880
Very nice.

1098
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:29,920
As you do so, Stevie kind of like rouses.

1099
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:37,200
Hey, Stevie, what the fuck?

1100
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:40,240
What did you just do to us?

1101
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:40,960
That's fair.

1102
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:43,200
What's up?

1103
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:52,080
Stevie, I don't like to speak harshly to the people that I work with, but you are rapidly

1104
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:55,440
declining on my list of favorite can interns.

1105
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:57,200
Why don't you tell us what's up?

1106
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:58,000
Yeah.

1107
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:58,500
Yeah.

1108
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:03,200
Stevie, where's Fox?

1109
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:03,920
I don't know.

1110
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:06,800
I mean, you saw the news, right?

1111
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:08,720
Did you take him to the bridge?

1112
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:10,960
No, I didn't take him to the bridge.

1113
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:12,400
Like that's not Fox.

1114
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:16,160
Like that thing just like, I mean, now that it-

1115
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:19,840
You admit though that you blew the plant because we were supposed to keep him tied up down

1116
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:21,680
there and we could tell that you let him loose.

1117
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:28,160
I thought I could, I mean, clearly I'm not as good at it as my dad is.

1118
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:30,640
Fuck.

1119
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:33,200
That was Grover's Gorge that we saw, wasn't it?

1120
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:37,040
Oh, were you in there for a second?

1121
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:37,540
Yes.

1122
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,520
And it was Grover's Gorge.

1123
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:40,720
Was it my house?

1124
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:44,400
Well, I don't think we visited your house, Stevie, but it was a nice house.

1125
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:45,780
Yeah.

1126
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:48,080
Those damn bouncy sidewalks.

1127
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:49,440
Was that your house?

1128
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:49,680
Yeah.

1129
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:51,360
I mean, it was probably my house.

1130
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:52,880
It's like where it was going to start.

1131
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:54,000
Stevie, why did you do this?

1132
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,160
Did you know a place like home us?

1133
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:58,640
Well, I mean, no, it's like in your-

1134
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:00,560
That's one of my favorite movies, Stevie.

1135
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:04,800
I would appreciate it if you didn't give it negative connotations from me.

1136
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:08,000
If I could try, I mean, honestly, if I could do it again, that would be-

1137
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:12,800
I think you guys would maybe like-

1138
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:14,720
No, I don't think so, Stevie.

1139
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:17,200
They want us like dead there, right?

1140
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:18,720
Like we escaped a trial.

1141
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:19,680
Like you weren't there.

1142
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:21,040
You were just there in your brain.

1143
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:26,080
Like we all got out together and like I know that I bailed

1144
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:28,800
and I'm really sorry about that, but I-

1145
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:29,920
So what, Stevie?

1146
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:35,760
We spend the rest of our lives in this parking lot, imagining ourselves in Grover's Gorge?

1147
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:36,080
Okay.

1148
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:42,080
So like it's a little confusing, but mostly I'm just scared right now, honestly,

1149
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:45,680
because there's some shit going down.

1150
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:45,920
Yeah.

1151
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:48,080
Clearly you could handle it yourself, Stevie.

1152
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:54,880
Why don't you tell us what the shit is and maybe while we're still your friends,

1153
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:58,000
if we're still your friends, we can help you out of it.

1154
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:58,320
Okay.

1155
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:02,560
So I know the footage got stolen, right?

1156
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:03,760
Yes.

1157
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:07,360
Beck does a kind of embarrassed nod.

1158
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:12,000
And so like I'm getting it back?

1159
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:14,800
To give to us or-

1160
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:20,080
So like maybe not?

1161
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:24,880
Like what, like I had maybe a different plan, but-

1162
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:30,560
Cal looks very, very seriously at them and says, Stevie, this is the news.

1163
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:32,800
Yeah.

1164
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:39,120
It was probably enough to like get my dad to give me whatever I wanted.

1165
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:41,040
So I was just going to like-

1166
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:42,080
Use it as blackmail?

1167
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:43,120
Yeah.

1168
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:45,600
You could have-

1169
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:48,800
I do not condone blackmail.

1170
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:51,360
I thought that you might not.

1171
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:56,160
Beck, maybe if you passed a role, definitely Julius, you could have just gotten a copy.

1172
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:01,440
But a copy is no good if it goes on the news.

1173
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:04,400
If it's already out there, then what's the blackmail good for?

1174
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:05,040
I mean-

1175
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:10,480
You were all very, very specifically intent on wanting to get it on the television.

1176
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:13,440
Stevie, is there really something your father could have given you

1177
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:17,760
that was more valuable than a letter of recommendation from Cal Colorado?

1178
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:19,120
Yeah.

1179
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:19,680
Oh, what?

1180
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:24,000
Like name a number or like-

1181
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:24,640
Five.

1182
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:25,280
Yeah.

1183
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:26,080
27.

1184
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:26,560
18.

1185
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:28,080
Negative 90.

1186
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:28,800
11.

1187
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:29,280
Okay.

1188
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:31,920
Put a million on the end of any of those except for the negative one,

1189
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:33,280
because I don't know how that would work out.

1190
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:36,720
And then yeah, that's probably like on the table.

1191
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:39,360
You would owe him then if it was a negative probably.

1192
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:41,840
Oh yeah, so I don't want to do that one.

1193
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:42,340
No.

1194
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:51,360
But I thought that it might be enough to where I could actually take over

1195
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:54,560
and get him to like fuck off, but maybe not.

1196
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:55,040
I don't know.

1197
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:57,520
Stevie, I've got to question your logic there,

1198
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:03,120
that your father would voluntarily give you enough of his fortune for you to take him down with.

1199
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:03,360
Yeah.

1200
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:06,800
I think in that case, you would just blackmail him to have the company,

1201
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:09,920
not for a number that would then be enough to buy it from him.

1202
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:11,600
See, this is why you should watch the news.

1203
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:18,240
So what do you guys think?

1204
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:19,440
How much should I ask for?

1205
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:28,880
Cow like sighs deeply.

1206
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:32,080
Well, what is he worth?

1207
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:39,440
I mean, the company I think is 8.3 something, maybe 8.4, somewhere in there.

1208
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:40,640
Bill.

1209
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:42,960
Oh, I thought you meant negative million.

1210
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:50,240
No.

1211
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:55,680
Stevie, do you have the tape?

1212
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:56,880
What?

1213
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:58,480
Have you made the pickup yet?

1214
01:01:58,480 --> 01:01:59,120
No.

1215
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:00,320
I want to human that.

1216
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:03,760
Past 20 on 70.

1217
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:09,360
Clearly Stevie was caught completely off guard and it's almost like you

1218
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:13,040
stripped them down to their veneer by asking the question.

1219
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:20,320
And you can just see right through a very simple like, no, that hasn't happened yet.

1220
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:21,840
How did you set up this meeting?

1221
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:23,680
Like, did you know the cops?

1222
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:25,680
The cops, by the way, did you know that?

1223
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:27,440
Well, see, it hasn't even happened yet.

1224
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:31,120
So we need to figure out where they are.

1225
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:33,120
Yes, I hold on.

1226
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:35,040
I'd like a sidebar with Beck.

1227
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:36,000
Yeah, for sure.

1228
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,320
Could you put yourself in your circle or something?

1229
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:44,640
Just do like a really tiny one in your seat there.

1230
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:48,160
Or just, you know, you could remake the one you made and we'll step out of the car.

1231
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:48,480
Okay.

1232
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:54,800
So I, because you guys both like passed your power and especially with the crit success,

1233
01:02:54,800 --> 01:03:00,160
like I didn't have you roll grip in the moment and that starting to feel a little bit.

1234
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:03,680
You're right, but I could see this dawning on us how fucked up with that was.

1235
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:07,120
I mean, as you say, as you mentioned that we didn't take a grip test, I'm like,

1236
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:10,640
oh yes, by the way, Stevie, what the fuck?

1237
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:11,940
Yeah.

1238
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:14,800
Can you both roll grip?

1239
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:17,200
Pass.

1240
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:19,040
10 on a 42.

1241
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:21,280
I pass a 25 on a 49.

1242
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:27,440
You were both whisked away somewhere mentally for a second, but it's not as if they couldn't

1243
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:32,800
have, you know, maybe projected some sort of image onto your eyeballs or something technologically

1244
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:37,280
speaking, like something could have happened that made you feel like you were elsewhere.

1245
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:41,360
And I don't know, like we were real tired and just dozed off real quick.

1246
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:42,000
Yeah.

1247
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:42,880
Quick nap.

1248
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:43,360
Why not?

1249
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:44,960
That makes way more sense than mine.

1250
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:50,960
I'm like, it's some wild tech thing that it's hot and new in the city.

1251
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:53,600
Cause you know, the tech in the city is getting out of hand these days.

1252
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:54,400
Not even in the city.

1253
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:56,800
Like it could just be Grover's Gorge tech.

1254
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:58,640
We saw all kinds of amazing things there.

1255
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:01,680
It makes sense that they, oh, you did a little VR.

1256
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:04,640
Like what are those in the fluid?

1257
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:06,800
Like aggressive attack VR.

1258
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:08,880
That's awesome.

1259
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:12,880
Actually, there are nano projectors in the fluid that you encompass.

1260
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:15,600
You know how they film the Mandalorian on that circular green screen?

1261
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:16,000
Right, right.

1262
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:16,480
Yeah.

1263
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:19,040
It's like that, but a portable technology.

1264
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:20,500
Yeah.

1265
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:24,880
That's I don't think that they have that like here, but that sounds like a Grover's Gorge

1266
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:25,200
kind of thing.

1267
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:25,600
Exactly.

1268
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:26,160
It was wild.

1269
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:26,960
Remember what they did?

1270
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:28,640
You know, when you got jackaloped?

1271
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:29,140
Yeah.

1272
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:30,640
Picture right up.

1273
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:33,280
So of course they could Mandalorian us in my C class.

1274
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:34,400
Deck feels his backside.

1275
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:35,440
Yeah.

1276
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:36,000
I remember.

1277
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:39,520
It feels better than you think as you have the memory of the pain.

1278
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:47,760
And Stevie just kind of like slips out of the Mercedes Cadillac.

1279
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:51,040
And Stevie just kind of slips out of the Cadillac at this point.

1280
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:53,040
What's it for fucking Mercedes?

1281
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:53,680
Other way around.

1282
01:04:54,640 --> 01:05:01,280
And Stevie, why don't you stay right there in the back seat and we'll slip out.

1283
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:01,840
Okay.

1284
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:02,560
Gotcha.

1285
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:03,040
Of this.

1286
01:05:03,040 --> 01:05:04,160
What kind of car is this?

1287
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:05,360
It's a Mercedes C class.

1288
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:05,860
Cool.

1289
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:08,580
Yeah.

1290
01:05:08,580 --> 01:05:10,400
Which Luke assured us was nice.

1291
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:18,640
Okay.

1292
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:23,440
So we slip out of the car, but back since we lost sight of Stevie.

1293
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:28,080
So easily a few minutes ago is going to like be staring into the back seat as we talk.

1294
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:28,320
I think.

1295
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:28,820
Yeah.

1296
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:31,440
What you got cow?

1297
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:33,520
Well, that's the question back.

1298
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:34,880
What do we have here?

1299
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:38,320
I mean, I've been kind of nervous about once we get to this point in every place we've

1300
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:41,760
gone so far about like how we physically get it back.

1301
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:44,400
Like they probably got guns, dude.

1302
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:45,840
And they're expecting Stevie.

1303
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:51,920
If we can keep Stevie on our side, I think they're our best bet at getting the footage back.

1304
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:55,760
So we probably need to stay out of sight though for the handoff, right?

1305
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:57,200
I don't think we can be a part of it.

1306
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:03,360
Cal is thinking very seriously for a minute and he says, I think our best bet at getting

1307
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:09,600
the footage and showing the public is if for now we let Stevie believe that they can go

1308
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:11,040
through with the blackmail.

1309
01:06:11,040 --> 01:06:11,280
Yeah.

1310
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:17,840
I think at the very least cow vomits on the steering wheel or remember we're out of the

1311
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:18,080
car.

1312
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:18,880
You're in the car.

1313
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:20,000
God damn it.

1314
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:23,440
You are where we can see you.

1315
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:26,720
It's really smart.

1316
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:28,880
That's what we mean when we say family.

1317
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:30,320
Beck wants to open his door real quick.

1318
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:31,120
Pop his head in.

1319
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:33,280
Stevie, what was the like terms of the deal?

1320
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:37,120
Were you going to pay them money or how are you going to get the stuff from them?

1321
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:41,040
Oh, they're like, uh, already on the gato payroll.

1322
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:44,720
So I just acted like they just think you're an agent of.

1323
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:45,280
Exactly.

1324
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:45,600
Yeah.

1325
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:48,720
You're like the next higher up that they're passing it on to.

1326
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:50,320
What time are you supposed to meet them, Stevie?

1327
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:51,600
Uh, well, they're late.

1328
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:52,480
Fuck.

1329
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:54,320
Beck looks around.

1330
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:55,680
Where were you supposed to meet them?

1331
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:56,720
Like the south gate?

1332
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:57,520
Yeah, the south gate.

1333
01:06:57,520 --> 01:06:58,480
Oh, the people's gate.

1334
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:01,840
You know, I used to go there with my father, but we don't have time for that Stevie.

1335
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:07,840
You need to go right away.

1336
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:09,680
We're going to let you carry out your blackmail.

1337
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:10,080
What?

1338
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:10,640
Really?

1339
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:12,240
We think it's for the good of the people.

1340
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:13,600
Yeah, it is.

1341
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:16,400
And then once you've got yours, we get ours.

1342
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:16,960
That's right.

1343
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:18,000
We need a copy though.

1344
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:18,320
Okay.

1345
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:18,640
Yeah.

1346
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:20,240
You guys get a exclusive.

1347
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:22,720
Like you're the first people who get it right.

1348
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:24,000
Cal looks hard at Beck.

1349
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:24,400
Yeah.

1350
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:26,880
Beck returns the same kind of face.

1351
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:28,400
So you guys look hard at each other?

1352
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:28,880
Yeah.

1353
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:29,200
Yeah.

1354
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:29,760
Real hard.

1355
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:30,480
Yeah.

1356
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:31,120
It's hot.

1357
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:32,880
And then, um, don't.

1358
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:36,800
I mean, what do you expect me to fucking do with that?

1359
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:38,720
I said, no, you can just don't.

1360
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:42,320
I like bit down on that laugh earlier and it still came out.

1361
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:44,000
I like really tried to hold it in.

1362
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,400
I just specifically leave the part out where I say it's hard.

1363
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:47,920
So the fucking discord doesn't.

1364
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:56,240
The spoiler chat just doesn't become the horniest place on earth.

1365
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:58,720
And even though what we're saying is funny right now, please cut it.

1366
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:02,160
Because I'm serious about those discord fucks.

1367
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:07,120
Can't give them an itch.

1368
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:09,680
You're gonna have to say something way worse for it to get cut.

1369
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:13,200
Don't try to bait me.

1370
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:16,320
All right.

1371
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:16,560
Back.

1372
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:17,520
Do you want to try to bait him?

1373
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:27,040
Cow looks real hard at Beck Beck gets an erection.

1374
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:41,040
That's not appropriate.

1375
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:47,120
That even though you could read into it some other way, what we have here is a father son

1376
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:48,160
type dynamic.

1377
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:48,720
Oh yeah.

1378
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:49,040
No.

1379
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:50,720
So knock it off for sure.

1380
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:51,040
For sure.

1381
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:51,520
For sure.

1382
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:51,840
For sure.

1383
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:54,800
Which one of you is this step?

1384
01:08:57,680 --> 01:08:58,560
I'm the daddy.

1385
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:00,080
I'm the daddy.

1386
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:05,920
So now it's in your hands, Zach.

1387
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:08,320
What you unleash on the world.

1388
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,360
On the edit, baby.

1389
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:14,160
It's on the edit.

1390
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:15,440
We'll see.

1391
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:19,120
Stevie, you got to, you should get going then.

1392
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:20,480
You're going to, you have to meet them.

1393
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:23,600
Well, yeah, I was just popping out because I'm hungry.

1394
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:25,040
Oh, are you meeting them in the subway?

1395
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:29,120
Oh, yeah, they're going to meet me down by the subway.

1396
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:32,560
If you're meeting them in the subway, couldn't you have just gotten a sandwich there?

1397
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:34,880
Oh my God.

1398
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:36,080
I'm so stupid.

1399
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:37,840
Why did I talk like that?

1400
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:40,080
Stevie, Stevie, you're not stupid.

1401
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:43,360
You're just at the beginning of your life and you've got a lot to learn.

1402
01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:43,840
Yeah.

1403
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:45,200
But I believe in you, kiddo.

1404
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:46,000
That's awesome.

1405
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:48,000
That's so cool.

1406
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,560
Okay, well, do you guys want to like come with me or?

1407
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:55,760
I don't think they should see us, but if you wanted to, I don't know,

1408
01:09:55,760 --> 01:10:01,760
FaceTime us from your phone pocket or something or from your shirt pocket with your phone in it.

1409
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:03,120
Yeah, I'll put you in my hoodie pocket.

1410
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:06,240
I mean, I've already got your earbuds in all the time.

1411
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:09,440
So like that's, that's kind of my steez, right?

1412
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:11,360
So like, they're not going to know that.

1413
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:12,560
I thought your name was Stevie.

1414
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:13,440
It's Stevie.

1415
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:17,920
And they're not going to know that I've got one earbud that's talking to you guys.

1416
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:19,360
Beck, I thought their name was Stevie.

1417
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:19,860
Yeah.

1418
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:22,880
No, Stevie's like a thing that you say.

1419
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:24,880
They say like kids say it.

1420
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:26,240
Like we say it.

1421
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:34,720
Oh, everybody says here in the city in 2022, all the kids are saying Stevie.

1422
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:40,960
And at that moment, you see a familiar car turn the corner

1423
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:45,360
inside this parking garage and pull up next to you.

1424
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:46,640
How familiar?

1425
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:49,600
Well, how much do you know about?

1426
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:51,360
Julia Summers?

1427
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:51,860
No.

1428
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,520
The intern, Jeremy and what he drives.

1429
01:10:57,520 --> 01:11:05,680
Cal, uh, to answer your question, Cal looks over and says, who the fuck is that?

1430
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:11,200
I think if it's, if it's an internet can Beck would know.

1431
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:16,400
Who got you coffee and energy drinks earlier, like yesterday and like for your jobs and stuff.

1432
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:19,200
It was the one that was running alongside our car.

1433
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:19,680
Absolutely.

1434
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:20,480
This is Jeremy.

1435
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:22,880
Dude, Cal, it's Jeremy.

1436
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:27,440
And sitting shotgun is decide.

1437
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:29,200
Oh no.

1438
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:33,680
I'm just going to wait for Luke to like describe what you guys see as sitting shotgun.

1439
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:34,240
Nice.

1440
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:34,560
Hell yeah.

1441
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:36,800
That's also perfectly in time with when I need to pee.

1442
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:44,800
All right, let's get down to the end of the app.

1443
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:51,920
Cal Colorado in the driver's seat of his Mercedes C-class Beck Wilder sitting shotgun.

1444
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:59,200
And pulling up is the car of Jeremy, the city action news intern.

1445
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,480
He's driving and sitting shotgun.

1446
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:04,320
What do they see?

1447
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:11,360
Julius opens the door, hops out of the passenger's seat, looks at Jeremy.

1448
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:13,140
Thanks.

1449
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:20,480
Slams the door and goes to get in the back seat of Cal's car.

1450
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:26,240
Cal presses the lock button and crank, like rolls down the driver's window, just a tad.

1451
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:30,400
Which makes sense because when you look at Julius Summers, you see.

1452
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:37,760
He is covered in blood and like bits of brain and flesh.

1453
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:38,260
What?

1454
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:40,800
Oh shit.

1455
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:41,360
We're all good.

1456
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:43,120
You got promotions.

1457
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:44,400
I got promotions.

1458
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:45,520
Julius, dude.

1459
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:47,200
Dude, Julius, you're covered.

1460
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:49,520
What's the, yeah, Julius, you are.

1461
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:52,320
Oh, there's a lot of viscera on you.

1462
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:55,760
There was water features and stuff like a fountain.

1463
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:57,120
It got all wet.

1464
01:12:57,760 --> 01:12:58,400
Yeah.

1465
01:12:58,400 --> 01:12:58,900
What?

1466
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:00,500
Yeah.

1467
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:02,480
Blood fountain?

1468
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:03,280
That's blood, dude.

1469
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:04,880
Are you hurt?

1470
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:08,560
Julius looks down at himself and is like, I'm fine.

1471
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:11,440
My face hurts a little bit, but I'm good.

1472
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:13,920
What do we see if we look at his face specifically?

1473
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:14,420
Blood.

1474
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:17,440
No, but no like specific face trauma.

1475
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:19,120
No wounds or injury.

1476
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:22,560
You can't really, you wouldn't really be able to tell through the blood.

1477
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:23,120
Yeah.

1478
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:30,160
And he seems to be, maybe there's like a hole in his shoulder and he's probably like kind

1479
01:13:30,160 --> 01:13:32,720
of holding it just a little bit.

1480
01:13:32,720 --> 01:13:38,640
Julius, just so we're clear here, you think you're just a little wet right now?

1481
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:40,400
Yeah, it'll be fun.

1482
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:41,040
From water?

1483
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:42,400
From the fountain.

1484
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:47,360
Well, if you were, wouldn't I be terrified because that's my phobia?

1485
01:13:49,120 --> 01:14:01,360
That's a wrap on the episode.

1486
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:02,160
God damn it.

1487
01:14:02,160 --> 01:14:02,880
Holy shit.

1488
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:04,880
Holy shit.

1489
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:06,800
And you said pieces of viscera, like brain?

1490
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:07,860
Yeah.

1491
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:08,420
Wow.

1492
01:14:10,160 --> 01:14:10,660
Wow.

1493
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:13,680
What's happening now?

1494
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:15,840
Holy shit.

1495
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:26,880
It's all mine for, cause my life is great.

1496
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:41,200
And it's all mine, cause my life is great.

1497
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:52,160
For if I do, my mom would say.

1498
01:14:52,160 --> 01:14:53,200
God damn.

1499
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:55,600
See, old women were terrifying in the nineties.

1500
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:00,640
That aesthetic was not fucking chill.

1501
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:08,400
That was like an Andrew Dice Clay crowd shot.

1502
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:13,440
Whoa.

1503
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:14,480
He made his mistake.

1504
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:17,600
Relatable moment.

1505
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:18,640
Hell yeah.

1506
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:21,360
Raffi even Raffi makes mistakes.

1507
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:22,320
Okay.

1508
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:23,600
Can't believe he did it.

1509
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:30,400
And we back and we back and we back and we back and we back and we back.

1510
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:37,600
Welcome everyone to the 26th episode of season two of pretending to be people.

1511
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:41,600
Wow.

1512
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,360
I'm curious guys.

1513
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:49,840
We've, we've been through a lot and it's been a while.

1514
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:53,760
And last we left you, we left you on a bit of a cliffhanger, but let's not talk about

1515
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:54,560
that.

1516
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:59,440
We just did four full episodes as different characters.

1517
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:00,560
I don't know if it's the headphones.

1518
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:02,080
You sound crazy blown out to me.

1519
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:02,580
Yeah.

1520
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:04,800
So you might want to check that before we.

1521
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:06,880
What the fuck were you talking about?

1522
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:09,360
I was trying to think of words that rhymed with all your names.

1523
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,400
All right, let's run it down.

1524
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:13,200
Joe.

1525
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:16,000
Have you ever seen Joe blowing his load down by the bay?

1526
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:18,720
That's as far as I got.

1527
01:16:18,720 --> 01:16:20,320
Okay, well let's go to Thomas.

1528
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:22,480
That's where I got stuck.

1529
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:22,720
Right.

1530
01:16:22,720 --> 01:16:25,600
So I guess me next probably would be easier.

1531
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:35,040
Have you ever seen Zach attack a rack of snacks down by the shack where he's at down

1532
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:38,160
by the bay?

1533
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:38,560
Mac.

1534
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:43,840
Have you ever seen Justin busting down by the bay?

1535
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:46,960
It was like Michael unicycle.

1536
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:49,200
I was taking inspiration from the man himself.

1537
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:52,320
What Michael on a unicycle.

1538
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:52,640
Yeah.

1539
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:54,800
He just said, have you ever seen Michael?

1540
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:55,120
Unicycle.

1541
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:59,360
And then he paused and he said, unicycle down by the bay.

1542
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,280
Well, rhymes with Thomas.

1543
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:01,780
Promise.

1544
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:04,180
No.

1545
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:06,020
Okay.

1546
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:07,840
Is that the only thing, Thomas?

1547
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:11,840
Dude, I don't know.

1548
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:12,880
My last name is a lot more.

1549
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:13,600
I mean your whole.

1550
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:14,320
Oh, right.

1551
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:16,240
That would have been the move.

1552
01:17:16,240 --> 01:17:18,160
Can't think of anything that rhymes with that either.

1553
01:17:18,160 --> 01:17:18,660
I saw.

1554
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:24,400
I saw Thomas Cox box of Fox eating locks in his socks.

1555
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:25,120
Kicking rocks.

1556
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:26,080
Kicking rocks.

1557
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:26,880
Getting off his rocks.

1558
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:27,600
Getting off.

1559
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:28,880
Yeah.

1560
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:30,080
You can play around with all that.

1561
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:30,320
Yeah.

1562
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:31,360
Down by the bay.

1563
01:17:32,160 --> 01:17:33,760
So everyone's jerking off.

1564
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:33,920
Yeah.

1565
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:34,800
Except for me.

1566
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:36,000
I'm attacking a rat.

1567
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:38,560
I was watching a box.

1568
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:39,520
Oh, is that code?

1569
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:40,960
Is that euphemism?

1570
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:41,680
No, no, no, no.

1571
01:17:41,680 --> 01:17:43,360
We were just attacking the rat.

1572
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:44,480
You got to do me now.

1573
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:48,000
I saw Luke eating puke down by the bay.

1574
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:52,080
Have you ever seen Luke eating so much cum that he pukes down by the bay?

1575
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:52,560
Oh no.

1576
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:54,320
Never eat the beach.

1577
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:55,200
Real good energy.

1578
01:17:57,200 --> 01:17:58,960
Definitely a good take to stick with.

1579
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:01,680
Down by the bay.

1580
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:05,440
And it's all my fault.

1581
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:27,040
In season two, episode 16 of the Pokemon anime, Go West Young Meowth, Meowth reveals that he

1582
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:30,960
stumbled across a female Meowth when he was young and fell head over heels for her.

1583
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:36,160
She didn't return his affection though because she had a rich trainer and said Meowth and

1584
01:18:36,160 --> 01:18:41,440
saw Meowth as a street Meowth who couldn't impress her because he wasn't human.

1585
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:44,080
So Meowth decided to make himself as human as he could.

1586
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:48,640
He learned to walk on two legs by watching people practice at a local dance academy,

1587
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:53,760
which also just so happens to offer pronunciation lessons over time.

1588
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:57,520
And with a little help from a picture book, he learned to sound out words.

1589
01:18:57,520 --> 01:19:02,000
Unfortunately, that didn't impress the female Meowth who went so far as to call him a freak.

1590
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:06,640
A broken hearted Meowth eventually left to join team Rocket because Rocket

1591
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:09,440
was the first word he ever understood the meaning of.

1592
01:19:12,240 --> 01:19:17,520
According to the logic of this episode then, there isn't anything special about Meowth

1593
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:19,040
that makes them able to talk to humans.

1594
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:23,200
Theoretically, any Pokemon that is able to speak their own name articulately

1595
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:24,880
could learn our language.

1596
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:28,800
They just need the proper motivation, a little help, and a lot of determination.

1597
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:31,600
That makes us wonder why more Pokemon haven't bothered to learn our language.

1598
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:37,040
It took Pikachu almost 20 years to finally speak in Pokemon I Choose You,

1599
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:39,440
and that might have just been a hallucination.

1600
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:44,560
And he even needed help from Ryan Reynolds and a pretty wild plot twist to speak in

1601
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:46,560
the Detective Pikachu movie.

1602
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:50,080
Shouldn't Pikachu have been motivated to talk to Ash way before that?

1603
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:52,560
Wait, was Pikachu in love with Ash?

1604
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:57,680
Because romantic love was the only thing to drive a Pokemon previously to learn English.

1605
01:19:57,680 --> 01:19:58,480
I don't think he was.

1606
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:04,080
But then again, having more Pokemon speak like humans would probably run some of the

1607
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:05,280
magic of the franchise.

1608
01:20:06,240 --> 01:20:09,520
It's part of the series charm that they can only say their names.

1609
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:11,440
It also makes Meowth special.

1610
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:15,120
Of course, maybe Pikachu doesn't care about Ash as much as Team Rocket's Meowth

1611
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:16,560
cared about the other Meowth.

1612
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:20,080
Oh, so they were on the same page as me?

1613
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:22,000
Yeah, that was written by Seamus Kelly.

1614
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:22,880
Thanks Seamus.

1615
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:24,080
Wow, what a-

1616
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:30,480
Radio Hedge Fund, nice, says it does also make Team Rocket idiots.

1617
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:34,240
They want to capture a nondescript Pikachu because he is in some way special,

1618
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:36,080
and yet they have a talking Meowth.

1619
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:38,400
The only one in the world.

1620
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:42,160
This little guy is beyond special, and yet they mistreat him all the time.

1621
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:47,760
Chris says, Slowking also spoke in Pokemon 2000.

1622
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:49,760
Slowking.

1623
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:55,440
Dude, I'm so Slowking stoked for this episode we're about to record.
