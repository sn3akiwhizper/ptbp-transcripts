1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,760
Rub, rub, rub, rub that magic lamp, baby.

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:07,360
Rub it up real nice.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:10,080
Oh shit, I'm coming on out.

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,480
It's your gin who's hooked on gin

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,160
as long as it's made in a bathtub.

6
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:18,460
I'm your fermented genie wolf the dog.

7
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:20,280
And I'm granting you three wishes

8
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:24,360
as long as they're all about me and giving me cool stuff.

9
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,760
I'm getting rubbed on live here

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,760
over on 694.2 PTBP, my babies.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Do y'all think if you fed a cow enough paromchaun cheese

12
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,840
it would make some kind of Alfredo

13
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,480
come out those long milk skin tubes it's got on its tummy?

14
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,620
If you can help, please send answers

15
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,080
to this very serious inquiry

16
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,680
to at pretending pod on Twitter

17
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,080
or at pretending pod on Instagram

18
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:58,760
or tag us on Facebook as pretending to be people.

19
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:03,760
We here at 694.2 PTBP love getting to know our wolf pups

20
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,800
on the old internet.

21
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:10,120
So throw us a follow, a like, a retweet, a doggy treat,

22
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:13,240
and then join us in the subreddit r slash pretending

23
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,120
to be people and hop on into the discord

24
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:20,040
to hang, talk theories, and play games with other listeners.

25
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,800
It's a fucking sweetheart of a community.

26
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,640
There's links to all this shit in the show notes

27
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,880
and you know what would just be the swellest.

28
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,880
Swing on into Apple Podcasts and write up a five star review.

29
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:38,360
If it's truly spicy, your Wolfie might read it here on air.

30
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:42,120
Like I'm reading this one here from Ford Beeblebrox

31
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,820
titled You Should Probably Seek Therapy.

32
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:48,880
They write, the game is Delta Green, mostly.

33
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,600
The cast are humans, mostly.

34
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,320
The jokes are funny, five out of five.

35
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,120
After listening to this show, I'm not entirely certain

36
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,120
that I'm sane anymore though.

37
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,720
Do I need to talk to my dog more often?

38
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,800
Have I been to this bar before?

39
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,220
Is one of my eyeballs made of metal?

40
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:09,360
I don't wanna poke myself in the eye to find out,

41
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,120
but well, sanity has its limits.

42
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,900
Kind of a one way street, that one.

43
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:18,120
Anyway, if you want a story that is stupidly hilarious

44
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:23,120
while still being spooky, this is the one.

45
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:29,040
Start at episode one and just go forward, but seek therapy.

46
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,240
Ha ha ha ha ha.

47
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,560
Thank you, Ford Beeblebrox.

48
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,880
Don't panic, but make sure y'all always remember

49
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:41,200
to bring a towel because this show is very messy.

50
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:46,200
I give the review a 42 out of 42 stars, my babies.

51
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,480
For those insatiable garbage hounds out there

52
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,960
with the delicious luxury of financial stability,

53
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:58,560
you can support the show on patreon.com slash pretendinpod

54
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,640
and instantly access 11 bonus episodes,

55
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,400
the most recent of which is part one

56
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,640
of our playthrough of Lover in the Ice,

57
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,440
a legitimately nasty scenario for Delta Green.

58
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,040
Even I think that shit's nasty.

59
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,520
You know who I am.

60
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,500
This scenario was chosen by popular vote

61
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,080
in a poll exclusive to our patrons,

62
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,800
wherein y'all pups proved the filthy apple

63
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,480
doesn't fall too far from this fucking obscene tree.

64
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,280
Remember, y'all, hit up our Twitch

65
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,080
for some good video game and chill times.

66
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,080
I don't know what a video game is,

67
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,160
but I hear they're pretty fun.

68
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,560
Apparently, Justin has been doing some prime hang time

69
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,360
with the community there Tuesday and Thursday evenings,

70
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,280
chatting with y'all and such,

71
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,560
twitch.tv slash pretendinpodstreams.

72
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,240
Now, put your stress in suspension.

73
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,480
Give in to the ooze.

74
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:02,200
Decompress and contention and embrace the news.

75
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:06,040
The town of contention is very, very different.

76
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,140
There was a roadblock at the exit.

77
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:11,360
There are man-made puddles all over the place.

78
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,600
The town is quiet.

79
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,120
A massive wall of water filled with fish

80
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,620
surrounds the campus of the First Church of Contention.

81
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:22,640
In response, John Lee Bettymore the Thirth

82
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:25,460
just repeatedly slapped Keith's dad's watch

83
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,800
on wrist after wrist in an attempt

84
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,560
to gain as much information as possible.

85
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,220
One of those visions brought the name Silas Cole

86
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,780
back into the story.

87
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:38,660
Silas Cole was one of the founders of contention.

88
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:41,200
In his speech at his daughter's funeral,

89
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,640
Stan Manstein claimed.

90
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:48,640
My daughter was kind, hardworking, and good every time.

91
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,920
She was those things when she was a police officer.

92
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,720
She was those things when she was a school teacher.

93
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,920
She was those things when she was a historian.

94
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:03,000
You see, one long time ago when this land was stolen

95
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,320
and pioneer towns began to form,

96
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:08,400
Silas Cole was a miner in the mine

97
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,080
that employed the town nearby of contention.

98
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,040
While down in the mines,

99
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:17,720
Silas Cole came upon an odd black substance

100
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,700
and he became obsessed with studying it.

101
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:24,480
The substance was invisible to others, but not to Cole.

102
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,560
Exploiting the substance's wrong qualities,

103
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,280
he became an inventor and made so much money

104
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,400
off of his inventions that he bought the mine.

105
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,400
He built an office on the top floor

106
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,840
of the tall, skinny mining company building

107
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,640
that sat right above the mine itself.

108
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,840
He began to harvest the residue

109
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:46,400
and acquired a much firmer grasp on its tendencies.

110
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,120
He invented wild, magical things.

111
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,040
Each new invention brought him wealth and power,

112
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:56,680
but also released more of this inky substance into the town.

113
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,960
To divert his raising paranoia,

114
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,120
he began looking for a partner.

115
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,440
He found a similarly intelligent engineer

116
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,000
in his wife, Mary Cole, who could also see the substance

117
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,200
as they began calling residue.

118
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,920
But Silas Cole was scared of their inventions.

119
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:15,000
He became paranoid that other people could see the residue

120
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,520
that was loose all over the town.

121
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,560
Consumed, he believed the town was plotting against him,

122
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,820
so he began kidnapping people he suspected knew too much.

123
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,700
The town was suspicious of the disappearances,

124
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:31,920
but most of the ones gone were bad people.

125
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,720
The whole saloon staff, the bartender, Miss Kitty,

126
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,820
the piano player, there's a few gamblers,

127
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:39,420
the town drunk, so they kept their heads down

128
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,220
and went about their business.

129
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,180
But then some good people disappeared,

130
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:46,460
a professor, a circuit judge, a rancher, a homesteader,

131
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:50,100
the homesteader's wife, then the preacher disappeared.

132
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,900
The town freaked out and they hired a roaming cowboy

133
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,180
named Cornelius Beans to kill

134
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:58,540
their weird, paranoid figurehead.

135
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:01,820
Silas and Mary Cole were never seen again.

136
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:04,500
Neither was Cornelius Beans.

137
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:08,300
That was the history of contention,

138
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:12,580
when my daughter's name was Mia or Leah or Micah or Ben,

139
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:15,380
but her name is Ari forever now,

140
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,820
and our history is different.

141
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:20,660
Mine is now definite.

142
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:24,540
Before they could continue binge-watching,

143
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,940
Keith heard the voice of Terrence Licker

144
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:29,380
threateningly holler at Randy Anx

145
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:32,100
from an idling truck about a block away.

146
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,860
Keith has beef.

147
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:37,540
Tea Licker owes him three fucking dollars.

148
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,460
At Randy's, John found his cousin, Jimmy,

149
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,880
a bit off his rocker in a truck bed

150
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,020
that's been puddle-teamed,

151
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,340
and Clark saw Randy through the window

152
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:51,380
being held down by a man in cahoots with Terrence Licker.

153
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:53,120
Keith just grabbed the keys

154
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,820
from out of the truck's ignition,

155
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,840
tipping off the opposition,

156
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,820
delivering us now to a scene

157
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:01,220
that puts the tension in contention.

158
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:04,900
It's kudzu with no back bone.

159
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:38,100
Hello, everyone, and welcome to Pretending to Be People.

160
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,460
We are on episode 80.

161
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:43,660
My name is Zach, and I am the one leading you

162
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:46,980
through this adventure with my words,

163
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,460
just painting pictures of scenes

164
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:54,220
that you are then forced to see inside of your own mind,

165
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:58,180
and helping me concoct these very, very logical

166
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:01,180
and easy-to-follow stories are my three...

167
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,900
...e...

168
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:19,940
...best friends.

169
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,620
Thanks for having us. Oh, this is really awkward.

170
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:24,260
We are three best friends,

171
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,940
but we're not best friends with you.

172
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,700
Yes! Yeah, we're all three best friends.

173
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,500
No, no, no, like the three of us.

174
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,740
The three of us are best friends.

175
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,060
He owns us, so we're his.

176
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:36,180
No, but we've done, like, his three best friends.

177
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,900
I definitely have three best friends here, for sure.

178
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:41,020
Yeah, exactly, is what we're trying to say,

179
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:43,100
but every time we get together with you,

180
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,980
you're like, I've got these stories to tell.

181
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:48,620
You have to play in them, and it's like, God,

182
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:52,860
sometimes I just want to fucking tell you about my day.

183
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,260
Anyway, that's why you're not top three.

184
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,700
Oh, that's a really good point, Thomas.

185
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,500
Tell me about your day.

186
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,060
Oh, well, it's...

187
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,220
I fucking got you.

188
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,740
I don't consider you one of my best friends,

189
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,340
so I don't want to share that.

190
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,700
It's 2020, Thomas, tell me about your day.

191
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,740
What?

192
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:20,180
Tell me about your day.

193
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,740
It rained today.

194
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,420
It did rain all day.

195
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:26,020
My dog got muddy, and I gave her a bath.

196
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:29,300
I had to wipe my dog's paws off when he came inside,

197
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,260
but he didn't get muddy.

198
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,300
I let my dog run around outside for an hour,

199
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,820
and she rolled in mud.

200
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:34,660
I said, you know what?

201
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:35,500
Have your fun.

202
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,100
I let Joe outside, but his feet were dry as fuck

203
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,140
when he came back in.

204
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,500
It's a thing that they do.

205
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:44,500
They're so dry.

206
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,540
They just auto dry.

207
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:49,380
Joe, I so enjoy our walks.

208
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,220
I do too.

209
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,780
Sometimes you let me off the leash.

210
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:56,220
Until you attack families.

211
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:00,380
I just get excited.

212
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:06,220
I've just been picturing Joe this whole time.

213
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:08,060
On all fours.

214
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:13,060
Yeah, but like smiling, like smile growling.

215
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,900
Hey, so everybody keeping it together during quarantine?

216
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:17,740
Nope.

217
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,420
All right.

218
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,540
It's hard to

219
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:27,540
get anything done.

220
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:34,060
I'm having a difficult time focusing on anything.

221
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:38,060
You guys, do you guys feel my, feel it?

222
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:40,380
Have you tried staying up until like five or six

223
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,700
in the morning and then waking up after noon,

224
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,120
quite a bit after noon?

225
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,140
You know what?

226
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:46,960
I have.

227
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,800
That's how I tried.

228
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,340
That was the first thing I tried, yeah.

229
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,900
The cool thing that happens with me

230
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,540
is that my sleep schedule seems to just like rotate

231
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:58,300
throughout the week as if it's completely divorced

232
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:02,100
from the rotation of our own planet.

233
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:07,100
So one day a week for sure I'll be up till five

234
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,980
and then that kind of shifts.

235
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:14,540
Sometimes I go to bed at 7 p.m. and then wake up at 5 a.m.

236
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:16,600
and then other times it's the opposite.

237
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,700
Yeah, my vices are pushing me basically

238
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,380
like wholeheartedly at this point.

239
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:25,120
They've taken the reins on when I sleep.

240
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,540
So it's purely caffeine and weed,

241
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,820
just like back and forth and back and forth

242
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:35,020
until I am either awake and able to do stuff

243
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,960
like freak out or asleep.

244
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,220
I've been huffing paint to go to sleep.

245
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:43,620
Congrats, man.

246
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:44,440
I'm really proud of you.

247
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,660
I ran out of glue, so.

248
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,100
Gotta graduate.

249
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,840
I don't know which one I prefer, honestly.

250
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,860
I prefer Glue, Luke.

251
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:52,700
Glue.

252
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,520
Glue.

253
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,640
Paint Luke is a little edgy.

254
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,200
You don't like my silver goatee?

255
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,980
Five years.

256
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,640
It doesn't feel like it's been five years

257
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,660
since Fairy Road came out, but it has been

258
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,080
and that's what we're talking about for this whole hour

259
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,200
here on Pretending to Be People.

260
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,360
Oh, that'd be fucking awesome.

261
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,200
I would do that.

262
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,060
Half decade anniversary of one of the greatest

263
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:15,900
action movies ever made.

264
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:18,160
Did it really come out five years ago?

265
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,000
Damn.

266
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,120
I saw it in IMAX.

267
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,000
It blew my mind.

268
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,320
I saw it three times in theaters.

269
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,000
I saw it twice in theaters.

270
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,620
The second time was someone who I dated

271
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:33,640
for nearly two years, but I shouldn't have

272
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,560
because at the start of our relationship

273
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:38,720
we saw Fury Road and she was like, I fucking hated that.

274
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,440
Yeah, you should have known to hop out

275
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,920
right then and there, but if you had,

276
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:48,540
we wouldn't be friends, so I'm glad that you stuck around.

277
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,560
Sorry and thanks.

278
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,400
I can't imagine that she would

279
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,640
much less make it 80 episodes.

280
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,400
Every time I worry about saying something,

281
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,560
A, they're not gonna listen to it this far in

282
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,120
and B, if they just decided to like listen

283
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,480
to episode 80 for some reason,

284
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,040
if they make it all the way through Wolf the Dog

285
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,680
not knowing what the fuck is going on,

286
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,760
then they deserve to hear what I think about it.

287
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,400
Who are you thinking about in particular right now

288
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,400
that you wanna just say like fuck you two

289
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,240
or like something bad about him?

290
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,400
My dad, I love him so much that it's just like,

291
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,160
you know when you love someone so much,

292
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:30,080
you know when you're like.

293
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,360
Fuck you, dad.

294
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,960
C, Thomas, when a boy loves his father.

295
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,200
Very much.

296
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,880
Do you guys wanna play some role playing?

297
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,120
I wanna hear more about the dads and the Bs.

298
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,980
You fuck your dad and make a mom.

299
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:48,900
Where do mommies come from?

300
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,260
When a son loves a father very much.

301
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:03,340
Yes, we here at Pretending to Be People

302
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:08,340
are very tolerant, even encouraging of behavior

303
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,220
far past that that is recognized as appropriate.

304
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,380
Hold on, encouraging?

305
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:18,860
Oh yeah, no, I just misspoke terribly just now.

306
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:21,780
Not when I'm in it all.

307
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:25,180
Listen, we here at PTBP defend your right

308
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,860
to fuck your dad.

309
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,060
Consensually.

310
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,180
In the pursuit of a mom.

311
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:30,220
Right. Exactly.

312
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,060
Okay, so now that we're all on the same page.

313
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:33,100
We're pro mom.

314
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:38,220
As it says in Ecclesiastes 4.16.

315
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,980
Fuck your dad.

316
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,460
In the pursuit of your mom.

317
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,300
Yes.

318
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,660
John Lee Pettymore the third is standing

319
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:49,820
on the driveway of Randy Angst's home.

320
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:52,400
He's staring into the bed of a truck

321
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,620
that is made into a puddle that is teaming with fish

322
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:59,880
and also not so much teaming, but consisting of a body

323
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,800
that it belongs to Jimmy Sanders.

324
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,540
However, the mind of Jimmy Sanders,

325
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:06,560
it is unsure of whether or not he is still in there

326
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,540
because he is not acting himself.

327
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:11,780
When he saw John Lee Pettymore the third,

328
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:15,660
he dove into this water around the side of the car,

329
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:18,340
standing there with holding the keys.

330
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:20,580
They were just in the ignition of this truck

331
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,980
is Keith Vigna.

332
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,980
And standing outside the side of the house,

333
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:27,660
looking in the window is Clark Bishop.

334
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:31,420
You notice that this man, this burly as fuck,

335
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:36,160
five foot four, rocky sweat suit wearing motherfucker.

336
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:39,260
You know him as Fade.

337
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:40,660
It's a nickname.

338
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:44,780
His name is Luca Fajevic, but everybody calls him Fade.

339
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:45,620
Shout out.

340
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,660
Luke was like, what'd you call me?

341
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:52,540
Shout out to Lucas from Connecticut,

342
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:56,580
one of our patrons who is at the $10 level,

343
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:59,500
which is called the honorary police officers.

344
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:04,500
And he submitted Luca Fade Fajevic as his MPC.

345
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:08,780
Luca Fade Fajevic and Terrence Licker

346
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:11,180
are standing over Randy Angst.

347
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:15,640
And Randy Angst is face down in his own carpet

348
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,140
wearing a fancy blue suit.

349
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:20,900
And to the right of him, there's a cane.

350
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:24,940
You'd remember that Randy Angst uses a cane to get around,

351
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,860
so it's not necessarily great.

352
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:28,620
You do see this cane next to him

353
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:31,420
has a big Rubik's Cube on the top.

354
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:36,340
Standing right behind Luca Fade Fajevic

355
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:40,260
is T. Licker, Terrence Licker,

356
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:43,260
famed beef-haver with Keith Bigna.

357
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,460
Beef house.

358
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:45,780
I smell like beef.

359
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:49,060
He says, all right there, Randy.

360
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:50,960
We just need to get you on out there.

361
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,980
We need bodies and you know we need them.

362
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:55,680
And you know, if you want things to go back,

363
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,920
if you want back to where it used to be,

364
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,380
then you can have it, you know?

365
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:03,660
And the truck engine outside stops.

366
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:07,140
It's combat order time, and I say combat order,

367
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,620
but what I really mean is initiative.

368
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:13,100
And therefore, we will begin as we always do

369
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,060
with Clark Bishop.

370
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,720
Do they see me?

371
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,220
Wait, do we have said initiative?

372
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:22,060
The initiative in Delta Green is based on dexterity

373
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:25,140
and therefore it should be Clark Bishop,

374
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:28,420
then Keith Bigna, then John Lee Pettymore, I believe.

375
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,220
Mine is a default 55,

376
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:32,820
but I think if I've annotated this right,

377
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:36,080
that's minus 10 for my robot abilities, so 45.

378
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:36,980
I'm at 60.

379
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:39,560
And Clark Bishop has a talent that lets him go first

380
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,140
at the beginning of any combat.

381
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:43,440
And because I like to make things easy on myself,

382
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:48,180
it always goes PCs, then NPCs, then back to the PCs.

383
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,820
So you guys get to begin first.

384
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,020
Clark Bishop, what are you doing?

385
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:51,940
They heard the car stop.

386
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:55,120
Do they look up and see me or where do they look?

387
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,500
They look to the front of the house.

388
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,780
They do not see you.

389
00:18:58,780 --> 00:18:59,860
When we were approaching the house,

390
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:02,180
I assumed there was a back door on this place.

391
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:06,300
I'm gonna try sneaking my way back to the back door.

392
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,760
Okay, Keith Bigna, what are you doing?

393
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,940
I wanna search the console and the truck

394
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,180
and see if there's anything in there.

395
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,180
Okay, real search.

396
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:15,380
What are you looking for?

397
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:17,060
He asked right as you crit.

398
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,820
Everything you have.

399
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:23,500
I'm just looking in there to see what's in there,

400
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,460
but mostly I'm looking for money,

401
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:28,100
specifically at least $3

402
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:31,900
and any weapons that might be in there.

403
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,620
I know that you critically succeeded,

404
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:36,100
but there's no chance that there's money in there

405
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:40,380
because that'll be so much more fun to role play out later.

406
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,440
So if you're looking for weapons.

407
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,980
I don't know, it'd be pretty fucking funny

408
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:49,620
if Keith finds three bucks in that guy's center console

409
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,900
and then comes in like, the debt is settled

410
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,540
and he has no fucking clue what Keith's talking about.

411
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:59,180
Make it so.

412
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:01,240
That's what the bald man says, right?

413
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,600
Yeah, zero, zero.

414
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,480
If I roll a zero, that's a critical failure, right?

415
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,320
That's 100?

416
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,220
That's 100.

417
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,060
Yeah.

418
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,800
Good thing I just rolled that idly.

419
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,620
I need to stop doing that.

420
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:15,500
I know, I don't know.

421
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,700
Luke, what do you want?

422
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,700
I mean, I don't know.

423
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,040
Give me something cool.

424
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,260
Oh, okay, yeah, no, sorry.

425
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:29,060
You open up the glove box and I will ask Joe and Thomas

426
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,900
to take your headphones off.

427
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:34,080
Luke, when Keith Vigna reaches into the console

428
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:38,220
and opens it, there is a piece of paper,

429
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:42,020
standard, eight and a half by 11, folded four times,

430
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:45,600
and when you unfold it, it is a picture of you,

431
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,340
Keith Vigna, handwritten underneath it.

432
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:52,980
It says, bring alive.

433
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,200
Oh shit.

434
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,000
You also find a mag light.

435
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,840
Okay.

436
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,480
Like one of those long, hefty mag lights,

437
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:02,240
so now you've got like a legit flashlight

438
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,440
as well as basically a lead pipe as far as.

439
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,280
Tight, tight.

440
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,240
You can do some serious damage with the guy.

441
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,060
Okey-doke.

442
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,160
I found an atom bomb.

443
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,400
Actually, we're trying to go more woke.

444
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,280
It's an Eve bomb.

445
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,120
What's that?

446
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,120
Oh shit.

447
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:24,400
So I hit the red button and I explode the atom bomb.

448
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,000
Thomas, John Lee Pettymore, what are you doing?

449
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,300
Yeah, probably dying if Luke blows up the atom bomb.

450
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,140
I asked him what he wanted.

451
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:42,140
No, no, I'm fishing around in the truck bed

452
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,240
trying to pull Jimmy Sanders out of the water.

453
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,080
Yeah, okay.

454
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:50,280
As you grab onto his arm, he kind of surfaces

455
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,800
and he's like.

456
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,240
I gave him two big slaps.

457
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,480
Two big slaps?

458
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,600
Okay, roll unarmed combat.

459
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,640
Okay, 87.

460
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,800
I pass with a 32.

461
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,880
Nope, I failed.

462
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,560
He dodges out of the way of both slaps

463
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:13,080
and dives back underneath the water

464
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,240
as you hear the front door open.

465
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,420
I turn to look at that.

466
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:21,880
You see, Luka Fajevic, this super burly,

467
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,880
quite short, wide dude comes out,

468
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,960
these bright white teeth looking like Rocky.

469
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:32,960
He comes out first and he has got a crowbar in his hand.

470
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,000
Hey, who the fuck?

471
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,760
And he looks and he, of course,

472
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:40,120
he sees Keith Vigna inside of the truck

473
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:45,120
and he sees John Lee Pettymore III standing in the driveway.

474
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:49,080
Oh, Terrence, Terrence, hey man, get over here.

475
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,400
We found him.

476
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,240
He came to us.

477
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,420
He's just right here.

478
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,960
Let's fucking get him.

479
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:58,640
And Fajevic is coming straight for you and he is.

480
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,840
He's walking here.

481
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,920
And Terrence Liger is following behind

482
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:11,160
but does not seem to have any sort of weapon

483
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,840
in his hand currently.

484
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:16,720
Keith motherfucking beans, you piece of shit.

485
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:21,480
And he comes out and he's reaching behind him currently

486
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,680
in his back pocket.

487
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,320
Clark Bishop, it is your turn

488
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,540
and you are walking in the back door currently.

489
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:28,640
I wanna get to Randy.

490
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,360
Is he still on the ground?

491
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,960
Oh, God, yes.

492
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,800
We're here to help you.

493
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,620
We're here to help you.

494
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,460
Hang on.

495
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:35,280
Yes, shh.

496
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,120
Find cover, find cover.

497
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,680
I wanna kind of walk past him to the front.

498
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,400
I mean, I'm sneaking up on the guys.

499
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,240
You can do that.

500
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,360
He's gonna crawl into his fireplace.

501
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,020
Does it smell like Randy shit his pants?

502
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:45,860
Oh, no.

503
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:51,160
And the house just reeks of,

504
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:55,560
it's like the heat is turned up super, super high

505
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,920
because it is pretty cold out today.

506
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,000
It's been a temperate December so far

507
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,480
but this is certainly the coldest it's been,

508
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,240
mostly so that the animals would have somewhere

509
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,320
to be for a while and I could really get that plot going.

510
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:13,040
But, so as it's gotten much colder,

511
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,680
Randy has got the heat turned way up.

512
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:18,880
So it's like that thing where you fart in the shower

513
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,000
and the heat just like keeps it down.

514
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,560
What?

515
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,400
Do you not know what I'm talking about?

516
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,000
I know what you're talking about.

517
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,240
What do you mean keeps it down?

518
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,540
It keeps it down.

519
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:33,200
Like permeates it.

520
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,840
Keeps it down wasn't really the right-

521
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,640
No, cause like heat rises and farts are heat.

522
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,360
You're saying you fart up the whole shower

523
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,600
and it keeps it in there.

524
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:45,760
Yeah, because like the steam is sitting on top of the fart

525
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,560
cause the fart can't make it through the steam, right?

526
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,720
And so the fart is just like where your head is

527
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,200
cause the steam's right above that.

528
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:57,200
Where's your head at in your farts, in your fart?

529
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,920
No, that doesn't happen to me when I fart in the shower.

530
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,520
Whatever loser.

531
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,920
All right, so you guys are,

532
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,920
Randy Yanks' house smells like shit cause it's hot fart.

533
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,280
Farting out so many shit particles

534
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:17,760
that they're able to attach to like the water droplets

535
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,600
and permeate the air.

536
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,720
Well, I'm not going to poop before I get in the shower.

537
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,000
I'm not saying you should, but,

538
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,160
oh wait, actually you should.

539
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,000
There's nothing worse than-

540
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,120
There's literally, it's the worst feeling on earth.

541
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,400
The humid after shower shit.

542
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,460
Getting a hot shower, taking a shit

543
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:35,540
and just having the toilet paper just soggy and-

544
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:37,380
Oh my God.

545
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:38,220
Oh God.

546
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,060
Just poop in the shower.

547
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:40,620
And then you take another shower.

548
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,780
Yep, a minute second shower.

549
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:44,100
And cheese grate it.

550
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,260
Just smash it down.

551
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,940
Is that where you just stomp it?

552
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:49,140
Oh yeah, I knew it had a name.

553
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:51,060
Pour some shampoo on it to clean it.

554
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:53,820
Pour some shampoo on it.

555
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:57,460
Thomas is here for these songs.

556
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:58,300
Dang, I love it.

557
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,980
I can't wait until we're all in one room

558
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:01,220
and we can sing together.

559
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:03,820
Oh my God, I miss it.

560
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:05,620
Smells like shit in this house.

561
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:07,300
Keith Vigna, it's your turn.

562
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,860
I help Randy into the fireplace and I say,

563
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,780
dude, it smells like a shower fart in here.

564
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:16,780
I'm so sorry, it's just that the heat is pushing it down.

565
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:20,460
Joe, real fucking talk,

566
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,740
does it happen to you in the shower?

567
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:26,580
I don't know the science behind it, but yes, it does.

568
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:29,420
Yes, I feel like when I fart in the shower, I get nothing.

569
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:30,860
Like it dissipates better.

570
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,980
When we're in the shower together.

571
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:36,980
Oh yeah, when we're all pressed together, then yeah.

572
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:39,100
Like obviously, right.

573
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:42,140
I also can't wait until we're all in one room to do that.

574
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,780
Right, that's how we usually record

575
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:46,100
all naked together in a shower.

576
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:49,620
It's just the audio quality is so much better.

577
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:52,300
Well, I mean, that's the work you put in

578
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:55,340
to take the shower sounds out of each track.

579
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:58,780
And I know that takes you roughly 72 hours per track.

580
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:02,540
It's a lot of music and rubber ducky in the background.

581
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:03,620
You got to edit all that out.

582
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:06,140
That's the work that goes into each podcast, y'all,

583
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:09,020
before this horrible quarantine situation

584
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:11,580
where we can't shower and record together anymore.

585
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:14,100
Heartbreaking is what I would call that.

586
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:14,940
Fartbreaking.

587
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:17,260
Honestly, we have it the worst.

588
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,820
Keith Vigna, you are...

589
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:24,540
That was a good one.

590
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:27,220
Keith, you're in the cab of this truck

591
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:29,940
as these two men walk outside.

592
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:30,780
What do you do?

593
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:34,340
I see them, I jump out of the truck,

594
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:38,660
I get my gun, and I yell,

595
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:40,860
don't come any closer, I'll shoot.

596
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:43,180
And when the camera pans back to me,

597
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:45,220
I've got the gun up to my own head.

598
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:47,060
Yes!

599
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,780
Chomp, chomping right there.

600
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:51,060
Hell yes, hell yes.

601
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:52,500
Oh, you get 10 luck.

602
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,340
Hell yeah.

603
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,500
Nice, hell yeah.

604
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,900
Thomas, do the same thing.

605
00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:00,420
He puts the watch on.

606
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:03,340
I put my gun to Keith's head.

607
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:10,500
Okay, John Lee, Betty Moore III, what are you doing?

608
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,580
Trevor, Trevor is his name?

609
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:13,420
Nope, Terrence.

610
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,420
Terrence, Terrence.

611
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:16,060
You've known this guy for years.

612
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:16,900
Yeah, John has.

613
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,820
You've heard me talk about him forever.

614
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:21,260
Terrence has his hand on his gun, right?

615
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,580
But the other guy does not.

616
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:24,820
The other guy's holding a crowbar.

617
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:26,580
Oh yeah, I just start firing at them,

618
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:29,260
trying to suppress them and get them back into the house.

619
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:33,100
Okay, roll firearms and who are you firing at?

620
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:35,100
Both of them or are you just doing suppressing fire?

621
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,740
Are you actually trying to hit somebody?

622
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:37,580
Crowbar guy.

623
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,420
Fade.

624
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:39,860
I wanna leave the other one for Luke.

625
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,540
Very kind.

626
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:43,260
That's just good storytelling right there.

627
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:45,100
That's friendship storytelling.

628
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,260
It's like it would be smarter

629
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,500
to take out the guy with the gun, but.

630
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,340
Yeah, probably.

631
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:55,180
47 on a six D.

632
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:57,980
Roll a D 10.

633
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:58,820
Three.

634
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,940
All right, three will be a shoulder hit

635
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:03,980
as John Lee Pettymore pulls his firearm

636
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:08,820
and hits Luca Fade Fudgevitz right in the shoulder.

637
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:12,180
Hands off your fucking gun, drop the crowbar.

638
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:14,660
So you fire at him while yelling that

639
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:18,180
and this just like jacked dude.

640
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:21,300
You know Fade is the guy who has just been like

641
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:25,980
hanging out on his front lawn for the past like four years,

642
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:28,460
only doing like arm day.

643
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:31,100
Like he only gives a fuck about his upper body.

644
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:33,300
So he's got these little chicken legs now,

645
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,180
whereas you know, like when he was younger,

646
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:37,740
he used to be like a bodybuilder

647
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:40,020
and now he's just given up on his legs.

648
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,740
He's got this massive upper body

649
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:43,460
and as soon as you shoot him in the shoulder,

650
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:45,620
he drops the crowbar and he's like,

651
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,780
ow, ow, what the fuck, man?

652
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:50,580
They didn't know he couldn't do that, man.

653
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:53,340
Luca, are you just that nice, man?

654
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:55,900
It's just Fade, it's me, man.

655
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:59,140
Fade, I'm sorry about your sick lats,

656
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:03,140
but you're coming at some police officers.

657
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,580
You gotta put those weapons down.

658
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:08,620
I know, you're police officers, what?

659
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:11,540
And he like slumps up against the garage,

660
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:13,860
like backs into the garage

661
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:16,380
and then slumps down the white garage door,

662
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:20,740
leaving a trail of red as he like hits his butt

663
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:22,940
on the concrete below and he's like,

664
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:25,660
man, we just want Keith, man.

665
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:29,220
This is my voice now forever, man.

666
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,380
Keith's with us.

667
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:32,860
And as you say Keith's with us,

668
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:37,260
Terrence Licker holds his gun at his head.

669
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:41,020
Keith, Vigna, you think you can play mind games with me?

670
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:44,140
You think you were here about the smartest man in town,

671
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:47,420
but I think otherwise with Anya, for sure.

672
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:53,140
Terrence, is his back to the door?

673
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:54,060
It is.

674
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,780
I wanna sneak up and wrestle away the gun from him,

675
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:58,260
from behind him.

676
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:00,100
I feel like I should get some kind of advantage on that.

677
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,300
He doesn't know I'm in there.

678
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,500
He doesn't know I'm in there.

679
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,460
He's got it up against his head.

680
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:06,940
So how are you doing that?

681
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:08,060
Pulling his arm backwards

682
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:09,420
so it's gonna hurt his arm some

683
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:11,740
and get the gun pointed not at his head.

684
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,140
And I'm trying to get it out of his hand.

685
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,420
I'm trying to take it for my own.

686
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:16,060
I'll give you an option.

687
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:17,900
I will either let you do this

688
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:20,220
if you can pass a stealth check

689
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:25,180
or I'll just give you a bonus on your unarmed combat.

690
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:26,820
I'll take the bonus on the unarmed.

691
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:29,300
Okay, so he'll roll against you on that.

692
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:31,140
Go ahead and roll that unarmed combat.

693
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:37,060
What's my bonus?

694
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:40,940
Oh, you get a plus 20.

695
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:43,660
You sure it's not plus 30, right?

696
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:47,820
So as you go to grab this guy's gun,

697
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:51,060
his hands go straight up in the air, the gun fires,

698
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:53,820
and then the gun falls to the ground

699
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:55,900
out of the reach of either one of you.

700
00:31:55,900 --> 00:32:00,500
It flings itself as it's firing up out of your hands

701
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:04,780
and you two are just standing right outside the front door

702
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:08,220
almost to the driveway of Randy Angst's home,

703
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:10,940
gun 10 feet away in the grass.

704
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:11,780
Keith Vigna.

705
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:15,580
I want to run at him with the mag light

706
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:17,860
and try to whack him in the head.

707
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,300
Yeah, yeah, okay.

708
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:23,420
Actually, so he crit failed with a 99.

709
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:26,060
Okay, do I need to roll anything?

710
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:26,900
Yeah, go ahead and roll.

711
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,740
Melee weapons.

712
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,780
An eight on a 30.

713
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:31,820
Hell yeah, tweet.

714
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:35,380
So basically whatever you want to happen

715
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:37,900
can happen here close to it.

716
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,500
As the scuffle's going on or whatever,

717
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,820
the gun goes off, I holster my gun,

718
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:45,580
grab the flashlight from the front seat,

719
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:49,460
run over to him and just like right in the teeth,

720
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:50,580
hit him with the mag light.

721
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:54,500
Oof, roll a D6.

722
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,340
Three.

723
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,180
You shoot him in the shoulder.

724
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:59,900
It's a joke about how three damage did that earlier.

725
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,380
Fucking nailed it.

726
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:02,220
Trust it in.

727
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:07,380
So you hit him right in the mouth

728
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:11,900
and two teeth go flying as he hits the ground.

729
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:15,140
Clark, he is like pushed into you by this movement

730
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:18,140
and you are now in between him and the gun

731
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:22,340
and he is now prone on the ground, bleeding from his mouth.

732
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:25,820
Luka Fajevic's fade is also on the ground

733
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:28,940
with a gunshot wound in his shoulder bleeding

734
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:32,620
and Thomas is taking off his robe.

735
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:39,780
All right, there it is.

736
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:42,180
Oh, Luke is going shirtless as well.

737
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:43,020
Here we go.

738
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:47,540
I like the beanie with the shirtless look, Thomas.

739
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:49,300
It's a good combo there.

740
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:51,180
Thank you, it's cold in my house.

741
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,020
Oh.

742
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:59,140
You guys both have great nips.

743
00:33:59,140 --> 00:33:59,980
Thanks.

744
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:00,820
Am I allowed to say that?

745
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:02,300
No.

746
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,140
Oh, okay.

747
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:04,780
Luke, you've got great nips.

748
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:06,380
It's an invasion of my privacy.

749
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,020
Stop looking at me.

750
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:17,060
I have no idea where I was.

751
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:19,460
Oh no, did our distraction work?

752
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:27,020
Well, it's not like the NPCs were destroying you guys

753
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:30,540
so you were trying to distract me.

754
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:33,900
You've got this easily in hand, I believe, at this point.

755
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,060
Oh, I know, it's just late.

756
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:37,220
It is John Lee Pettymore's turn.

757
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:48,980
And obviously, John Lee Pettymore knows

758
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:50,620
exactly what's going on

759
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:54,420
because he wasn't wasting his time Zoom stripping.

760
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:55,580
You're good at that, by the way.

761
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:57,180
You might want to talk to Terrence Licker.

762
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:59,740
So, John Lee Pettymore,

763
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:02,220
you are looking at Luka Fade Fajevic

764
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:04,300
who is bleeding up against the garage.

765
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,580
You are looking at Keith Vigna

766
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:11,180
who just took a mag light to the face of Terrence Licker

767
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:13,860
who is now ass grounded.

768
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:16,980
And you see Clark Bishop just to the right of them.

769
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:18,620
Yes, I said ass grounded.

770
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:22,140
And Clark Bishop is standing to the right of them,

771
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:24,380
almost in the neighbor's yard at this point.

772
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:26,300
But you guys are all just around this

773
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:29,580
front of the house area and it is your turn currently.

774
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:31,220
All right, so gun drawn.

775
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:34,100
Don't move a fucking muscle, you're under arrest.

776
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,620
He's not even a cop.

777
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:37,900
I don't even think that one's a cop.

778
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:40,860
It's complicated, but I am.

779
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:42,500
You're under arrest.

780
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:45,180
None of y'all wearing police uniform.

781
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,380
Are you not even on duty?

782
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:48,140
You ain't been around, the world is different.

783
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:49,740
I shoot him in the leg.

784
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:54,740
No, I don't, dude, I don't actually.

785
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:58,180
So, okay, so he draws his gun and he says all that

786
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:59,460
and he's like, I am a cop.

787
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:03,060
Damn it.

788
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,340
All right, John Lee Pettymore's having like a breakdown

789
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:08,300
in the driveway, you cannot figure out what's going on.

790
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,820
Shut up, that's not what happens.

791
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:13,460
I'm such a strong man, why have I maimed him?

792
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:18,460
All right, I'm advancing on them with my gun drawn.

793
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,340
You're under arrest.

794
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:22,380
For real, I'm a cop.

795
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:26,420
Luca is the one closest to you and he's looking up at you

796
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:29,020
from the ground up against the garage.

797
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,300
Hey, hey, who are you?

798
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,580
A cop, god damn.

799
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:34,980
What, you're under arrest.

800
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:37,380
What are you doing with this Keith Wigner fella?

801
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:38,580
He's a cop too.

802
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:40,500
Yeah, but you weren't a cop here before.

803
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:43,500
I don't have time to explain any of this to you.

804
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:46,220
I am ball, motherfucker.

805
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:48,580
I slap him across the face and I handcuff him.

806
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:52,300
Okay, so here's a pretty decent issue.

807
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:54,060
You don't have any handcuffs.

808
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,060
Don't I?

809
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:56,140
No, you don't.

810
00:36:56,140 --> 00:37:00,180
You used your handcuffs on the body of Drew Andrews.

811
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:01,260
That's right.

812
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:04,660
No, no, no, no, no, those were Clark's handcuffs.

813
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:05,500
Yes.

814
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:06,620
But I don't know if you would have any.

815
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:08,620
Didn't you give me feet and hand shackles

816
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:11,140
because we said that that's what cops would use in the 70s?

817
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:11,980
Yeah.

818
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:17,500
But John Lee Pettymore is in the body of Kevin

819
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:20,420
who is in all black tactical gear

820
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:23,220
who has a lot of cool stuff,

821
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:27,380
probably like a silencer and like a laser sight

822
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:29,260
and like glow in the dark.

823
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:30,580
Some handcuffs.

824
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:33,300
Use laser cuffs on him.

825
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,140
Okay, okay.

826
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:37,700
If I'm fully like tactical, like survival loaded out,

827
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:38,660
I zip tie him.

828
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:39,660
There it is.

829
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,340
I just needed you to think.

830
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:42,180
Fuck off.

831
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,020
Ah!

832
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:45,140
All right.

833
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:45,980
It's late.

834
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:51,940
As you zip tie his hands,

835
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:55,020
I need whoever has the best alertness or alertness.

836
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:56,500
I got a 70.

837
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,340
Clark has the bishop it is.

838
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:02,580
Fuck me, a 73.

839
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:04,500
I don't know if I've passed a role

840
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,340
like in the last two episodes.

841
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:07,180
Don't worry.

842
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,820
I'm helping the podcast and the storyteller.

843
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:14,340
We're like out of combat essentially at this point.

844
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:16,180
Well, I'm gonna go pick up his gun.

845
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:17,020
Okay, yeah, done.

846
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:19,060
Yeah, I go over to him.

847
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:20,740
Is he face down or face up?

848
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:24,580
Clark, the gun is a little revolver, snub nose fella.

849
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:28,980
And Luke Terence is face up, ass grounded.

850
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:31,900
I go over to him and I just kind of like kick him

851
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:35,340
with my foot and like shove him over,

852
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:38,580
like roll him over to where he's on his stomach.

853
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:41,340
I reach in to his back pocket and grab his wallet

854
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:42,180
and look inside.

855
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:45,020
Hey, hey man, there ain't no need to do that.

856
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:46,460
What do I see inside the wallet?

857
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:49,260
Inside Terence Licker's wallet.

858
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:54,500
You know, he's got a punch card for Subtropolis

859
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:59,500
and he's got his ID and he's got a few credit cards,

860
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:04,540
like four or five credit cards, no debit card,

861
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:07,020
no library card, certainly not.

862
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:09,380
However, he's in Mensa.

863
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,020
So he's got a little Mensa ID card.

864
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:12,500
Does he have any cash on him?

865
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,460
Cash?

866
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:18,380
Go ahead and roll, roll a D20

867
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:21,060
to see how many dollars are in here.

868
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,300
Times 1000.

869
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,900
$13.

870
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:25,740
$13,000.

871
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:29,740
So he's got a $5 bill and an $8 bill.

872
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:35,020
No, 13 works out perfectly for you.

873
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:37,580
I open it up, I see there's 13 bucks in there.

874
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:41,460
I take the three ones, like hold it down by his face

875
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:43,340
and I'm like, we're even now.

876
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:45,900
And I like take the $10 bill and like rip it up

877
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:49,620
in front of him and then stick the $3 in my pocket.

878
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:50,700
I look at the guys, I'm like,

879
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,820
should we go to the pond now?

880
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:59,100
I'm glad you said that in front of these people.

881
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:03,740
Keith, it seems like maybe more to the mystery.

882
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:06,300
Yeah, sorry, I just, I kinda had.

883
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:08,620
I think we might be able to unravel some more right here.

884
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:10,300
You know, I focused in on the pond

885
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:12,620
and then I focused in on my getting even with this guy.

886
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:16,020
Sure, sure, I understand the $3 was your objective

887
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:17,620
and as soon as that was complete,

888
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:19,140
you're like, let's go, I get it.

889
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:22,380
Once I kinda like get my bearings back,

890
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:24,300
I look down at Terrence, hey,

891
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:26,280
if you can still talk without your teeth,

892
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,660
what's up with the bodies, why do you have this?

893
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:31,620
And I show him the picture of me that I found in his truck.

894
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:35,380
You son of a bitch, I ain't talking shit to you.

895
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:37,500
Please, now you say that.

896
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,540
I mean, you can roll.

897
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:40,380
Torture.

898
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:46,100
There are torture rules in the Delta Green handbook.

899
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:48,140
Of course there are, it's Delta Green.

900
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:51,820
Yeah, it's very legitimate and it uses willpower.

901
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:53,220
You don't know them offhand,

902
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:55,180
you fucking incompetent keeper.

903
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:56,580
Oh, we don't play Delta Green.

904
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:57,940
I know.

905
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:06,580
And so, Luke, you need to roll

906
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:10,940
either some sort of persuade or law.

907
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:12,500
Okay, I got a pretty good persuade.

908
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,060
Or you can go psychotherapy

909
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:15,260
if you wanna like try to turn a mind for it.

910
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:16,980
I got a four on a 70.

911
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:19,640
I ain't talking to you, I ain't giving you shit.

912
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,860
I wad up the picture of me and I'm like,

913
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:23,060
well, if you're not gonna talk

914
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:24,940
and I like shove it into his mouth.

915
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:29,980
Can I like talk now?

916
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:31,900
Okay, yeah, I'll talk now.

917
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:34,340
I didn't like having you inside my mouth.

918
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:35,300
Nobody does.

919
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:38,100
Hey, did we take that little bit of carpet

920
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:40,260
that we were shoving down Drew's throat

921
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:42,500
to see where people were?

922
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,180
I can't imagine that you didn't take it.

923
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:46,980
I mean, maybe it works on any throat.

924
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:48,900
We could just find out whatever we want.

925
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:51,860
Jesus, keep that in the back pocket.

926
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:53,580
Between that and the watch,

927
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:56,300
we've broken your game wide open, Zach.

928
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:57,900
I gave it to you.

929
00:41:58,780 --> 00:41:59,620
Use it.

930
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:03,420
So he spits it out.

931
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:05,180
Am I gonna have to keep going?

932
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:07,620
No, I told you I had talked to you now.

933
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:09,120
What do you want?

934
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:09,960
We're supposed to find you.

935
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,860
What are you doing here?

936
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:12,980
We're collecting.

937
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:14,140
What are you doing here?

938
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:16,020
Why do you have a picture of me?

939
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:19,180
And what's this with the bodies and disappearing?

940
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:20,780
Yeah, what do you want with Randy?

941
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:22,860
Okay, the last question

942
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:24,900
and the first question are the same.

943
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:28,220
So I will say that we're collecting.

944
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:29,740
We need more bodies.

945
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:30,860
Daddy needs more bodies.

946
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:31,700
For what?

947
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:32,780
I don't know if you've noticed,

948
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:36,200
but the world is completely off its filter

949
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:39,180
and daddy's gonna make everything better.

950
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:40,620
How's he gonna do that with bodies?

951
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:41,460
He's gonna go back.

952
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:43,020
He's gonna make everything better.

953
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:47,100
Do the bodies get to live after you're done with them?

954
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:48,140
Well, yeah, of course.

955
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:49,840
Everything's gonna go back to normal.

956
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,820
We're gonna go back to normal.

957
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:55,740
How are you, hold on, how are you using these bodies?

958
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,580
Well, we gotta sacrifice all these bodies

959
00:42:57,580 --> 00:43:00,260
so that daddy can go back

960
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:03,500
and make sure everything's normal from here on out, right?

961
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:05,700
So if he goes back and fixes everything,

962
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:07,460
then it won't be this way now.

963
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:08,700
You damn fool.

964
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:10,660
Daddy doesn't wanna take things back to the way they were.

965
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:12,080
Who the fuck are you?

966
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:14,140
Daddy wants to consolidate his power.

967
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:15,820
I'd like to walk up now and say,

968
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,060
you keep saying go back.

969
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:20,460
What do you mean by daddy wants to go back?

970
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:21,700
In time.

971
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:24,020
He's doing this with a sacrifice?

972
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:25,260
Well, if we have enough bodies,

973
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:26,700
we'll be able to make it happen.

974
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:28,440
Did daddy explain this to you

975
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:31,580
or is this something that you've learned recently?

976
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:33,820
How do you know about how this is gonna work?

977
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:35,740
Daddy explained it to everyone

978
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:40,740
and everyone at the First Creek family of contention knows

979
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:45,460
we need more bodies so that we can do the sacrifice

980
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:48,740
so that daddy can go back and fix everything.

981
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:50,620
You willing to sacrifice your body?

982
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:51,860
How many bodies you're gonna need?

983
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:53,580
No, I'm just a collector.

984
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:54,500
How many have you got?

985
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:55,320
Me?

986
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,160
I'm not winning.

987
00:43:57,580 --> 00:43:58,400
But-

988
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,860
He incentivized it into some kind of competition?

989
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:02,460
Well, of course you're not gonna collect

990
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:03,840
without a competition.

991
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,060
What do you win? What does winner get?

992
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:06,380
Winning gets whatever they want.

993
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:07,620
What do the losers get?

994
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:09,460
Well, the losers still fought the family

995
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:11,180
so ain't nobody really a loser.

996
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:12,820
But do they have to give their bodies?

997
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:15,220
Everybody giving their body, we all gonna die.

998
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:16,500
We're all dying anyway.

999
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:17,980
There ain't no living here.

1000
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:19,340
Have you seen contention?

1001
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:20,940
There ain't no living here.

1002
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:23,980
The only change we have having a real life is going back

1003
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:26,020
and daddy can go back and fix everything.

1004
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:27,100
If you don't wanna be a part of it,

1005
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:28,600
you need to go get on out of here,

1006
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:29,960
but we need to keep Keith

1007
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:32,860
because Keith is the key that's going back.

1008
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:33,900
Expand on that.

1009
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:36,060
Daddy needs Keith.

1010
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:38,260
So you just believe everything daddy tells you.

1011
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:40,900
And John, you look down, Clark, you look down as well,

1012
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:43,260
you see this piece of paper that he spit out

1013
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:45,660
that Keith Vigna shoved into his mouth

1014
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:49,020
is a picture of Keith Vigna.

1015
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:52,500
And below it, it says whatever I said earlier,

1016
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:55,220
but I'm gonna say, collect alive.

1017
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:57,860
I shoved the piece of carpet sample into his mouth

1018
00:44:57,860 --> 00:44:59,180
and I say, daddy.

1019
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:08,620
What the fuck was that?

1020
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:10,220
And his eyes get real big

1021
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:13,060
and then he starts squirming, horrified.

1022
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:17,780
He is extremely, extremely scared

1023
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:19,660
of John Lee Pettymore the third.

1024
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:23,020
When he looks up and sees John Lee Pettymore

1025
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:26,460
after John shoves this piece of carpet into his throat,

1026
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:29,020
he freaks out and he's like, you're one of them.

1027
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:30,620
How did you get, you're one of them.

1028
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:33,180
It's in you, it's in you.

1029
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:34,720
See, I think it's in you.

1030
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:36,480
I think it's in all of you.

1031
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:37,840
What are you doing with Jimmy?

1032
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:40,860
As you say that, you hear like a little splash

1033
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:45,860
and Jimmy Sanders with his long unkempt hippie hair

1034
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:50,020
does the like Bond girl fling out of the water

1035
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:52,980
that's in the back of this truck and looks over at you.

1036
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:57,120
Hey, number six, you know, extra cucumber.

1037
00:45:58,580 --> 00:46:00,920
It's not an oil spill, it lives here now.

1038
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:07,780
That's basically how Jimmy was before all this.

1039
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:09,020
So that's not, you know.

1040
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:12,980
Look at Terrence, are you using him to see the stuff?

1041
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:14,660
Oh yeah, of course we are.

1042
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:17,020
Right, because they use children and crazy people.

1043
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:18,060
Good job, Luke.

1044
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:20,940
Jimmy, do you see it on us?

1045
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:22,980
Oh, and you can't even approach Jimmy

1046
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:25,400
without him dipping into the water.

1047
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:27,820
As if he sees goo everywhere.

1048
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:30,100
No, it's specifically when he's looking at you

1049
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:31,560
and I need you to roll sanity.

1050
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:32,780
Me? Yes.

1051
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:35,140
Thomas, John is so fucked up that your cousin

1052
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:37,980
just keeps dunking his head in this water.

1053
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:40,860
Dude, 28 on a 25.

1054
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:44,700
Oh, you just lose one.

1055
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:46,500
But Luke and Joe, if you could take off

1056
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:47,900
your headphones real quick.

1057
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:55,220
Hey, Thomas.

1058
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:57,100
You just lose one sanity.

1059
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:59,480
However, you approached Jimmy Sanders

1060
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:02,580
who immediately like looks you in the face,

1061
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:07,580
gets extremely scared and then dips into the water

1062
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:10,500
and as you're turning back,

1063
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:13,260
you catch a reflection of yourself

1064
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:17,500
in the shotgun side mirror of this truck

1065
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:21,540
and there is black ooze dripping

1066
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:23,380
out of both of your nostrils,

1067
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:26,700
running down your face from both of your eyes,

1068
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:29,180
coming out maybe one of the sides of your mouth

1069
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:31,980
and running down from both of your ears

1070
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:35,080
and then you blink and it is not there

1071
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:37,140
and you look like you always do.

1072
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:38,420
Fuck.

1073
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:47,100
So you guys see Kevin Lee Pettymore

1074
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:49,100
take a step back from the truck

1075
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:51,080
and like he falls backwards.

1076
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:53,300
He lands on his ass.

1077
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:54,820
John, you all right?

1078
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:55,660
Trip there?

1079
00:47:56,580 --> 00:47:58,340
I'm walking over to try to help you out.

1080
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:00,020
Oh, hey, yeah.

1081
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:04,500
Kinda just for a second there out of the corner of my eye,

1082
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:09,420
saw the goo running out of all my orifices,

1083
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:13,460
so I blinked, it was gone,

1084
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:15,860
but it was there real as day.

1085
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:16,780
Was it doing anything?

1086
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:18,020
Did it move?

1087
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:21,860
Just oozing, just oozing,

1088
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:23,740
coming out of my nose, holes in my.

1089
00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:25,260
Should you take a dunk?

1090
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:27,640
And I look over at the truck.

1091
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:31,380
John's eyes get wide and he nods

1092
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:34,740
and he dives into that pool with Jimmy Sanders.

1093
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:36,800
You dive into it?

1094
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:40,720
I leap and I just body slam into the pool.

1095
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:41,680
Yeah, okay.

1096
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:44,420
Luke and Joe, I need you to take your headphones off again.

1097
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:45,260
Cool, cool, cool.

1098
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:55,620
John, as you break into the water,

1099
00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:57,980
into this puddle that has been formed

1100
00:48:57,980 --> 00:49:01,340
and teeming with fish in the back of this truck,

1101
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:05,500
your head vibrates like it's sizzling

1102
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:10,500
and you feel basically in your ears and in your nose,

1103
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:15,140
you feel like when your ears are super clogged up

1104
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:18,600
and then you pour hydrogen peroxide or something in there

1105
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:22,460
and it like bubbles up crazy, like insane bubbles.

1106
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:25,740
And all you can hear is like.

1107
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:31,300
And you feel it in your nose and it like tickles

1108
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:35,180
and there's something inside of your head

1109
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:40,180
that is just like throbbing and all of a sudden,

1110
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:42,860
you feel yourself rolling.

1111
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:47,780
You feel yourself rolling back and forth comfortably.

1112
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:53,660
It's a nostalgic feeling and it reminds you of family.

1113
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:58,340
It's warmth, it's comfort.

1114
00:49:58,340 --> 00:49:59,260
You said come.

1115
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:01,100
You can feel.

1116
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:02,820
You said come for it.

1117
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:07,860
Gross.

1118
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:11,740
Welcome to Fort come.

1119
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:14,040
Okay, shit.

1120
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:19,040
So, ew, God, I just keep picturing like Santa Claus' workshop

1121
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:25,080
Yeah, cause it's like all the frosting and shit,

1122
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:26,140
but it's just gum.

1123
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:31,380
It's like a gingerbread house, but it's cum.

1124
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:32,580
Instead of peppermints,

1125
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:35,100
like there's just cock rings all over it and like.

1126
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:36,500
Too far.

1127
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:37,780
Oh boy.

1128
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:39,840
Yeah, you just feel yourself rolling back and forth

1129
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:42,940
and then you realize that you are rolling back and forth

1130
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:44,160
in a palm.

1131
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:47,100
Okay.

1132
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:49,300
And then you lift your head above the water

1133
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:50,580
and immediately.

1134
00:50:56,980 --> 00:50:59,500
The smell is awful.

1135
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:00,340
Like a shower.

1136
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:03,540
There is a distinct stench.

1137
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:06,340
It is fishy, but it is rancid.

1138
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:09,120
It is overpoweringly stinky.

1139
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:11,420
After Jon lifts his head above the water,

1140
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:16,420
you all smell this and it is coming from the truck bed

1141
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:19,860
and it fucking reeks.

1142
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:21,900
Jon, I need you to roll constitution

1143
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:24,220
to not puke on your cousin.

1144
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:27,360
Which is lower than my constitution.

1145
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:31,180
What's your throw up like?

1146
00:51:31,180 --> 00:51:32,500
It's nuts and bolts.

1147
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:39,120
Yeah, I imagine there's like some synthetic oils in it.

1148
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:43,060
Do androids dream of electric barf?

1149
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:46,460
You are mostly human.

1150
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:48,140
Then it's a mostly human barf,

1151
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:50,780
but there is still some motor oil in there.

1152
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:53,980
Yeah, that completely adds up for me.

1153
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:56,140
But mostly just because you've been drinking motor oil

1154
00:51:56,140 --> 00:51:57,780
the whole way back to contention.

1155
00:51:57,780 --> 00:51:59,220
Stop or we're gonna have to stop

1156
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:01,000
for you to pee again, Thomas.

1157
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:01,900
Oh my.

1158
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:06,900
So he just yaks all up in this puddle that has been created.

1159
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:10,640
And Jimmy Sanders is, it doesn't live here.

1160
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:16,000
He's just got extra meat.

1161
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,380
And then he's gonna stand up

1162
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:21,500
and then he's gonna sit back down.

1163
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:23,380
It's a confusing guy, Jimmy Sanders.

1164
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:27,700
Hey there, he got a, what the?

1165
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:29,620
That man over there, he licked himself,

1166
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:31,740
freaked out, jumped in there and started throwing up.

1167
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:34,460
What's going, it smelled like shit, y'all been.

1168
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:35,860
Other than the presence of that smell,

1169
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:37,860
has anything changed at all?

1170
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:39,980
Like, can I tell a source of the smell?

1171
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:41,620
It's just when he popped up from the water

1172
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:42,460
and came from the truck.

1173
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:44,100
Then the truck started smelling terrible, yeah.

1174
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:46,040
Jimmy, do you see any goo?

1175
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:50,060
Oh, Jimmy doesn't just like answer questions.

1176
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:51,700
Right, I figured, but.

1177
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:53,820
He's just like talking this whole time.

1178
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:58,180
He's always talking and he's always just like,

1179
00:52:58,180 --> 00:53:00,180
yeah, of course you'd have a number one,

1180
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:02,740
but like, you can't have that without living here.

1181
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:06,020
I mean, the oil is extra tomatoes, but the split,

1182
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:08,220
you know, I can't cut it in half for the reasons,

1183
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:09,780
you know, he's vegetarian.

1184
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:12,540
I'm a pescatarian, but I only eat meat.

1185
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:17,200
I look over at Terrence, how do you get,

1186
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:19,500
how do you get him to tell you about the ooze?

1187
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:21,460
Oh, he just screams normally.

1188
00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:23,620
Okay, so you don't think there's any around us right now?

1189
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:25,060
I mean, it smells, don't it?

1190
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:26,540
Something just happened.

1191
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:28,100
Does it smell like the ooze?

1192
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:29,900
Clearly, your bar just dumped in there

1193
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:31,060
because he was trying to avoid it.

1194
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:33,980
We couldn't see it, but your friends there is crazy.

1195
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:35,100
I want y'all to know that.

1196
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:36,660
He could have seen it, he jumped in there,

1197
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:38,060
and now it smells, of course it does,

1198
00:53:38,060 --> 00:53:40,100
because when the fifth gets smelled, it smells like it.

1199
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:41,700
I'm gonna yell over to John.

1200
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:42,900
John, are you all right?

1201
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:45,180
What's going on?

1202
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:46,020
You all right?

1203
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:47,580
John lifts his head out of the water

1204
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:51,820
and smells the smell, sees that Jimmy's not screaming,

1205
00:53:51,820 --> 00:53:56,820
and he's like, I am now, I'm all right now, maybe.

1206
00:53:57,460 --> 00:53:59,220
I don't really know how this works.

1207
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:02,260
No, it seems tricky, I don't know either.

1208
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:06,580
I mean, you're, hey, hey, Keith Vigna, psh,

1209
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:07,780
your friend is crazy.

1210
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:10,020
The one who's not a cop, Clark.

1211
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:12,900
The one who's not a cop, he's crazy.

1212
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:14,820
He can see it, he's losing his shit.

1213
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:16,420
I don't believe you.

1214
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:18,140
How would you know that?

1215
00:54:18,140 --> 00:54:19,820
Because he saw it, and then he jumped in,

1216
00:54:19,820 --> 00:54:20,940
and now it smells.

1217
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:23,900
When the puddles get teemed, right,

1218
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:25,580
they got fish in them, right?

1219
00:54:25,580 --> 00:54:27,300
But when the fish collect,

1220
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:28,740
we're doing collecting of people,

1221
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:31,060
fish doing collecting of residue,

1222
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:32,900
when the fish collect, it smells.

1223
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:36,500
So this smell is from collecting residue.

1224
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:41,300
Is it time for me to appear now?

1225
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:45,660
And you see Randy Angston in a very nice blue

1226
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:49,900
three-piece suit, except for instead of the pants that match,

1227
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:51,500
he's wearing sweatpants.

1228
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:54,780
Hello, I'm Randy Angst.

1229
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:57,220
What do you know about all this?

1230
00:54:57,220 --> 00:54:58,620
Well, is it safe?

1231
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:01,260
What do you know about all this?

1232
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:04,420
I'm the one who's scared, you're out here running around.

1233
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:08,420
Do you know anything else other than what daddy wants?

1234
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:10,100
Who the fuck is daddy?

1235
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:12,540
I think it's the pastor.

1236
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:16,220
Oh, that fucking piece of shit, little turd nugget.

1237
00:55:16,220 --> 00:55:18,220
That's the impression we get, yeah.

1238
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:22,060
Ever since he lost his family, he's been a real dick.

1239
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:27,060
Oh, he lost his, how did he lose his family?

1240
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:29,460
He died in a car crash.

1241
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:35,540
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, no.

1242
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:40,260
Hey, yeah, remember?

1243
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:41,660
Oh, no.

1244
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:45,300
Remember that burning, that burning vehicle

1245
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:47,540
with the family inside?

1246
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:52,580
I bet it was, his family was kind of burnt up.

1247
00:55:52,580 --> 00:55:54,900
Didn't we save one of them?

1248
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:57,020
Not enough, I guess.

1249
00:55:57,020 --> 00:56:00,860
I mean, I pulled somebody out of there.

1250
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:01,980
I pulled someone out of that.

1251
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:03,740
But people perished, right?

1252
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:05,780
Yeah, for sure.

1253
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:08,300
There's like a wife and maybe a couple kids.

1254
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:12,220
Why do you think these things are connected?

1255
00:56:12,220 --> 00:56:13,820
That happened a couple days ago.

1256
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:17,860
Well, just because we hadn't, you know,

1257
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:20,540
we weren't getting much of a ruckus out of the pastor

1258
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:23,860
until, you know, maybe he could have directly linked us

1259
00:56:23,860 --> 00:56:25,380
to his family's demise.

1260
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:26,740
Terrence, when did his family die?

1261
00:56:26,740 --> 00:56:27,780
Tell me when his family died.

1262
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:29,820
Years and years ago, right?

1263
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:33,420
No, it was you guys, and it was a couple days ago.

1264
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:36,020
It was right before you skipped town.

1265
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:38,980
So-called contention police officers.

1266
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:40,260
I believe you murdered three-

1267
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:43,300
One thing you need to know is that we did not skip town.

1268
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:45,100
Everything we've done between here and now,

1269
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:48,180
like the outset of all this and now, is to save this town.

1270
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:50,180
And the only thing that's happened since then

1271
00:56:50,180 --> 00:56:53,060
is that we've lost almost our entire population

1272
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:56,260
of contention, and the pastor who's now taken over

1273
00:56:56,260 --> 00:56:59,060
lost his wife, his daughter, and his son

1274
00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:01,700
in a car accident that was caused by you

1275
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:03,260
and all of your tomfoolery.

1276
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:05,020
No, no, no, now wait a minute.

1277
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:09,140
We're not the ones gathering up the population's bodies.

1278
00:57:09,140 --> 00:57:13,140
No, I got, I saved, I saved, I saved the son.

1279
00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:15,580
I saved the son, I did what I could.

1280
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:18,740
No, you must have failed a role there right at the end.

1281
00:57:18,740 --> 00:57:20,660
I think there was one specific role

1282
00:57:20,660 --> 00:57:23,180
that would have saved him, and it was right before

1283
00:57:23,180 --> 00:57:26,180
he took off in the ambulance, and it was a failed role.

1284
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:28,380
So that killed a child.

1285
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:33,340
And gave us our main enemy for this situation.

1286
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:37,060
I look at the other two guys.

1287
00:57:37,060 --> 00:57:39,300
What are we gonna do with these guys?

1288
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:41,460
We can't let him go back to the pastor.

1289
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:43,580
Luca is asleep.

1290
00:57:43,580 --> 00:57:47,180
I think the pain and the shock have gotten to him,

1291
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:51,380
and he is eyes closed up against the garage door.

1292
00:57:51,380 --> 00:57:54,420
And there's a trail of blood now making its way

1293
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:56,940
at, it's about halfway down the driveway.

1294
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:59,140
I'm gonna go back inside if it's all good to you.

1295
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:00,540
It's much more comfortable.

1296
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:02,220
So you're not helping out the pastor at all?

1297
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:03,580
No, we need you out here, Randy.

1298
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:04,580
No, God, no.

1299
00:58:05,060 --> 00:58:07,580
That cane you had in there, it had a Rubik's Cube on it.

1300
00:58:07,580 --> 00:58:09,860
Do you have a bunch of different canes?

1301
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:11,220
No, that's my cane.

1302
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:13,620
Was there ever a tooth one?

1303
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:16,940
I love my cane, and I don't like Adam Kane.

1304
00:58:16,940 --> 00:58:19,780
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

1305
00:58:19,780 --> 00:58:22,980
A tooth, now I've got plenty in my mouth.

1306
00:58:22,980 --> 00:58:25,460
Ha, but no, it's a Rubik's Cube.

1307
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:27,140
And he hands you a business card.

1308
00:58:27,140 --> 00:58:27,980
Let me read it.

1309
00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:29,340
It says that he is the director

1310
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:31,700
of the Children's Museum of Mathematics.

1311
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:34,460
Yeah, that's not what his business card said last time.

1312
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:37,540
The Children's Museum of Mathematics

1313
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:42,540
is a location given to us by a patron at the $10 level.

1314
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:44,940
David from San Jose.

1315
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:47,540
Thanks, David, good job.

1316
00:58:47,540 --> 00:58:48,380
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1317
00:58:48,380 --> 00:58:49,740
The Children's Museum of Mathematics

1318
00:58:49,740 --> 00:58:51,580
is an underfunded museum,

1319
00:58:51,580 --> 00:58:54,440
which aims to get kids excited about math.

1320
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:56,620
It's mostly puzzles and exhibits

1321
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:58,580
about how you can arrange shapes.

1322
00:58:58,580 --> 00:59:00,260
Did he hand that card to me?

1323
00:59:00,260 --> 00:59:02,660
Yes, have you not been?

1324
00:59:02,660 --> 00:59:05,260
Randy, do you have a collection of all these cards?

1325
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:06,980
You got a bunch of different ones?

1326
00:59:06,980 --> 00:59:08,100
Yeah, absolutely.

1327
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:09,940
And he reaches in a pocket

1328
00:59:09,940 --> 00:59:12,220
and pulls out a bunch of business cards

1329
00:59:12,220 --> 00:59:14,500
that all say Randy Angst,

1330
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:17,900
director of the Children's Museum of Mathematics.

1331
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:19,460
Randy, do you remember the last time

1332
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:21,180
we ran into each other?

1333
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:23,660
Keith Vigna, not one for mathematics.

1334
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:26,500
I believe you may have pulled me over

1335
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:28,220
because I didn't have my lights on

1336
00:59:28,220 --> 00:59:29,820
about a month and a half ago.

1337
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:30,860
That's my bad.

1338
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:32,020
No, we're talking about the time

1339
00:59:32,020 --> 00:59:33,740
you just shit all over your pants

1340
00:59:33,740 --> 00:59:34,860
just a few days ago.

1341
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:35,860
A few days ago?

1342
00:59:35,860 --> 00:59:37,760
My memory is hopefully not that bad,

1343
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:39,420
but the pants that I just shit in

1344
00:59:39,420 --> 00:59:42,620
about 15 minutes ago are already in the washer.

1345
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:44,220
Randy, have you ever been director

1346
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:45,900
of the Contention Historical Society?

1347
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:48,740
I'm a member, but I didn't,

1348
00:59:48,740 --> 00:59:50,100
did you ask if I started it?

1349
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:53,500
I don't wanna claim that I started it.

1350
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:55,940
No, no, I thought that's what your old card said

1351
00:59:55,940 --> 00:59:56,980
is that you were director.

1352
00:59:56,980 --> 00:59:58,100
My old card?

1353
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:00,380
Yeah, we just ran into you a couple days ago.

1354
01:00:00,740 --> 01:00:02,240
Back when we were fighting that robot man,

1355
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:03,080
remember that?

1356
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:03,900
It was a robot.

1357
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:04,740
You were staring at the legs.

1358
01:00:04,740 --> 01:00:06,820
His upper half flew off the window.

1359
01:00:06,820 --> 01:00:09,320
Randy Yanks is now slowly backing away

1360
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:10,160
from the three of you.

1361
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:10,980
You were in chess games.

1362
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:15,980
And he is going to, if you wouldn't mind,

1363
01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:19,980
I think I'm just going to,

1364
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:22,540
and he's backing into his doorway of his house.

1365
01:00:22,540 --> 01:00:24,900
Randy, Randy, now we don't mean you no harm.

1366
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:28,100
I'd really like to just shut this door.

1367
01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:29,780
Randy, listen, for one second,

1368
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:31,620
you're wearing sweatpants

1369
01:00:31,620 --> 01:00:33,920
instead of your three piece suit pants.

1370
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:35,940
That's cause you shit your pants.

1371
01:00:35,940 --> 01:00:38,500
Yes, but that's not a crime.

1372
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:40,700
I know it's not a crime, but how would we know that

1373
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:43,700
unless we had seen you shit your pants in the past?

1374
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:45,340
Adds up, but I don't remember it.

1375
01:00:45,340 --> 01:00:46,180
We know.

1376
01:00:47,180 --> 01:00:48,680
Roll sanity, everybody.

1377
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:54,540
Is 91 good?

1378
01:00:55,540 --> 01:00:56,660
38, fail.

1379
01:00:56,660 --> 01:00:58,060
I fail over my power.

1380
01:00:58,100 --> 01:00:59,820
Yeah, I got bad news for Randy Yanks.

1381
01:00:59,820 --> 01:01:01,020
I failed over my power.

1382
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:04,860
The door isn't quite closed yet.

1383
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:07,640
Do we just take one or a D something?

1384
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:08,540
No, just one.

1385
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:11,640
Well, fellers, it seems like this town is fucked

1386
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:15,140
and we might as well just bail on this reality.

1387
01:01:15,140 --> 01:01:15,980
Later.

1388
01:01:18,860 --> 01:01:20,400
That's one way we can do this.

1389
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:21,680
I don't know if it'll be satisfying.

1390
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:23,060
You know, people say we don't get a lot

1391
01:01:23,060 --> 01:01:25,700
of satisfying conclusions to these plot points,

1392
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:30,380
but Luke wrapped up that three single dollar things so fast.

1393
01:01:30,380 --> 01:01:31,900
All in one, baby.

1394
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:34,880
Yeah, that plot point you introduced this episode.

1395
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:35,720
Fucking nailed it.

1396
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:37,300
It was the last episode, I think.

1397
01:01:38,620 --> 01:01:39,460
It was tonight.

1398
01:01:39,460 --> 01:01:41,060
Earlier this evening.

1399
01:01:41,060 --> 01:01:46,060
As all of you realize, Randy Yanks ain't Randy Yanks.

1400
01:01:46,420 --> 01:01:47,420
Is Randy Yanks?

1401
01:01:47,420 --> 01:01:49,420
He's not our Randy Yanks.

1402
01:01:49,420 --> 01:01:51,620
Exactly, but maybe somebody's Randy Yanks

1403
01:01:51,620 --> 01:01:54,340
and Clark Bishop and Keith Vigna

1404
01:01:54,340 --> 01:01:57,540
both roll over their power, lose one sanity,

1405
01:01:57,540 --> 01:01:58,660
and then Clark goes first.

1406
01:01:58,660 --> 01:02:00,700
Clark is rushing the door

1407
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:03,900
and Joe is hoping that Randy closed it first,

1408
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:06,720
but he's rushing the front door to attack Randy.

1409
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:07,980
Yeah, let's just do a quick roll.

1410
01:02:07,980 --> 01:02:09,140
Okay, what kind of roll?

1411
01:02:09,140 --> 01:02:09,980
Dexterity.

1412
01:02:14,140 --> 01:02:19,140
The one roll I make tonight.

1413
01:02:20,660 --> 01:02:22,620
It's a 52 on a 60.

1414
01:02:22,620 --> 01:02:23,460
Get him.

1415
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:24,980
89.

1416
01:02:24,980 --> 01:02:25,820
Oh yeah.

1417
01:02:25,820 --> 01:02:27,420
Oh, you're busting in there.

1418
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:29,740
I barrel in the door so hard

1419
01:02:29,740 --> 01:02:32,600
that it knocks him back and onto the ground.

1420
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:34,020
And I'm doing like I did to Keith.

1421
01:02:34,020 --> 01:02:35,860
Oh, no.

1422
01:02:35,860 --> 01:02:37,100
Just moments before,

1423
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:39,500
and I'm throttling him into the ground,

1424
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:44,020
saying, you're not a children's museum of mathematics guy.

1425
01:02:44,020 --> 01:02:46,900
You're a historical society guy.

1426
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:47,740
Keith Vigna.

1427
01:02:47,740 --> 01:02:50,180
I see that and I start looking around

1428
01:02:50,180 --> 01:02:53,300
and I see the two guys on the ground

1429
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:54,860
and Jimmy in the back,

1430
01:02:54,860 --> 01:02:57,700
and I'm like, this is a trap.

1431
01:02:57,700 --> 01:02:59,580
Somebody's coming and I get my gun out

1432
01:02:59,580 --> 01:03:01,140
and I just shoot.

1433
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:03,500
I shoot at Terrence.

1434
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:04,780
Holy shit.

1435
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:06,500
Luca and Jimmy.

1436
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:07,780
Holy shit.

1437
01:03:07,780 --> 01:03:09,700
Should I roll firearms?

1438
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:11,460
No, I'm gonna roll.

1439
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:14,180
Just like a 50-50 luck, basically.

1440
01:03:14,180 --> 01:03:15,620
If you're just like unloading a clip

1441
01:03:15,620 --> 01:03:17,740
around like three people.

1442
01:03:17,740 --> 01:03:20,540
Yeah, then I'll roll luck for each of them.

1443
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:22,580
It won't be 50-50.

1444
01:03:22,580 --> 01:03:24,300
That'd be insane.

1445
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:28,900
It'll be like a 25% chance that it hits any one of them.

1446
01:03:31,180 --> 01:03:32,060
22.

1447
01:03:32,060 --> 01:03:32,900
So...

1448
01:03:34,620 --> 01:03:35,460
Somebody's getting dinged.

1449
01:03:35,460 --> 01:03:36,700
That's the one we wanna kill.

1450
01:03:36,700 --> 01:03:41,540
Yep, so D6, we'll do a one and a two is Jimmy Sanders,

1451
01:03:41,540 --> 01:03:43,980
a three and a four is Fade,

1452
01:03:43,980 --> 01:03:47,180
and a five and a six is Terrence.

1453
01:03:48,340 --> 01:03:49,180
Is that a five?

1454
01:03:49,220 --> 01:03:51,060
It's a three.

1455
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:51,900
Yep.

1456
01:03:51,900 --> 01:03:52,740
Jimmy.

1457
01:03:52,740 --> 01:03:53,580
No, that's Fade.

1458
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:54,420
Fade.

1459
01:03:54,420 --> 01:03:55,260
Three's Fade.

1460
01:03:55,260 --> 01:03:58,340
You like fire a couple shots towards Jimmy Sanders

1461
01:03:58,340 --> 01:04:00,460
and then a couple shots towards Terrence,

1462
01:04:00,460 --> 01:04:03,260
who's like right next to you, like on the ground.

1463
01:04:03,260 --> 01:04:04,700
As you're looking at Terrence,

1464
01:04:04,700 --> 01:04:07,380
you just like hold it up and fire over it, Fade,

1465
01:04:07,380 --> 01:04:11,740
and go ahead and roll a D10.

1466
01:04:11,740 --> 01:04:12,580
Nine.

1467
01:04:12,580 --> 01:04:13,620
Nine?

1468
01:04:13,620 --> 01:04:14,820
Nine.

1469
01:04:14,820 --> 01:04:15,740
Oh boy.

1470
01:04:16,740 --> 01:04:20,340
Clark Marshall, Clark Marshall, Clark Marshall,

1471
01:04:20,340 --> 01:04:21,180
Clark Marshall here.

1472
01:04:21,180 --> 01:04:24,260
Clark Bishop rushes into the house of Randy Anks,

1473
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:25,620
shoving the door backwards,

1474
01:04:25,620 --> 01:04:27,460
knocking Randy Anks on his back.

1475
01:04:27,460 --> 01:04:30,940
Keith Vigna begins unloading his clip into the area,

1476
01:04:30,940 --> 01:04:32,700
freaking out, his eyes are wide.

1477
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:35,460
Johnny, you can see it and he's panicking.

1478
01:04:35,460 --> 01:04:38,820
And as he's panicking, you can't even tell

1479
01:04:38,820 --> 01:04:40,540
where he's aiming this gun.

1480
01:04:40,540 --> 01:04:42,900
And then all of a sudden you just see like

1481
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:44,980
the fucking Zapruder film.

1482
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:48,820
Luca, Fade, Fajevic's head,

1483
01:04:48,820 --> 01:04:53,820
and the garage is a Kai Twombly painting immediately.

1484
01:04:53,940 --> 01:04:58,940
Just abstract art on the garage door of Randy Anks

1485
01:04:59,060 --> 01:05:03,460
as the shoulders slump off to the right

1486
01:05:03,460 --> 01:05:07,140
with the momentum of this gunshot.

1487
01:05:07,140 --> 01:05:12,140
And the blood now starts a second path down the driveway,

1488
01:05:13,140 --> 01:05:16,100
but the second one is moving much, much quicker

1489
01:05:16,100 --> 01:05:18,740
and it is much wider and thicker

1490
01:05:18,740 --> 01:05:22,180
with the blood of Luca, Fade, Fajevic

1491
01:05:22,180 --> 01:05:27,180
as he dies errant bullet from an insane Keith Vigna

1492
01:05:27,540 --> 01:05:28,820
who turns to you.

1493
01:05:28,820 --> 01:05:32,300
And I need John Lee Pettymore, Thomas, sorry,

1494
01:05:32,300 --> 01:05:34,300
and Joe to take your headphones off.

1495
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:39,300
As Keith Vigna turns to John Lee Pettymore the third,

1496
01:05:41,220 --> 01:05:45,740
you see that this black viscous ooze is pouring

1497
01:05:45,740 --> 01:05:49,940
out of his nose and it is dripping from his mouth

1498
01:05:49,940 --> 01:05:53,660
and it is running down his cheeks from his eyes

1499
01:05:53,660 --> 01:05:57,700
and from his ears, it is going underneath his shirt.

1500
01:05:57,700 --> 01:06:01,060
From his ears, it is going underneath his shirt.

1501
01:06:07,580 --> 01:06:10,260
I look back over at him and I point my gun at him

1502
01:06:10,260 --> 01:06:12,620
and I say, get back in the water.

1503
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:15,140
At me?

1504
01:06:15,140 --> 01:06:16,100
Yeah.

1505
01:06:16,100 --> 01:06:18,740
Aw, all right, and he does so.

1506
01:06:19,620 --> 01:06:24,620
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

1507
01:06:24,940 --> 01:06:25,980
Oh, all right.

1508
01:06:25,980 --> 01:06:27,580
And me, all right.

1509
01:06:30,620 --> 01:06:31,620
Holy shit.

1510
01:06:48,740 --> 01:06:53,740
Am I the only one trying to pull over?

1511
01:06:55,620 --> 01:07:00,620
How can you have enough drowning out of the noise?

1512
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:10,420
There's nobody home, nobody home, nobody home.

1513
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:19,620
Bye.

1514
01:07:19,620 --> 01:07:20,460
Bye.
