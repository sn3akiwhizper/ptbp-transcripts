00:00.000 --> 00:03.180
Hello, my ever-present fan base.

00:03.180 --> 00:06.200
It's your time jumping, dimension bumping,

00:06.200 --> 00:09.480
grease pumping baby wolf the dog.

00:09.480 --> 00:14.080
And I'm here to slurp up all the information of the worlds

00:14.080 --> 00:17.200
and regurgitate it back into all y'all's mouths

00:17.200 --> 00:19.520
like the baby birds y'all are.

00:19.520 --> 00:22.660
Chirp, chirp, my hungry little chickadees.

00:22.660 --> 00:27.460
Mama Wolf is bringing that good slop fresh out of her gullet.

00:27.460 --> 00:28.440
Oh yeah.

00:28.440 --> 00:33.440
We're also live from 694.2 PTBP or something, I guess.

00:34.440 --> 00:36.740
And now speaking of sustenance,

00:36.740 --> 00:40.180
this week's Howlin' with Wolf is from at Bagel Boy,

00:40.180 --> 00:43.840
who tweeted about the show and tagged at Pretending Pod,

00:43.840 --> 00:47.360
which is the third quickest way to make wolf salivate.

00:48.360 --> 00:51.240
Bagel Boy writes, howdy wolf.

00:51.240 --> 00:53.820
Just wanted to send some good vibes your way

00:53.820 --> 00:55.960
and to tell you to stay greasy.

00:55.960 --> 00:57.480
I'm new to the big city

00:57.520 --> 01:00.880
and although everything right now is new and unfamiliar,

01:00.880 --> 01:05.000
I'm glad I got good old wolf to grace my hearing holes.

01:05.000 --> 01:08.040
The city seems nice so far.

01:08.040 --> 01:10.360
Aside from the fact that I've been mugged

01:10.360 --> 01:12.560
four damn times this week,

01:12.560 --> 01:15.160
I haven't seen a single damn police officer

01:15.160 --> 01:16.520
since I got here.

01:16.520 --> 01:19.160
Though I'll admit it does make me oddly feel

01:19.160 --> 01:23.360
like I'm right back home in sleepy, quiet contention.

01:23.360 --> 01:25.960
Anywho, keep up the good work over there

01:25.960 --> 01:28.600
and I'll keep on tuning in over here.

01:28.600 --> 01:32.360
Oh, and stay safe out here in the concrete jungle.

01:32.360 --> 01:34.680
I wouldn't want to see my good friend wolf

01:34.680 --> 01:36.760
on the evening news.

01:36.760 --> 01:40.240
Thanks for writing into the show, boy of bagels.

01:40.240 --> 01:42.960
I'm glad we got some listeners buzzing in

01:42.960 --> 01:45.840
from old sleepy and quiet contention.

01:45.840 --> 01:48.480
Never anything exciting or dimension altering

01:48.480 --> 01:50.040
ever happened over there.

01:50.040 --> 01:51.880
No sir, redo.

01:51.880 --> 01:55.260
Nothing to see over there, that's for dang sure.

01:56.280 --> 01:57.200
Ha, ha, ha.

02:01.040 --> 02:03.920
If you want to write up something for your wolf to howl,

02:03.920 --> 02:07.120
tag at pretending pod on Twitter or Instagram,

02:07.120 --> 02:09.720
tag pretending to be people on Facebook,

02:09.720 --> 02:11.360
or write up a five star review

02:11.360 --> 02:13.580
on the podcast app of your choice.

02:13.580 --> 02:16.000
Screenshot that stunning missive

02:16.000 --> 02:18.720
and get it in front of old wolfy's eye holes

02:18.720 --> 02:22.100
so I can say, hey, thanks.

02:22.100 --> 02:23.880
Now raise your hands in the air

02:23.880 --> 02:26.760
if you support this show on Patreon.

02:26.760 --> 02:29.400
Wave them around, get weird with it.

02:29.400 --> 02:33.920
Fuck everybody else because you, my delicious listener,

02:33.920 --> 02:38.000
are keeping the proverbial lights metaphorically on

02:38.000 --> 02:41.240
in this quote unquote studio.

02:41.240 --> 02:45.640
In the ephemeral words of Dame Alyssa Arnett Elliott,

02:45.640 --> 02:47.440
get your freak on.

02:47.440 --> 02:49.840
In the words of Cal Colorado,

02:49.840 --> 02:53.320
blah, blah, whatever, something about the news.

02:53.320 --> 02:57.020
Last time, the field team for the City Action News

02:57.020 --> 03:02.000
began in a familiar place, the CAN Conference Room.

03:02.000 --> 03:05.200
But without Ty Frailand at the head of the table,

03:05.200 --> 03:08.280
lead anchor Isabel Acaya took on the role

03:08.280 --> 03:12.920
of handing out assignments and sent Cal Colorado and co

03:12.920 --> 03:17.120
off on a wild goose chase to a mysterious drop pen

03:17.120 --> 03:20.120
for exclusive coverage of a secret town

03:20.120 --> 03:22.560
run by the Godel Company.

03:22.640 --> 03:26.440
They were joined by Stevie, a production assistant

03:26.440 --> 03:29.880
with a wall of dark wavy hair that covered all of her face

03:29.880 --> 03:31.880
except a pierced bottom lip.

03:31.880 --> 03:35.840
And the four members of City Action News drove and drove

03:35.840 --> 03:38.040
further and further off the grid.

03:38.040 --> 03:40.840
All the road signs told them to turn back,

03:40.840 --> 03:43.560
but they carried on until the CAN van

03:43.560 --> 03:46.240
approached a perspective engulfing wall

03:46.240 --> 03:48.780
made of tree-lined vines and kudzu,

03:48.820 --> 03:53.060
taking us now to the other side of this foresty facade,

03:53.060 --> 03:57.420
this biennial barrier, the dam of detritus.

03:57.420 --> 04:02.420
It's Altagirl with My Life is Great and It's All My Fault.

04:02.700 --> 04:05.700
It's all my fault

04:05.700 --> 04:10.700
Cause my life is great

04:10.700 --> 04:12.700
And it's all mine

04:19.780 --> 04:24.780
Cause my life is great

04:24.780 --> 04:27.780
And it's all my fault

04:37.780 --> 04:39.780
Were you at his house that said that?

04:39.780 --> 04:41.780
I didn't say it was disgusting, but I was like

04:41.780 --> 04:42.780
Well, you meant it

04:42.780 --> 04:43.780
You are

04:43.780 --> 04:44.780
I don't think it's disgusting.

04:44.780 --> 04:48.780
I think it's thoroughly emasculating

04:51.780 --> 04:53.780
Do you feel emasculating when I burp you?

04:53.780 --> 04:55.780
To be burped like a baby

04:55.780 --> 04:57.780
Well, so I don't think about being emasculating

04:57.780 --> 05:00.780
because I don't think in terms like that, you know?

05:00.780 --> 05:03.780
I don't feel like a father when I do it, if that helps

05:03.780 --> 05:05.780
When I think of myself, I don't really think of myself

05:05.780 --> 05:09.780
Yeah, you're more like a sexually dominant, like

05:09.780 --> 05:10.780
Always

05:10.780 --> 05:13.780
I don't really ever think of myself as a man

05:14.780 --> 05:17.780
I'm like a boy that has to shave

05:17.780 --> 05:19.780
I don't have a beard

05:19.780 --> 05:20.780
Do you have to shave?

05:20.780 --> 05:22.780
I thought you were saying, I don't have to

05:22.780 --> 05:25.780
No, I don't have a beard, but I have to shave

05:27.780 --> 05:29.780
Dude, literally, I shaved this morning

05:29.780 --> 05:33.780
Yesterday at Ethan's house, Jake Herron was over there

05:33.780 --> 05:34.780
and he's like

05:34.780 --> 05:36.780
Shout out to Jake's Vegan Burgers

05:36.780 --> 05:37.780
Are we recording?

05:37.780 --> 05:38.780
I had the taco meat tonight

05:38.780 --> 05:39.780
Oh, nice

05:39.780 --> 05:40.780
Jake was on season one of the podcast

05:40.780 --> 05:42.780
and on our Patreon

05:42.780 --> 05:44.780
I hung out with Jake last night

05:44.780 --> 05:47.780
Go listen to the, we were fighting the devil in Hawaii

05:47.780 --> 05:48.780
or something

05:48.780 --> 05:50.780
Yeah, a church group fighting the devil in Hawaii

05:50.780 --> 05:54.780
He was like, dude, Luke, I've never seen you with facial hair

05:54.780 --> 05:57.780
and I'm like, yeah, it's a mistake

05:57.780 --> 05:59.780
I don't have facial hair

05:59.780 --> 06:02.780
and this is something that I don't know that I've brought up

06:02.780 --> 06:05.780
with you guys before, but I follow a Reddit

06:05.780 --> 06:08.780
about what I have and they say, tell your friends

06:08.780 --> 06:11.780
Have you ever noticed me picking at my face?

06:11.780 --> 06:12.780
No

06:12.780 --> 06:17.780
I have trichotillomania, which I pull my hair out

06:17.780 --> 06:20.780
and it's like, I enjoy doing that

06:20.780 --> 06:22.780
but it's like, you shouldn't do that

06:22.780 --> 06:23.780
Specifically your face?

06:23.780 --> 06:26.780
I should probably stop pulling hair out of your face, too

06:26.780 --> 06:28.780
Wait, but the subreddit says that you should

06:28.780 --> 06:31.780
tell all your friends

06:31.780 --> 06:33.780
It's a callback from the last episode

06:33.780 --> 06:35.780
It is, that's not make damn sure, is it?

06:35.780 --> 06:37.780
No, I mean, it's by taking it

06:37.780 --> 06:39.780
I know it's taking back Sunday, I just don't know

06:39.780 --> 06:42.780
Anyway, some people it's like on their head

06:42.780 --> 06:44.780
Some people it's like random parts of the body

06:44.780 --> 06:48.780
So when I grow my facial hair out, it's only here and here

06:48.780 --> 06:52.780
and it's because I literally just pick all the hair out of my cheeks

06:52.780 --> 06:55.780
and I'm trying really hard to stop it

06:55.780 --> 06:57.780
So if you see me doing that, tell me not to

06:57.780 --> 06:59.780
So is it like a support group on Reddit kind of thing?

06:59.780 --> 07:03.780
Yeah, it's like a join this so that you can think about doing it

07:03.780 --> 07:04.780
so you stop doing it

07:04.780 --> 07:05.780
Interesting

07:05.780 --> 07:06.780
Should we get a spray bottle?

07:06.780 --> 07:08.780
Yeah, just spray me when I do it

07:08.780 --> 07:14.780
Literally, I can grow hair on my cheeks

07:14.780 --> 07:16.780
Also, if you look at my middle fingernail

07:16.780 --> 07:17.780
Did you just do it?

07:17.780 --> 07:18.780
It's literally like

07:18.780 --> 07:20.780
Luke, don't

07:20.780 --> 07:24.780
It's like worn down because I pick like that

07:24.780 --> 07:29.780
My thumb and middle fingernails have like indents

07:29.780 --> 07:34.780
Is there a support group for grown adults who need to be burped like babies on Reddit?

07:34.780 --> 07:38.780
See, that's a thing that I don't want to give up

07:38.780 --> 07:40.780
And hey, here's the thing

07:40.780 --> 07:44.780
And I'm not far enough, it's not a fetish yet

07:44.780 --> 07:46.780
Luke, you let me know when it is

07:46.780 --> 07:47.780
Yeah

07:47.780 --> 07:48.780
But

07:48.780 --> 07:49.780
Dude

07:49.780 --> 07:51.780
I don't know, hopefully this isn't recorded

07:51.780 --> 07:52.780
Or maybe it is

07:52.780 --> 07:54.780
Maybe it is and you're out there and you have trichotillomania

07:54.780 --> 07:56.780
It is recorded, is that okay?

07:56.780 --> 08:00.780
That's fine because literally I would love to grow a beard

08:00.780 --> 08:07.780
And the only thing stopping me from doing that is me picking the hairs out of my face

08:07.780 --> 08:09.780
Just so you guys know

08:09.780 --> 08:11.780
Spray me, baby

08:11.780 --> 08:17.780
If we hit a certain Patreon goal, we're gonna get Luke a Hannibal Lecter mask

08:17.780 --> 08:18.780
So he can't touch his face

08:18.780 --> 08:23.780
I think it'd be more to just like glue oven mitts on my hands for a while

08:23.780 --> 08:24.780
So I can't do it

08:24.780 --> 08:25.780
Glue them

08:25.780 --> 08:26.780
Glue them on me

08:26.780 --> 08:27.780
Why not both?

08:27.780 --> 08:29.780
Fuck day

08:29.780 --> 08:32.780
Glue oven mitts to my face like a Hannibal Lecter

08:35.780 --> 08:38.780
And then all your hair gets ripped out when we take it off

08:39.780 --> 08:40.780
Solved

08:40.780 --> 08:42.780
Look how long his beard was

08:45.780 --> 08:49.780
And then I was gonna make like a ripping your pubes joke out but that's a real thing

08:49.780 --> 08:51.780
Yeah, ouchie, ouchie

08:51.780 --> 08:52.780
Ouchie, ouchie

08:52.780 --> 08:53.780
So

08:53.780 --> 08:56.780
We saw some cool shit at the end of the last episode

08:56.780 --> 08:58.780
It was like fucking cool, dude

09:00.780 --> 09:06.780
What do you remember? What is the vision in your mind of what you saw at the end of the last episode?

09:06.780 --> 09:13.780
Crazy ravine where no ravine should be behind a crazy wall where no wall should be

09:14.780 --> 09:21.780
With a train where no train should be leading over a gigantic fucking bridge where no bridge should be

09:21.780 --> 09:22.780
Well said

09:22.780 --> 09:31.780
During our break I was just like googling Blaine the Mono which is like the scary train from the Dark Tower series

09:31.780 --> 09:32.780
Okay

09:32.780 --> 09:36.780
I've got three opened up here, scroll through them, but that's what I was imagining

09:36.780 --> 09:39.780
Oh, duh, these look like evil trains, dudes

09:39.780 --> 09:41.780
Yeah, straight up evil trains, bro

09:41.780 --> 09:43.780
Train one had kind of tentacles or something underneath it

09:43.780 --> 09:44.780
Well

09:44.780 --> 09:45.780
No tentacles on this one

09:45.780 --> 09:51.780
I didn't think there were but it seems Cthulhu-y to have tentacles

09:51.780 --> 09:52.780
Cthulhu-onian

09:52.780 --> 09:53.780
But also

09:53.780 --> 09:54.780
Cthulhu-onian

09:54.780 --> 10:01.780
If you guys haven't listened to, I say listened to the Dark Tower series because I read the first book and the last book

10:01.780 --> 10:03.780
And I listened to all the rest of them

10:03.780 --> 10:07.780
Listen to the Dark Tower series, it's really good

10:07.780 --> 10:09.780
If you like Delta Green, holy shit, bro

10:09.780 --> 10:12.780
If you like Delta Green, don't fucking listen to the Dark Tower

10:12.780 --> 10:14.780
Listen to Pretending to Be People

10:14.780 --> 10:15.780
Season one

10:15.780 --> 10:18.780
Scary, very scary

10:18.780 --> 10:25.780
Also, his name is Blaine the Mono because Blaine the Train I guess is too stupid

10:28.780 --> 10:30.780
It all seems pretty stupid

10:32.780 --> 10:35.780
I don't know, you do a bunch of coke and write a whole series

10:35.780 --> 10:36.780
Okay

10:36.780 --> 10:38.780
Challenge accepted, yeah

10:38.780 --> 10:43.780
No, like the little faces on the train are so dumb

10:43.780 --> 10:45.780
Like the mean eyes

10:45.780 --> 10:47.780
None of those are like

10:47.780 --> 10:50.780
I'm Blaine the Mono, don't call me Blaine the Train

10:50.780 --> 10:51.780
I'm evil

10:51.780 --> 10:53.780
That's why I'm angry

10:53.780 --> 10:57.780
Everybody keeps calling me Blaine the Train

10:57.780 --> 11:01.780
Um, the train I guess isn't sentient though

11:01.780 --> 11:04.780
No, it's pretty simple looking

11:04.780 --> 11:05.780
Aw, damn

11:05.780 --> 11:07.780
Oh, I thought you meant Blaine

11:07.780 --> 11:09.780
Oh, Blaine is sentient for sure, bro

11:09.780 --> 11:12.780
He's definitely sentient

11:13.780 --> 11:20.780
I wanted to clarify, is this bridge that is extending outward from us across the ravine, first of all?

11:20.780 --> 11:21.780
Yes

11:21.780 --> 11:24.780
And you said 100 meters long, does that mean we can see the other side?

11:24.780 --> 11:25.780
Yes

11:25.780 --> 11:26.780
Okay, what's on the other side?

11:26.780 --> 11:28.780
The same thing that's on your side

11:28.780 --> 11:29.780
Which is?

11:29.780 --> 11:30.780
A train station and a wall

11:30.780 --> 11:32.780
A train station and a wall

11:32.780 --> 11:33.780
And a wall

11:33.780 --> 11:34.780
Fuck that

11:35.780 --> 11:36.780
That's creepy

11:36.780 --> 11:39.780
And so the fog is all settled in the ravine below us

11:39.780 --> 11:41.780
You said a deep foggy ravine

11:41.780 --> 11:43.780
Yep, the fog is settled in the ravine below you

11:43.780 --> 11:44.780
Cool

11:44.780 --> 11:50.780
I need everyone to roll grip, as this is a deeply unnatural sight

11:51.780 --> 11:54.780
I pass a 20 out of 75

11:54.780 --> 11:56.780
If you fail, you're just going to lose one grip

11:56.780 --> 12:01.780
I was going to say, I pass enough that I don't even have to look up what mine is

12:01.780 --> 12:02.780
3

12:02.780 --> 12:03.780
Rolled a 3

12:03.780 --> 12:05.780
I rolled an 87, which is a failure

12:05.780 --> 12:06.780
Which is a failure

12:06.780 --> 12:13.780
So you're going to lose one grip, and with that, as you guys are looking around this area, Cal is...

12:13.780 --> 12:20.780
You don't know this about me, or maybe you do, but I happen to be an avid student of local geography

12:20.780 --> 12:22.780
And this ravine should not be here

12:22.780 --> 12:24.780
This ravine can't be here

12:24.780 --> 12:27.780
Well, I mean, we're looking right at it, dude, it's right there

12:27.780 --> 12:30.780
I know it's here, but it shouldn't be

12:30.780 --> 12:32.780
Are you getting this? Are you getting shots of this?

12:32.780 --> 12:33.780
Beck definitely is

12:33.780 --> 12:40.780
We're 87 minutes away from my home, and there could be one, I don't know

12:40.780 --> 12:46.780
This ravine would be a national park, if it was natural

12:46.780 --> 12:50.780
Does it look natural, or is it smooth walled or something weird?

12:50.780 --> 12:57.780
Go ahead and roll if you have any sort of science, or I'll take intelligence at a negative 20

12:57.780 --> 12:59.780
Any of us, or him?

12:59.780 --> 13:00.780
Any of you

13:01.780 --> 13:06.780
Oh my god, at a negative 20, that makes my intelligence 50?

13:06.780 --> 13:07.780
I got a 51

13:10.780 --> 13:12.780
Oh, I can roll on intelligence?

13:12.780 --> 13:13.780
Mine is 20, yeah

13:13.780 --> 13:16.780
Oh, I pass with flying freaking colors, bro

13:16.780 --> 13:19.780
At a negative 20, I'm also a 50, and I rolled a 50

13:19.780 --> 13:23.780
Nice, we got a success there, and we got a success from Julius Summers

13:23.780 --> 13:26.780
Julius Summers is the only one who really notices

13:26.780 --> 13:29.780
And I only say that because Cal Colorado is dealing with

13:30.780 --> 13:41.780
Yeah, loss of grip, and on top of the loss of grip, just the itchiest face, hands, and arms that he's felt since he was a boy

13:41.780 --> 13:42.780
Not to touch my face

13:42.780 --> 13:44.780
Oh, you fell face forward, sir

13:44.780 --> 13:45.780
Critical fail

13:45.780 --> 13:47.780
I didn't realize that Cal's money maker was

13:47.780 --> 13:50.780
Oh, it's gonna be a time frame situation at this point

13:50.780 --> 13:56.780
With the crit fail, I think all your clothes came off real quick, you rolled around in it, and then they all flew back on

13:56.780 --> 13:57.780
Yeah

13:57.780 --> 14:01.780
Yeah, no, you are working on a time crunch to your face not being camera ready

14:01.780 --> 14:04.780
Stevie, do you have any concealer? Do you have any

14:04.780 --> 14:08.780
Yeah, and she's right on it, and she's getting into her makeup bag and coming at your face

14:08.780 --> 14:12.780
Stevie, you're practically a Marvin, you don't know what that means, but

14:12.780 --> 14:17.780
Julius feels deeply insulted by that comment

14:17.780 --> 14:24.780
Julius is far too busy staring at the deeply unnatural sides of this rock

14:24.780 --> 14:34.780
You can't quite put your finger on it, but it's nothing that you've ever seen before, this is not a natural occurrence, I need you to roll grip

14:34.780 --> 14:35.780
Haha

14:35.780 --> 14:39.780
And yeah, I like what Joe said earlier, let's say it's really smooth

14:39.780 --> 14:40.780
Yeah

14:40.780 --> 14:41.780
Cool, I like that

14:41.780 --> 14:44.780
I'm unaffected with a five

14:44.780 --> 14:51.780
Amazing, so you know that this is not normal, it may not have ever happened before, but

14:51.780 --> 14:54.780
No, not but, but so

14:54.780 --> 14:56.780
It's a kick ass

14:56.780 --> 15:08.780
Julius pulls his phone out, goes to TikTok, thinks it's the perfect time for the calzone

15:08.780 --> 15:11.780
Cal, could you stand next

15:11.780 --> 15:14.780
It's much better Mr. Colorado now, it's much better

15:14.780 --> 15:21.780
Julius points his phone at Cal and looks at his phone to see like how good he looks on his screen

15:21.780 --> 15:22.780
Sure

15:22.780 --> 15:23.780
Does it look good

15:23.780 --> 15:24.780
Yes

15:24.780 --> 15:25.780
Is he made up

15:25.780 --> 15:26.780
Yeah and honestly it's

15:26.780 --> 15:27.780
Maybe you slide over to a filter

15:27.780 --> 15:29.780
Oh for sure, yeah

15:29.780 --> 15:37.780
Well one of the things that Julius did on the way here was, because he didn't have to drive, was make a can filter

15:37.780 --> 15:40.780
Specifically made for Cal, Colorado

15:40.780 --> 15:41.780
A calcan?

15:41.780 --> 15:45.780
The calcan, the calcam for the calzone

15:45.780 --> 15:47.780
The calcam for the calzone

15:47.780 --> 15:49.780
The calcam for the calzone

15:49.780 --> 15:53.780
And it perfectly matches his skin tone or something

15:53.780 --> 15:58.780
No, it's just like any blemishes or anything are kind of like smoothed over a little bit

15:58.780 --> 16:10.780
Okay so you need to get this poison oak faced, elderly, older statesman of anchors to dance like a monkey for your TikTok

16:10.780 --> 16:12.780
While he's just lost grip

16:12.780 --> 16:15.780
We are not dancing for this calzone

16:15.780 --> 16:18.780
Look at where we are, this is insane dude

16:18.780 --> 16:20.780
I'm saying this to the DM

16:25.780 --> 16:26.780
Cal

16:26.780 --> 16:27.780
Julius

16:27.780 --> 16:30.780
Get next to the edge and we're gonna do a calzone

16:30.780 --> 16:32.780
You want me to go on right now?

16:32.780 --> 16:33.780
You want me to be on?

16:33.780 --> 16:36.780
Well you don't have to be on, we can practice it, it's a TikTok

16:36.780 --> 16:39.780
You can practice a TikTok?

16:39.780 --> 16:41.780
We don't even have to record the first time

16:41.780 --> 16:46.780
I've spent 30 years on air living on the razor jads of live TV

16:46.780 --> 16:48.780
Have you ever thought about acting?

16:48.780 --> 16:50.780
I'm mostly thinking about itching

16:50.780 --> 16:53.780
Well they're from what I've heard one and the same

16:53.780 --> 16:55.780
I'll make a note of that

16:55.780 --> 16:58.780
Right now I'm acting very hard

17:01.780 --> 17:04.780
Well then let's not make you act too hard

17:04.780 --> 17:10.780
And he just starts recording just video that way he can upload it to TikTok later

17:10.780 --> 17:14.780
I'm here in front of an unholy monstrosity

17:14.780 --> 17:19.780
The god old corporation in their avarice has torn a trench into mother earth

17:19.780 --> 17:20.780
Make it fun

17:25.780 --> 17:27.780
It's very deep and broad

17:27.780 --> 17:29.780
Like the dance that you're gonna do

17:30.780 --> 17:33.780
Cal just looks at the camera and like bewilderment and confusion

17:34.780 --> 17:37.780
Who could dance at a moment like this?

17:37.780 --> 17:38.780
Not this reporter

17:38.780 --> 17:41.780
Julius cuts it off right after like not this reporter

17:41.780 --> 17:44.780
And he's like okay, perfect, I got this

17:44.780 --> 17:49.780
And then he just starts editing the can talk together

17:49.780 --> 17:54.780
Hey man, we have like TikTok quotas or whatever

17:54.780 --> 17:56.780
But like maybe we wait to post that

17:56.780 --> 17:59.780
My uncle told me to do TikToks

18:00.780 --> 18:02.780
Yeah, for sure

18:02.780 --> 18:07.780
I just don't know if like we like we're kind of in the middle of like figuring out what this is

18:07.780 --> 18:11.780
Like what if it's like, you know a nuclear test site

18:11.780 --> 18:13.780
We don't want people like rushing out here to see it

18:13.780 --> 18:15.780
Understandable

18:16.780 --> 18:19.780
He continues editing the TikTok

18:21.780 --> 18:23.780
Cool man, I'm glad you heard me

18:23.780 --> 18:28.780
Beck, anytime you want to talk to me, I'm here to listen

18:28.780 --> 18:30.780
That means a lot dude, thanks

18:30.780 --> 18:33.780
Yeah, and then he finishes editing the TikTok

18:33.780 --> 18:36.780
And he doesn't post it, but he sends it to his uncle

18:36.780 --> 18:38.780
Interesting

18:38.780 --> 18:44.780
So looking at this simple train car in this simple train station

18:44.780 --> 18:46.780
All seemingly made out of steel

18:46.780 --> 18:49.780
All built for this one single car

18:49.780 --> 18:55.780
You see that there are lockers adjacent on the exterior wall of the station

18:55.780 --> 19:00.780
And above it the sign of course says, welcome to Grover's Gorge

19:00.780 --> 19:06.780
Founded by Frank Godel in 1945 by necessity not choice

19:07.780 --> 19:12.780
I know it was founded by Frank Godel, but what if it was founded by Grover from Sesame Street

19:12.780 --> 19:15.780
Let's just all take a moment to imagine that

19:15.780 --> 19:17.780
I actually saw that What If episode

19:19.780 --> 19:21.780
Is What If a show?

19:21.780 --> 19:23.780
Are you thinking of What Would You Do?

19:24.780 --> 19:26.780
What If with John Quiñones

19:26.780 --> 19:28.780
With John Quiñones

19:29.780 --> 19:31.780
What?

19:31.780 --> 19:33.780
What Would You Do with John Quiñones?

19:33.780 --> 19:35.780
John Quiñones

19:35.780 --> 19:37.780
Yeah, Quiñones

19:37.780 --> 19:38.780
Quiñones

19:38.780 --> 19:40.780
You've never seen What Would You Do?

19:40.780 --> 19:42.780
The whole premise of the show is like

19:42.780 --> 19:46.780
We get actors to do really shitty things in public

19:46.780 --> 19:49.780
And then we see what the public does

19:49.780 --> 19:51.780
What Would You Do?

19:51.780 --> 19:54.780
What would you do if a guy beat up a little kid?

19:54.780 --> 19:56.780
What would you do if he was at home

19:56.780 --> 19:58.780
Sixteen seasons

19:58.780 --> 20:00.780
February 26, 2008, the present

20:00.780 --> 20:02.780
I've never even heard of this show

20:02.780 --> 20:04.780
The thing that kills me, Thomas, is that you're not alone in that

20:04.780 --> 20:06.780
There's a lot of people who haven't seen it

20:06.780 --> 20:07.780
But for some reason

20:07.780 --> 20:08.780
I've seen like every episode

20:08.780 --> 20:10.780
Everybody on the show that ends up being on the show

20:10.780 --> 20:13.780
They go, oh my god, it's John Quiñones

20:13.780 --> 20:16.780
As if they all know him and he's a big celebrity

20:17.780 --> 20:19.780
It was created by Chris Whipple

20:19.780 --> 20:20.780
Which is a very fun name

20:20.780 --> 20:21.780
That is a very fun name

20:21.780 --> 20:22.780
Chris Whipple

20:22.780 --> 20:24.780
Not a fun show, really, though

20:24.780 --> 20:25.780
Zach, I don't want to harp on this ravine

20:25.780 --> 20:27.780
But I just realized we didn't ask what was down left or right

20:27.780 --> 20:30.780
Like, how far can we see? How far does this ravine go?

20:30.780 --> 20:33.780
So you can actually even really see how deep the ravine is

20:33.780 --> 20:35.780
Or how far left or right it is

20:35.780 --> 20:37.780
Because it's so foggy

20:37.780 --> 20:39.780
You can see to the other side

20:39.780 --> 20:41.780
That a hundred meters across

20:41.780 --> 20:44.780
But the fog is just filling up this ravine

20:45.780 --> 20:47.780
And then the fog kind of

20:47.780 --> 20:52.780
Takes over the land far down on the left and far down on the right

20:52.780 --> 20:55.780
So you can't even see the end of these walls

20:55.780 --> 20:57.780
Of massive plant life

20:57.780 --> 21:00.780
If there were another bridge like the one we're looking at

21:00.780 --> 21:01.780
Would you be able to see it?

21:01.780 --> 21:02.780
If there was one

21:02.780 --> 21:04.780
You would be able to see it

21:04.780 --> 21:07.780
If it was within about a hundred meters of you on either side

21:07.780 --> 21:09.780
Okay, and we don't see anything

21:09.780 --> 21:13.780
Beck, could I borrow a mic clip?

21:13.780 --> 21:15.780
Sure, of course, dude

21:15.780 --> 21:18.780
Hey, Stevie, would you grab a mic clip out of there?

21:18.780 --> 21:19.780
Yeah, of course, yeah

21:19.780 --> 21:20.780
Here you go, sir

21:20.780 --> 21:22.780
Julius grabs the mic clip

21:22.780 --> 21:25.780
And he shows it to Beck

21:25.780 --> 21:28.780
He's like, can you get audio from this?

21:28.780 --> 21:30.780
Yeah, oh yeah, for sure

21:30.780 --> 21:31.780
Hang on a second

21:31.780 --> 21:33.780
He wires it up to the receiver

21:33.780 --> 21:36.780
Could you do it unwired?

21:36.780 --> 21:37.780
Do what unwired?

21:37.780 --> 21:40.780
Bluetooth, perhaps?

21:40.780 --> 21:42.780
What are you getting at, man?

21:42.780 --> 21:43.780
I'm gonna throw it

21:43.780 --> 21:45.780
Oh no, we can't afford to lose a whole mic, dude

21:45.780 --> 21:49.780
This is your first serious error as a producer

21:49.780 --> 21:52.780
The network will not be pleased to hear about how you wanted to use their equipment

21:52.780 --> 21:55.780
And unfortunately, Beck and I are duty bound to report it

21:55.780 --> 21:57.780
I will say Beck did

21:57.780 --> 22:01.780
Beck did say we have so many of those

22:01.780 --> 22:03.780
Yeah, it's for like, you know, miking up people

22:03.780 --> 22:06.780
But like, we're not gonna like toss them over ravines

22:06.780 --> 22:09.780
Sometimes you have to interview a group of school children

22:09.780 --> 22:10.780
Or perhaps a church choir

22:10.780 --> 22:13.780
Can I roll to see if this is Bluetooth or wired?

22:13.780 --> 22:15.780
It's wired for sure

22:15.780 --> 22:17.780
Wired for sound

22:17.780 --> 22:21.780
So yeah, Julius throws the mic with the mic clip over the side

22:21.780 --> 22:24.780
But then it just like six feet later stops

22:24.780 --> 22:26.780
Cause it's wired in

22:26.780 --> 22:28.780
What can you hear, Julius?

22:28.780 --> 22:30.780
Not what I want to do

22:30.780 --> 22:34.780
And Stevie's walking up and noticing your headphones

22:34.780 --> 22:37.780
Beck and she's like, Mr. Wilder, those are some sweet cans

22:38.780 --> 22:39.780
Dude, thanks!

22:39.780 --> 22:40.780
And I knuckle, Stevie

22:40.780 --> 22:41.780
Knuckle

22:41.780 --> 22:44.780
Cal Colorado gets like a chill down his spine

22:44.780 --> 22:47.780
As if he's heard that voice from someone else in a past life

22:49.780 --> 22:51.780
Another faithful

22:51.780 --> 22:53.780
That was smart, I am smart

22:55.780 --> 22:58.780
Hey, Julius, like if you're trying to like get a sense of like the depth here

22:58.780 --> 23:00.780
We could just do the old fashion way

23:00.780 --> 23:01.780
And Beck finds a rock

23:01.780 --> 23:03.780
Dosses it over the edge to listen for the sound

23:03.780 --> 23:05.780
And you listen

23:05.780 --> 23:07.780
And you listen

23:07.780 --> 23:09.780
And you listen

23:10.780 --> 23:13.780
As if you threw a rock off of a cliff

23:13.780 --> 23:16.780
9.82 meters per second squared, right?

23:16.780 --> 23:17.780
Uh huh

23:17.780 --> 23:19.780
You're asking the right people

23:19.780 --> 23:23.780
Down about somewhere like 836 feet

23:23.780 --> 23:26.780
Like basically 80 stories

23:26.780 --> 23:28.780
And then you hear just

23:28.780 --> 23:31.780
Of a rock hitting water

23:31.780 --> 23:33.780
It sounds like it's about 80 stories down

23:33.780 --> 23:35.780
Uh, there's water down there

23:36.780 --> 23:38.780
I don't even think we'd be able to hear that

23:39.780 --> 23:41.780
No, but once I started talking

23:41.780 --> 23:43.780
I was like, well, fuck

23:43.780 --> 23:44.780
No, I heard it

23:44.780 --> 23:45.780
Cause the mic

23:45.780 --> 23:46.780
I know I heard it

23:46.780 --> 23:47.780
The mic's hanging over the edge there

23:47.780 --> 23:48.780
And I picked it up on my headphones

23:48.780 --> 23:50.780
Good work, Julius

23:53.780 --> 23:55.780
On this simple single train car

23:55.780 --> 23:57.780
You see two steel doors

23:57.780 --> 23:58.780
One toward the rear

23:58.780 --> 24:00.780
One toward the front

24:00.780 --> 24:02.780
And they both slide open

24:02.780 --> 24:04.780
Without obstructing the large lettering

24:04.780 --> 24:07.780
Laid out under the train car's windows

24:07.780 --> 24:09.780
It says

24:12.780 --> 24:14.780
My uncle didn't tell me

24:14.780 --> 24:16.780
That this is what we would be looking at

24:16.780 --> 24:19.780
But I think if we go in

24:19.780 --> 24:22.780
I can impress my uncle

24:22.780 --> 24:23.780
If I recall correctly

24:23.780 --> 24:25.780
Your uncle didn't tell you anything

24:25.780 --> 24:27.780
You haven't been in contact with him

24:27.780 --> 24:28.780
Julius goes in

24:28.780 --> 24:30.780
And acts like he doesn't hear this

24:30.780 --> 24:32.780
Given that assignment by

24:32.780 --> 24:34.780
Julius walks right into the train

24:34.780 --> 24:35.780
The woman who took my job

24:35.780 --> 24:37.780
And actively

24:37.780 --> 24:39.780
Actively doesn't hear this

24:39.780 --> 24:41.780
Looking out over the bridge

24:41.780 --> 24:43.780
Is it also enveloped in fog

24:43.780 --> 24:45.780
Or can we see, like, the center clearly

24:45.780 --> 24:47.780
You can see the center of the bridge clearly

24:47.780 --> 24:49.780
Is there anything distinguishing, like

24:49.780 --> 24:51.780
This is a Thomas question, not a Cal question

24:51.780 --> 24:52.780
Okay

24:52.780 --> 24:53.780
This is a Zach answer

24:53.780 --> 24:56.780
Does it look like a train is blinking out of existence

24:56.780 --> 24:57.780
In the middle of the bridge or something

24:57.780 --> 24:59.780
Like there's evidence of, like, cartoonish

24:59.780 --> 25:00.780
Burn patterns or something

25:00.780 --> 25:02.780
If Thomas is asking no

25:02.780 --> 25:03.780
Cal's looking at the center of the bridge

25:03.780 --> 25:05.780
It doesn't look like anything weird

25:05.780 --> 25:07.780
Is gonna happen in the middle

25:09.780 --> 25:10.780
I think if we get in this train

25:10.780 --> 25:12.780
We'll just pass uneventfully

25:12.780 --> 25:13.780
To the other station

25:13.780 --> 25:15.780
Perhaps that's where this gate is

25:15.780 --> 25:17.780
Julius walks into the train

25:17.780 --> 25:19.780
And finds the snack cart

25:19.780 --> 25:21.780
Stevie's, uh

25:21.780 --> 25:22.780
Gathering up all the equipment

25:22.780 --> 25:24.780
And dragging it up into the back

25:24.780 --> 25:26.780
And the seating in this train car

25:26.780 --> 25:28.780
Is similar to the types of train cars

25:28.780 --> 25:30.780
That have a narrow aisle

25:30.780 --> 25:32.780
Running down the middle of the car

25:32.780 --> 25:34.780
With two seats on either side

25:34.780 --> 25:35.780
Oh you mean

25:35.780 --> 25:37.780
All trains

25:37.780 --> 25:39.780
So with five rows

25:39.780 --> 25:41.780
There's enough space here

25:41.780 --> 25:42.780
For

25:47.780 --> 25:48.780
Magic

25:48.780 --> 25:49.780
20 passengers

25:49.780 --> 25:50.780
Oh

25:51.780 --> 25:52.780
Sitting

25:52.780 --> 25:53.780
20 sitting passengers

25:53.780 --> 25:55.780
Magical schooler

25:55.780 --> 25:56.780
There are some cabinets

25:56.780 --> 25:58.780
In which Julius finds

25:58.780 --> 26:00.780
Some light refreshments

26:00.780 --> 26:01.780
Energy drink

26:01.780 --> 26:02.780
Energy drink

26:02.780 --> 26:03.780
And pretzels

26:03.780 --> 26:05.780
I like to think that energy drink

26:05.780 --> 26:07.780
Is made by the Godel Corporation

26:07.780 --> 26:09.780
Is just a plain, like, aluminum

26:09.780 --> 26:11.780
Unpainted can with energy drink

26:11.780 --> 26:13.780
Painted in the same green

26:13.780 --> 26:14.780
That, like, the

26:14.780 --> 26:16.780
That was on the wall outside

26:16.780 --> 26:17.780
It's perfect

26:17.780 --> 26:19.780
And yeah, you find some energy drinks

26:19.780 --> 26:20.780
There

26:20.780 --> 26:22.780
And there are large windows

26:22.780 --> 26:24.780
On either side of this steel train car

26:24.780 --> 26:26.780
Which kind of looks like a giant can of energy drink

26:26.780 --> 26:28.780
Which does

26:28.780 --> 26:30.780
And the lettering is green

26:30.780 --> 26:31.780
So it matches

26:31.780 --> 26:32.780
Is this the can tram?

26:32.780 --> 26:33.780
This is the can tram

26:33.780 --> 26:34.780
Fuck yeah

26:34.780 --> 26:36.780
Cal steps on and says

26:36.780 --> 26:37.780
Now it's the cal tram

26:37.780 --> 26:39.780
And there's TV screens

26:39.780 --> 26:41.780
Mounted in both the front and the rear

26:41.780 --> 26:43.780
The modern flat screens

26:43.780 --> 26:45.780
Flicker to life

26:45.780 --> 26:46.780
As you all enter

26:46.780 --> 26:47.780
And you see a blank

26:47.780 --> 26:49.780
White sound stage

26:49.780 --> 26:50.780
With a white stool

26:50.780 --> 26:51.780
On the screens

26:51.780 --> 26:53.780
Oh if your stool is white

26:53.780 --> 26:55.780
You should probably get that checked out

26:55.780 --> 26:56.780
Yeah, definitely

26:56.780 --> 26:57.780
Like some like

26:57.780 --> 26:59.780
Sun dried dog poop

26:59.780 --> 27:00.780
Yeah, that's

27:00.780 --> 27:01.780
That is not natural

27:01.780 --> 27:02.780
You don't see much of that

27:02.780 --> 27:03.780
You said stool

27:03.780 --> 27:04.780
So we thought

27:04.780 --> 27:05.780
Poop, white poop

27:05.780 --> 27:07.780
A man walks into frame

27:07.780 --> 27:08.780
Sits on the stool

27:08.780 --> 27:09.780
Oh no

27:09.780 --> 27:11.780
Stool, you said it again

27:13.780 --> 27:14.780
And smiles

27:14.780 --> 27:15.780
Joe, when he says stool

27:15.780 --> 27:17.780
What do you think of?

27:19.780 --> 27:21.780
No, I think of a seat with four legs

27:21.780 --> 27:22.780
What are you guys?

27:22.780 --> 27:25.780
Oh, I think a big poopy

27:25.780 --> 27:26.780
Actually, stool

27:26.780 --> 27:27.780
It's medical

27:27.780 --> 27:29.780
I think of a very gross poopy

27:29.780 --> 27:31.780
When we start calling it stool

27:31.780 --> 27:33.780
There's a reason it's been collected

27:33.780 --> 27:34.780
And it can't be good

27:34.780 --> 27:36.780
A man walks into the frame

27:36.780 --> 27:38.780
Sits on the stool

27:38.780 --> 27:41.780
And smiles at the viewer

27:41.780 --> 27:42.780
Well hello there

27:42.780 --> 27:44.780
Cal says hello

27:44.780 --> 27:46.780
I'm Fred Godel

27:46.780 --> 27:47.780
And you see the Fred Godel

27:47.780 --> 27:49.780
He's a soft looking man

27:49.780 --> 27:50.780
In his later 60s

27:50.780 --> 27:52.780
With a loose plumpness

27:52.780 --> 27:53.780
And glasses

27:53.780 --> 27:55.780
That consistently look like

27:55.780 --> 27:57.780
They're about to fall off of his nose

27:57.780 --> 27:59.780
With black pants and shoes

27:59.780 --> 28:00.780
Fred's green shirt

28:00.780 --> 28:03.780
Is the only pop of color in the shot

28:03.780 --> 28:05.780
Welcome to Godel's Gate

28:05.780 --> 28:07.780
To Grover's Gorge

28:07.780 --> 28:09.780
I'm overjoyed that you're here to join me

28:09.780 --> 28:11.780
On a tour of the future

28:11.780 --> 28:13.780
Before we begin

28:13.780 --> 28:16.780
Please leave all outside food and beverages

28:16.780 --> 28:18.780
In the complimentary lockers

28:18.780 --> 28:20.780
On the outside of this here

28:20.780 --> 28:23.780
Simple steel single train car sized train station

28:23.780 --> 28:26.780
Fred Godel points his finger into the air

28:26.780 --> 28:28.780
And a purple light comes on

28:28.780 --> 28:31.780
This one means there's still

28:31.780 --> 28:34.780
Outside food or beverages in the car

28:34.780 --> 28:36.780
He moves his hand a bit over

28:36.780 --> 28:38.780
And a green light comes on

28:38.780 --> 28:40.780
This one means you're good to go

28:40.780 --> 28:43.780
So which light stays on?

28:43.780 --> 28:44.780
Definitely the purple

28:44.780 --> 28:46.780
With Stevie's huge bag of awesome snacks

28:46.780 --> 28:47.780
Yeah

28:47.780 --> 28:50.780
And Stevie kind of looks at the screen

28:50.780 --> 28:52.780
With this like anger

28:52.780 --> 28:54.780
As she goes down to the bag

28:54.780 --> 28:56.780
And is like ugh

28:56.780 --> 28:58.780
Guys I think I got to get rid of all these snacks

28:58.780 --> 29:00.780
I'm sorry the cooler

29:00.780 --> 29:02.780
But did you finish the coke in that energy drink

29:02.780 --> 29:03.780
That I brought you?

29:03.780 --> 29:04.780
Yeah but hang on a sec

29:04.780 --> 29:06.780
And Beck is getting into her bag

29:06.780 --> 29:07.780
And finding energy drinks

29:07.780 --> 29:09.780
And is chugging

29:09.780 --> 29:11.780
Like at least one if you guys want to get in on this

29:11.780 --> 29:12.780
Julius does not

29:12.780 --> 29:14.780
I've got a thought

29:14.780 --> 29:16.780
Maybe leave one of those for last

29:16.780 --> 29:18.780
And see if the light stays purple

29:18.780 --> 29:20.780
Yeah of course Cal

29:20.780 --> 29:22.780
Let me just get

29:22.780 --> 29:24.780
Topped up here real quick

29:24.780 --> 29:25.780
Hang on

29:25.780 --> 29:27.780
Do you need to be burped?

29:27.780 --> 29:29.780
While this is happening

29:29.780 --> 29:31.780
Julius is going to wander up there

29:31.780 --> 29:33.780
And see if he can't just like

29:33.780 --> 29:35.780
Turn the light off or something

29:35.780 --> 29:37.780
Yeah it's just kind of these like

29:37.780 --> 29:39.780
Colored bulbs over the top

29:39.780 --> 29:41.780
Of where the light is

29:41.780 --> 29:43.780
And just the bulb on the outside

29:43.780 --> 29:45.780
Is the coloration that's making it

29:45.780 --> 29:47.780
So Julius's hand

29:47.780 --> 29:49.780
Over the light doesn't

29:49.780 --> 29:51.780
As Julius puts his hand

29:51.780 --> 29:53.780
Over the purple light

29:53.780 --> 29:55.780
His hand kind of turns

29:55.780 --> 29:56.780
Purplish

29:56.780 --> 29:57.780
Right like

29:57.780 --> 29:58.780
I'm not saying that it's going to change

29:58.780 --> 30:00.780
I'm saying like just if it's covered up

30:00.780 --> 30:01.780
Like

30:01.780 --> 30:03.780
There's nobody else on the train right?

30:03.780 --> 30:05.780
They're not going to know

30:05.780 --> 30:07.780
But the train knows Julius

30:09.780 --> 30:10.780
Exactly

30:10.780 --> 30:11.780
Julius

30:11.780 --> 30:13.780
Continues to hold his hand over the light

30:13.780 --> 30:14.780
Just to see

30:14.780 --> 30:15.780
It's not doing anything

30:15.780 --> 30:16.780
Still doesn't

30:16.780 --> 30:18.780
I let Stevie go ahead and finish

30:18.780 --> 30:20.780
Putting the bag outside the train car

30:20.780 --> 30:21.780
Whatever she was doing

30:21.780 --> 30:22.780
I've gotten my fill

30:22.780 --> 30:23.780
And we are keeping one

30:23.780 --> 30:25.780
Energy drink with us to see

30:25.780 --> 30:26.780
Okay so

30:26.780 --> 30:28.780
I got rid of all of the snacks and drinks

30:28.780 --> 30:30.780
That we brought except for

30:30.780 --> 30:32.780
And she flicks a finger

30:32.780 --> 30:33.780
At the one in Beck's hand

30:33.780 --> 30:35.780
And then we look to the light

30:35.780 --> 30:37.780
And the light is still purple

30:37.780 --> 30:39.780
We actually got rid of

30:39.780 --> 30:41.780
All the drinks

30:41.780 --> 30:42.780
And then he

30:42.780 --> 30:44.780
And then he looks at the light

30:47.780 --> 30:50.780
Are you trying to fool the light with a lie?

30:50.780 --> 30:52.780
Julius looks at you and goes

30:52.780 --> 30:53.780
No

30:53.780 --> 30:55.780
As he nods his head up and down

30:59.780 --> 31:01.780
I don't know what kind of detection system

31:01.780 --> 31:03.780
They have for this outside food or drink

31:03.780 --> 31:06.780
But I don't think it's based on your word

31:07.780 --> 31:11.780
Have you ever been in an autonomous train

31:11.780 --> 31:14.780
That knows whether you have a drink or not?

31:14.780 --> 31:16.780
No but I've been on a roller coaster

31:16.780 --> 31:17.780
And they just ask you there

31:17.780 --> 31:20.780
But this light seems more insistent

31:20.780 --> 31:22.780
Exactly

31:22.780 --> 31:23.780
Now that you mentioned it Cal

31:23.780 --> 31:25.780
How do they know though?

31:25.780 --> 31:26.780
Like

31:26.780 --> 31:28.780
And then Beck wants to see if there's a camera

31:28.780 --> 31:30.780
Or anything in here that he can spot

31:30.780 --> 31:33.780
Every single part of this wall is cameras and sensors

31:34.780 --> 31:36.780
Yeah go ahead and roll search

31:36.780 --> 31:38.780
Or you can roll computer science

31:39.780 --> 31:41.780
I got a 48

31:41.780 --> 31:43.780
Which is good for my computer science

31:43.780 --> 31:45.780
So you know where to look

31:45.780 --> 31:47.780
Which is behind this kind of like

31:47.780 --> 31:49.780
Black sheen plastic

31:49.780 --> 31:50.780
The top middle

31:50.780 --> 31:52.780
The front of this train cabin

31:52.780 --> 31:53.780
Above the TV

31:53.780 --> 31:54.780
Sheen

31:54.780 --> 31:55.780
Very ethical corporation

31:55.780 --> 31:59.780
And you see if you walk real close up to it

31:59.780 --> 32:01.780
You see that there's a

32:01.780 --> 32:03.780
A red blinking light on it

32:03.780 --> 32:05.780
Did anyone else succeed?

32:05.780 --> 32:06.780
I did succeed at search

32:06.780 --> 32:07.780
Bro

32:08.780 --> 32:09.780
Yeah so the two of you noticed

32:09.780 --> 32:11.780
That there are sensors of some sort

32:11.780 --> 32:13.780
On the doors

32:13.780 --> 32:14.780
And the entrances

32:14.780 --> 32:16.780
On the front and back

32:16.780 --> 32:18.780
Entrances of this train car

32:18.780 --> 32:19.780
What do you see there Beck?

32:19.780 --> 32:20.780
Yeah I guess like

32:20.780 --> 32:21.780
Smile dudes

32:21.780 --> 32:22.780
We're on candid camera

32:22.780 --> 32:24.780
And I'm no tech wizard like you

32:24.780 --> 32:26.780
But it appears to be

32:26.780 --> 32:28.780
There are some sensors on this door

32:28.780 --> 32:29.780
Food sensors

32:29.780 --> 32:30.780
Cal

32:30.780 --> 32:32.780
Dude

32:32.780 --> 32:33.780
Good work

32:33.780 --> 32:34.780
You're right man

32:34.780 --> 32:35.780
Those are sensors

32:35.780 --> 32:38.780
You're getting the hang of this tech stuff my man

32:38.780 --> 32:39.780
Cal is like

32:39.780 --> 32:41.780
Openly blushing a little bit behind the makeup

32:41.780 --> 32:43.780
It might just be the flush of like a

32:43.780 --> 32:44.780
Poison oaked face

32:44.780 --> 32:48.780
But he really like

32:48.780 --> 32:49.780
Nothing gets his old heart

32:49.780 --> 32:51.780
Glatter than a young person saying

32:51.780 --> 32:54.780
He did something right with technology

32:54.780 --> 32:57.780
Julius takes his hands off the light

32:57.780 --> 32:59.780
And he walks up to Beck

32:59.780 --> 33:03.780
And Beck I think

33:03.780 --> 33:04.780
If you want that

33:04.780 --> 33:05.780
You better drink it

33:05.780 --> 33:07.780
Dude waste not want not

33:10.780 --> 33:11.780
Wow he drank that really fast

33:11.780 --> 33:13.780
Beck is wired

33:13.780 --> 33:17.780
That was the sound of Joe actually drinking an energy drink

33:17.780 --> 33:20.780
Did Beck have his camera recording already?

33:20.780 --> 33:21.780
Oh yeah

33:21.780 --> 33:22.780
Oh yeah

33:22.780 --> 33:23.780
It hasn't stopped

33:23.780 --> 33:25.780
After his third energy drink in three minutes

33:25.780 --> 33:26.780
He's a little wired and just like

33:26.780 --> 33:29.780
Pointed his camera right at the camera

33:29.780 --> 33:30.780
I see you

33:30.780 --> 33:33.780
The watcher sees the watchman man

33:34.780 --> 33:35.780
So

33:35.780 --> 33:37.780
You can play that game

33:37.780 --> 33:38.780
Train go

33:38.780 --> 33:41.780
Well so we've now downed the can

33:41.780 --> 33:42.780
And I guess I'll throw the can out the door

33:42.780 --> 33:45.780
As soon as the can flies out the door

33:45.780 --> 33:46.780
I say train go

33:46.780 --> 33:49.780
Zach asks you all a question

33:49.780 --> 33:53.780
In the same way that you guys ask me these kinds of questions

33:53.780 --> 33:57.780
Did you try to sneak any additional food or bev?

33:57.780 --> 33:58.780
We're not going to pull out like

33:58.780 --> 34:00.780
Oh by the way I still

34:00.780 --> 34:04.780
Actually I had peanuts in your pocket and your light's fucking dumb

34:04.780 --> 34:05.780
Idiot

34:06.780 --> 34:07.780
You didn't

34:07.780 --> 34:10.780
I didn't say Simon said didn't have any food

34:10.780 --> 34:13.780
So Simon says the light turns green

34:13.780 --> 34:15.780
The door shuts

34:15.780 --> 34:17.780
Hey guys I do have like six hamburgers in my pocket

34:17.780 --> 34:20.780
Oh yeah I've got a bunch of wet lasagna

34:20.780 --> 34:23.780
Just leaking down from my hand pockets

34:23.780 --> 34:25.780
Dude I have to pee and poop

34:25.780 --> 34:29.780
As the simple steel train car begins making its way down the track

34:29.780 --> 34:32.780
It does so at a quick clip

34:32.780 --> 34:39.780
The flat screens show an animation that follows along with a serious voiceover

34:39.780 --> 34:42.780
In 1945

34:42.780 --> 34:47.780
The world defeated men with evil in their hearts

34:47.780 --> 34:49.780
Later that year

34:49.780 --> 34:53.780
Evil itself was extinguished

34:53.780 --> 34:55.780
Out of the windows

34:56.780 --> 35:00.780
You see a palm sweat inducing drop

35:00.780 --> 35:03.780
As the velocity of this train

35:03.780 --> 35:07.780
Has whipped up enough of this fog

35:07.780 --> 35:10.780
That it's moving up out of the ravine

35:10.780 --> 35:12.780
And towards the clouds

35:12.780 --> 35:16.780
And you can see deep 836 feet down

35:16.780 --> 35:19.780
Almost 80 stories which would make this

35:19.780 --> 35:23.780
The 21st tallest bridge in the world

35:23.780 --> 35:27.780
The only thing that kept Frank Godel fighting those years

35:27.780 --> 35:30.780
Was the thought of coming back home

35:30.780 --> 35:32.780
And marrying his sweetheart

35:32.780 --> 35:37.780
But Frank, freshly back from stamping out evil overseas

35:37.780 --> 35:41.780
Returned only to find evil at his doorstep

35:41.780 --> 35:43.780
Threatening his future

35:43.780 --> 35:46.780
Looking back at the cliffside you just stood at

35:46.780 --> 35:52.780
You can all see just how smooth and strange this wall face is

35:52.780 --> 35:55.780
Like nothing you've ever seen before

35:55.780 --> 35:58.780
The fight between Frank Godel and this evil

35:58.780 --> 36:03.780
Lasted for 13 hours and 56 minutes

36:03.780 --> 36:09.780
And the final blow to defeat evil caused this massive crevice

36:09.780 --> 36:13.780
Frank fought the fucking ball-rog?

36:13.780 --> 36:15.780
On the left hand side of the train

36:15.780 --> 36:20.780
The fog in this absurdly deep canyon clears out even more

36:20.780 --> 36:22.780
And you see a church building

36:22.780 --> 36:24.780
Still mostly intact

36:24.780 --> 36:27.780
But completely upside down

36:27.780 --> 36:32.780
Awkwardly stabilized by jutting rocks from both sides

36:32.780 --> 36:36.780
The steeple reaches out for the water below

36:36.780 --> 36:39.780
But the house of God is well stuck

36:39.780 --> 36:44.780
Frank Godel stood tall and victorious after this contest

36:44.780 --> 36:46.780
You can see on your left hand side

36:46.780 --> 36:48.780
The church did not

36:48.780 --> 36:53.780
In its place, the Godel Company cared for Grover's Gorge

36:53.780 --> 36:58.780
And kept its residents fed, clothed, housed and safe

36:58.780 --> 37:01.780
The screen quickly cuts back to Fred Godel

37:01.780 --> 37:05.780
Sitting in his green shirt on his white stool

37:05.780 --> 37:08.780
And the Godel Company has continued that practice

37:08.780 --> 37:11.780
Into these modern times

37:11.780 --> 37:14.780
So open your heart, open your eyes

37:14.780 --> 37:16.780
And open your mind

37:16.780 --> 37:21.780
Let me show you a future without hunger, without pain

37:21.780 --> 37:24.780
Welcome to Grover's Gorge

37:30.780 --> 37:33.780
Holy shit dude, this is dope as fuck

37:35.780 --> 37:36.780
Oh damn

37:36.780 --> 37:40.780
And as the simple steel train car stops, you're on the other side

37:41.780 --> 37:44.780
Strangely, it feels identical

37:45.780 --> 37:47.780
That's not so strange, you look exactly the same

37:47.780 --> 37:52.780
That's right, if everyone could roll heavy machinery, architecture, or search

37:52.780 --> 37:53.780
Whichever you'd like

37:53.780 --> 37:55.780
I passed search with a 14

37:55.780 --> 37:57.780
I also passed search with a 19

37:57.780 --> 38:00.780
Whatever it is, I passed it with a teen something

38:00.780 --> 38:02.780
Uh, what were you rolling on?

38:02.780 --> 38:03.780
Search

38:03.780 --> 38:05.780
Okay, so you all rolled search, so

38:05.780 --> 38:07.780
It was heavy machinery and what was the other one?

38:07.780 --> 38:09.780
Heavy machinery, architecture, or search

38:09.780 --> 38:10.780
Gotcha, yep

38:10.780 --> 38:12.780
Which I only have one of those

38:12.780 --> 38:14.780
So with the success there, you kind of match up

38:14.780 --> 38:17.780
Where the door was on the original side

38:17.780 --> 38:20.780
Like how far away it was from the station

38:20.780 --> 38:25.780
And you can pretty quickly make your way over and find the door through the plant matter

38:25.780 --> 38:27.780
On this side as well

38:27.780 --> 38:30.780
And there's so much plant matter growing on the door

38:30.780 --> 38:35.780
However, it seems to wrap itself in a way in which you can open this door

38:35.780 --> 38:39.780
Without needing to like, cut through any of this shit

38:39.780 --> 38:43.780
Can I, now that you mentioned the overgrowth, can I retroactively real quick mention

38:43.780 --> 38:48.780
Looking around in the train to see its level of decrepitness

38:48.780 --> 38:52.780
Like, was it dusty even, or was it feeling brand new in there?

38:52.780 --> 38:55.780
How did, I mean like the whole setup really, the station, the lockers

38:55.780 --> 38:58.780
Clean, sterile, spartan

38:58.780 --> 38:59.780
But like, maintained?

38:59.780 --> 39:06.780
Simply due to its cleanliness, you would assume that it is wiped down a decent amount

39:06.780 --> 39:07.780
Yeah, okay

39:07.780 --> 39:10.780
Used much, or?

39:10.780 --> 39:13.780
Used much much?

39:13.780 --> 39:14.780
Okay, let me rephrase

39:14.780 --> 39:18.780
Without a heavy machinery roll, you're gonna be hard pressed to figure that one out

39:18.780 --> 39:20.780
Okay, I don't have any in that, so I won't do it

39:20.780 --> 39:23.780
But we rolled search successfully, you

39:23.780 --> 39:25.780
Yeah, you rolled to find the door

39:25.780 --> 39:29.780
Is there like a path that's been followed through this

39:29.780 --> 39:34.780
Or does it seem like we might be one of the few that have used this station?

39:34.780 --> 39:37.780
There is not a well-trod path here

39:37.780 --> 39:40.780
I tricked him, I tricked him

39:40.780 --> 39:44.780
I didn't have any heavy machinery, but I got him to tell me with

39:44.780 --> 39:48.780
You used logic in a good way, I like that, good job Luke

39:48.780 --> 39:49.780
Can I get a pointy look?

39:49.780 --> 39:50.780
Do you have luck already?

39:50.780 --> 39:51.780
Nah, I have luck already

39:51.780 --> 39:52.780
Okay, nevermind

39:52.780 --> 39:53.780
Joe, you can't have any

39:53.780 --> 39:54.780
Damn it

39:54.780 --> 39:59.780
God damn, I drank all those energy drinks there dude

39:59.780 --> 40:03.780
With all that being said, I would like to open the Spongebob door

40:03.780 --> 40:06.780
And emerge from the other side

40:06.780 --> 40:08.780
Yeah, you guys pack up all your shit and kind of

40:08.780 --> 40:12.780
Who lives in a church in the bottom of the ravine?

40:12.780 --> 40:16.780
Frankie Godall

40:16.780 --> 40:19.780
Battled evil for 13 hours did he

40:19.780 --> 40:23.780
Frankie Godall

40:23.780 --> 40:26.780
Were there lockers on the other side also?

40:26.780 --> 40:29.780
Cause the lockers at the first side was to kind of leave our shit in

40:29.780 --> 40:31.780
Yeah, that's a great fucking question

40:31.780 --> 40:34.780
There are lockers on this side, it is exactly identical

40:34.780 --> 40:35.780
Aw, lame

40:35.780 --> 40:36.780
Aw, dip

40:36.780 --> 40:38.780
We should have looked in those lockers back there and seen if they were something

40:38.780 --> 40:40.780
I mean Stevie did, she put the food in the lockers right?

40:40.780 --> 40:41.780
Oh yeah

40:41.780 --> 40:43.780
Stevie, did you see anything in those lockers?

40:43.780 --> 40:45.780
Oh, I didn't open up a bunch of them

40:45.780 --> 40:49.780
I just kind of opened up one and she holds up a key

40:49.780 --> 40:54.780
There was already keys in them so I just locked it and I guess this is our key

40:54.780 --> 40:57.780
Why don't you like check if it works on one of these over here?

40:57.780 --> 41:02.780
And then she walks over and she's holding up a key that is number 5

41:02.780 --> 41:07.780
And she's like, oh these are alphabetical on this side it looks like

41:07.780 --> 41:08.780
Oh cool

41:08.780 --> 41:10.780
Try F

41:10.780 --> 41:11.780
Wait, E

41:11.780 --> 41:12.780
Try L7

41:12.780 --> 41:13.780
Try E

41:13.780 --> 41:17.780
She walks up and there are keys in all of the doors on this side

41:17.780 --> 41:18.780
Drats

41:18.780 --> 41:19.780
Except for

41:19.780 --> 41:21.780
There's keys in all of the doors?

41:21.780 --> 41:26.780
There's keys in all of the lockers so they're all ready to be used except for one

41:26.780 --> 41:28.780
The A locker is locked

41:28.780 --> 41:30.780
Stevie, will you try that one real quick?

41:30.780 --> 41:31.780
Yeah I guess

41:31.780 --> 41:34.780
And she tries to put her key into it and it just kind of jams

41:34.780 --> 41:35.780
She's like, ah it doesn't fit

41:35.780 --> 41:36.780
Interesting

41:36.780 --> 41:38.780
This is so fucking cool

41:38.780 --> 41:39.780
I want to open B

41:39.780 --> 41:41.780
You open B, it is empty

41:41.780 --> 41:42.780
C, D, E

41:42.780 --> 41:43.780
Empty, empty, empty

41:43.780 --> 41:44.780
Z

41:44.780 --> 41:45.780
There's only 20

41:45.780 --> 41:47.780
I put my pocket lasagna in B

41:47.780 --> 41:50.780
You almost had me for a second

41:50.780 --> 41:54.780
What happens as I open up the hatch

41:55.780 --> 41:58.780
Oh okay I thought you were going to say the 20th letter of the alphabet

41:58.780 --> 42:00.780
No that's obviously 6

42:02.780 --> 42:08.780
You guys head on over and Stevie's kind of pack mewling all of your gear over to where this door is

42:08.780 --> 42:14.780
And she's like, alright I've got the key here in my pocket so don't let me forget it

42:14.780 --> 42:17.780
Stevie, don't forget the key in your pocket

42:25.780 --> 42:28.780
Oh sorry guys, Luke just shits pants

42:30.780 --> 42:32.780
That was Julius opening up the hatch

42:32.780 --> 42:36.780
It opens in the exact same way, this time it opens in toward you

42:36.780 --> 42:42.780
And on the other side of this enormous and lush impediment

42:42.780 --> 42:46.780
Is a vast opening with plenty to unpack

42:47.780 --> 42:53.780
You're looking at a sprawling town park straight out of the 1950's idea of the future

42:53.780 --> 42:59.780
Perfectly manicured trees like enormous emerald cake pops

42:59.780 --> 43:03.780
Lying a colorful synthetic walkway

43:03.780 --> 43:12.780
This slightly bouncy comfortable sidewalk would take you all the way around this gigantic green area ahead of you

43:12.780 --> 43:16.780
It's like a big square and the path is a big square going around it

43:16.780 --> 43:20.780
And on the far side of this green space

43:20.780 --> 43:24.780
Maybe about 255 meters away or so

43:24.780 --> 43:30.780
So really far, these people are really tiny, you see tiny people in the distance

43:30.780 --> 43:34.780
People wearing like yellow and green uniforms

43:34.780 --> 43:41.780
And from all the way across this park, so monumental that they're clear from here

43:41.780 --> 43:44.780
There are two statues of men

43:44.780 --> 43:48.780
Each about 26.3 meters tall

43:48.780 --> 43:51.780
Made of green rock

43:51.780 --> 43:55.780
And they stand tall in front of a gorgeous building

43:55.780 --> 43:59.780
Seemingly made of glass and grass

43:59.780 --> 44:02.780
Or ass

44:02.780 --> 44:06.780
There might be ass making it, nobody rides the Godel train for free

44:07.780 --> 44:10.780
So it's a big square, you're on one side, the statues are on the other

44:10.780 --> 44:14.780
There's a massive square park green space in the middle

44:14.780 --> 44:17.780
The trees outline the green space

44:17.780 --> 44:23.780
And on the side that you're on, behind you, there's just this enormous wall of plant life

44:23.780 --> 44:25.780
You can go left or right

44:25.780 --> 44:26.780
To follow the path

44:26.780 --> 44:27.780
To follow the path

44:27.780 --> 44:33.780
And you would assume that based on what you can see in the park that it would lead you in a big square around

44:33.780 --> 44:37.780
Is there what's in the middle? Is it just green space? Literally just green space?

44:37.780 --> 44:45.780
Yep, it's a lot of places where people are playing, people are hanging out, picnicking, throwing frisbees

44:45.780 --> 44:48.780
Are they all wearing green or yellow uniforms?

44:48.780 --> 44:53.780
They're all wearing some sort of green or yellow flair on their clothing

44:53.780 --> 44:57.780
You said the pathway was synthetic, colorful, and bouncy?

44:57.780 --> 44:59.780
Yeah, I did say that

44:59.780 --> 45:00.780
Fuck yeah

45:00.780 --> 45:06.780
Cal puts a foot out on it and then gives a few steps out and starts springing a little bit on it

45:07.780 --> 45:11.780
Yeah, it looks like even Cal could go for a jog and it wouldn't hurt his knees

45:11.780 --> 45:13.780
I haven't felt like this in years

45:15.780 --> 45:16.780
Everyone roll grip

45:16.780 --> 45:22.780
You are in a completely, seemingly unnatural to you location

45:22.780 --> 45:28.780
I failed, 86, Cal starts to think, I haven't felt like this in years

45:28.780 --> 45:36.780
As the other two pass, you're both just looking at, is that okay?

45:36.780 --> 45:39.780
He stops bouncing on the pathway

45:39.780 --> 45:42.780
Stevie, is anything okay?

45:42.780 --> 45:44.780
This is weird, huh?

45:44.780 --> 45:48.780
This is weird, huh? Beck, you're filming, right?

45:48.780 --> 45:54.780
Beck is not only filming, but he's zooming in to try and see if there's anything on the closest uniform

45:54.780 --> 45:56.780
If there's any kind of logos or names or anything

45:56.780 --> 46:00.780
Yeah, so no logos, everyone seems to be wearing a name tag

46:00.780 --> 46:02.780
Does it look like anybody's noticed us?

46:02.780 --> 46:07.780
As you're now looking at the people who are walking, people are walking on this pathway

46:07.780 --> 46:13.780
And they're all kind of side-eyeing you as they're passing, but no one has approached

46:13.780 --> 46:19.780
You see that everyone is wearing nice clothes, they're like very well made

46:20.780 --> 46:27.780
Everyone who is walking on the pathway is wearing grey-scale joggers and athleisure

46:27.780 --> 46:30.780
But then with a flare of green or a flare of yellow

46:30.780 --> 46:35.780
And everyone who's sitting nicely casually, having a picnic, is dressed

46:35.780 --> 46:39.780
Everyone's sitting nicely

46:39.780 --> 46:43.780
That's the call and response I used when I taught children in Korea

46:43.780 --> 46:46.780
Everyone's sitting nicely

46:46.780 --> 46:48.780
I was gonna say they're all in Oakland Acor

46:48.780 --> 46:49.780
Green and yellow

46:49.780 --> 46:52.780
Oh yeah, so it's either green or yellow

46:52.780 --> 46:56.780
No one is wearing both that you've seen so far, but everyone is wearing something

46:56.780 --> 47:02.780
The people who are sitting at like picnics, the men are wearing like nice black shorts

47:02.780 --> 47:05.780
With a green or a yellow polo

47:05.780 --> 47:09.780
The women are wearing like a green or a yellow sundress

47:09.780 --> 47:12.780
The people who are playing a sport of any kind are

47:12.780 --> 47:16.780
Everyone is wearing clothes that are specifically built for what they're doing

47:16.780 --> 47:21.780
And everyone has like nice, what you would call like upper shelf athleisure

47:21.780 --> 47:23.780
Uh, Cal?

47:23.780 --> 47:24.780
Julius

47:24.780 --> 47:25.780
You're a pro, right?

47:25.780 --> 47:26.780
Julius, I am the pro

47:26.780 --> 47:30.780
Beck, from what I know, you're a pro?

47:30.780 --> 47:31.780
Yeah dude

47:31.780 --> 47:33.780
Let's find out where we are

47:33.780 --> 47:37.780
We're in Grover's Gorge, the secret Godel company town

47:37.780 --> 47:40.780
Hidden behind a giant mysterious ravine

47:40.780 --> 47:43.780
That apparently Frank Godel created in a fight with evil itself

47:43.780 --> 47:47.780
Julius has already stopped listening and he's going to find somebody to interview

47:47.780 --> 47:50.780
But Cal is nodding vehemently while rolling on Cal

47:50.780 --> 47:52.780
Did you call me Ba-Cal?

47:52.780 --> 47:54.780
Ma-Cal? What did I say?

47:54.780 --> 47:55.780
You said Ma-Cal

47:55.780 --> 47:58.780
Rolling on Ba-Beck, Ba-Beck, Ba-Beck

47:58.780 --> 48:04.780
The way you were saying that sounded so perfectly angry that Beck instinctively was filming you as you said it

48:04.780 --> 48:05.780
We're standing here

48:05.780 --> 48:06.780
I've always just had this voice

48:06.780 --> 48:09.780
Julius just walks up to the first person he sees and says

48:09.780 --> 48:11.780
Uh, would you like to be on TV?

48:11.780 --> 48:16.780
Yeah, you look up across this absolutely gorgeous, like stunning park

48:16.780 --> 48:22.780
So just like clean and glimmering in the sunshine

48:22.780 --> 48:29.780
And there's a woman who's mid-twenties, blonde ponytail bobbing up and down as she's jogging

48:29.780 --> 48:34.780
Wearing her like lovely, there are no apples in sight

48:34.780 --> 48:36.780
She's not bobbing for apples

48:36.780 --> 48:40.780
But her ponytail is bobbing up and down as she's jogging

48:40.780 --> 48:41.780
For apples?

48:41.780 --> 48:42.780
Towards you

48:42.780 --> 48:45.780
Are you glad?

48:45.780 --> 48:49.780
Yeah, it would have been sad if he didn't do it again

48:49.780 --> 48:56.780
And she kind of like slows her jog as she's kind of approaching you with a quizzical smile on her face

48:56.780 --> 48:59.780
Confused, but also curious

48:59.780 --> 49:04.780
Cal like kind of turns to face her and reaches out his hand and like puts on a big broad smile and says

49:04.780 --> 49:07.780
Cal Colorado, City Action News

49:07.780 --> 49:09.780
May we have a moment of your time?

49:09.780 --> 49:12.780
Oh yes, of course, yeah, absolutely

49:12.780 --> 49:13.780
And she puts out her hand and says

49:13.780 --> 49:16.780
Jennifer, it's extremely nice to meet you, welcome

49:16.780 --> 49:19.780
Welcome to Grover's Gorge, I see that you're not from here

49:19.780 --> 49:24.780
No Jennifer, we're not, we've come here to learn more about your fine town

49:24.780 --> 49:27.780
Well welcome, welcome all, again I'm Jennifer and she puts out her hand

49:27.780 --> 49:28.780
Speck and Julius

49:28.780 --> 49:31.780
Hi Beck, hi Julius, and what's your name?

49:31.780 --> 49:33.780
And Stevie puts out their hand and

49:33.780 --> 49:34.780
Stevie

49:34.780 --> 49:36.780
Yeah, it's nice to meet you Stevie

49:36.780 --> 49:40.780
I mean, is this your first time I would assume at Grover's Gorge?

49:40.780 --> 49:42.780
Yeah, never made it out here before

49:42.780 --> 49:48.780
Welcome, welcome, welcome, oh the Godel Company has treated us so well, woo

49:48.780 --> 49:50.780
Go GEs

49:50.780 --> 49:53.780
That's actually what brought us out here

49:53.780 --> 49:57.780
Could we ask you a few questions about the Godel Company and the gorge?

49:57.780 --> 50:04.780
Yeah, absolutely, absolutely, I mean I'm in the middle of a jog, do you mind if I run in place?

50:05.780 --> 50:09.780
Yeah, I mean I don't, unfortunately that doesn't play on the camera

50:09.780 --> 50:14.780
And she's running in place like, and she's doing high knees now and she's like high knees, high knees, high knees

50:14.780 --> 50:21.780
Beck is getting into the camera bag to get out of lapel mic and he's trying to attach it to her and it's kind of difficult because she's jumping up and down in place

50:21.780 --> 50:26.780
Uh oh, hey, could you maybe just hang on for just a sec, let me get this attached

50:26.780 --> 50:32.780
She slows her roll a little bit, stares you straight into the eyes and is like, I'm doing calf raises

50:32.780 --> 50:38.780
Yeah, you are, those are good calf raises, can I have you like say and spell your name for me real quick?

50:38.780 --> 50:43.780
Yeah, it's Jennifer, J-E-N-N-I-F-E-R, Jennifer

50:43.780 --> 50:45.780
And what's that last name?

50:45.780 --> 50:47.780
Um, Lang

50:54.780 --> 51:00.780
She gets kind of a quizzical look on her face and she's like, can we actually not do a last name, it's just Jennifer

51:00.780 --> 51:04.780
Yeah, that's fine, it's just how we're going to credit you on the news, I just wanted to make sure that we get it accurate

51:04.780 --> 51:10.780
Jennifer from Grover's Gorge, uh, Godel Company, uh, G-E, woo

51:10.780 --> 51:14.780
Jennifer from Grover's Gorge, Godel Corporation, G-E

51:14.780 --> 51:18.780
The Godel Company, gotta get it right, T-C-G, woo, T-G-C, woo

51:18.780 --> 51:23.780
Gotta get it right, The Godel Company, Jennifer, how long have you worked for The Godel Company?

51:23.780 --> 51:27.780
Well, worked I guess, um, you know, a few years now, but

51:27.780 --> 51:29.780
And how long have you lived in Grover's Gorge?

51:29.780 --> 51:36.780
Oh, I've lived here since I was born, born and raised, Grover's Gorge, woo, go G-E's, woo, hungry for points

51:36.780 --> 51:39.780
Did you always hope to work for The Godel Company?

51:39.780 --> 51:44.780
Sure, yeah, I guess hope is a weird word, I knew I was going to work for The Godel Company

51:44.780 --> 51:45.780
What do you mean?

51:45.780 --> 51:49.780
Well, I was born here and raised here and everyone works for The Godel Company here in Grover's Gorge

51:49.780 --> 51:53.780
No one grows up to leave and become a doctor or an astronaut?

51:53.780 --> 51:58.780
Oh, I guess, yeah, if people want to leave they can, but I knew I was going to stay, I like it here

51:58.780 --> 52:00.780
Has anyone to your knowledge ever left?

52:00.780 --> 52:01.780
Yeah

52:01.780 --> 52:02.780
Many people?

52:02.780 --> 52:06.780
Mmm, like, not a ton, maybe like two or three a year maybe?

52:06.780 --> 52:12.780
I see, and Jennifer, you've enthusiastically shouted G-E a couple of times

52:12.780 --> 52:13.780
Woo, go G-E's!

52:13.780 --> 52:15.780
Yes, go G-E's

52:15.780 --> 52:16.780
Thanks for asking about that

52:16.780 --> 52:18.780
What is G-E?

52:18.780 --> 52:23.780
Oh, that means I'm a great employee, woo, go G-E's, hungry for points, woo

52:23.780 --> 52:28.780
I'm a G-E of TGC, I'm a G-E TGC

52:28.780 --> 52:33.780
Yes, yes, Jennifer, hungry for points, what are these points?

52:33.780 --> 52:36.780
Forget about it, cuh, I gotta have my points

52:36.780 --> 52:40.780
Like I said, we hungry, trying to get these points

52:40.780 --> 52:46.780
Cal is like desperately looking to Beck and Julius and he's like, is that a TikTok thing?

52:46.780 --> 52:49.780
I mean, not that I know of, it could be new

52:49.780 --> 52:50.780
Looks at Julius

52:50.780 --> 52:52.780
Julius shakes his head, he doesn't know

52:52.780 --> 52:55.780
Jennifer, is that a TikTok thing?

52:55.780 --> 52:57.780
Oh, I don't think so

52:57.780 --> 52:59.780
Asked and answered

52:59.780 --> 53:03.780
Ask if there's any B-E's, bad employees

53:03.780 --> 53:07.780
Jennifer, perhaps a difficult subject

53:07.780 --> 53:08.780
Mmm

53:08.780 --> 53:09.780
You are a great employee

53:09.780 --> 53:11.780
Yeah, I am, ha

53:11.780 --> 53:13.780
Are there any bad employees?

53:13.780 --> 53:16.780
Oh, I see what you did there, no

53:16.780 --> 53:19.780
None of the people who left were bad employees

53:19.780 --> 53:21.780
Oh, no, they just left

53:21.780 --> 53:29.780
Everyone performs adequately at their job, no one is ever fired or let go or disciplined in any way

53:29.780 --> 53:33.780
Well, no, I don't see why they would be, no, no, no, everyone works like

53:33.780 --> 53:42.780
We have a really good job here and a really good life here, so I don't see why anyone would not want to work well

53:42.780 --> 53:43.780
Does that make sense?

53:43.780 --> 53:45.780
That makes sense to Cal

53:45.780 --> 53:53.780
And now the corner of each of your eyes, all of your eyes, each and every one of them, you all see

53:53.780 --> 53:56.780
How did you know about all my eyes?

53:56.780 --> 54:00.780
I read your character sheet

54:00.780 --> 54:03.780
Goals, get rid of all these eyes

54:03.780 --> 54:05.780
Get rid of all these fucking eyes

54:05.780 --> 54:08.780
I didn't fill out my eye, uh

54:08.780 --> 54:13.780
Oh, dude, if you don't put at least two, you're fucked

54:13.780 --> 54:14.780
Too late now, baby

54:14.780 --> 54:16.780
Out of the corner of your eyes, you

54:16.780 --> 54:20.780
That's a compelling story, the blind television producer who can never see his own segments

54:20.780 --> 54:24.780
But still longs to struggle in the industry, or succeed in the industry

54:24.780 --> 54:26.780
Longs to struggle in the industry

54:26.780 --> 54:29.780
Does struggle in the industry, longs to succeed

54:29.780 --> 54:32.780
My taste is so good, though, that I can

54:32.780 --> 54:35.780
Oh, yeah, you're actual

54:35.780 --> 54:37.780
My taste is with my tongue

54:37.780 --> 54:41.780
I thought you meant you had like Daredevil vision, but for reality television

54:41.780 --> 54:43.780
No, I can taste anything

54:43.780 --> 54:49.780
Your taste is great, and so is your vision, which means that you can see out of the corner of your eye

54:49.780 --> 54:50.780
All of them?

54:50.780 --> 54:52.780
A jackalope

54:52.780 --> 54:55.780
Wait, is a jackalope the rabbit with antlers?

54:55.780 --> 54:57.780
It's the mythical creature with antlers, yeah

54:57.780 --> 54:59.780
It's a rabbit with antlers

54:59.780 --> 55:00.780
A rabbit with antlers

55:00.780 --> 55:03.780
And it's got a yellow ribbon tied around its head

55:03.780 --> 55:04.780
Around its head?

55:04.780 --> 55:05.780
Yeah, like

55:05.780 --> 55:06.780
Around its antlers, or?

55:06.780 --> 55:07.780
Yeah

55:07.780 --> 55:09.780
Cal's jaw drops

55:09.780 --> 55:12.780
Julius immediately starts filming it on his phone

55:12.780 --> 55:15.780
Beck whips around to it and says out loud

55:15.780 --> 55:17.780
You guys got a jackalope?

55:22.780 --> 55:24.780
Jennifer, what is that?

55:42.780 --> 55:53.780
Are we recording?

55:53.780 --> 55:55.780
The people love this

55:55.780 --> 55:56.780
They love what?

55:56.780 --> 55:59.780
They love the roid talk

55:59.780 --> 56:01.780
You just said what now?

56:01.780 --> 56:04.780
I have my first Aldi hemorrhoid

56:04.780 --> 56:06.780
No, it doesn't hurt, it's fine

56:06.780 --> 56:08.780
It's just a firm little guy

56:08.780 --> 56:09.780
I need 30 seconds of silence

56:09.780 --> 56:10.780
Fun little guy

56:10.780 --> 56:12.780
Firm

56:16.780 --> 56:18.780
He's just a, hey, you should get to know him

56:18.780 --> 56:19.780
He's just a fun little guy

56:19.780 --> 56:20.780
He's just a silly little guy

56:20.780 --> 56:21.780
He's just popping out to say hello

56:21.780 --> 56:23.780
He's a lot like you, Zach

56:24.780 --> 56:26.780
Bald little head poking out of your asshole

56:30.780 --> 56:33.780
And it's all my fault

56:40.780 --> 56:43.780
Thanks for watching!
