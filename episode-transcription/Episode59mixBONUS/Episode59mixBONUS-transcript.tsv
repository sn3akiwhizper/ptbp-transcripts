0	7280	What's up, my babies? It's your handler, your GM, your BM, which stands for Best, May, and Never Your DM,
7280	15120	because if I'm in a dungeon, I am most assuredly not the master. It's Zach. I'm Zach. I am Zach.
15120	21280	We have a special bonus episode this week, because this is the end of an era.
21280	28160	This is the last episode of Pretending to Be People that will be released on a Monday,
28160	35520	because in 2020, we are switching our release day to Friday. So the next episode will be out
35520	42240	next year on Friday, January 3rd. But this episode right here? This episode right here is special.
42240	47600	It's a bonus. This is the first episode we made for the Patreon. It's a Q&A from back in May.
47600	54400	This is a taste of what our honorary police officers have access to for $5 a month. Wolf
54400	59840	has an intro to this episode, so I won't keep you for much longer, but go to your Google Cal,
59840	66880	put a horny emoji on every Friday in 2020, and enjoy this Q&A episode. Also, thank you so much
66880	70320	for listening, and every time we get to interact with y'all on the internet, it makes my heart
70320	74080	warm, and every time I see fanart on Instagram or over on the subreddit, it makes my heart
74080	79760	heart okay. I love you. Okay, bye. Welcome, friends, to the nastiest radio show this side
79760	87360	of the city. Y'all know I'm all about that nasty. This is 694.2 PTBP,
87360	94480	contention's greasiest and grimiest radio show, hosted by me, Wolf the dog.
95040	102880	Y'all know I'm such a nasty boy. Now, what ain't nasty is that y'all have been helping support us
102880	111360	through a little thing called Patreon, and that makes Wolf feel real nice inside. Nasty nice.
111360	117600	Keep them dollars flowing, y'all. Wolf needs to buy himself a big old nice bucket to fill with
117600	124560	some tasty meat slop. We have yet another special presentation here on PTBP for y'all. We got
124560	131840	ourselves another listener Q&A from that weird podcast called Pretending to be People. Remember,
131840	137280	y'all, there are spoilers abound here, so make sure you are caught up with what they're putting
137280	144560	down before you take a listen. Now, it's time for this new band I heard to dish out some hot
144560	157280	slop for y'all. I hope y'all ready, cuz it's Kudzu with no backbone.
174560	198160	Hey, that's John McCain. That's not me. He actually sang that at a fundraiser,
198160	203200	didn't he? He did. Oh, fuck. Did he really? Yeah. Have you not seen that video? I guess not. Yeah,
203200	210160	he was like, it reminds me of that old Beach Boys song. Bomb bomb bomb bomb bomb Iran. Yeah,
210160	218560	and then he did it. What a country we live in. Welcome to... Wait, what? The first Patreon
218560	226160	episode. Are we live? Thomas likes that we're kicking it off with that one. When do you think
226560	233600	John McCain bombed Iran? Twice in 89, and then I think he's planning on doing it when he died.
234960	240080	Is he dead now? He's dead now. He died of brain cancer. Yeah, so now then, I guess, probably.
240080	251760	Well, he said that in like 2002. So, 89 was a record. In 89? Mm-hmm. In 91? I wasn't born then.
252640	258960	Okay. So you don't need to know anything. It's impossible to know. Yeah. I don't think of
258960	265920	anything before 93. Luke, you don't think of anything before 93 minutes ago. Ouch. Boom.
265920	270160	He got you. That's not true. I could tell you all about podcasts that I listen to.
270800	277280	Unnamed podcast. I know every episode. Oh, God. Okay, yeah.
279760	284080	Rhymes with gum frown. Oof. All right. Hey, I don't listen to that.
286080	291760	No, you listen to Cum Town. No, I listen to Cum Town. Gum Frown is a terrible racist podcast that
291760	298560	thinks it's doing it ironically. All right. Welcome to the Patreon for pretending to be people.
298560	304240	Don't let the Chapo subreddit hear you say that. Hey, first off, thank you so much for listening.
304240	309680	You are a part of an elite crew. Oh, my God. Like, we are so grateful. Honestly,
309680	313600	fuck all the other people that listen to this podcast except you guys.
314400	318880	You're the heroes. Absolutely. You know what? You're the heroes. Yeah. Let's all clap.
318880	335680	First question is from stories colossal on Twitter. Says if I give you money,
335680	341200	will you tell me what was up with that jump scare? I'm spooked and I can't shake it. Well,
341840	351360	it's colossal. Step one. You have given us money. So, yeah, actually, I said yes, we'll answer it
351360	358240	tonight. And they said, okay, it's a deal. It's a done deal. It was a pact. We made a blood pact
358240	368400	over Twitter. Just please don't unsubscribe to the Patreon immediately. You know what?
368400	374160	Yeah. Thanks for kicking it off. That's what you wanted? Yeah. $5 for this answer? Absolutely. So,
374160	380400	here's what happened. We were in the room recording that episode and in the middle of the
380400	388080	Marvin Glass monologue, I fucking screamed. Like, I went for it. It was absolutely in real life
388080	395520	shocking. It was all like jaw dropped staring. Like, that's why there didn't seem to be much
395520	403200	of a reaction is because our reaction was not audio quality reaction. It was just,
404560	409840	I'm doing it right now. You can't hear it. Again, Luke, this is an audio medium.
410800	416240	It was absolutely stunned silence. Our jaws dropped. We were stunned. And the reason that
416240	424400	it sounded even crazier on the podcast is the magic of audio editing. A little behind the scenes
424400	433360	here, basically what I did was I layered my scream on top of itself three times and I changed up the
433360	438400	interval just a little bit. That way I wasn't at the exact same time each time. And then I modulated
438400	447040	the voice I believe up and down perhaps. So you added the spooky filter. I did. I clicked on my
447040	454000	audacity tab that says spookify. Spooky. 90%. You can check us out on spookify. There were some
454000	458880	questions as to what that was. That was just Marvin getting very angry. He got upset and he
458880	465280	screamed. And it sounded not of this world. It didn't. It didn't for some reason. I wonder why.
465280	472480	And yeah, I've also seen some questions. I saw somebody on Reddit said like, is this DM just
472480	478320	crazy good at voices or is there a modulator in there? And the answer is I am very.
478400	478900	Both.
482400	486880	Yeah, so every once in a while I'll throw something up or down and have a sandwich with it,
486880	491440	but in between like it's all my voice. That's just an old audio pro term.
493840	495680	In the biz, you know. In the biz.
497040	500960	Zach, could you do your best voice of anything for us right now?
500960	503840	Oh yeah, obviously. Give us your Schwarzenegger.
504080	512000	Hello. My name is Arnold Schwarzenegger.
512640	513840	Very good. I nailed it.
516880	523920	What is your favorite character voice to do? So this is so actually growing up. I grew up with.
523920	524400	Too far.
524400	537840	We're not trying to get too intimate on this podcast. Oh God, I'm going to do it.
537840	541360	My dad is an awesome dad. He reigns from heaven.
545440	547520	This is brought to you by assemblies of God.
548400	558720	Oh God, so we are assembling and I am your God. So when I was younger, my dad, he did voices
558720	565280	all the time for us. He's a total goofball in the best way possible and I love him to death.
565280	572960	And he did Mickey Mouse and Goofy and Elmo. And it was always, I mean, in the morning it'd be,
573440	579600	hi everybody. He would just jump into it at any point in time. And he was actually,
579600	588320	I can never get down the Donald Duck. He can talk while he does it. I'm still working on that one.
588320	590960	The Donald Trump. I tried that in my whole childhood.
590960	595920	And never figured it out. You can mumble, but I can't say words.
597040	601680	Thomas can actually do a solid machine gun with his mouth. And I haven't gotten him
601680	606480	to do the Foley work on the podcast yet, but one of these days he'll get some extra
606480	611440	points on the Patreon. Yeah, we're going to debut that on an episode sometime.
611440	617040	We'll have bonus content where we all just do, what's the guy from Police Academy?
617040	618560	Oh yeah. Michael Winslow.
618560	621120	Yeah, we'll do Michael, right? Is that right?
622480	623680	Michael Winslow impressions.
623680	633520	The dad from Family Matters. So we'll debut that at a later time after Thomas meets with
633520	636960	his vocal coach a couple more times. I do, yeah. I've got to do some work out.
636960	642160	Speaking of character voices, we're kind of talking about that recently. And by recently,
642160	645440	what I mean is right before we started recording and we all said, oh wow,
645440	649360	this is a good conversation that we should have had on microphone. Let's go for it.
649360	652560	You didn't answer my question. Luke, why don't you have character voices?
652560	658400	What is your favorite character voice to do in pretending to be people?
658400	662240	Oh, my favorite one to do is Drew Andrews and that's why he's in it the most.
662240	663280	Yeah. Yeah, for sure.
663280	666640	It's one of my favorites also. Could you give us a sample?
668000	674160	No, but what I can do is ask you guys what you're going to do when you are playing a
674160	678320	different character with the voices, Joe? I'm not playing a different character.
678320	684480	If Clark dies, I fucking die. I don't know. I've been working on it.
684480	685680	Don't leave us, Joe.
685680	690720	If I have to do a new character voice. I don't know what I'll do. I have a bad
690720	695840	habit of slipping down into my Southern accent no matter what character I play.
695840	698720	So I'm going to try and actively fight against that, but we'll see what happens.
698720	700800	Do you think that's based on your roots?
700800	701600	I reckon so.
701680	705840	Joe is from South America.
711840	716000	Luke, you do a, like a really out there character voice on the show right now.
716800	720480	Yeah. I do it so often.
720480	721440	It comes back around.
721440	728400	The thing is, once I started doing this podcast, it's kind of like just slipped
728400	732160	in to my everyday life. Like I've started just talking like Keith.
734080	735280	That's crazy, man.
735280	736000	That's insane.
736000	739680	So I'm going to have to get back to my, my normal, you know what I'm thinking?
739680	740800	You got to shake off the character.
740800	744400	I'm thinking I'm shaking. I'm going to shake off the character voice and talk in my normal
744400	750080	voice for the next character, which I mean to, I mean, to the Patreon subscribers, you,
750080	755200	you know, this is just for you, but my normal talking voice is a little bit like this.
756080	758400	And I ain't like talking like this.
758400	760560	We don't hang out with Luke outside of recording.
760560	762160	No, it's impossible.
762160	762720	Honestly.
762720	766480	I just role play during my life.
766480	770560	Yeah. I've told you, you can use your normal voice when you're describing what your character
770560	771040	does.
771040	772320	Yeah. But I don't know.
772320	777760	We tested it with some audiences and it really didn't go over well.
778400	780080	And you know, that might've just been the wrong crowd.
780080	785760	But, uh, people tell me I have a, a, a face for radio and a voice for the library.
787120	791200	Well, and the focus group said voice for closed captioning.
792240	794720	The focus group said that your voice was too smelly.
795440	795680	Yeah.
798320	799120	That reminds me.
799120	802000	I haven't owned a toothbrush in so long.
802000	803280	I really need to go buy one.
803280	804640	How do you brush your teeth?
804640	805280	I don't.
805280	805920	Oh no.
805920	807360	Well, I mean, I brush his teeth.
807920	813280	I let, uh, I let Thomas's dog lick my mouth clean.
813280	815440	Cause they say it's cleaner than a toilet.
815440	816720	They do say that.
816720	819040	I heard it is at least cleaner than the toilet.
820480	821120	That's a bar.
825200	826320	You want to kiss me?
826320	828080	My mouth is cleaner than a toilet.
828640	834640	Speaking of the character voices, uh, we, we had some, some interesting responses to
834640	838000	Wolf, the dog, not being the radio DJ.
838000	844240	When we went to the city, Justin, what are you going to do if the story leaves contention
844240	844880	forever?
845440	846000	I don't know.
846720	848080	Let's probably just do Wolf.
848080	848320	Yeah.
848320	849680	Wolf just moves to the city.
849680	850000	Right.
850000	854000	I feel like Wolf, the dog, Wolf could get really successful in the city.
854000	854320	Yeah.
854320	856080	He expands his empire.
856080	856320	Yeah.
856320	860080	He's an upward rising mobile individual.
860080	861600	Wolf's an ambitious young man.
861600	864160	He is an influencer or whatever.
865040	865840	Or whatever he is.
867760	868480	Slash Wolf.
871360	871600	Yeah.
871600	873680	And he's an influencer on social media.
873680	877440	Did, did people not like my NPR radio host voice?
877440	881040	Oh no, actually I think, uh, I think people were super into it.
881040	881680	Yeah.
881680	882160	Oh no.
882800	884400	What if they like him more than Wolf?
885600	887680	Well, everyone's like, fuck that weird voice.
887680	889840	Let's get more of this soothing voice.
890720	891440	More Steve.
891440	895760	There's a podcast that, uh, or a few months ago, give us a cool little shout out.
895760	899760	They were, they were caught up in listening and they just, uh, recently gave us another
899760	902800	little shout out saying they were kind of catching up and caught up.
902800	905440	And one of the hosts, this is the ugly mugs podcast.
905440	906000	Oh yeah.
906000	908960	The other host said that Wolf, the dog is one of his favorite things in the world and
908960	912640	that he slips into that voice in his day to day life.
912640	913680	That makes me happy.
913680	914560	It was really cool.
914560	915440	That's so fun.
915440	920480	So that actually came about because we were hanging out of the house one day playing a
920480	927280	game of everyone is John, which is a touch on a, another question shortly about this.
927280	927680	Yeah.
927680	934320	I think we, uh, like that's a single page role playing game that we like to do when
934320	935840	we're just hanging out on a Saturday.
935840	936880	The games take what?
936880	938240	Like an hour, hour and a half.
938240	942000	So yeah, we, we can crack out two games or one long one.
942000	947040	But we get along so well last eight hours, pretty much every time.
947040	952320	Uh, but in the middle of that game, Justin just started speaking exactly like Wolf, the
952320	956640	dog, and then immediately named the character in that improv.
956640	960800	And I looked at him and I was like, Justin, this is a thing.
961920	966400	Cause we, I mean, that was like what mid recording of, of the podcast.
966400	966960	Oh yeah.
966960	969280	We were just like, this is going to be on the show.
969280	970640	We have to figure out a way.
970720	977200	And honestly, I think that had a lot to do with how we figured out how to put an intro
977200	978080	onto the show.
978080	985120	And we wanted to do a previously on, but I knew how much work the editing was just to
985120	987520	edit a show and put it out every week.
987520	990160	I really didn't want to put together a previous.
990160	994160	Come through the whole fucking episode, looking for clips and like, yeah.
994160	1000080	And so we, uh, we kind of talked to Justin and I and came up with, uh, with the radio
1000080	1000720	station.
1000720	1005280	And I love that it adds, it adds a character and it is so much more entertaining to listen
1005280	1009760	to than a, here's the thing that you like, especially if you're binging a show, it's
1009760	1012640	like, here's what you listened to 20 minutes ago.
1012640	1013200	Yeah.
1013200	1018880	It adds like a, for me listening to it even, cause I'm a, I'm like, I kind of listened
1018880	1021040	to it after the fact with you guys.
1021040	1024160	Like I'm, I wasn't involved in those recordings initially.
1024160	1028160	So it's really fun for me to get like, as a huge narcissist who loves to hear them.
1028160	1030240	I love my voice.
1030240	1030560	Oh yeah.
1030560	1037600	If you guys don't know that, no, it was just fun to get to do this weird, I wanted to like
1037600	1040400	help out with the podcast and like any way that I could.
1040400	1043840	So it was fun to get to like actually add my voice.
1043840	1046240	Cause we had already talked about you doing the music.
1046240	1046560	Yeah.
1046560	1046880	Yeah.
1046960	1051520	And so it was cool to be like, oh, I'm actually like kind of like a character within this
1051520	1054000	universe now, which is very fun.
1054000	1055280	But he's kind of this other world.
1055280	1058000	You are one of the most well-defined characters in this universe.
1060160	1064000	And you're like, you're like an, like a, almost like a godlike character where you're
1064000	1065440	like, it's like, how the fuck do you know?
1066400	1072240	Me and Zach have talked like extensively about Wolf's like backstory that may never
1072240	1076480	actually get revealed, but we have like all this weird like character history for him
1076480	1078720	and it's real goofy and fun.
1078720	1079040	Yeah.
1079040	1085280	It's necessary in order for us to, uh, to, to get just all up inside Wolf the dog every
1085280	1085680	week.
1085680	1086640	All up in them guts.
1086640	1090560	All up in them guts when we're writing the, uh, the intro.
1090560	1095600	So that kind of leads us into, uh, BFEvans19 wrote, uh, have you ever, have any of you
1095600	1099440	ever played any interesting systems other than Delta Green or Pulp Cthulhu?
1099440	1100000	No.
1100000	1101360	And the answer is no, no.
1102480	1105120	I would like to specifically un-shout out D&D.
1107200	1109760	I don't know that I ever want to play D&D again.
1109760	1110160	No.
1110160	1116400	I'm playing, I'm playing Pathfinder with a group right now and it is, it's fun every
1116400	1118960	time, but it's like, it's a different game.
1118960	1123600	It's so different than Delta Green where it's like, you know, you are just like in,
1123600	1124960	everybody's involved the whole time.
1124960	1130240	And then with Pathfinder, it's like, I am having fun playing it and like when it's my
1130240	1131360	turn, it's, be careful.
1131360	1132240	He's listening.
1132240	1132800	Right.
1132800	1133840	Shout out to Andy.
1133840	1136880	Thank you Andy for running Pathfinder.
1136880	1137380	Oh, sorry.
1138240	1138560	Docs.
1138560	1139280	Who lives that?
1141040	1144320	Andy, after we finished this, let's play Delta Green.
1148240	1150560	But, but yeah, we played a lot of systems.
1150560	1154480	And we've played, um, like I said earlier, we play Everyone is John if we're looking
1154480	1156000	to have a relaxed afternoon.
1156000	1157520	And that one is so much fun.
1157520	1158560	It's a really fun game.
1158560	1158880	Yeah.
1158880	1161680	Besides, you have to have somebody like Zach to run it.
1161680	1165760	Besides Dungeons and Dragons and Delta Green, the only campaign I've gone through.
1166560	1167280	What was that called?
1167280	1170800	The Sion with Zach and Justin.
1170800	1172000	And you play there too.
1174880	1177600	Luke was playing a way less annoying character in that campaign.
1182240	1183200	I was the drummer.
1185360	1190400	You play semi-mythical like superheroes kind of who, who all follow an ancient pantheon
1190400	1195680	of some kind, whether it be Egyptian, uh, Hellenic or, uh, like Aztec.
1195680	1195840	Yeah.
1195840	1198160	We played the fuck products of gods.
1198160	1198800	Yeah.
1198800	1205680	It was, it was so fun to like, I think sometimes like the gameplay in that system can be a
1205680	1209920	little like, I think the gameplay in the system can be a little, eh, like it gets like, you
1209920	1211520	can kind of get OP really quickly.
1212080	1216400	Um, but the like character creation and the thought you put into like having this.
1216400	1217680	What did you play?
1218240	1225280	I was like a Kurdish rebel who killed, uh, was it Osama bin Laden or Saddam Hussein?
1225280	1227040	Oh, it might've been Saddam.
1227040	1228080	Was it both?
1228080	1229280	I can't remember.
1229280	1233680	I made my guy like this crazy, like, uh, assassin basically.
1233680	1236720	But I also had all these, we, the powers were really interesting.
1236720	1238560	And what was your, your God?
1238560	1241280	Ooh, I actually, I actually can't remember.
1241280	1242800	Do you remember your pantheon?
1242800	1244560	What like category it came from?
1244560	1247040	Was I like, was I a noob?
1247040	1248560	No, someone else was a new bus.
1248560	1248960	I think.
1248960	1249600	I don't remember.
1249600	1251440	I had no idea what mine was.
1251440	1252400	Was I a noob?
1254080	1257040	I actually, I played in off, uh, an officer in offspring.
1257040	1257840	I played in offspring.
1257840	1260080	I played the band, the offspring played in the band, the offspring.
1260080	1265840	And, uh, I played a son of Dionysus who was a drunk priest.
1265840	1267440	That was a, that one was really fun.
1267440	1268560	Super fun to play.
1268560	1272560	I played a son of Apollo, I think, or Hermes.
1272560	1275520	I don't remember who was just David Bowie basically.
1276000	1276880	It was a lot of fun.
1276880	1282560	Thomas would write, and Thomas would write songs during the sessions.
1282560	1287280	There was Christmas time in London town.
1287280	1288960	The streets are gray.
1288960	1293040	Wait, the skies are gray and the streets are brown.
1294240	1295600	Yeah, it was very good.
1295600	1297040	It's my favorite song ever.
1298640	1302880	Uh, what was that system that we did a one shot one day of where you play heightened
1302880	1304000	versions of yourselves?
1304720	1305760	That was a lot of fun.
1306240	1307760	Uh, the end of the world one.
1307760	1308000	Yeah.
1308720	1310880	Was it called apocalypse?
1310880	1312160	Dude, I have no idea.
1312160	1313440	We need to look that up right now.
1313440	1314240	Can we take a break?
1314240	1314800	I gotta pee.
1315760	1321440	We'll, uh, go ahead and take a break and we'll come back right after a word from our sponsors.

1361440	1364720	So come on down to Al's Tires this Saturday only.
1366480	1371760	Thank you to product for advertising on this, uh, here podcast.
1371760	1373120	Product has changed my life.
1373120	1378480	I was really excited that we had, uh, that product on this time because that is one
1378480	1384960	that legitimately like I, on a daily basis, think about or use.
1384960	1389920	Well, like product in my toes, product in my hair, product in your ears.
1389920	1393120	Don't put things in your ears, but product goes everywhere.
1394240	1396080	I know I said last week that I was going to buy two.
1396080	1397200	I think I'm going to up the order.
1397200	1397680	Oh yeah.
1397680	1399200	Yeah, I think I got it.
1399200	1400640	I think four is appropriate.
1400640	1403120	So, uh, putting so much product up my penis.
1403120	1407040	We were in, that's a fun place for it and save it for later.
1407040	1407840	Spicy.
1407840	1411840	So the, uh, the, the game that we were talking about was called the end of the world.
1411840	1414560	Uh, we played, I think there's six different variants on it.
1415120	1416080	I just remembered it.
1416080	1416320	Yeah.
1416320	1417440	We just remembered.
1417440	1417680	Yeah.
1417680	1418800	We didn't have to look that up.
1418800	1419680	Great memories.
1419680	1421600	And it is called the end of the world.
1421600	1422560	Thomas was right.
1422560	1424000	You get a five points of luck.
1424960	1425360	Awesome.
1426160	1428240	I'm writing that down.
1429520	1432080	So what, uh, what else?
1432880	1433040	Yeah.
1433040	1435920	So we played that zombie apocalypse into the world.
1436320	1440400	Joe, you were the one who brought that up that day where we played the, uh, the bigger
1440400	1446080	versions of ourselves where we actually, the stats on that game are built by making what
1446080	1448560	you think are the stats for yourself.
1448560	1452160	And then the group votes on whether or not you are right.
1452160	1454160	Yeah, that is incredible.
1454160	1455200	I forgot about that part.
1455200	1457680	Did we have too many like disagreements on that?
1457680	1459840	We had, uh, two slight ones.
1459840	1461840	Uh, we just up stats, right?
1461840	1463920	Like typically that's what we do.
1463920	1464420	Yeah.
1465280	1466320	Makes the game more interesting.
1466320	1469200	But I spent, I feel like people underestimated themselves, right?
1469200	1469440	Yeah.
1469440	1473040	That was, uh, that was one where we were like, Hey man, you're smarter than that.
1473040	1478000	One of the fun things about that, uh, that scenario, I guess, I don't know if they all
1478000	1480080	work this way, but you play heightened versions of yourself.
1480080	1482640	And then we played, uh, that we were in our town.
1482640	1486560	So it was like, we went over to so-and-so's brother's house that we all have been to
1486560	1486960	before.
1486960	1491040	It was actually, you are supposed to play where you are, right?
1491040	1491280	Yeah.
1491360	1494880	You start the game in the space where you're playing.
1494880	1501360	And then, uh, we actually moved pretty quickly to our friend Jake's house and Jake was on
1501360	1502160	the podcast.
1502160	1504800	He played a young Ferguson beans.
1504800	1505280	Rest in peace.
1505280	1507360	And we'll hopefully be on the podcast again.
1507360	1508800	And we'll hopefully be on the podcast.
1508800	1513760	Also, Jake's backyard neighbor is Justin's brother.
1513760	1514320	Yes.
1514320	1518960	And we started our zombie story by making him the first infected, basically.
1518960	1519680	Oh, that's right.
1519680	1520960	The first one we saw.
1521840	1523200	Ryan shout out to Ryan.
1523200	1528160	Everyone has a Ryan Sala at your local meta games.
1528160	1533680	Everyone has a Ryan Sala and Ryan Sala runs our local gaming store called meta games here
1533680	1534400	in Springfield.
1535040	1536640	Meta games has been very good to us.
1536640	1540000	And Ryan, that will cost you $25 for that.
1541520	1543520	Also shout out to Jake's vegan burgers.
1543520	1544880	That's another 25.
1544880	1546720	We just made $50 this episode.
1547920	1548800	Who else do we know?
1548800	1552080	So that was a, that was a really fun one.
1552080	1557200	And actually about, uh, three quarters of the way through that game, we took a little,
1557200	1558880	uh, we took a little detour.
1558880	1559280	Oh yeah.
1559280	1560080	In real life.
1560080	1560800	Yeah.
1560800	1565440	And not in the game, even though the game was based on real life in real, real life.
1565440	1565920	What was it?
1565920	1567760	Your dad needed help with some horses.
1567760	1569280	Oh, I was there for that.
1569280	1569600	Yeah.
1569600	1569840	Yeah.
1569840	1570640	You were here for this game.
1570640	1570800	Yeah.
1570800	1571760	The horse.
1571760	1574240	We went out to my, uh, my parents' house.
1574240	1576960	Shout out to Jake who has Jake's vegan burgers.
1576960	1580800	I don't think he needed help with the horse, but we did just get really drunk and hang
1580800	1581760	out with my dad's horse.
1583440	1585360	Who is also named Jake.
1585360	1585860	Yes.
1586880	1590960	So Jake, uh, the human got to meet, uh, Jake the horse.
1590960	1591360	Yeah.
1591360	1593840	And they couldn't stop staring at each other.
1593840	1594640	They knew.
1594640	1598240	When Two Jakes, Two Jakes is a movie, I think, but when Two Jakes meet, they know.
1598240	1602800	Well, and it was awesome to see Jake ride Jake, but I won't tell you who rode who.
1603440	1607440	Justin, have you played any other interesting game systems?
1607440	1608320	Why yes, Zach.
1608320	1609200	I have.
1609200	1615840	As a matter of fact, uh, I've actually played, uh, dungeon world a little bit, which I am
1615840	1617280	a big fan of.
1617280	1623200	Um, I was actually running a campaign for some friends that, uh, crumbled spectacularly.
1623200	1628160	If I may say so myself, uh, probably in ways that people can guess.
1628720	1630400	That's a very fast paced system, right?
1630400	1632080	Or am I confusing it with something else?
1632480	1633600	It's easy.
1633600	1637120	All the roles are like, are pretty simplistic.
1637120	1642320	Uh, I haven't done, I actually forgot what the, you basically always roll the same, like,
1642320	1643120	is it like two dice?
1643120	1644160	Two D six, I think.
1644160	1646400	Is that a powered by the apocalypse game?
1646400	1647040	Yes, yes, yes.
1647040	1647540	Yeah.
1648160	1649920	I think it's savage world.
1649920	1652720	Savage world and, um, what else?
1652720	1653600	Monster of the week.
1653600	1655440	Those are all powered by the apocalypse.
1655440	1657920	And so did we ever play monster of the week?
1657920	1658640	We still haven't.
1658640	1659140	Okay.
1659440	1661200	But it was, it was so fun.
1661200	1663280	Like it was my first time getting to host something.
1663280	1667840	And this, like you guys said, like with D and D stuff, sometimes you wait for your turn
1667840	1671920	and it's just like, there's so many things you have to think about.
1671920	1676640	Whereas dungeon world is so fucking get that, like, let's, let's make this story happen.
1676640	1681520	Let's do this shit instead of like, okay, get your rule books out and look at all your numbers
1681520	1682160	and everything.
1682160	1686960	And speaking of getting to run stuff, uh, a couple of the days where we've played everyone
1686960	1688640	is John as a friend group.
1689200	1694960	Uh, we've had, I, I've gotten to play and I believe Thomas has run.
1694960	1696560	Everyone has run one.
1696560	1696880	Yeah.
1696880	1700160	Did you do the underwater F1 thing?
1700160	1700660	Yeah.
1700720	1701220	Yeah.
1701280	1702240	That was very fun.
1702240	1703600	And Luke, did you run one?
1703600	1710480	I haven't run one yet, but I would like to do it just to dip my feet into, I've never
1710480	1712320	like ran a game before.
1712320	1715680	It was a fun way to learn a little bit about DMing.
1715680	1720000	It's the only thing I've ever run below, you know, you have 10 or 15 minutes to prepare
1720000	1721120	and then you just have to wing it.
1721120	1722480	And it was, it was fun.
1722480	1724480	It's a, it's a improv Olympics.
1724480	1728560	You, you, you, you set out a few goals for yourself and then have fun.
1728560	1732800	There's really no structure to it beyond what the DM writes in 15 minutes or so.
1732800	1734560	Did we talk about this game at all?
1734560	1736400	Did we talk about how everyone is John works?
1736400	1737600	Oh no, we didn't.
1737600	1741040	But if you want to hop into it, be my guest.
1741760	1743440	Well, so literally everyone is John.
1744400	1748720	John is, is one character that you all kind of take turns controlling.
1749920	1755760	And before you start playing the game, you set specific goals for John and try to two
1755760	1760880	specific goals for John and you try to meet them sometimes as many times as you can.
1760880	1761120	Yeah.
1761120	1765280	And each character voice has two talents, right?
1765280	1766160	You, yes.
1766160	1773360	So you're basically controlling this person who's just losing his mind as he gets compelled
1773520	1776720	by wildly different interests.
1777360	1782400	So the, and then the DM tries to set up the world to, to meet the, make those goals meetable.
1782400	1784400	Like Joe said, it's improv Olympics.
1784400	1784880	Yeah.
1784880	1786640	And we all try to win a medal.
1786640	1792640	Also like whoever's running the game tries to, you know, get everybody to get, meet those
1792640	1793040	goals.
1793040	1796800	Like there's one, what you, somebody wanted to play with the Beatles.
1796800	1797680	Was that you Joe?
1797680	1798080	Yeah.
1798080	1799760	So you kind of set up the goals.
1799760	1803280	You have one that seems impossible and then you have one that you can kind of do on a
1803280	1804640	repeated basis.
1804640	1808640	So mine was, I, it was to play in the Beatles was my unreachable goal.
1808640	1811200	And then I think the other one was to steal stuff or something like that.
1811200	1814320	So I tried to steal free or steal.
1814320	1815920	You've got corn dogs or something.
1815920	1816480	Something like that.
1816480	1820240	I just tried to steal stuff as I made my way toward the stage that Thomas had created where
1820240	1822160	the Beatles were having a reunion concert.
1822720	1824400	I tried to get John there.
1825680	1829760	I remember there was one where I like, one of my talents was like, I was really good
1829760	1831280	at like sucking on stuff.
1831920	1836800	And so like, I attached really uncomfortable ball to play role playing games.
1838320	1844480	Well, I attached myself to the bottom or to the top of a car moving vehicle with my mouth.
1845040	1845200	Yeah.
1847120	1850560	If that's not using your talent, then I don't know what is.
1850560	1851200	Use your mouth.
1852080	1855680	I think Jake had one that was like, he just wanted to like drink milk.
1855680	1856080	Milk.
1856080	1856320	Yeah.
1858160	1859760	That was the one that won, right?
1860480	1861520	Drink a lot of milk.
1862400	1866160	Well, no, because other people kept drinking things that had milk in them somehow.
1866160	1867600	Like, Oh yeah.
1867600	1871680	Cause if other people achieve your goal, then you hit the point for it.
1871680	1874720	Somebody's like, I'm going to drink a, like a white Russian.
1874720	1874960	Yeah.
1874960	1876320	White Russian or a milkshake.
1876320	1877600	That whole drink was yeah.
1877600	1878880	Latte based.
1878880	1885280	So, um, we've got another, uh, we've got another question here from Limey Well.
1885280	1886560	Uh, I think it was on Twitter.
1886560	1887760	Got a Tinder match.
1887760	1889120	Oh, congratulations.
1890720	1891040	Pause.
1891040	1892560	Let's hear that bio.
1892560	1892720	Yeah.
1892720	1893440	Let's look at this.
1895120	1898560	Well, I, uh, today, earlier in the day, it said I had a free boost.
1898560	1900720	So I've been matching with a lot of people.
1900720	1902240	You've been like matching like crazy.
1902240	1904640	So I matched with just now.
1904640	1906240	Uh, it's a fun name.
1906240	1908640	Just the quintessential goth girlfriend.
1908640	1910240	E-girl TM.
1910240	1912560	New to Missouri as of five 27.
1912560	1913440	Show me what you got.
1914000	1914240	Wow.
1915200	1916240	Next question.
1916240	1921760	On an extremely similar note, Limey Well asks, are you going to post up the campaign
1921760	1923120	notes when it's complete?
1923120	1929280	Uh, my answer is, you know, whatever Zach says, that's, that's, that's.
1929280	1929520	Yeah.
1929520	1935360	You can take your own notes along with the podcast, but if someone will pay me, I will
1935360	1937280	take pictures and post them online.
1937280	1941840	Are you going to go into my journals with my information that I have about all of you
1941840	1942640	in the campaign?
1942640	1944160	You don't know that I haven't already.
1944240	1949200	Last time we did that, I found out a disturbing fact about you, which is why I am now wearing
1949200	1950880	my vans at your house.
1950880	1951280	Yeah.
1951280	1955600	I, everybody else took their shoes off when I came in, but Luke kept his on cause I have
1955600	1958160	my shoes are trying to see those toes, baby.
1960160	1961440	What shoes are you guys wearing right now?
1961440	1967120	So the actual answer to that question is, uh, I, I think, uh, yeah, yes.
1967120	1973440	If there's interest, uh, when this, uh, when this, uh, first arc, a story arc with these
1973440	1977040	characters of this campaign is finished, I'll, I'll probably type up something and,
1977040	1979920	uh, send it off or just self publish it.
1979920	1983840	If, if that's something people are interested in, for those of you listening, you would
1983840	1986000	be the ones who had, who would probably get it.
1986480	1991360	Uh, as Patrion subscribers, when, uh, is campaign though, it's a specific thing.
1991360	1993440	Does he mean typing up this campaign?
1993440	1993680	Yeah.
1993680	1998320	So basically what I would do is I would be able to run, yeah, I would outline the town
1998320	2005600	and the characters in the town and then, uh, some sort of, uh, a chain of events with,
2005600	2007040	uh, to match your timeline.
2007040	2007680	Exactly.
2007680	2010720	And then, and then you would all have to do with that what you will.
2010720	2011840	Cause that's what I'm doing.
2012720	2017120	And you get to invite your new friend that has never role-played and make them be Keith.
2017120	2017600	Yeah, man.
2018400	2018880	Oh God.
2022160	2025360	And, uh, yeah, no, I, I, that would be extremely fascinating.
2025600	2029840	I would love to hear how other campaigns went that, uh, played in this setting.
2029840	2030080	Oh, that would be super cool.
2030080	2030960	Yeah, absolutely.
2030960	2033440	That would be extremely interesting to me.
2033440	2036400	Um, let's see, we've got another one here.
2036400	2037520	I don't know how to pronounce this.
2037520	2038720	It's a user on Reddit.
2038720	2041680	It's a J O R S E S H O.
2041680	2042880	Jors is ho.
2042880	2045120	Like horses ho, Jors is ho.
2045120	2046000	I don't know.
2046000	2049680	Uh, Jors ho, Jors show, Jors show.
2049680	2053280	How do you determine the mental disorders the guys suffer from?
2054160	2055360	It's a really good question.
2055360	2057840	And it, uh, it took some balance here.
2057840	2059600	We just add the ones from our own lives.
2061520	2064960	Uh, has, since I don't listen to the other guys stuff,
2064960	2067520	do they, does the audience know all of our disorders?
2067520	2070720	You know, I'm not sure if we've, uh, I don't think we've said it.
2070720	2074480	Well, that's, that's not going to specifics then unless you want to here.
2074480	2077200	Um, I think it's fine to not go into specifics here.
2077200	2082720	Basically I met with each of you individually and we had a quick conversation about it where
2083280	2087280	I told you what I was thinking, a base outline for what the disorder would be.
2087280	2088800	And you said yes or no.
2088800	2093120	I can't remember how that went down, but we muddled it and whittled it down to something
2093120	2094000	that we could play with.
2094000	2098240	Historically in our past games, the disorders have always been kind of based on whatever
2098240	2100240	happened to give us that sanity loss.
2100240	2100480	Right.
2100480	2105680	So on the last episode, we actually, the last Q and A, we talked about how Luke's previous
2105680	2109360	character, Dr. Denny Dennison, AKA worm fingers.
2109360	2114480	He had a, I had a scat fetish, a scat fetish, a debilitating scat fetish.
2114480	2119520	Do you actually remember, I remember the clue that led you to become infatuated with the
2119520	2127920	poop, but I, I remember I, there was something like I had to dig through a toilet to find
2127920	2129840	a clue or to find something.
2129840	2130480	Yeah.
2130480	2135680	And like while doing it, I lost enough, uh, to hit your breaking point, to hit my breaking
2135680	2136000	point.
2136000	2140640	So I developed a scat fetish and you know what?
2140640	2142880	I really ran with it on that one.
2142880	2143600	You sure did.
2144560	2149200	So I believe in that one, we were actually playing a bit of a body horror campaign where
2149200	2154880	you guys had, uh, the spawn of an elder God inside of you in the form of these little
2154880	2156640	white gooby spiders.
2156640	2162640	And Luke's character was bent over the toilet puking spiders like these like goopy monsters
2162640	2165200	into the toilet when he saw a note.
2165200	2170000	But a previous character maybe hadn't flushed when he rolled poorly or something.
2170000	2176400	I had to dig through to get what I had thrown up through puke and poop to find a note left
2176400	2178000	by a character who had been in the bathroom.
2178000	2180240	So I lost, I lost that sanity.
2180240	2182080	And then, um, you know what?
2183120	2187600	It was really the perfect thing for that character to have developed.
2187600	2190240	Patreon subscribers, we promise you more of this.
2190320	2196720	One of mine in that last campaign.
2197920	2199920	That's a little taste of the next character voice.
2201440	2202720	Don't let Keith die.
2204480	2205600	Already got a catchphrase.
2205600	2206560	Joe, what were you saying?
2206560	2212000	I, uh, I saw a ghost girl in a window for one of my disorders that sent my sanity right
2212000	2215040	to the breaking point and I just was scared of kids from that point on.
2215040	2215520	Children.
2215520	2217520	It doesn't always have to be as gross as scat fetish.
2218160	2221040	No, I mean, that's an extreme, I'm pretty sure.
2221040	2223120	I would say that children are just as gross.
2224000	2230320	Children and poop are also just funny because I don't remember any specifics of like you
2230320	2233680	acting that out, but I just kind of ran into a group of kids in an alley one time.
2233680	2239040	And I, uh, I, so, oh, wait, was that that town full of just the weird fucking kids.
2239040	2242160	So when you hit your breaking point, sometimes you don't have any control over what your
2242160	2243120	character does.
2243200	2247920	And so I, uh, ended up running the opposite direction and like across town and away from
2247920	2251040	you guys, I didn't get to be part of whatever was going on for a few minutes.
2252080	2256480	That campaign was really cool because we passed through this, a very creepy town in
2256480	2261920	Arkansas coming back from a show we had seen Zach and I, uh, and another friend of ours.
2262480	2264880	And we were like, fuck, this would be an amazing.
2264880	2266400	We can say what we went and saw.
2266400	2268480	Was it, uh, it was Harmon.
2268480	2273360	It was when we were at a casino in Arkansas.
2273360	2277600	We know when Thomas and I were somehow more sad than we are now and still listening to
2277600	2278240	Harmon town.
2278960	2280720	No, Harmon town was less sad.
2282240	2286320	I don't know, man, but we were going through the alienate any harmonians.
2286320	2286880	No, of course.
2286880	2290480	Why would we, uh, cause they're all sad losers.
2294080	2298240	And we too have, uh, and we've been there so you can get out of it.
2299040	2304080	But no, Harmon town was one of the things that brought, uh, Zach and I that got us interested
2304080	2304560	in roleplaying.
2304560	2305440	Absolutely.
2305440	2307440	Have you guys ever watched Rick and Morty?
2307440	2310720	So Harmon quest was not smart enough to watch Rick and Morty.
2311360	2311600	Yes.
2311600	2313040	Harmon quest was awesome.
2313040	2314320	I really enjoyed it.
2314320	2319840	So, uh, we were on our way back from Arkansas and went through this super creepy town.
2319840	2324160	Then we based, uh, uh, I based a town like three months of our play on.
2324160	2324560	Yeah.
2324560	2325440	And it worked.
2325440	2327200	It was super, it was super fun.
2327200	2331600	Was that when we were doing the, like, uh, in the caves and shit with, uh, yeah.
2331600	2335920	Was it a different one where it was like the, uh, the church put on the Halloween?
2336640	2341040	Yes, that was different characters, but different scenario.
2341040	2341360	Okay.
2341360	2342080	Yeah.
2342080	2343760	That was a real fun time.
2343760	2349440	Uh, that's based on the Helen Texas campaign written by Scott Dorward of the good friends
2349440	2355680	of Jackson Elias podcast and actually fucking huge shout out to Scott Dorward because when
2355680	2361600	I was running Helen Texas during that campaign, I posted on the call of Cthulhu subreddit
2361600	2367600	and I got some awesome responses from people who had also run that scenario.
2367600	2375360	But also Scott responded who wrote the scenario and gave some fantastic insight into how I
2375360	2381280	could finish up that scenario in a, uh, in a really interesting and a horrifying way.
2381280	2382240	That's super duper cool.
2382240	2384320	And I remember I came to you guys, I was like, Oh my God.
2384320	2384480	No.
2384480	2384720	Yeah.
2384720	2386000	You were very excited.
2386000	2387520	We were all excited too.
2387520	2392480	Reddit is obviously the best and worst website in the world because you can create anything
2392480	2392800	on there.
2392800	2396880	But if you're into something very niche like this, like there it's, there's nowhere else
2396880	2398080	you can go really.
2398080	2403040	Honestly, the community of role playing in this game, the call of Cthulhu and Delta green
2403040	2405920	specifically is so fantastic.
2405920	2406480	Actually.
2406480	2411040	Um, yeah, that Scott Dor that, that freaked me out and I got so giddy, but then I was
2411040	2412000	in my kitchen.
2412000	2412880	That was years ago, right?
2412880	2414000	We were just dorks.
2414000	2415600	That excited us all a lot.
2415600	2418000	We're just like, Oh, we're playing this little role playing game.
2418000	2419040	And I wrote it.
2419040	2421200	No, he talked to me.
2421200	2427520	Uh, and then like a month ago I was in my kitchen doing dishes, listening to their podcast,
2427520	2430000	which I've been listening to for years now.
2430000	2434400	And they started talking about pretending to be people and I lost my shit.
2434400	2434900	Yeah.
2435440	2435920	Incredible.
2437680	2438960	I was, I was so happy.
2438960	2444800	But speaking of the people within this, uh, within this hobby being fantastic humans,
2444800	2452880	uh, one of the guys who is very responsible for Delta green, the role playing game, becoming
2452880	2455440	a game, his name is, uh, Dennis debt Willer.
2455440	2463040	And I was writing a paper for my undergrad about why role playing games are a positive
2463040	2466640	influence on both the individual and society.
2466640	2468560	And I needed to interview someone.
2468560	2474480	And so I found his email through his Patreon and I emailed him a bunch of questions, not
2474480	2477440	thinking that, uh, he would, he would respond.
2477440	2481600	I emailed a bunch of different people because he was one of the creators of Delta green,
2481600	2485600	the game that is the only game that I've ever run and obsessed over.
2485600	2492000	And he responded like so quickly with these amazing in depth responses.
2492000	2493120	And it blew me away.
2493120	2498080	And I didn't even realize when I asked for some of his credentials, uh, he was, uh, he
2498080	2503360	was the artist of, he was one of the artists for the original magic, the gathering.
2503360	2503840	No way.
2503840	2505600	Oh, so that's a cool card game.
2505600	2506100	Yeah.
2506720	2507520	Painting the cards.
2507520	2507840	Yeah.
2507840	2509040	He's an incredible artist.
2509040	2512480	I think he worked for Marvel, uh, for a while.
2512480	2513600	And what is Marvel?
2513600	2515760	It's a, uh, they're kind of big now.
2515760	2517360	Uh, actually it's funny.
2517360	2518880	Little indie comic book company.
2519920	2521360	They're doing real good for themselves.
2522240	2525840	So that, that also, I mean, that just absolutely blew me away.
2525840	2530560	And he's, he's done some interviews on some podcasts recently that have been so fun to
2530560	2532000	listen to and really in depth.
2532000	2533120	Um, yeah.
2533120	2534080	Shout out to Dennis.
2534080	2538320	He's, he's doing just amazing work and keeping the game that we love alive.
2538320	2538960	Dennis.
2538960	2539360	Dennis.
2543600	2544000	Yeah.
2544000	2546880	An alternative name for Delta green is the Dennis system.
2552240	2553680	Separate entirely.
2554240	2556080	That is, that is a good DMS.
2556080	2560240	Like guideline for if you want to make your players terrified.
2560800	2561440	Yeah, man.
2561440	2562640	Delta green's real.
2562640	2565520	I know we don't play the, uh, the rules as written in this.
2565520	2571280	So, uh, your characters, uh, are a little bit, uh, heartier than they would be in Delta
2571280	2571600	green.
2572800	2575040	But we still just, and we also,
2575040	2576480	Which is why Pope Cthulhu was made.
2576480	2578640	It's just to offer a slightly different play style.
2578640	2579280	Exactly.
2579280	2584480	And like we, we also in the past, you know, have played as government agency, you know,
2584480	2588080	members before, but for the podcast, wanted to do a little something different.
2588080	2593200	So we are playing a, uh, a, a outside of the normal realm of Delta green and this whole,
2593200	2594480	and this whole campaign.
2594480	2594720	Yeah.
2594720	2599760	Like, um, I don't, were you in those Delta green sessions where just people would drop
2599760	2602080	like flies with me whenever we first started?
2602080	2606880	Justin, when we first started, I went through three characters in three games.
2606880	2607200	Yeah.
2607200	2612960	I, I remember just like having a character that survived like three sessions and being
2612960	2614080	like, I can't die.
2614080	2619520	Like it was like this, like you feel like a God, but normally it's just like, you roll
2619520	2621200	something wrong and you're fucking gone.
2621200	2621440	Yeah.
2621440	2627040	And your character becomes the expert in the group on the mythos within one session.
2627040	2627280	Yeah.
2627280	2631360	Cause you're just out survived to one other person and it's like, I guess I'm the veteran.
2632080	2635760	I think that's, that's why straight Delta green rules are great for one offs.
2635760	2642160	When you're like, you've got a few people together to play a one night scenario when
2642160	2646160	you have six hours, six people, three people are going to die or more.
2646160	2651680	Like, and it's fun to feel that, uh, fragility like to be like, I'm, I could, I could die
2651680	2656320	cause I feel like I don't know if we've mentioned this or not, but I think we lost our first,
2656320	2658800	the first one I played, I think we didn't win.
2658800	2659200	Right.
2659200	2660960	Oh, or did I just get too drunk?
2662480	2662640	No.
2663600	2664400	Yeah.
2664400	2667040	So I don't know that I've been a part of one that we've won.
2668640	2668960	Right.
2668960	2669440	Yeah.
2669440	2676480	Well cause yeah, like the losing upward doctor, the doctor Denny, Dr Denny Dennison one.
2676480	2681600	I ended up becoming like a, a servant to the demon.
2681600	2682720	Oh, well yeah.
2682720	2690240	You became a servitor of a glocky, uh, the elder God who is in the labyrinth.
2690800	2696640	Oh, it was the one who made us vomit spiders, right?
2696640	2696960	Yes.
2696960	2697280	Yeah.
2697280	2700880	Oh, spoilers for that elder God.
2703120	2703620	Yeah.
2704320	2706160	Any new players to Delta green?
2706160	2709840	If you find yourself bobbing in spiders, it's, I might be, I heard.
2709840	2710720	Don't say his name.
2712480	2714480	Al from Al's tires here.
2714480	2718480	I would like to offer him a sincerest apologies to all of you who may have heard a recent
2718480	2722240	advertisement on this radio station ostensibly from Al's tires.
2722800	2728080	I assure you Al's tires disavows that message and its content completely.
2728080	2731520	It does not reflect the values and standards of Al's tires.
2731520	2735600	We shy unabashedly from that sort of empty braggadocio and flash.
2736240	2742000	My son Al Jr suffers from acute hyperactive attention deficit disorder, leaving him as
2742000	2746160	devoid of business sense as he is a sense of basic radio propriety.
2746160	2750640	He will no longer be watching Al's tires on Saturdays unsupervised.
2750640	2755920	Several weeks ago, my beloved wife Molly suggested I take out a local radio advertisement.
2755920	2762320	And while I was at first reluctant, the resulting 7% increase in business was frankly intoxicating,
2762320	2767200	but seeing the impact of fame on my family and my son Al Jr in particular has me questioning
2767200	2770080	whether Al's tires hasn't lost 7% of its soul.
2770720	2774720	So for the next few weeks, we're going to do a little less talking and take some more
2774720	2776880	time to listen, pray, and reflect.
2777760	2782320	All sale prices mentioned in the original advertisement will, of course, be honored.
2783120	2784720	Thank you and God bless.
2784720	2789040	We've got another question here from Reddit from user, oh boy,
2789040	2800080	Rinafiron asks, are there different classes?
2800080	2802800	It seems magic is available in this world.
2802880	2808240	Did the boys just choose not to go down that road with these characters?
2808240	2813040	I'm going to let you guys field this one because we've, this is our third campaign together
2813040	2814320	and we have some experience with this.
2815520	2817520	So yes, magic is available.
2818720	2820000	This is actually a question for you, Zach.
2820000	2821280	Is it available from the outset?
2821280	2823600	You kind of have to find it as a character, don't you?
2823600	2825040	That's, that's what we've done.
2825040	2826080	And that's fun.
2826080	2828240	I think, which is why I don't think any of us.
2828880	2830560	Is there a mechanic for it to start out with?
2830560	2831840	Can you find it to start?
2831920	2835920	I believe in the rules of Delta green rules is written.
2835920	2842080	You can take a, uh, from the top, you can have an experience with the unnatural.
2843120	2846240	However, we have never played that way.
2846240	2851120	And I, the rules I think would totally allow for you to be an advanced kind of character
2851120	2852560	in that if you want it to be.
2852560	2859120	But when we've done our longer campaigns, I think I'm the only one who's been given magic.
2859520	2863760	You're the only one, as far as I can remember, you're the only one that has used magic.
2863760	2865920	And it was a pretty long process and it was cool.
2865920	2871040	Zach made, literally, he handed me at our friend Jake's, uh, pizza night.
2871680	2872640	Pizza night?
2872640	2874000	Shout out to Jake Heron again.
2874000	2876800	This hand drawn, uh, 25 more dollars.
2876800	2877920	Jake's vegan burgers.
2877920	2880400	You owe us 50 for the app.
2880400	2881440	Get the total.
2881440	2886560	This hand drawn little notebook with all these symbols and like weird incantations in it and
2886560	2887040	shit.
2887040	2888800	And like, it was awesome.
2888800	2891120	And he just like, he handed it to me silently.
2891120	2892640	He's like, it's like, you know what this is?
2892640	2893920	And I was like, I don't know what this is.
2895760	2898960	It's like, no, that was actually so dope.
2898960	2900240	I remember that so clearly.
2900240	2907920	So the, uh, call of Cthulhu put out a supplement called the grimoire, the grand grimoire.
2907920	2913920	And I was so fucking stoked for that book because that's a call of Cthulhu mechanic,
2913920	2915040	not a Delta green mechanic.
2915040	2920160	Yeah, so that, that, those, that book, uh, is for the call of Cthulhu game.
2920160	2927120	And it has every single spell that has been used in a call of Cthulhu scenario in the
2927120	2930000	book alphabetized and ready to go.
2930000	2936720	And so I went through it and I found ones that I thought fit into the campaign that
2936720	2939120	we were currently running at the time.
2939120	2947920	And what I did with it is I buried it in the grave of Joe's character's brother.
2947920	2951120	And that character, the brother was still alive.
2952320	2955840	And Thomas's character found the book in that grave.
2955840	2960000	Thus learning that Joe's character's brother was still alive.
2960000	2962000	And that was still a closed game at the time.
2962000	2963440	So we did that in game.
2963440	2965520	We figured, we figured out and found out in game.
2965520	2966720	It was real, it was real cool.
2966720	2972240	And basically for that game, the whole idea was that you guys were playing cowboys, uh,
2972240	2978400	as the terminology goes in Delta green within the, uh, within the lore of the system, there
2978400	2980800	are two factions of Delta green.
2980800	2983760	There's the cowboys and the program.
2983760	2989200	And the cowboys are these, uh, these guys who've been doing this forever, who have the
2989200	2992240	cells, a cell B cell all the way down.
2992240	2996960	And they are there to protect the world from the mythos.
2996960	3003760	And then, uh, basically the program was this Delta green, uh, organization, basically the
3003760	3008640	ones who were brought over from majestic 12, which is an organization within the original
3008640	3009440	Delta green game.
3009440	3014080	I'm getting into some deep lore here, but basically, uh, Joe's character's brother was
3014080	3016240	the leader of the opposition group.
3017040	3017520	Nice.
3018080	3021200	And they found out that he was alive and they found this spell book.
3021200	3025840	So, uh, Thomas was allowed these, like, I think I gave you like eight spells.
3025840	3029600	They were all, um, as powerful as they were fucked up.
3030320	3033600	Cause you had to do something in order to cast the spell, right?
3033600	3036480	They cost, I think willpower and some other things.
3036480	3042080	They, they all exact, like they were costly and they weren't guaranteed as the thing.
3042080	3045280	I lost my arm trying to cast one of them.
3045280	3046960	I remember that one so specifically.
3046960	3050880	Was that the helicopter one or so with, had you fucked it up?
3050880	3052960	I remember, I remember the scene so well.
3052960	3059680	So in that town that we based off, uh, in Arkansas, there was a cave because, um, there
3059680	3063680	was some sign we saw in this like seemingly abandoned town in Arkansas.
3063680	3064080	Oh yeah.
3064080	3067600	It was like trail of the hill people or some shit like that.
3067600	3069040	That's exactly what it said.
3069040	3072800	And we also cave people, I think trail of the cave people.
3073360	3077600	And so I immediately was like, Oh, going to go into that for our game.
3077600	3082080	And it was like, it's a cool, I think archeological thing that I'd like to go back to,
3082080	3084080	but it sounded spooky as fuck.
3084080	3084480	Yeah.
3084480	3094400	And in the game it was, and there is this woman up there who was a, uh, who was a mythos,
3094400	3098080	um, tainted, uh, creature at this point.
3098080	3104640	And she had trapped them and Thomas tries to pull off the spell and rolls a fucking
3104640	3105360	crit fail.
3106160	3110800	The spell, if it had been successful, I believe would have transformed some of the blood in
3110800	3115200	my body into this like damaging dust, right?
3115200	3116880	That shoots out my arm.
3116880	3120640	And so I'd pulled it off a couple of times, uh, before this.
3120640	3125520	And this time, yeah, I roll the crit fail and instead of the blood in my arm turning
3125600	3130320	to dust, just my whole arm turned to dust and it was gone.
3130320	3130640	Yeah.
3130640	3130960	Yeah.
3130960	3133040	So not to get too sorry, Luke, go on.
3133040	3137840	I was going to ask, uh, just, was this the woman that made us drink blood out of a bowl?
3137840	3138320	Yes.
3138320	3138640	Okay.
3138640	3138960	Yeah.
3138960	3139600	Yeah.
3139600	3143040	Um, so it was one of our more lighthearted adventures.
3144720	3150080	So I, uh, not to get too deep on just me and Thomas talking about a past campaign, but,
3150080	3155520	uh, one of my favorite role playing nights of all time was actually just Thomas and I
3155520	3157200	sitting at my kitchen table.
3157200	3162800	And that character had just gotten this spell book that, you know, that he had found and
3162800	3166560	he went out to the woods to, oh my God.
3166560	3166960	Yeah.
3166960	3169440	To try to experiment with some of the spells.
3169440	3171600	Was this the professor character?
3171600	3175520	This was the professor, uh, professor Richard Ryland.
3175520	3176320	Oh, dr.
3176320	3176800	Dr.
3176800	3178320	Richard Ryland.
3178320	3186160	And your wife was very ill.
3186160	3187040	She's very ill.
3187040	3193120	And so, so one of the spells in the book was, it wasn't quite clear what it did.
3193120	3198240	That's why I had to experiment on it, but it looked like it would transfer a life into
3198240	3199920	a, into a healthier body.
3199920	3200080	Yeah.
3200080	3204000	Can you go into like, none of the spells in the spell book actually said.
3204000	3204960	Yeah, exactly.
3204960	3208320	They just kind of had, um, fuck.
3208320	3209680	I don't, I don't remember.
3209680	3211040	I'm sure I still have it somewhere.
3211040	3211280	Yeah.
3211280	3216000	They had obtuse and vague names for the spells and then light directions.
3216000	3217040	So very much so.
3217680	3221440	So he didn't necessarily know what they were going to do, but what he did do was go out
3221440	3225120	to a gas station and, uh, find some right.
3225120	3225600	Dr.
3225600	3228400	Ryland picked up an aimless teen.
3228400	3228640	Yeah.
3228640	3229920	Three of them, I believe.
3229920	3230800	Oh, that's right.
3230800	3232000	Aimless teens.
3232080	3236400	And he took them out to the woods and he tried to switch the body with deers.
3236960	3237200	Yeah.
3238080	3244160	So he like shot a deer and then tried to transfer the life of one of these boys into the body
3244160	3244800	of the deer.
3245360	3251440	And, uh, it was one of the most fucked up and horrifying nights of role playing I've
3251440	3257760	ever had in my life because I was the one, I was the one playing, I was the DM, but I
3257760	3263600	was playing these Call of Cthulhu characters basically who were stuck in the woods with
3263600	3264800	a goddamn sorcerer.
3265520	3266000	Wait.
3266000	3271200	So I, I, I don't know if you told us about this or if this was just, no, that was specifically
3271200	3278560	something that I think I kept from you guys in the campaign because I had, I know, um,
3278560	3281520	I killed three teenagers.
3281520	3284160	Uh, he actually at least one teenager.
3284720	3290640	If I remember correctly, they tried to run away and then you use that, the one that you
3290640	3295120	lost the spell that you lost your arm to, you use that to disintegrate them.
3295680	3297120	So the teens didn't get away.
3298480	3304880	Well, the, the spell that I remember you casting in that was a, to down a helicopter.
3304880	3306560	That was the blood arm one.
3306560	3309840	I was trying to shoot my blood dust at that helicopter to down it.
3309840	3312400	I don't know if I succeeded in that one or if that's where I lost my arm.
3312400	3313520	I actually can't remember.
3313520	3315120	You lost your arm in the cave, but it doesn't matter.
3315120	3320160	It was very, you successfully down the helicopter.
3320160	3325120	I don't know why, but like for some reason we were found out of all the shit that we
3325120	3325840	had been doing.
3325840	3325920	Yeah.
3325920	3331200	I don't know if you've been listening, but I'm pretty lenient on, uh, what is allowed
3331200	3337760	to happen in the games because it's so much fun and like the more fun shit that happens,
3337760	3340000	the better the game is in my opinion.
3340000	3342080	And I'm not going to step in your way.
3342400	3348560	So it's so much sucks when you're like, yeah, like you, you do not do this often.
3348560	3356000	And when you do, well, you do it for good reasons.
3356000	3358080	I mean, I say you don't do this often.
3358080	3363120	You do it very sparingly, but it's like, the only times you say no is when I'm saying
3363120	3367360	something and I'm like, there's no way that he says yes to this.
3367360	3369680	And then, and then, and then you say no.
3369680	3370320	I'm like, okay.
3372080	3377600	I just, I was just listening to an episode where, um, you, Luke as Keith.
3377600	3381440	Oh, it's, it's where you, uh, I was really listening to the episode where you kill your
3381440	3382000	brother.
3382000	3386320	Cause I was like kind of fuzzy on those events and I was like, wait, what happened with all
3386320	3386800	that?
3386800	3392480	So I listened to it again and you shut off the power to, uh, Fergie's house.
3393280	3397600	Then you try to go back through this automatic door and Zach's like, you prop that open,
3397600	3397840	right?
3398880	3401440	He didn't just say like, you can't get back in.
3401600	3408880	Which I think is a very tempting DM instinct sometimes, but it's, it's so much more fun
3408880	3413440	to just get to keep murdering his brother and that woman.
3413440	3417360	I would have found a way around it, but also it would have just taken up time.
3417360	3420080	A roadblock for roadblock's sake is not a fun thing.
3420080	3420960	Exactly.
3420960	3424080	If it's, if it's really something stupid you've done, sometimes yes.
3424080	3428320	But like this was straight up just like, yeah, there's no reason to not get you back through
3428320	3428720	this door.
3429360	3437200	Recently I was talking to Andy who is Luke's DM in that Pathfinder game and we were, shout
3437200	3441280	out to Andy, we were talking about the campaign that you're actually playing in right now.
3441280	3447600	And he was asking me about ways to carry forward and I kind of told him, I was like, well,
3447600	3451760	if you want them to do something that you don't expect, give them a dead end.
3451760	3457760	And it's what I did with Thomas and Luke in the, in the box that was hanging over the,
3457760	3461360	the pulping, the juice box as I've thought of it.
3462400	3466720	Where the fighters, the loser got pulped and juiced onto the crowd below.
3466720	3468000	I basically, I put you guys in there.
3468000	3469440	I had no fucking clue.
3469440	3474560	I'd honestly, um, listeners, I know you're ready for us to get pulped.
3474560	3479520	No, I know that you think that, uh, I'm, I'm paying really close attention and I am, but
3479520	3480960	I forgot Luke had that gun.
3482960	3487040	That is exactly, that is hilarious because we had confirmed it.
3487360	3491280	That's exactly what I was going to ask is like, did you remember that I had that?
3491280	3492320	No, no, I didn't.
3492320	3494560	And when you pulled it out, I was like, yes, dig gun.
3495840	3501280	So like what was, uh, what, what would an alternate reality be if you know what Keith
3501280	3502960	isn't as stupid as you think he is.
3504160	3508880	And alternate reality is that we do a strength test on each other to beat each other to death.
3508880	3509280	Yeah.
3509280	3511120	And one of you fucking kills the other one.
3512400	3514880	And then we just go into the next character or something.
3514880	3515360	Yeah.
3515360	3517600	Um, actually I've got a 50.
3517600	3518800	What do you have in strength?
3518800	3519280	Strength.
3519280	3520800	We've, uh, we've got some dice here.
3520800	3521680	We could settle this.
3521680	3522240	Yeah.
3522240	3523680	You need, what's your score?
3523680	3526720	Strength 55.
3526720	3526960	Okay.
3526960	3528400	You've got five more than me.
3528400	3532480	So whoever rolls the highest without going over, beats the other one to death.
3533760	3535120	26.
3535120	3536160	Oh, that's a pass.
3536880	3537840	At least it's a pass.
3537840	3538720	40.
3538720	3539520	Luke wins that one.
3539520	3540400	Oh shit.
3540400	3543840	Keith Vigna fucking kills John Lee Pettymore.
3543840	3545600	Good thing that didn't happen canonically.
3546960	3549440	Um, we literally had someone on the subreddit ask.
3550560	3553440	They're like, Oh man, I wanted to see John kill Keith.
3553440	3553600	Yeah.
3553600	3554720	And we all agreed.
3554720	3555360	Yeah.
3555360	3559920	Hey, well to whatever, uh, user that was, fuck you.
3563440	3566320	Keith kills John and you know what?
3566320	3567440	I'm going to role play it out.
3570400	3571360	Use your character voice.
3571360	3572160	Yeah, please.
3572160	3572640	Yeah.
3572720	3573040	Hold on.
3575680	3582800	Keith, uh, walks into the, uh, walks into the cube, squares up with John and we're looking
3582800	3584160	at each other in the eye.
3584160	3588240	And Keith is looking at John like, man, I really don't want to do this.
3589280	3592720	John is looking at Keith like, man, I really want to do this.
3592720	3594000	Really wants to kill me.
3594000	3594960	And I see that.
3595840	3596720	And then you shoot him.
3596720	3597600	You just pulled the gun.
3597600	3597840	Yeah.
3597840	3599840	And then you pull the gun out of your penis.
3599840	3601680	And then I pull the gun out of my penis.
3601680	3606720	No, I, uh, I, I, yeah, that's exactly for sure.
3606720	3612080	Uh, Rena, uh, the, uh, the same user asked, uh, are you really going to end the podcast
3612080	3613840	if you don't hit the Patreon goal?
3613840	3614480	Yes.
3614480	3614800	Yeah.
3615360	3615680	Yeah.
3615680	3616400	I know.
3616400	3621920	We will continue the story for, for us, but we will have the fan on.
3621920	3623600	We will have the door open.
3624400	3628960	We will be, we will be getting drunker than we do.
3628960	3634160	Zach won't be spending like a full time job every week.
3634160	3636400	I'll hang out with my wife all the time.
3636400	3637600	Well, your wife sucks.
3639040	3639760	That's not true.
3639760	3640480	That's not true.
3641040	3642000	Oh my God.
3642000	3644800	Well, I just, uh, you've got the coolest wife.
3644800	3645360	I know.
3646000	3647120	Shout out to Taylor.
3647120	3651440	Shout out to Taylor who did a stellar job in the episode, sweater vest, sweater vest,
3651440	3654160	sweater vest with Joe on his backstory.
3654160	3656560	We are also bringing her back shortly.
3657120	3657680	Oh, spoilers.
3657680	3658640	I haven't listened to yours.
3659200	3663120	Also, uh, on, on one of the breaks, also shout out to product.
3663680	3672240	Um, on one of the breaks, I, uh, I walked into the kitchen to throw away a beer can
3672240	3674960	and recycle to recycle a beer can.
3675760	3679760	And, uh, I was like, this smells so good.
3680400	3682720	You had another question coming from, Oh no, you said it.
3684960	3686160	I was trying to pull us up.
3687040	3688480	No question from Joe.
3688480	3689200	Can we leave?
3689760	3692560	Yeah, it is definitely edit all of that.
3694080	3697840	Do we, do we have another question to end it with or a thing too?
3697840	3699760	Well, wait, let's expand a little bit more on.
3699760	3701840	Yes, we are going to end the podcast.
3701840	3702480	So yeah.
3702480	3703520	Uh, sadly.
3704480	3711520	We will have to, uh, stop releasing, uh, weekly and free episodes and any episodes
3711520	3713600	for anyone we'll just shut down completely.
3714560	3718400	And let's not mention that we like, don't even mention we'll keep playing it.
3718400	3719600	Just be like, no, this is the end.
3719600	3720160	Yeah, of course.
3720160	3720640	It's the end.
3720640	3722000	You definitely won't keep playing.
3722000	3723520	And we'll, we'll know.
3724800	3728480	I mean, we won't know what happens to these characters, but, uh, if you don't,
3729600	3734480	if we don't make a thousand dollars a month, we won't be friends anymore.
3734480	3734960	Oh yeah.
3734960	3737040	No, I'll never hang out with these guys again.
3737040	3737760	Why would I?
3737760	3738800	That's pretty true.
3738800	3742560	I will move out of the house that we all live in.
3743360	3745120	But we do need to make it worth Zach's time.
3745120	3746400	That's the bottom line.
3746400	3749360	He, he, he put, he puts hours and hours and hours and hours into it.
3749360	3752640	It needs to be, uh, uh, something that he can be able to do.
3752640	3757120	But more importantly, we really want to grow this into a big enterprise where
3757120	3762240	we are delivering you solid content, not only on a weekly basis, but maybe a
3762240	3764720	twice a week basis, the episodes can get longer.
3764720	3766080	We can get bonus episodes.
3766080	3767920	We can start a second podcast.
3767920	3770560	There are so many things that we can do.
3770560	3772000	We can play other games.
3772000	3773760	Um, this is super fun.
3773760	3776480	It's something we'd really like to keep doing all of us.
3776480	3779040	And so what we would like to say is thank you.
3779040	3781760	Thank you so much for hopping on board right away.
3781760	3782960	That's so fucking cool.
3784000	3786080	Everybody that is listening to this right now.
3786080	3787440	Keep telling your friends about the podcast.
3787440	3790960	That's one of the easiest ways you can help, uh, help us grow is by telling your
3790960	3793280	friends that, uh, we're doing this weird thing.
3793280	3795200	If you know somebody who likes funny stuff, tell them.
3795200	3797200	If you know somebody who likes spooky stuff, tell them.
3797200	3797680	Yeah.
3797680	3799840	If it's the same person, you can tell them twice.
3799840	3801360	Keep reviewing us on iTunes.
3801360	3803120	We'd love to hear it.
3803120	3805440	Even the negative reviews, like really help us.
3805440	3812480	We got one that, uh, we were all pretty tickled by because it specifically said,
3812480	3815840	you know, this podcast is just for white guys sitting around being funny.
3816400	3820080	And they didn't say trying to be funny.
3820080	3822560	Thank God they didn't say trying.
3822560	3826320	Yeah, exactly.
3826320	3830880	So a horror podcast, you know, role play podcast isn't for everybody, but at least
3830880	3831520	you like us.
3833280	3834080	So thank you.
3834640	3837280	Thank you so much for supporting us.
3837280	3844240	It really honestly, it, it means, it means so, so much to us that you care enough to
3844240	3844800	do that.
3844800	3849600	And we are infinitely and, uh, disgustingly grateful.
3849600	3850160	Absolutely.
3850160	3850400	Thank you.
3850400	3850960	Thank you.

3885760	3896720	We'll see you next month.
3916480	3920960	I just wanted to apologize for saying kudzu was dishing out hot slop.
3920960	3926800	You see for your boy Wolf hot slop is something good and something good in the neighborhood
3926800	3938720	is kudzu with no backbone.
3945760	3965600	How am I the only one trying to fool?
3965600	3975600	How can you have enough drowning out all the notes?
3975600	3988600	With no mind at all, no mind at all
3988600	3995600	Light to light, street me down, takes me back to where you're from
3995600	4006600	When you don't stop a dying of devotion to only one
4006600	4026600	With no mind at all, no mind at all, no mind at all
4026600	4050600	With no mind at all, no mind at all
4050600	4059600	Tell me the words, tell me the lies
4059600	4067600	Tell me the guns, tell me the lies
4067600	4079600	Tell me the lies, tell me the lies
