0.00 251.12 speaker0  Hello friends, strangers, bits of biological matter, and hitchhikers from all over the galaxy. I am your guide Wolf the Dog, here to disseminate information and tips to help better your life in the vast emptiness of space. Get your towels ready, cause it's gonna be a wet one here at 694.2 PTBP, the galaxy's only holistic radio station. I hope y'all are ready to buy some of my supplements, cause we got a new Howlin' with Wolf this week. This one comes from Man's Best Friend's Best Friend on Twitter, and Zach's friend Jack in real life. Note here says, your wedding reception this weekend made Zach real fuckin' happy. You two compliment each other so beautifully. He has a personal request for Wolfie. He writes, at some point in the show Zach was having a drink with 1800 and some type of seltzer or soda water I think. Problem is, I'm too lazy to go back and find the episode slash recipe lol, so I'd like to request a formalization of the drink recipe, with measurements included, read by Mr. Dog. Ooh baby, Mr. Dog, I love the ring of that. Well best friend, I'm in the delightful position of being able to deliver exactly what you request. I have here the recipe for Zach's Roleplay and Juice. It is two ounces 1800 silver tequila and one ounce Grand Marnier in a rocks filled glass with crushed ice, topped with grapefruit spindrift sparkling water, served with a lime wedge that should be promptly squeezed and muddled into the drink with dirty fingers. Enjoy the blessing and curse of being the Luis Mendoza of your roleplaying group. He's the kid from D2, The Mighty Ducks, and D3, The Mighty Ducks, who could skate real but people keep saying it. Remember, if you want to write up something for your wolf to how, tag at Pretending Pod on Instagram or Twitter, tag Pretending To Be People on Facebook, or write a 5 star review and email us at pretendingpod at gmail dot com. Also get up on the contest happening over on the subreddit, r slash pretending to be people, all entries have a shot at winning a D&D 5e starter set. If anything, go check out all the brilliant entries on the thread so far, including a work of staggeringly beautiful non-fiction that depicts love between Joe Terry and his character Clark Bishop. Seriously y'all, it's there, and it's delicious. Clark Bishop, and John Lee Kevinmore did their best to survive what seemed to be an imminent demise. After a lethal contest with a human man that is also somehow seemingly part fish and a monstrous giant version of the same abomination, Keith Vigna fell asleep due to blood loss, taking us now to the darkness inside his unconscious mind.
245.52 377.44 speaker1  In the darkness, you see a woman wearing old-timey clothing. Regardless of how she turns to look either way, you can see right through the middle of her head, and she is walking toward you. As she walks, her clothes change multiple times, as if she's in an unnatural fashion show that is moving forward in time, decade by decade. She pulls out a Zippo lighter, and as it hits the ground, you see the House of Chief Maggie Cook go up in flames. You saw this happen in the front yard, but this time, right now, you see it from the backyard. The fire spreads and explodes toward you, over you, through you, and you turn around to see these flames ignite the pond, Bean's Pond, and immediately, the water evaporates. Looking down into a dry basin filled with fish flopping their final flops, you see your brother Ferguson Beans, crouched over a hatch in the ground, wearing a cowboy hat and spurs, and the watch your father, William, gave him. You look down on your wrist, and the watch is there. You look up, and the pond is filled with water and animals, and Tildy B. Mitchell comes walking
373.08 382.08 speaker0  This is just one of the regular old fish men.
381.08 394.84 speaker4  Wow. On different dice also. That's weird. So strange. This room absolutely loves you. Oh, there we go.
393.84 401.28 speaker1  Nine. All right. Hell yeah. And that one actually goes down as well. You are dropping these things. Fuck yeah.
400.28 409.86 speaker4  Like flies.
407.10 424.66 speaker1  And as it dies, it says, barely knew her.
420.82 451.70 speaker3  I don't know what stat this would be, and I'm hoping you would agree with the American government during World War II that every American boy can throw a baseball. of the monster and the other guy who's right on top of him. And there was another guy that killed him because he's a bad ass. So yeah, I want to do that. Okay.
450.70 460.92 speaker1  50%. That's a pretty good chance.
457.50 476.44 speaker3  So yeah, I just kind of like from my position on the catwalk, pull the pin on the splash bang and I just chuck it underhanded and it sails in an arc and just lands right on Keith Vigna's chest. He's unconscious and it explodes.
475.36 480.92 speaker1  A little, maybe.
479.92 489.36 speaker3  You know what? any real damage.
487.32 491.80 speaker4  He's going to look so cool after this. Yeah.
490.80 527.64 speaker3  Oh yeah, he will. Oh my gosh. You're welcome. soot. Yes. Explosions. Explosions. No eyebrows. And yeah, and so this like a ball of light and sound just like emerges in the face of And hopefully disorients him for a turn or so.
525.64 530.52 speaker1  That could be good or bad.
528.64 536.96 speaker3  Doug, go see if they're around.
535.96 554.32 speaker1  other side. Oh, actually I'm in my mind, you kind of bend over and she does a roll over your back. Rush hour two style.
551.32 558.68 speaker3  your mouth, Kathy Piston.
556.92 562.52 speaker1  She's a goddamn assassin. Kathy Piston has not rolled over 40.
560.80 576.00 speaker3  Fucking John Wick. And she rolled a nine. Yeah, Kathy.
566.16 633.32 speaker1  So she fires into the smaller of the two fishmen, the humanoid one, and it takes an absurd amount of damage. You can see blood and acres just like leaking out of this thing. It is now its turn as well as its fish friend in the very back of the room that you can see on the other side of this giant beast thing. and you could tell it smelled and it knew this, this would be a meal that I've already had and it was taken away from me from the inside and I must feast once more. But the flashbang confused it and it swipes down into the water near it thinking that it's where the catwalk is and it falls face first directly into the water.
630.68 645.72 speaker3  Fucking fish dick. I love fish dicks.
641.76 656.04 speaker1  And this is the, uh, who, who pressed the button? Was that John? John Lee Pennymore? All right. So when it's your turn, it'll have been one round. Is that right?
654.68 659.04 speaker3  So that would have been one round. Absolutely. So it'll be two rounds.
658.04 664.24 speaker1  Coming up on two full rounds. Clark Bishop, it is your turn.
663.12 669.28 speaker4  What's the numbers above it say? Oh, that's an interesting question.
668.28 679.84 speaker3  Why?
678.84 693.04 speaker4  I got to take it. So I'm going to do it. That's real scary, but I'm going to have to just be there with the plan of picking them up next round.
691.00 708.28 speaker1  It's been two rounds since you pressed the elevator button. What do you want to do this round?
707.04 724.84 speaker4  be Luke's terms.
720.12 743.64 speaker1  One of them, the one you would assume maybe that was in the back of the room pops up quite And the one that was nearer Keith and it's giant compatriot busts up out of the water
742.40 754.20 speaker3  I mean, who cares?
752.48 849.72 speaker1  And it critically succeeded. in the air. Doug Jacobs. all the way through the neck of Doug Jacobs and the body of agent Trent Chad and lands standing in between you all and the elevator as the body and head fall separately into on either side, just next to Clark Bishop and Keith Vigna. He rolls an op too.
848.72 881.88 speaker4  It slows.
877.86 894.32 speaker1  on to Keith Vigna and keep the two of you on dry catwalk.
892.04 901.16 speaker4  It's a 54 on a 65. Congratulations.
900.16 906.68 speaker1  To Keith's unconscious body? Yeah, as you're pulling him.
905.68 958.42 speaker4  My baby boy. Fuck you too. That's a fail over my power. now is he would throw Keith down onto the catwalk, turn around, and he wants to walk up to the giant fish thing and throw a grenade down its gullet, the frag grenade.
952.80 964.72 speaker1  This thing is pulled down successfully and it is in the water now with the catwalk as you are up on the catwalk. He's about five feet below you. I can't.
963.72 970.02 speaker3  Oh, you want to toss a grenade?
965.02 973.02 speaker1  I thought you wanted to place it gently inside of its mouth.
972.02 976.02 speaker3  Yeah, baseline.
975.02 987.02 speaker4  Come on.
985.02 1009.32 speaker1  We're going willy-nilly here. So you actually get, because you'll be rolling athletics, to drop it in. Maybe a nice beer pong shot this grenade into the mouth of this being.
1005.32 1021.62 speaker4  That's really handy because I don't have any, so I got the baseline 30. Alright. And then you add 20. I got a 50 on this. Here we go. I pass a 37 on a 50. Alright.
1020.62 1026.62 speaker1  Roll 4d6.
1023.62 1049.62 speaker4  You got a couple of d6s over there? Never mind. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. 11 points of damage with that grenade down inside of its belly.
1048.62 1056.92 speaker1  went off. It's like...
1054.92 1061.92 speaker3  Sorry, I was yawning into the mic just then. What was the sound it made?
1060.92 1067.92 speaker1  Could you just...
1065.92 1071.92 speaker3  I'm so sorry, I didn't get much sleep last night. We can take a break if you need a Red Bull or something.
1068.92 1076.92 speaker4  Yeah, I'm gonna run down to the gas station.
1073.92 1086.22 speaker3  I want to move one space forward and do the same thing. Drop a grenade right on top of it.
1085.22 1134.52 speaker1  You are not mistaken. Roll 4d6 for damage for me. 10 total? Yeah. Or did you roll 10 on 1d6? And it starts to kind of gargle. As it moves into the water. Down below. And it is Kathy Piston's turn. Oh, go ahead and roll alertness for me. No.
1132.52 1148.52 speaker3  You know my alertness is 60 and not 6, right?
1143.52 1345.62 speaker1  Kathy Piston moves up at the end of the catwalk leading to the elevator door and lines up her shot on the fish man that just took down, decapitated, and smiled at the death of Doug Jacobs. And she rolls another success. And it doesn't look like it took very much damage at all as she shoots it in its kind of plate amphibious lining there. And some of the sharper parts catch some of the bullets and make it so The fish man will retaliate. And the fish man that is closest to Kathy Piston rolls a 10 and succeeds and hits her for 7 damage with the scythe and just digs the scythe into her leg and she starts screaming out and she's gonna try to like grab on to the end of the scythe and kind of battle back and forth but as she's battling it's just digging in further and further and and falls backwards. Kathy Piston is now bleeding into the water as well. There's also a fish man that is right next to Clark Bishop and Keith Vigna and he is going to try to pin Clark Bishop to the ground so we are going to roll an opposed test of unarmed combat. So this fish man uses its scythe to pin you to the ground and it and you see this mucusy wet slime form and it's big thick lips and it kind of drips down directly onto your face and just splats. has not taken enough damage to be considered what one might call bloody in a game called D&D and it's coming for you John Lee Pettymore. It's coming for you real fucking hard with one of its claws. It reaches back all the way to get as much momentum as possible and it claws at you and it misses.
1343.62 1348.62 speaker3  Oh very very very cool.
1347.62 1361.92 speaker1  It is your turn. You are pinned currently. The only thing you can do unless you're more creative than I is an unarmed contest to become unpinned. Or unarmed combat.
1360.92 1398.22 speaker4  Get creative. Try to persuade it. 74 on a 70.
1397.22 1408.22 speaker1  Oh, it is your turn. Thomas, it's John Lee Pettymore's turn.
1407.22 1422.52 speaker3  No. Okay, but you can move and attack? I want to move one step backwards while tossing a grenade forward and then shoot a shotgun. I just got mad deja vu.
1421.52 1429.52 speaker1  No.
1428.52 1432.52 speaker3  and stepping backwards.
1431.52 1436.52 speaker1  Okay.
1435.52 1450.82 speaker3  Oh, wait. Okay, 61 on a 70 modified. Nice. Nice.
1447.82 1457.82 speaker1  Four six-sided die.
1455.82 1461.82 speaker4  Four dicks six.
1459.82 1488.12 speaker3  but the size is... We found out the math didn't quite work out. Joe throws things on. The weight. So I'm actually going to count that one that's a four right now on the floor. Fucking good because I sacrificed for it. You know what? We've never made rules about squishing your balls while you roll, so let's keep that four. Okay, so four, four, two, and three,
1487.12 1491.12 speaker4  which is...
1490.12 1495.12 speaker1  Thirteen. Thirteen. Thirteen.
1494.12 1505.42 speaker3  Thirteen. Thirteen. Which is... Thirteen.
1502.42 1520.42 speaker1  and you actually hear a whimper from this giant creature in front of you.
1518.42 1549.42 speaker3  but I do want to shoot my shotgun as I... John Lee Pennymore's dead. John Lee Pennymore, go home, John Lee.
1548.42 1570.72 speaker1  Good lord. No, I think moving and throwing a grenade seems... seems perfectly reasonable for a turn. And it is going to be Kathy Piston's turn and she just got mucked up in the leg by a scythe. You can say fuck.
1569.72 1573.72 speaker4  For real? Yeah.
1572.72 1576.72 speaker1  No, with my mouth? Yeah.
1575.72 1581.72 speaker3  But you can't say beep.
1580.72 1594.02 speaker1  I can't do it. Mucked in the leg by a scythe and she's bleeding all over the place and she looks up with this determination in her eyes and a barrel in her hand. But the gun part, not just the barrel.
1592.02 1596.02 speaker3  Yeah, I was like, where'd she get that barrel?
1594.02 1608.02 speaker1  I don't know. I don't know. She's good with it. And she is going to once again fire at a fish man
1607.02 1612.02 speaker4  MVP.
1610.02 1661.32 speaker1  However, she just once again does not roll enough damage to actually damage the creature and therefore, she's like my leg, your leg and she shoots it in the foot and it starts bleeding out and hopping up and down on one foot while still chanting photography, photography photography, photography Very cool. Very cool fish. And it doesn't like being shot in the foot. And so, it's going to come for Kathy Piston. This fish creature takes its scythe out raises it above its head and slams down the scythe into the top of Kathy Piston's skull.
1659.32 1666.32 speaker4  No!
1664.32 1668.32 speaker1  for witnessing this horrible event.
1666.32 1679.62 speaker4  For some reason that one hurts the most. I fail 24 on a 17.
1677.62 1695.62 speaker1  to lose just one sanity. Kathy Piston was a human And just because her death was gruesome does not mean I don't know if deserved was the right word there
1693.62 1703.92 speaker4  Her tank is down.
1701.92 1706.92 speaker1  You hear chants from underwater.
1703.92 1716.92 speaker4  MVP! MVP!
1714.92 1728.92 speaker1  is standing on top of Clark Bishop's throat with its scythe pressed down and according to the rules of Delta Green
1726.92 1750.22 speaker4  I can't contest it. Dad! Zach's an expert.
1748.22 1754.22 speaker3  You read a Chuckling Boy post?
1752.22 1778.52 speaker1  Quick shout out to user ChucklingBoy on Reddit who is doing incredible work on the subreddit for r slash pretending to be people and it is so cool. He posts these posts on Monday and Thursday called Mythos Monday and Technique Thursday and they are just phenomenal.
1776.52 1780.52 speaker4  They are so good you should go and check them out.
1778.52 1784.52 speaker3  It's absurd.
1782.52 1792.82 speaker1  of us and we really can't thank him enough for all he's doing. Thanks man. It's really fun to read all those posts.
1790.82 1798.82 speaker4  I don't read all of your posts because I'm worried that I'll learn too much and I like being the one who doesn't know a lot about the game.
1796.82 1800.82 speaker3  Also he can't read.
1798.82 1808.82 speaker4  I just skim him for the stuff that looks neat.
1806.82 1895.62 speaker1  just headbutts you for one Breaking your nose just a little bit. intense rush of pain throughout but it doesn't It is the massive creature's turn and it is going to rush John Lee Pettymore who just threw at its face and it rolls a success with the claw. The claw. Oh actually what did you do with your turn? and it has a chance It failed the grab attempt. swipes at you scratching the shit out of your body in the front part of it ripping your cool clothes that Kevin had all the black tactical gear less tactical now that it's been shredded up by a big fucking claw.
1893.62 1901.62 speaker4  It's not that turn yet. Never mind.
1899.62 1915.62 speaker1  So Clark at the top of this round go ahead and roll an alertness check for me.
1913.62 1921.62 speaker4  I wouldn't know what's going on with the elevator.
1919.62 1933.62 speaker1  lifted up enough. Just to have something happen maybe. And it's your turn. What would you like to do? You are still being pinned currently.
1931.62 1943.62 speaker4  can I reach into my boot to grab my other gun and use it to fire up at the creature? No. Then I'm just going to unarmed back at him.
1941.62 1953.62 speaker1  So that's the thing with being pinned. It's supposed to completely immobilize you.
1951.62 1965.62 speaker4  Which I should be able to do and I'm having trouble. I succeeded with a 29. Fuck yeah.
1963.62 1969.62 speaker3  Fish fish.
1967.62 1975.62 speaker4  work but can I fling him so hard that he gets away from me?
1973.62 1985.62 speaker1  act naturally or however you want on your next turn but so will he. And or it or whatever a fish person
1983.62 1987.62 speaker4  to him? It just unpicks me. No.
1985.62 2001.62 speaker1  It just gets him off. Yeah. Low on grenades. High in spirit.
1999.62 2015.62 speaker3  I'm going to walk up to the big fish creature and blast my shotgun at it. Cool. Point blank. Did I get any
2013.62 2023.62 speaker4  It definitely seems like you should with a shotgun
2021.62 2027.62 speaker1  It's going to be hard to miss. Doesn't matter
2025.62 2039.62 speaker3  Nice. So yeah. Point blank range. That is 3d6. It is indeed. It would be 4 if it was a crit. 5, 3, and 2. So 10 again. 10 again.
2037.62 2043.62 speaker1  Just like give us a visual of what's
2041.62 2071.62 speaker3  he looks like Nick Cage at the end of Mandy. He's just completely covered in blood. You can see this giant just like these gashes down his chest revealing bits of like bone and metal and he kind of staggers towards this thing one space and then just brings his shotgun up to his hip and just blast it right into its fish face. And doing so blows
2069.62 2105.62 speaker1  of the fish's teeth these massive human like teeth. This is like a mouth that you could climb up into for fun and it like a quarter of this fish's mouth just dissipates into like blood and dust and slime as the creature just moans and from you as it takes this massive amount of damage. But it is still conscious and it is still moving. I don't know if
2103.62 2123.62 speaker3  having heard it so much. So John Lee Kevin Moore he kind of groans looks like tonight McDonald's is serving filet of you.
2121.62 2163.62 speaker1  offended and taken aback it dies. other fishmen is the one that just murdered the shit out of Kathy Piston and really fucked her up good comes up behind you and is going to swing at you with its scythe. a 25 percent. above your head and you feel the wind brush atop.
2161.62 2167.62 speaker3  get shaved right off.
2165.62 2211.62 speaker1  immediately whip pans over to one fish man standing near Clark and Keith and it is going to attempt the same thing at after being thrown off of Clark Bishop it doesn't know quite what to do. However what does know what to do is this giant giant beast that is just reeling from the attack sent to it by John Lee Kevin Moore. I need you to roll an unarmed combat contest. 18 on a 40.
2209.62 2217.62 speaker4  Fuck. With
2215.62 2237.62 speaker1  of you it grabs on to the catwalk below it and it uses its giant arms to launch itself toward John Lee Pettymore with its mouth wide open and it swallows you whole.
2235.62 2261.62 speaker3  Keith got out of this and he's an idiot so this is arguably the safest place I could be right now. I had six points.
2259.62 2283.62 speaker1  the darkness closes in on you as the light above you leaves as this giant creatures mouth closes but you can still feel all of this wet gunk inside and you can feel water
2281.62 2291.62 speaker3  ten like to avoid major damage.
2289.62 2301.62 speaker1  Okay we'll put that on pause. My super cool monologuing about the water that you feel
2299.62 2309.62 speaker3  the little luck thing. The sheep of how to spend luck.
2307.62 2317.62 speaker1  episodes could have used some luck spins maybe. I don't know. Anyway where are we at here?
2315.62 2325.62 speaker3  roll a d6 to reduce damage on that last attack.
2323.62 2343.62 speaker1  Very well done. So you're at five hit points and you feel this water touching your skin and all this fish guts and blood and viscera that is inside of this fish and I need you to roll an intelligence check for me.
2341.62 2347.62 speaker3  He has a seventy five intelligence and he rolls a thirty one. You remember
2345.62 2377.62 speaker1  that the hole that Keith blew into this giant creature is on its right side. And you think by the way that you were eaten and then went down left side. That big hole
2375.62 2387.62 speaker4  It's a badass scene in my head if you had known that you just go charging at its open mouth and dive straight in. That's exactly what happened listeners.
2385.62 2395.62 speaker3  It was my plan all along.
2393.62 2401.62 speaker4  Is that maybe the case?
2399.62 2415.62 speaker1  Bishop's turn. Big Daddy just went and swallowed John. Also his name is
2413.62 2431.62 speaker4  We're close. Sure. economy work with picking up Keith?
2429.62 2439.62 speaker1  We'll say yes.
2437.62 2479.62 speaker4  fishman that's nearest me how's he looking I can move now. I just worry about how fast he can move. He can get all up I think look at the elevator. pick up Keith and fire the fishman. Alright. No movement.
2477.62 2491.62 speaker1  I'm gonna give you a negative 20 on the firearms. Okay. Alright go ahead and roll
2489.62 2497.62 speaker4  I would have passed but I don't pass.
2495.62 2519.62 speaker3  luck. and swimming downward into the beast he John Lee Pettymore is going to release his remaining flash bang and one of the smoke grenades down into these guts as he like swims out the hole. I'm gonna need
2517.62 2531.62 speaker1  to properly do this whole maneuver.
2529.62 2533.62 speaker3  haunted dice Jeff.
2531.62 2539.62 speaker4  We're bumping rolling doubles. It's weird.
2537.62 2551.62 speaker3  because I was rolling like a dumb ass.
2549.62 2555.62 speaker1  this flash and this smoke and flash.
2553.62 2575.62 speaker3  So the flash grenade is hopefully gonna I mean it's a big concussive thing. Hopefully that's gonna fuck up his insides and while he's in the water and then if it doesn't I hope the smoke grenade makes his tummy real
2573.62 2583.62 speaker4  imagine what that would feel like. Just like like dry smoke billowing through your soft insides.
2581.62 2601.62 speaker3  What you have to do is implant one into your guts and leave the fuse sticking out of your belly button and then you can light it. That's what the belly button is for. to this fish man? Well I think you swim

Yep. And the other one is going to move closer to the elevator door. With that it's make an initiative tracker for myself. I was like oh I can totally do this by memory. Nope. Thomas you you hear a noise as you come out of you're swimming away you feel something grip one of your legs. you just swam away from this creature that you were birthed out of and you feel something grab your leg.

2767.62 2789.62 speaker1  you turn and look? I turn and look. When you turn and look you can only see the murky water that is around you. You can't make out where your leg is in the water. The water is too opaque in its nastiness.

Looking down there is absolutely nothing holding on to you but swimming away you do see there is a little fish head about the size of a softball that is on a human body the size of a Barbie doll and it is to make a constitution check because you've been in the water for some time and I looked up the rules
