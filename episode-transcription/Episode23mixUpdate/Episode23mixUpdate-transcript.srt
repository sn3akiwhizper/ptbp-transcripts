00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,680
Hello my patients, it's your doctor, Wolf the Dog, and I'm here to check the charts

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:13,260
so I can diagnose what the fuck is plaguing Contention here on 694.2 PTBP, Contention's

3
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:15,160
only radio show.

4
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:18,780
Y'all I'm scrubbed up and ready to go.

5
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:25,180
This week's Howlin' with Wolf comes from at bfevans19 on Twitter and Reddit who blessed

6
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:32,460
us with a glowing 5 star review on Apple Podcasts, quote, and now Wolf has a special

7
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:47,180
announcement for all you agents in the field out there, 42, 65, 20, 73, 75, 72, 65, 20,

8
00:00:47,180 --> 00:01:13,220
74, 6F, 20, 64, 72, 69, 6E, 6B, 20, 79, 6F, 75, 72, 24, F, 76, 61, 6C, 74, 69, 6E, 65,

9
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:16,420
end transmission, end quote.

10
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:25,180
My producer has a note here, apparently Reddit user KRUCZ36 has made a subreddit for pretending

11
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:30,500
to be people located at r slash pretending to be people.

12
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:35,260
The first person to decode the message and post it in the subreddit will receive the

13
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:40,860
pride that comes with being the best agent in the field and also the ability to write

14
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:46,340
up their own Howlin' with Wolf announcement to be read by your personal physician, Dr.

15
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,340
Wolf.

16
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:55,280
And as always, if you want to see behind the scenes of 694.2 PTBP, follow along at pretending

17
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,900
pod on Instagram and Twitter.

18
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:02,860
There's a Facebook, sure, but Zuckerberg is a fuck face.

19
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,500
Now back to reality.

20
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,440
Oh, there goes gravity.

21
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,460
It's time for the news.

22
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:13,940
After officers Bishop and Vigna had the most uncomfortable dinner since the last supper,

23
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:16,700
some real plot heavy shit went down.

24
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:20,820
Keith Vigna was approached by his niece, Francis Beans.

25
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:25,980
Upon accepting her proposal, the two are driving East away from contention.

26
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:33,660
John Lee Pettymore and Drew Andrews bonded over shared fortune after a smooth transaction.

27
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:38,840
Clark Bishop saw an impossibility out of his window and then woke up in an unfamiliar

28
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,860
place with an unfamiliar face.

29
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:46,900
Strap on your restraints and bite down hard because this is going to be a fucking wild

30
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:47,900
ride.

31
00:02:47,900 --> 00:03:13,340
Keith, you are in the car of your niece, Francis Beans.

32
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,480
It is a Chrysler Sebring.

33
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:21,560
She has offered you $1 million to kill her father, your brother, Ferguson Beans.

34
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:27,880
She tells you she is going to take the secret way to avoid security and begins driving on

35
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:33,620
a narrow path through the woods, trees missing her side mirrors by inches every couple of

36
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,620
feet.

37
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:42,520
And then she pulls up to a black iron fence seemingly out of place in these thick woods.

38
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:48,120
Francis grabs a backpack from her back seat and motions for you to follow her as she opens

39
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:52,360
a hatch in the ground and jumps inside disappearing from view.

40
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,580
I follow her down the hatch.

41
00:03:54,580 --> 00:04:03,120
Down the hatch, you guys are in this like crazy dark underground tunnel that is lit

42
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:10,760
by these red lights every like 15 feet on the walls of this tunnel.

43
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,400
It's dank down here.

44
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,920
It's like, did I recognize it all like on the way here?

45
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,360
Had I ever been here before?

46
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:23,560
I think you've maybe been out here once or twice for a reason.

47
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:29,360
I mean, you and your brother kept in touch kind of, but not really.

48
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,520
So had I been the secret way before?

49
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,520
No, absolutely not.

50
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,520
All right, cool.

51
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,520
So anyway.

52
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:40,320
So you guys are going through this underground tunnel and when you pop up, it's this, she

53
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:47,080
tells you right before, she's like, um, we're about to pop up above ground and it is like

54
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:53,380
this sweet spot where there's no security cameras looking and we'll be able to take

55
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:56,720
an easy direct route into the house.

56
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,720
You can do that.

57
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:03,400
I am going to bail and then I will meet up with you later when it's finished.

58
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,400
All right.

59
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,640
Are you sure you can't come with me?

60
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:10,080
Uh, yeah, I'm pretty fucking sure that it would look a little bit more suspicious if

61
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,920
two of us were coming then maybe just one where we're trying to be stealthy, right?

62
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,400
And avoid people seeing us.

63
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,600
So I think this one's on you, my dude.

64
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,000
Have you ever thought about going into the force?

65
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,720
I think you'd be pretty good at it.

66
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,720
Which one?

67
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,800
The one that I'm on in the police force.

68
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,960
You think that I would be a good police officer?

69
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:37,400
I actually thinking about it now, I am going on a hit for you right now.

70
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,400
Maybe not.

71
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,520
So maybe I wouldn't be a great police officer.

72
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,120
Maybe I'd be about as good of a police officer as you are, Keith.

73
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,840
Oh, you'd be a much better police officer than me.

74
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,840
Anyway.

75
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,840
Um, okay.

76
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,640
Just show me the route that I need to take.

77
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,640
Okay.

78
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:56,360
And she writes it out, kind of like shows you on her palm where the two houses are that

79
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:01,960
are on the property and then, uh, which one is Ferguson's and how you need to get up into

80
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:07,280
his room and like where to hide, basically like written on her hand.

81
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,280
It's written on her hand.

82
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:14,160
I put my hand up to her hand and my slightly sweaty palm is hold it on a little bit and

83
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,160
then take it off.

84
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,720
And now it's just on my hand, but tattoo style first.

85
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,720
Yeah.

86
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,720
Yeah.

87
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,920
And she is super grossed out the entire time your hand is touching your hand.

88
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,120
She's like, I hate this.

89
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,120
I hate this.

90
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,120
I'm taking a picture.

91
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,560
This is so, why didn't you just take a picture evidence I'm a cop.

92
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,560
I'm a cop.

93
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:42,480
Uh, so you open up this hatch as she walks back the way you guys came and she cracks

94
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:46,440
up in this hatch for you and looking out, you're into the world.

95
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,600
It's this beautiful, nice little place.

96
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:56,560
Uh, Ferguson beans and his wife, Stacy live in two separate houses, right on the County

97
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,760
line between contention and the city.

98
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:05,040
They both own one of the homes and they use a weird archaic marriage law.

99
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,560
So they can both vote in both counties.

100
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:14,800
Fergie often brags about this to people over at his home, his home, his home is modern

101
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:20,280
with lots of sharp lines, glass walls and geometrical patterns.

102
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:25,600
And Stacy's home is an old Victorian with a wraparound porch and a turret reaching into

103
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,360
the sky from one corner.

104
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,200
And based on the map, are they like right next to each other, right next to each other.

105
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:37,080
And there's almost a line like in the grass where you can see the, like the County line

106
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:43,080
that Ferguson likes to joke about what a fucking dickhead.

107
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:49,040
And uh, as you can see from your hand, your backwards hand map, uh, you've got a direct

108
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:55,120
route into the back of Ferguson's home, uh, where you won't be seen by security.

109
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,120
Okay.

110
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:00,120
Um, I guess I stealthily sneak the path that she told me to do.

111
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,120
Yeah, absolutely.

112
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,800
So you can, I mean, you're just walking, there's like nobody here.

113
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,800
It's super dead.

114
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,360
You can maybe see there's like one or two lights on in the other home, the Victorian

115
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,840
home, Stacy's house.

116
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,180
Uh, but there are no lights on inside Fergie's Fergie's home.

117
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:17,960
And I'm, she told me to go into his house, his house.

118
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,960
Yeah.

119
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,960
They actually live in separate houses.

120
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:20,960
Yeah.

121
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,240
Cause I'll just go down the path and go into his unlit home.

122
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,240
Okay.

123
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:34,600
As you actually walk up to the door, it opens for you and immediately like, like what kind

124
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,600
of door is it?

125
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:40,700
Is it like a sliding like a, no, it's like a, it's like a normal door, but when it opens,

126
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:43,840
it's like, welcome home Ferguson.

127
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,000
This like voice comes over the top.

128
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I pause.

129
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,740
Do I hear any, anything else?

130
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:51,740
Nope.

131
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,580
I go into the home, I guess.

132
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:55,580
Yeah.

133
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,860
Walking through his house, everything is automated.

134
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:00,700
Like everything in this house, he's got like a smart home.

135
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:04,100
So like everything is super automated.

136
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,440
The like, everything looks super nice.

137
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,940
Everything's really minimalistic.

138
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:08,940
Okay.

139
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,180
I realize that everything's automated.

140
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:14,900
I want to go like outside and try to find the breaker or something for the house and

141
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,860
just like turn all the, you know, power off.

142
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:17,860
So yeah.

143
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:18,860
Yeah.

144
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:19,860
You can do that.

145
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:20,860
All right.

146
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:21,860
Easily.

147
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:22,860
I do that.

148
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:23,860
And then I go back to that door and walk in.

149
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:24,860
Okay.

150
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:27,020
I assume that you left it like cracked so that you could get back in.

151
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,020
Right.

152
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,020
Yeah.

153
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:31,300
You go in and everything's off.

154
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,300
Cool.

155
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,100
Completely dark inside.

156
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,820
And where did she tell me he would be?

157
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:41,260
She told you that the best spot would be upstairs.

158
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:46,140
Just go upstairs and get into his room and hide in the closet.

159
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:51,240
And he's going to be drunk or high or both when he comes home and he'll just pass the

160
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:55,660
fuck out in bed and just put a bullet in him and leave as soon as you can.

161
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:56,660
Okay.

162
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,500
I don't think I want to shoot him.

163
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,940
I'm going to grab, stabbing him is seems pretty hard.

164
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:02,940
It's really intimate.

165
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:03,940
Yeah.

166
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:04,940
I don't want to do that either.

167
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,340
Maybe.

168
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,340
Do you want to be inside Ferguson?

169
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:11,340
Do I want to be inside Ferguson?

170
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,340
Yeah.

171
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,340
If you're going to stab him.

172
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,340
No.

173
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,340
Uh, let's see.

174
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:19,540
Does he have some sort of like chemicals or something like if he's going to be drunk and

175
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:22,860
pass out, I could just like suffocate him or something.

176
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:23,860
Yeah, absolutely.

177
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:24,860
Uh, roll.

178
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:27,600
Um, what did, what is your search?

179
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,220
You're not like under duress, I guess.

180
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:33,740
I mean, you'd be, you'd be stressed out, but with a 40 you can for sure find it.

181
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,980
It's a 12.

182
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,300
Hell yeah.

183
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:41,940
So going through, you actually find, um, what do you want to find?

184
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,660
I want to, uh, I don't know.

185
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:44,660
Like chloroform.

186
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:45,660
Yeah.

187
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:52,440
I'm like, that's easy, but no, that's who, why would he have that now?

188
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,440
I don't know.

189
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,420
What do you mix to make mustard gas?

190
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:56,940
They did it in King of the Hill once.

191
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:57,940
I'm on a list now.

192
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:00,460
I just Googled mustard gas ingredients.

193
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:04,260
I did mustard gas mixture.

194
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:11,940
Apparently you just need garlic, onions and mustard.

195
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:12,940
Bleach and ammonia.

196
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:13,940
Okay.

197
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:14,940
Yeah.

198
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:15,940
He's definitely got those things.

199
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:16,940
Cool.

200
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:17,940
Yeah.

201
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:18,940
I do that.

202
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:19,940
Um, and I get like a towel.

203
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:20,940
Towel.

204
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:21,940
Yeah.

205
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:22,940
And I'm going to get the bleach and ammonia.

206
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:26,420
I'm not going to mix it together until he's there because I don't want to kill myself

207
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:29,700
because I'm pretty sure it's like pretty easy to do.

208
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:30,700
Okie doke.

209
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:34,220
And I take those upstairs to his room and hide in the closet.

210
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,220
All right.

211
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:43,340
So when you walk into Ferguson's room, uh, the lights are off, but there are candles

212
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,340
lit.

213
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:52,020
Uh, one candle on either side of the bed and by the candle light, you can see a woman in

214
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:58,500
bed wear laying on top of the sheets, but you know that this woman is not Stacy.

215
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:03,900
And this is an older woman, probably at least a generation older than you and Fergie.

216
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:13,700
And when she sees you, uh, uh, you're not, you're, you're not, uh, you're not, you're

217
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,700
not Fergie.

218
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,700
Who are you?

219
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,700
What?

220
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:17,700
I am.

221
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,700
I'm not.

222
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,700
I'm contention PD.

223
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:20,940
Oh, okay.

224
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:21,940
Is everything okay?

225
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:22,940
Is Ferguson okay?

226
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:28,860
Well, I got a call that some, something mysterious was happening in his house.

227
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:31,340
Somebody broke in or something.

228
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,340
What are you doing here?

229
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,780
Did you break into the house?

230
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:36,100
No, no, I'm here to meet Ferguson.

231
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,980
I'm you're not his wife.

232
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:40,900
No, I'm, I'm not.

233
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:41,900
Who are you?

234
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:42,900
I'm Joan.

235
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:43,900
Joan.

236
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:44,900
What?

237
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:45,900
Joan Robin.

238
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:46,900
Are you his mistress?

239
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:53,000
Uh, no, it's more of a, I was told I'm okay.

240
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:03,780
My boy Bruce is partners with Ferguson and he told me, this is embarrassing, but he told

241
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:08,700
me he would pay me a million dollars to wait for him and sleep with him.

242
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:13,180
That way he could, you know, he could rib his business partner about sleeping with his

243
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:17,220
mother and a million dollars is a million dollars, right?

244
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,980
I completely understand.

245
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,380
It's a good round number.

246
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:22,100
It can be used for many purposes.

247
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,940
I think you've got two options here.

248
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:24,940
The best option.

249
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:27,540
I think it's best that you leave right now.

250
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,900
What's the second option?

251
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:34,700
I give you my gun and when Ferguson walks in the door, you shoot him.

252
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:35,700
Wait, what?

253
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,700
You heard me.

254
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,700
Why?

255
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:41,500
You won't get a million dollars, but I can promise you a little money if you'll do it.

256
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,540
I can't tell you all the details.

257
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:46,780
The less, you know, the better, but go ahead and roll persuade.

258
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:48,220
What's your persuade skill?

259
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,220
70.

260
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:55,140
Oh, you did it's a 24.

261
00:13:55,140 --> 00:14:02,720
She looks at you and she says, Hmm, you know, no one knows that I was going to be here tonight.

262
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:10,020
And if Ferguson is out of the picture, my son would take complete control of the company.

263
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:12,740
It sounds like it would benefit you quite a bit.

264
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:15,500
How much extra are we talking on top here?

265
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,500
500?

266
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,420
Yeah, I'll give you half a mil.

267
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,820
Do you have a gun?

268
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,420
I do.

269
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:24,740
Is it your like police officers thought pistol?

270
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:27,900
It is, but uh, it's your service pistol.

271
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:28,900
Shit.

272
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,980
I'm not a, I never claimed to be a great police officer.

273
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:32,980
Okay.

274
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:33,980
You know what?

275
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:39,100
I'm going to go ahead and roll, roll law for me real quick and we'll see if you were smart

276
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:42,060
enough to bring a different gun.

277
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,060
I wasn't.

278
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:44,060
Okay.

279
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,060
Yeah.

280
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,540
You've got your service pistol.

281
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:50,340
Let me search the house to see if he's got a weapon again.

282
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,340
Yeah.

283
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:54,780
Your search roll from earlier, we'll have it, you know, go over and you can definitely

284
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:55,780
find it.

285
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:56,780
Okay.

286
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:57,780
So I find his like revolver.

287
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:58,780
Okay.

288
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,580
You give it to her.

289
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:01,580
Here's the deal.

290
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:05,900
I'm going to wait in the closet so that you don't get any funny ideas and I've got my

291
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,340
service pistol on me.

292
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:12,860
I trust you to do this, but I'll be here just, you know, in case anything bad happens more

293
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,660
for your safety than anything.

294
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:17,460
And then I opened the closet, give her a wink.

295
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:23,340
As you're about to walk into the closet, as you give her a wink, you both hear a car pull

296
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,720
up to the house.

297
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:32,280
And if you go to the window and look, you would see a white 15 passenger van with the

298
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:38,740
words Jesus Christ ministries in all caps painted on the side.

299
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:46,100
It pulls in to this beautiful, pristine circle drive in front of the house and the van is

300
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:52,560
pulling a white trailer that also says Jesus Christ ministries in all caps, a big trailer

301
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,420
on the back of the van.

302
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:57,460
This beautiful man gets out of the passenger side of the van.

303
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:01,500
He has perfect hair, perfect teeth, perfect jawline.

304
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:06,220
He's wearing the fuck out of a bright white suit with a red Rose pinned perfectly to his

305
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,220
lapel.

306
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:10,380
It is your brother Ferguson beans.

307
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:18,720
He clicks a button on his keys and as he walks toward his home, the ground around the van

308
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:25,740
and trailer begins to move and shift and the entire vehicular ensemble is transported below

309
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:32,760
ground on some crazy futuristic elevators of sorts as the driveway closes back up with

310
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:36,740
no evidence the van or trailer ever sat there.

311
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,260
That's pretty cool.

312
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:41,340
Thank you.

313
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:44,500
And then you, uh, go back in the room and hop in the closet.

314
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,500
I hop in the closet.

315
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,380
I tell her, you know what to do?

316
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,540
Just however you see fit.

317
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,980
I don't know if you want to do it just as soon as he walks in or if you want to let

318
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:55,940
him get in the room, but just do it and you know, we'll figure it out.

319
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:58,700
Uh, I'll help you out once the deed is done.

320
00:16:58,700 --> 00:16:59,700
Okay.

321
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:07,500
I also want to bring the ammonia and bleach into the closet.

322
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:14,180
Keith, you are standing in the closet, holding these things, looking around.

323
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:22,700
It's pitch black and you hear the door open and shut and then you hear your brother holler

324
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:23,700
upstairs.

325
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:26,860
Joan, is the power out?

326
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:31,020
You hear a very scared Joan Robin calling back.

327
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,500
Uh, yes, I don't know what it was.

328
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,020
Must've been the storm.

329
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,020
Sure.

330
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,020
Why not?

331
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:41,740
Let's set the mood, right?

332
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:42,740
You can hear it.

333
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:43,740
It's pouring.

334
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:44,740
Yeah.

335
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:45,740
Oh, I don't know.

336
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:49,220
And you're in, in your, your, your, your feet are wet or whatever.

337
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,220
I guess.

338
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,220
I don't know.

339
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,860
Your feet are wet from the wet grass.

340
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:53,860
Spooky.

341
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:54,860
Yeah.

342
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:55,860
That's so scary.

343
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,540
This is a horror podcast.

344
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:58,540
Remember?

345
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:04,780
Uh, your feet are way ASMR podcast.

346
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:15,860
And, um, as Keith walk, as, uh, okay, so, uh, Ferguson walks, you can hear him coming

347
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:22,140
up the, coming up the stairs and, um, the door swings open and you hear a shot and you

348
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:27,700
hear a scream and you hear another shot and you hear a different scream and you hear another

349
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:32,060
shot and another shot and another shot.

350
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:34,060
And then you just hear crying.

351
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,700
Is it a female crying?

352
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:40,420
It sounds like Joan crying.

353
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:41,420
I opened the door.

354
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:47,700
When you opened the door, she immediately, uh, swings the pistol in your direction and

355
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:53,180
then like, uh, puts it on, drops it on the ground and is just frantic and she's freaking

356
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:59,700
out and you see your older brother in this beautiful white suit, Rose on his lapel looking

357
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,880
fresh as hell.

358
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:08,020
But the Rose is not the only red part of his outfit now as he is just completely riddled

359
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:13,100
with holes from his own gun.

360
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:22,700
She runs to you and she wraps her arms around you and she's like, I didn't, I didn't think

361
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:26,700
it would, I didn't, I need you to roll a sanity check.

362
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,700
Yeah.

363
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,700
Yeah.

364
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,300
I rolled a 45 and my current sanity is 24.

365
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,300
Okay.

366
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:38,420
So for convincing a stranger to kill your brother and then seeing your older brother's

367
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:45,180
dead body, uh, on a failure, I'm going to go ahead and have you roll a D six, three.

368
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,720
All right.

369
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,720
Lose three sanity.

370
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,720
Where are you at?

371
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,720
21.

372
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,720
Bringing point is 20.

373
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,720
Oh boy.

374
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,720
Yeah.

375
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,900
So you are kind of losing it, right?

376
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:56,900
You just start crying.

377
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:01,300
I think probably, you know, you guys are just crying in each other's arms.

378
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:05,420
I cry for, you know, a couple of minutes and then I kind of snapped back to it.

379
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:11,340
I'm like, Hey, okay, just take a deep breath, lay back, lay on the bed and then I'm going

380
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:15,180
to think of how to clean all this up.

381
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:19,280
Uh, I think I saw some cleaning stuff in the, in the closet while I was in there.

382
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,500
Just give me a second and we can clean this up and we'll figure out what to do with the

383
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,500
body.

384
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,500
Okay.

385
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,500
Okay.

386
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,500
Okay.

387
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:31,220
She just kind of like sits at the end of the bed and with her head in her hands.

388
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,220
Okay.

389
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,220
I go back into the closet.

390
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:35,260
I get the bleach and ammonia.

391
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:39,580
Maybe I brought like a little cup with me or something to mix it up, pour them in there.

392
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:45,860
I'm like, put my shirt up over my face.

393
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:46,860
Great ventilation.

394
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:47,860
Yeah.

395
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:50,620
Um, and then I was probably gonna hurt my hands, but whatever.

396
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:56,180
I get the rag and I put it in the mixture and I bring it out and walk over to Joan.

397
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,180
Yeah.

398
00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:00,180
This seems like a great thing to clean blood up with.

399
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:02,100
Look at me real quick.

400
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,100
Yeah.

401
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:07,740
She's not in any a state of mind to think about anything.

402
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:13,380
So she just kind of looks up at you and I take my right hand with the mixture.

403
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:19,620
I put it up on her face, grab the back of her head, like with my arm and just hold it

404
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:20,620
there.

405
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:21,620
Uh, okay.

406
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:22,900
Let's do a strength contest.

407
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:26,660
Her strength is 45.

408
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,660
What is yours?

409
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:28,660
55.

410
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:29,660
All right.

411
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:36,660
So whoever goes highest without going over shitting ass, shitting ass, whatever that

412
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:37,660
means.

413
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:38,660
Well, I know what it means.

414
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:39,660
It means a ass that poops.

415
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:40,660
Yeah.

416
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:41,660
Not a good one.

417
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:42,660
It's a, but the poops.

418
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:43,660
Yeah.

419
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:46,900
So I missed, you missed as this is happening.

420
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:53,580
She fights you and she can get her hand in between her mouth and nose and the towel that

421
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,580
you're using.

422
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,440
And she starts yelling.

423
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:04,460
She's like, why, why I did what you asked to go ahead and roll again.

424
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:05,460
What'd you get?

425
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,460
21.

426
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,460
I got 24.

427
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,460
Oh yeah.

428
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,460
Attaboy.

429
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:10,460
Describe what happens.

430
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:13,660
Why did we just cheer you killing an innocent woman?

431
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:14,660
Well I guess not.

432
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:15,660
She's a murderer.

433
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:16,660
Well, are you?

434
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:20,900
I don't know at this point anymore.

435
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:21,900
Okay.

436
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,860
So I ripped the towel off her face.

437
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:26,580
I'm like, Oh my God, I'm sorry.

438
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:31,900
I just, I saw you kill my, or I saw my dead brother and I just started to freak out.

439
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:37,700
And then she puts her hand down and looks at me and I put it on her face and I hold

440
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:44,860
her down, like get on like on top of her on the bed and I hold it over her face until

441
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,620
she stops fighting back.

442
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:55,980
She's just screaming and squirming, but you hold down until she goes limp, roll sanity.

443
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:56,980
I do not pass.

444
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:57,980
Yeah.

445
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:02,420
So you just killed a woman covering up the murder that you made her do.

446
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,420
Right.

447
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:05,140
But also I do want to do one last thing.

448
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:06,220
Can I do that?

449
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:10,740
I want to, you know, she's on the bed, passed out or whatever.

450
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:15,100
I want to take like my, I think I have like a handkerchief or something.

451
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:20,060
I want to take the gun, put it in her hand and put it up to her head and shoot so that

452
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,500
it looks like she killed herself.

453
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,500
Okay.

454
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:29,620
I'm going to say that you're just in this weird state of like shock and determination

455
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:35,460
while you carry out this ice fucking cold task.

456
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:44,020
And she took his gun, shot him five times and then turned the gun on herself.

457
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:46,300
And that's what you've made it look like.

458
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,780
Yeah.

459
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:49,900
I need you to roll.

460
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:54,780
Let's just go D4 honestly, cause it's not as bad as, uh, you know, there's no tie there

461
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:55,780
I guess.

462
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:56,780
That's a three again.

463
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:57,780
All right.

464
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:58,980
Lose three sanity down to 18.

465
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:01,300
That is past my breaking point as well.

466
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,300
All right.

467
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,300
And what's your power?

468
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,300
10.

469
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,300
Okay.

470
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,140
I'm doing crazy.

471
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,140
Yes you are.

472
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:09,140
For good reason.

473
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,140
I'd say.

474
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,140
Yeah.

475
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,140
But it was all for the money.

476
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,140
I did it all for the money.

477
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,740
All for the nookie.

478
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:17,740
So as you complete this task, you're freaking out.

479
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:20,780
You've just lost six sanity within five minutes.

480
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:25,060
So you're losing your goddamn mind.

481
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:32,980
However, as you're walking away, you see that Ferguson is wearing that watch that you remember

482
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:39,380
from so long ago, your father giving him, I take my hanky and I take that watch off

483
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,380
of him.

484
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,380
Where do you put it?

485
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,820
On is probably not a good answer in my pocket.

486
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,840
So I wrap it up in the handkerchief, put it in my pocket.

487
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:51,300
When you take the watch off of Ferguson with this handkerchief, you see that the face of

488
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,880
the watch is blank.

489
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,040
There's nothing on it, which is odd for a watch.

490
00:24:56,040 --> 00:25:01,380
And when you slip it into your pocket, it feels like your consciousness is changing

491
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:06,940
the channel and you begin to phase out of your reality and you seem to be somewhere

492
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,420
else entirely.

493
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:14,780
You feel wet grass and dirt on your fingers and you were looking at a door in the ground

494
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:21,960
like a sealed metal door that was mostly buried was.

495
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:25,460
And on the door is an inscription, three lines.

496
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:39,120
It says, here lies the beans, scientists beyond measure, saviors of the world.

497
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,120
Where do you want to end up?

498
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,120
What do you mean?

499
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,620
Like where would you go after all of this?

500
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:48,700
I do want to do like a quick, obviously I want to put like the chemicals and shit back

501
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:51,260
where I found them, wipe them down.

502
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:56,220
Anything that I touched, I want to wipe down so that I can't be associated back to being

503
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:57,220
here.

504
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,220
Sure.

505
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:59,220
I'm going to leave the bodies and shit where they are.

506
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:02,020
Cause you know, I guess I'll just walk back to that tunnel.

507
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,020
Okay.

508
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:06,220
Do I have her phone number or should I, I don't really know where I am.

509
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:12,100
So I guess go back to that tunnel and then find my way back to, um, I guess my hotel

510
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,100
motel.

511
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,100
Hotel motel.

512
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,100
Okay.

513
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:21,700
Basically what we see as the audience is once you put that watch in your pocket, you're

514
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:28,720
basically somewhere else in your eyes as you begin cleaning up, making sure that the scene

515
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:33,980
of the crime looks exactly how it should and that your fingerprints are gone and that any

516
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:37,620
idea that there was a third person there is gone.

517
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:41,420
And we see you get into the tunnel and walking through the tunnel and your eyes are still

518
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:47,580
just, you know, kind of glazed over as you, um, not only have lost so much sanity from

519
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:53,960
doing and seeing what you just did and saw, but also it's almost like you are seeing that

520
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:58,820
feeling of being at this place with this door that's buried in the ground.

521
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:04,280
The whole time you're doing that stuff, you're just like halfway there, halfway here, and

522
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:10,040
then cut to you laying in bed at hotel motel, but you still have that watch in your pocket

523
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,040
in the handkerchief.

524
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,240
Do I have like a safe in this hotel motel?

525
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,240
Yeah.

526
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,640
Still wrapped in the handkerchief, stick that in the safe.

527
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,640
And as the safe door closes...

528
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,240
Do I have the same look in my eyes?

529
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,240
No.

530
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,240
You're back.

531
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,240
I'm back.

532
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:39,280
John, you just successfully made 5 million dollars by selling cocaine to a random, handsome

533
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:46,420
stranger named the Duke, paid him a grand to tell you Marvin Glass buys from him in

534
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:53,000
bulk, and paid 8 of your cousins 10 grand and a 24 pack of keystone light, to which

535
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,880
they each took a petty more sky shot and headed off into the night.

536
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:05,160
Drew walks up and says, John, I want to, I want to thank you, and kind of sits you down.

537
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:13,200
He grabs his, uh, his briefcase and he says, I thank you for making all of this money with

538
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,200
me.

539
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,200
This is amazing.

540
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:19,320
I thank you for showing me how to shoot a gun.

541
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:22,580
Yeah, actually about that, that's what I wanted to bring up.

542
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:27,080
And I point my gun at him and I'm like, can you give me that gun back now?

543
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,080
Yeah.

544
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,280
Let's pass it over real slow.

545
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:34,280
He passes it over and he's like, oh, that's okay.

546
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,280
Sorry, man.

547
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:39,000
Uh, I'm a man of means now and I can't afford to take any kind of risks.

548
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
No, that's fine.

549
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
That's fine.

550
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Mostly you are too, dude.

551
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,480
You know, that's how you got to start looking at the world with suspicion and hate and,

552
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,600
and fear for people who aren't as good as you because they're not as rich.

553
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,800
Oh, that's what the rich man gets to do.

554
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,480
Oh, well then can I have that gun back?

555
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:59,040
No, buddy, you gotta have a gun to make that one work.

556
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,040
Okay.

557
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,040
All right.

558
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,760
Well, mostly I wanted to thank you for your friendship.

559
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,760
You too, man.

560
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,760
You know what, Drew?

561
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,880
I think you are my best friend on the force.

562
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,880
Yeah.

563
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,680
Case an idiot and Clark's real uptight.

564
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,680
Yeah.

565
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,680
Well, you're my best friend in life.

566
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,680
So.

567
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,680
Yeah.

568
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,680
Hey, hey.

569
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,680
Cool, man.

570
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,680
But, uh, I am gonna leave.

571
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,680
That's cool.

572
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,680
Yeah.

573
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,680
Get the fuck out of here, man.

574
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,680
And I think I'm gonna bail.

575
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,680
I think I'm out.

576
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,680
You're out?

577
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,680
Yeah.

578
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:30,520
I think I'm gonna get a little, uh, a little spot, you know, and, and maybe north, I don't

579
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,520
know, maybe south.

580
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,520
All right.

581
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:39,400
But Drew, I mean, we're out when it's over, but you're the fucking glue that keeps our

582
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,880
sticky paper together.

583
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,420
And our sticky paper is the, the, the fucking Contention PD.

584
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:48,140
You're the goddamn peanut butter to our jelly, man.

585
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:54,320
And I'm the jelly in Clark and, uh, Clark, Clark and Keith are the pieces of bread.

586
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,440
Like, we need you, Drew.

587
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,440
Contention needs you.

588
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,680
We gotta save this fucking town, man.

589
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:04,720
And then we can go to Florida or wherever else people go.

590
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,760
Mexico, I guess.

591
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:11,760
Well, maybe you're right.

592
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,860
I'll see you around, John.

593
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:22,640
And he, uh, takes his briefcase and he gets into his car, heads down the long, long driveway

594
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,520
that you have out to your county road.

595
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,560
What do you want to do?

596
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,560
You're alone at home.

597
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:30,200
Is there anything you want to take care of before you call tonight?

598
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,080
Yeah, what's my willpower at?

599
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,080
How tired am I?

600
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,080
I did a bump, right?

601
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,280
I think so, yeah.

602
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,720
Your willpower should be at 12.

603
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,720
Okay.

604
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,920
I want to kill Keith Vigna.

605
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:44,840
All right, let's do this.

606
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:45,840
What do you do?

607
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,840
How do you prep?

608
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:51,760
No, honestly, I think like what I would do is just like call Keith and leave some real

609
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:56,000
drunk angry voicemails as I just pounded fucking keystones.

610
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,080
Do you want to leave a voicemail for Keith Vigna?

611
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,640
Yeah, I do.

612
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:00,960
Is it ringing?

613
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,960
Yeah.

614
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:02,960
Is it ringing?

615
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,960
Yeah.

616
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:04,960
What's his voicemail sound like?

617
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,960
Okay.

618
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:06,960
Yeah.

619
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:07,960
Bring, bring, bring, bring.

620
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:16,520
Hey, I'm a fucking idiot.

621
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,440
Leave your number at the beep.

622
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,440
Beep.

623
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:23,000
Keith, it's John Lee Pettymore.

624
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,560
I got $5 million now, motherfucker, and I'm going to kick your ass.

625
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,800
Stupid piece of shit.

626
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,800
Messing with my smoky DVDs, you goddamn bandit.

627
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,080
I'm the richest man in the world.

628
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:40,560
I'm going to stick a boot up your ass and then I'm going to fucking marry the turd that

629
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,640
comes out of that ass.

630
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,640
Let's delete all this.

631
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:46,400
No, I think that is gold.

632
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:52,320
I'm going to keep yelling about $5 million and then something about a turd coming out

633
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,320
of his ass.

634
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:58,760
So I'm pretty, I'm pretty tired from the events of this evening.

635
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:01,960
So I slam three more celebratory Keystone lights.

636
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:06,480
I do another line just to get me, you know, put a little pep in my step while I brush

637
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,680
my teeth and stuff.

638
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:15,760
And I send Keith Vigna a text message that just says, I know, love it.

639
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:19,840
I kind of spent some time, as I'm a wealthy man now, I have a fortune to protect.

640
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:25,000
So I am a little bit nervous about all these, these monsters and ghouls and entities that

641
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,720
have descended upon my town.

642
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:31,160
Got a lot more stake in this place now.

643
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,160
I don't like it.

644
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:36,000
Now you got to protect your town now.

645
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
You could own this town.

646
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:44,240
Who knew that with such fabulous wealth would come such immense responsibility.

647
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:49,680
Now that was not the idea of wealth as it was advertised to me, John Lee Pettymore.

648
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:54,600
A rich man has no troubles friend.

649
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:59,240
Certainly not supposed to be beset by goddamn supernatural horrors.

650
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,240
Caught at night?

651
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,240
Yeah.

652
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:08,040
John's gonna sweep up his smokey DVDs and put one in director's cut, fall asleep, smoking

653
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:14,960
a joint on his couch, dreaming of his millions, but also of terrible monsters.

654
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:21,160
So John is asleep on the couch with the butt of a joint in his mouth, lit in this cluttered

655
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:25,680
mess of a living room by the DVD menu screen of Smokey and the Bandit.

656
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:31,460
The night sky is beginning to turn bright, but the sun has yet to peak over the horizon.

657
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:36,160
It is early on this cold December morning and the air smells crispy.

658
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:41,640
A thin layer of fog hangs just above the dewy grass on John Lee Pettymore's property.

659
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:46,040
John, you wake up abruptly to the sound of two gunshots.

660
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,040
What do you do?

661
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,580
I scramble for my pistol.

662
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:51,200
You scramble it for your pistol, find it.

663
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,480
And I get, you know, behind some cover, but I peek out a window.

664
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,420
I try to look for where the shots are coming from.

665
00:33:56,420 --> 00:34:02,320
When you peek out of a window, you can see that outside of your house is a woman holding

666
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:06,320
hostage, the Pettymore cousins and Drew Andrews.

667
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:10,000
She is wearing jeans with a white shirt and a leather jacket.

668
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:15,580
She is gaunt with crazy hair and enormous thick glasses that make her already large

669
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:17,740
eyes look even bigger.

670
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:24,300
Six Pettymore boys and Drew are on their knees with their hands behind their backs.

671
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:29,320
Their mouths are duct taped and most are bleeding from some part of their body.

672
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:34,040
This is even more apparent as all seven of them have been stripped of their shirts.

673
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:40,920
The other two Pettymore cousins are also bound and shirtless, but they are face down about

674
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:45,720
twenty feet away from the group, and each has a puddle of blood growing from where their

675
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,240
heads landed.

676
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:51,240
This woman has a pistol nuzzled into the back of Drew's head.

677
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:59,640
Officer Pettymore, your presence is requested please.

678
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:03,760
So John Lee Pettymore IV nearly shits himself.

679
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:12,880
But he mutters, mo money mo problems, and then he scrambles to the door and he cracks

680
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,880
it open.

681
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,400
I know her, right?

682
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:19,400
You recognize her immediately as the woman you had the interaction with in the hotel

683
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,400
motel.

684
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,600
So I crack open the door and I shout, I'm here, what do you want?

685
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:29,620
Drop your gun, or I'll send your friend's brains through his toothy mouth.

686
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:34,540
It's drop, I drop my, I set it outside where she can see.

687
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:35,540
It's drop.

688
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:36,860
Come on out with your hands up.

689
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:37,860
I come out.

690
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:41,100
Alright, here's the deal John.

691
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,500
You know who I work for.

692
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,500
Yeah.

693
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:44,900
Do you know what he wants?

694
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,860
He wants the gun John.

695
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:47,860
Oh.

696
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:50,340
He wants the gun?

697
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:51,340
Not your gun.

698
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:52,340
No, I know.

699
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:54,240
He wants the other gun.

700
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,860
You killed two Pettymores.

701
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:57,980
Well they tried to run away from me.

702
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:00,100
I don't like it when people run away.

703
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:04,820
Well that was foolish of them considering the circumstances.

704
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:11,860
I still probably hate you forever, but I see what you done and why you did it.

705
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:18,660
Listen, your boss can have that gun when this is all said and done, but I don't particularly

706
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:21,740
think that's what he needs.

707
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:23,980
Now he wants to get his boys back, right?

708
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,540
Well yeah, I mean.

709
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:29,060
Or in another way of speaking, he wants to get his boys back, right?

710
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:30,060
Yeah.

711
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:31,060
Yeah.

712
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:35,060
Well I want to get my town back right, and I think maybe we can help each other in that

713
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:36,060
regard.

714
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:41,460
I think we kind of want the same thing, so what do you need?

715
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:45,380
You can have that gun, but I don't think that's really...

716
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:46,380
Let's talk about...

717
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:49,500
You can have that gun, but I think you might find some...

718
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,500
What do you need?

719
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:54,820
John, I am middle management at best.

720
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:57,620
I was sent here to collect the gun.

721
00:36:57,620 --> 00:37:03,300
If you don't have it, then I'm supposed to bring something back as collateral, you know,

722
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,060
until you bring it.

723
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:06,060
So uh...

724
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,060
Alright.

725
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,060
Hey, wait.

726
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,060
I don't have the gun.

727
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,420
I mean it's down at the station.

728
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:12,820
But why don't you bring me as collateral?

729
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:13,820
What?

730
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:14,820
Bring me to your boss.

731
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:16,580
I'd like to talk to him.

732
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:17,580
Uh, wait.

733
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:19,340
The gun is just at the station?

734
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,340
No.

735
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:22,540
That's what you just said.

736
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:26,340
Yeah, to trick your dumb ass.

737
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:34,820
I don't typically roll, but I'm going to go ahead and roll real quick.

738
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:38,260
This is all my own doing.

739
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:40,140
Yeah, okay.

740
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:46,300
You're not going to tell me what the result of that roll is?

741
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:50,700
We're going to need that gun then, if you have it.

742
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:51,700
That's all we want.

743
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:52,700
We don't need you.

744
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:53,700
We just want the gun.

745
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:54,700
He wants the gun.

746
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:55,700
I'm going to bring him the gun.

747
00:37:55,700 --> 00:38:03,000
If not, I'll go ahead and, you know, if you can bring the gun, then that would be great.

748
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,100
If you could go get it now, that'd be better.

749
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:07,380
For me personally, I don't like being here.

750
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:09,340
I'd rather go back to the city.

751
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:10,340
So...

752
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:11,340
Alright, alright.

753
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:13,980
Can I deliver the gun to him?

754
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:14,980
Or I...

755
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:15,980
Yes.

756
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:16,980
Can I come with you?

757
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:17,980
Sure.

758
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:18,980
Alright.

759
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:20,980
That's what I want to do.

760
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:23,620
Jesus Christ, was it so hard?

761
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:25,100
Let's go get the gun.

762
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:27,820
Lady, you killed two of my cousins.

763
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:30,820
Well, they tried to run away from me when I had a gun.

764
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:36,060
Like I said, I understand, but I'm still pissed at you.

765
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:37,860
Were they your favorite cousins?

766
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:39,060
I mean, how many do you have?

767
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:40,380
Yes, Edward was.

768
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:44,260
Well, my third favorite, anyway.

769
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:47,980
Did the other Patty Moore's kind of look up and they're like, what?

770
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:55,060
And I wink at Jonathan like, you know me, you're my number one.

771
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:57,580
He smiles through tears.

772
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:03,020
Edward was his brother.

773
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:04,500
Sad day for the Patty Moore's.

774
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,500
We're all like brothers, so it's fun.

775
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,100
So let's go to the station.

776
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,260
Yeah, we'll get the gun.

777
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,260
Right now.

778
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:12,580
If you can introduce me to your boss, I'll get you that gun.

779
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:14,060
Alright, let's go to the station.

780
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,060
Alright.

781
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:20,460
I think how this is going to work is she's not going to want to ever leave herself vulnerable

782
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:24,100
to you because she just killed two of your cousins.

783
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:28,500
So first she's going to let the cousins all go.

784
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,940
She's going to keep a gun on Drew.

785
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:36,980
Hey, boys, there's another 24 pack and 10K in this for y'all because of what you suffered.

786
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:37,980
And I bet they could split.

787
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:44,620
Yeah, well, I figured you'd divide Edward and Aloysius's share.

788
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:45,620
Yep.

789
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:48,900
Love that that's the name you just pull out.

790
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:50,980
That's a, oh brother, we're at that reference.

791
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:52,500
It's the name he pulls out.

792
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:53,500
Perfect.

793
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:54,500
One of them.

794
00:39:54,500 --> 00:40:00,340
Well, this campaign is turning into a bit of an odyssey.

795
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:07,140
So she's going to go ahead and have you and Drew drive in Drew's Mini Cooper.

796
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:10,760
And she's going to sit in the backseat with a gun pointed at both of you as you guys go

797
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,220
down to the station.

798
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:18,460
Lady, you might get that gun, but nobody fucks with the petty moors and lives to talk

799
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:19,460
about it.

800
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:22,140
What you've done today was unforgivable.

801
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:26,260
And there are many of us living in these Hills.

802
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:27,260
We're coming for you.

803
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:32,540
Even if I fall today, the petty moors are coming for you.

804
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:33,540
Okay.

805
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:34,620
That's fine.

806
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:38,140
And she pushes you forward.

807
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:51,620
All right.

808
00:40:51,620 --> 00:41:01,020
So Clark, you are in this stone room, circular stone room with a stone table light shining

809
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:04,340
down one man sitting across from you.

810
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:07,420
He's holding this big fucker.

811
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:13,140
And then he immediately puts it down in this like container in between his legs and puts

812
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:14,780
the lid on it.

813
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:16,580
And he sits back down.

814
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:18,020
So what do you think?

815
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:19,020
Can you repeat all that?

816
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:20,020
Yeah, sure.

817
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:27,260
So when I was, when I was a young boy, no, no, Clark is probably still silent and staring

818
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:28,260
at this lug.

819
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:29,500
Who are you?

820
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,940
Oh, my name is Leon Simpson.

821
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:32,940
Where am I?

822
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:34,620
You are in the lair.

823
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:38,740
Well, layer is kind of a dark word, but it is technically a layer, I suppose, of the

824
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:43,860
circle of knowledge, which I believe I just inducted you into.

825
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:49,320
We have a first task for you as a new member of the circle of knowledge.

826
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:55,460
And he reaches into his pocket and he pulls out the small little plastic container and

827
00:41:55,460 --> 00:42:00,340
he slides it toward you, takes a gun out of his pocket.

828
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:02,180
And it's not a normal gun.

829
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:06,120
It's a tranquilizer kind of thing in the little package that he's sliding across the table

830
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,120
toward you.

831
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:11,060
It's clear on top and there are a couple needles in there.

832
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:19,940
Okay, so Clark, these are filled with a very particular toxin that will make anyone obey

833
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:22,880
your will for some time.

834
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:27,540
And what we're going to need you to do is, well, I don't know if you're aware of this,

835
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:32,300
but the government isn't too happy with the situation over there in contention.

836
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:35,540
And we're going to need you to kind of get that under control.

837
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:39,380
That way we can take back control of your town.

838
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:42,860
So I'm going to need you to go back to contention.

839
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:48,140
There should be one FBI agent who is coming in the morning to take over all of the police

840
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:50,180
work in the town of contention.

841
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:54,900
I don't see any way that they're going to keep you all on based off of literally everything

842
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:55,900
that you've done.

843
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:57,860
They're watching you.

844
00:42:57,860 --> 00:43:02,820
And that's one of the reasons that we're bringing you on is that literally no one will believe

845
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:05,060
a word you say at this point, honestly.

846
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:09,660
You have absolutely no credit to your name.

847
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:12,720
And that's going to really turn out in our favor, I think.

848
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:17,260
So what you're going to do is you're going to load those needles into that gun.

849
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:22,220
They shoot out this little microscopic needle that has this toxin in it.

850
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:29,060
And I need you to make sure that the FBI agent doesn't see anything funny going around in

851
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:30,060
contention.

852
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:33,820
Now, Clark, I'm going to ask you this one time.

853
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:34,820
We're brothers now.

854
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:39,220
I know you just met me and you just figured out my name, Leon Simpson.

855
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:43,700
Very good name, but I'm going to need you to trust me.

856
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:45,740
What's been going on in contention?

857
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:51,220
Well, Leon, a lot of stuff's been happening.

858
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:52,220
Tell me all about it.

859
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:58,780
There's been some black goo and people disappearing in flashes of light.

860
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:02,700
And I've been seeing things that aren't there sometimes.

861
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:07,460
And then there were FBI agents that came and they had a black bag and they told us that

862
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:11,620
we were going to have to put stuff in it to neutralize it or something.

863
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:18,660
And there was these photos from a camera with tubes and a radio that made a man a cat and

864
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:19,660
a cat a man.

865
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:21,300
So, I mean, some stuff's been happening.

866
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:24,500
It made a cat a man and a man a cat?

867
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:25,500
Mm-hmm.

868
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:26,500
What?

869
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:27,500
The man is a cat now?

870
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:29,060
He's a cat man?

871
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:30,060
Yeah.

872
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:31,060
Yeah.

873
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:32,060
Okay.

874
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:33,800
What is this ooze, though, that you speak of?

875
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:35,500
Do you see it everywhere or?

876
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:36,500
Leon, how come?

877
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:37,500
How come?

878
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:40,380
It seems like you know a lot about a lot of stuff, but you don't know anything about any

879
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:41,380
of this.

880
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:45,260
Clark, I know so much more than you could ever imagine.

881
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:47,080
So this is a test.

882
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:48,180
It's a bit of a test.

883
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:52,900
The black goo, there was a guy who was vacuuming it.

884
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:53,900
Okay.

885
00:44:53,900 --> 00:45:00,060
Oh, and it made some, between you and I, a couple kids disappeared in it.

886
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:01,060
Whoa.

887
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:02,380
Haven't told anybody that.

888
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:03,380
Whoa.

889
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:04,380
Yeah.

890
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:05,700
Who was this guy who was vacuuming it?

891
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:07,740
His name was James.

892
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:10,060
James, the mononym James?

893
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:11,140
Yeah, you know him.

894
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:12,220
I do.

895
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:15,820
Are you from contention, Leon?

896
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:16,940
Is he still around?

897
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:17,940
Did you talk to him?

898
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:22,060
No, James is not, he's no longer with us.

899
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:24,100
He was in a house that blew up.

900
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:27,780
Did anyone else, wait, a house that blew up?

901
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:30,060
Yeah, there was a house that blew up.

902
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:34,380
It was, our chief Maggie Cook was in, it was her house.

903
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:35,380
Okay.

904
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:37,100
There were some other people in there.

905
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:38,100
Who was in there?

906
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:40,100
It was Maggie, and it was James.

907
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:41,180
Maggie is dead?

908
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:46,940
Maggie was dead before the house blew up, and so was James, probably.

909
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:49,100
I think the house blew up because it was booby trapped.

910
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:50,100
Booby trapped?

911
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:51,100
Yeah.

912
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:56,260
One of my partners was in there, and I think he slipped or something, and he heard a click,

913
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:57,260
and then...

914
00:45:57,260 --> 00:45:58,260
Is he dead too?

915
00:45:58,260 --> 00:45:59,260
No, he got out of there.

916
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:02,060
He rescued my dispatcher also.

917
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:03,060
Dispatcher?

918
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:04,060
His name is Drew.

919
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:07,780
Drew was over there because he got a call from Harold Dorsey.

920
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:10,180
Is this Harold Dorsey still with us, or?

921
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:12,420
No, I think he's dead too.

922
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:13,420
My goodness.

923
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:14,420
Okay.

924
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:18,020
Well, that's crazy.

925
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:20,180
I mean, do you guys know who did it?

926
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:24,380
Well, when you say who did it, there's a lot of its that it could be that you're asking,

927
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:29,580
but you know, I'll tell you what, no is the answer to all of them.

928
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:30,580
Okay.

929
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:35,500
Well, that's the kind of police work that we've come to expect from you all in contention,

930
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:36,500
honestly.

931
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:40,060
Well, I mean, if you had a lost dog, oh fuck, I fucked that up too.

932
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:47,540
If you needed to cross the road at a crosswalk, we could help you with that.

933
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:48,540
Wow.

934
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:49,540
Okay.

935
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:52,220
Well, this is going to be a bit more intensive than that.

936
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:56,620
This shooting an FBI agent with the needles and then telling him what to do, but basically

937
00:46:56,620 --> 00:47:00,020
we're going to need you to keep them away from any of the strangeness, any of the goo

938
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:05,880
that you've seen or ooze or whatever you're calling it, and that would just be great.

939
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:12,800
You have 24 hours and then I need you to report back and we can make sure that you will be

940
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:13,800
okay.

941
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:17,160
24 hours for me to tranq the FBI agent and get them off the trail.

942
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:18,160
Exactly.

943
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:21,360
Is there a way I can get in contact with you before that 24 hours is up if I need to?

944
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:22,360
Yeah, absolutely.

945
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:29,400
And he slides a business card across and it says Leon Simpson and then it has his number

946
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:30,400
and that's it.

947
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:31,400
Nice.

948
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:36,680
Leon, that thing in that jar there, what is it?

949
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:38,680
Oh, it's a xenonimatode.

950
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:47,840
Currently we believe it is a vector from either another time, another place, or another reality.

951
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:55,320
We're not quite positive, however, it is the thing that Paul Simon found that has connected

952
00:47:55,320 --> 00:48:02,880
the dots of the knowledge of the overseer, which you will attain one day within our elite

953
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,880
group, however that is for another time.

954
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:12,520
Basically these creatures, they have certain abilities that we have found a way to exploit

955
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:14,480
and so we need them.

956
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:17,960
We keep them around for a very specific purpose.

957
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:20,400
Actually you know what, follow me.

958
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:26,960
And he opens up the one door in this room and it opens into another stone room.

959
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:28,680
This one much larger.

960
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:34,280
This circular room is 20 yards across and has a domed ceiling.

961
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:40,080
The walls are stone and there are a handful of torches mounted to light the room.

962
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:47,840
There are six large slabs of stone, each with a couple of people laying on them, circling

963
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:52,600
a single unoccupied stone slab in the center of the space.

964
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:59,320
Each person laying down has one of those giant fucked up worm things attached to them and

965
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:04,800
many of them seem to have dead skin covering one or multiple limbs.

966
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:10,800
And there is a woman in electric blue slacks and a bright yellow cardigan walking deliberately

967
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:17,360
around to each slab, checking on each group and checking her watch.

968
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:20,620
And her back is turned to you.

969
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:23,120
When you walk into this room you're just kind of taking it all in.

970
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:28,160
This is a legitimately horrifying sight I would imagine.

971
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:34,860
Leon kind of grabs your shoulder and looks you in the eyes and he's like, this is the

972
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:40,760
chamber of the circle of knowledge and here is where we do our most important work.

973
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:46,960
You see, these brave men and women, and he motions to the people laying on the slabs

974
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:50,280
who all look very down on their luck.

975
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:53,040
One might call them homeless looking.

976
00:49:53,040 --> 00:50:01,200
And he says, these fine individuals have dedicated their lives to the survival of humanity.

977
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,920
Have they done it willingly?

978
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:09,440
That's not necessarily the most important idea to have right now.

979
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:17,840
But yes, in many cases we have become a much, much better organization within the past couple

980
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:25,000
of years and have begun to explain to people why they're dedicating their lives before

981
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,920
we make them.

982
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:32,400
Obviously not you necessarily, but we're also not asking you to, you know, give up your

983
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,700
skin or limbs for the cause.

984
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:38,600
We want you to be one of us.

985
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:43,720
And he kind of points at him and the woman in the electric blue slacks and bright yellow

986
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:50,640
cardigan who is standing on the far side of the room with a notebook, taking notes.

987
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:55,240
Let's get you going because the timer's already started and I'd hate for the 24 hours to go

988
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:58,920
up and you know, we really like you around, we'd hate to lose you.

989
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:08,040
So as he walks you out of the room, you hear the woman say, bye Leon, and you turn back

990
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:12,080
and look and you recognize this woman.

991
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:20,720
She is cold and vacant with a big smile on her face and her hair is covering one of her

992
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:21,920
eyes.

993
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:25,440
And she says, bye Clark.

994
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:28,400
You feel a little pinch in your neck.

995
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:31,240
As I feel that pinch, I'm turning around and running toward.

996
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:42,000
You're running toward her and she begins laughing as you slowly crumble to the ground.

997
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:48,240
Clark you come to in the back of a cab, trees lined both sides of the narrow gravel road

998
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:49,840
you were bouncing down.

999
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:55,040
Looking back, you see the gravel path leads to an opening where just enough plant life

1000
00:51:55,040 --> 00:52:00,420
has been removed to open up space for a parking lot and a massive brick building with two

1001
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:07,540
enormous smokestacks reaching up into the canopy of trees encircling this property.

1002
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:17,100
There is a sign that reads, the mill on the other side of the city.

1003
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:21,780
Of course Clark, thanks.

1004
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:59,060
How am I the only one trying to pull over How can you have enough drowning out of the

1005
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:00,060
dark?

1006
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:20,740
Hello there dear listener.

1007
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:27,620
It is I, your narrative Sherpa, Wolf the dog, standing self assured on this massive mountain

1008
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:28,940
of information.

1009
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:34,260
If you're a bit hazy on all the details of the story so far, fear not.

1010
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:41,980
Go check out episode 96 for a recap of episodes 1-23 and know that you are not alone.

1011
00:53:41,980 --> 00:53:47,420
Much love, yours both truly and falsely, Wolf the dog.
