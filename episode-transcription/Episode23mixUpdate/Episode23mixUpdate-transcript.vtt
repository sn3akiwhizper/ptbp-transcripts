00:00.000 --> 00:05.680
Hello my patients, it's your doctor, Wolf the Dog, and I'm here to check the charts

00:05.680 --> 00:13.260
so I can diagnose what the fuck is plaguing Contention here on 694.2 PTBP, Contention's

00:13.260 --> 00:15.160
only radio show.

00:15.160 --> 00:18.780
Y'all I'm scrubbed up and ready to go.

00:18.780 --> 00:25.180
This week's Howlin' with Wolf comes from at bfevans19 on Twitter and Reddit who blessed

00:25.180 --> 00:32.460
us with a glowing 5 star review on Apple Podcasts, quote, and now Wolf has a special

00:32.460 --> 00:47.180
announcement for all you agents in the field out there, 42, 65, 20, 73, 75, 72, 65, 20,

00:47.180 --> 01:13.220
74, 6F, 20, 64, 72, 69, 6E, 6B, 20, 79, 6F, 75, 72, 24, F, 76, 61, 6C, 74, 69, 6E, 65,

01:13.220 --> 01:16.420
end transmission, end quote.

01:16.420 --> 01:25.180
My producer has a note here, apparently Reddit user KRUCZ36 has made a subreddit for pretending

01:25.180 --> 01:30.500
to be people located at r slash pretending to be people.

01:30.500 --> 01:35.260
The first person to decode the message and post it in the subreddit will receive the

01:35.260 --> 01:40.860
pride that comes with being the best agent in the field and also the ability to write

01:40.860 --> 01:46.340
up their own Howlin' with Wolf announcement to be read by your personal physician, Dr.

01:46.340 --> 01:47.340
Wolf.

01:47.340 --> 01:55.280
And as always, if you want to see behind the scenes of 694.2 PTBP, follow along at pretending

01:55.280 --> 01:57.900
pod on Instagram and Twitter.

01:57.900 --> 02:02.860
There's a Facebook, sure, but Zuckerberg is a fuck face.

02:02.860 --> 02:04.500
Now back to reality.

02:04.500 --> 02:06.440
Oh, there goes gravity.

02:06.440 --> 02:08.460
It's time for the news.

02:08.460 --> 02:13.940
After officers Bishop and Vigna had the most uncomfortable dinner since the last supper,

02:13.940 --> 02:16.700
some real plot heavy shit went down.

02:16.700 --> 02:20.820
Keith Vigna was approached by his niece, Francis Beans.

02:20.820 --> 02:25.980
Upon accepting her proposal, the two are driving East away from contention.

02:25.980 --> 02:33.660
John Lee Pettymore and Drew Andrews bonded over shared fortune after a smooth transaction.

02:33.660 --> 02:38.840
Clark Bishop saw an impossibility out of his window and then woke up in an unfamiliar

02:38.840 --> 02:41.860
place with an unfamiliar face.

02:41.860 --> 02:46.900
Strap on your restraints and bite down hard because this is going to be a fucking wild

02:46.900 --> 02:47.900
ride.

02:47.900 --> 03:13.340
Keith, you are in the car of your niece, Francis Beans.

03:13.340 --> 03:15.480
It is a Chrysler Sebring.

03:15.480 --> 03:21.560
She has offered you $1 million to kill her father, your brother, Ferguson Beans.

03:21.560 --> 03:27.880
She tells you she is going to take the secret way to avoid security and begins driving on

03:27.880 --> 03:33.620
a narrow path through the woods, trees missing her side mirrors by inches every couple of

03:33.620 --> 03:34.620
feet.

03:34.620 --> 03:42.520
And then she pulls up to a black iron fence seemingly out of place in these thick woods.

03:42.560 --> 03:48.120
Francis grabs a backpack from her back seat and motions for you to follow her as she opens

03:48.120 --> 03:52.360
a hatch in the ground and jumps inside disappearing from view.

03:52.360 --> 03:54.580
I follow her down the hatch.

03:54.580 --> 04:03.120
Down the hatch, you guys are in this like crazy dark underground tunnel that is lit

04:03.120 --> 04:10.760
by these red lights every like 15 feet on the walls of this tunnel.

04:10.760 --> 04:12.400
It's dank down here.

04:12.400 --> 04:15.920
It's like, did I recognize it all like on the way here?

04:15.920 --> 04:18.360
Had I ever been here before?

04:18.360 --> 04:23.560
I think you've maybe been out here once or twice for a reason.

04:23.560 --> 04:29.360
I mean, you and your brother kept in touch kind of, but not really.

04:29.360 --> 04:31.520
So had I been the secret way before?

04:31.520 --> 04:32.520
No, absolutely not.

04:32.520 --> 04:33.520
All right, cool.

04:33.520 --> 04:34.520
So anyway.

04:34.520 --> 04:40.320
So you guys are going through this underground tunnel and when you pop up, it's this, she

04:40.320 --> 04:47.080
tells you right before, she's like, um, we're about to pop up above ground and it is like

04:47.080 --> 04:53.380
this sweet spot where there's no security cameras looking and we'll be able to take

04:53.380 --> 04:56.720
an easy direct route into the house.

04:56.720 --> 04:57.720
You can do that.

04:57.720 --> 05:03.400
I am going to bail and then I will meet up with you later when it's finished.

05:03.400 --> 05:04.400
All right.

05:04.400 --> 05:05.640
Are you sure you can't come with me?

05:05.640 --> 05:10.080
Uh, yeah, I'm pretty fucking sure that it would look a little bit more suspicious if

05:10.080 --> 05:14.920
two of us were coming then maybe just one where we're trying to be stealthy, right?

05:14.920 --> 05:17.400
And avoid people seeing us.

05:17.400 --> 05:19.600
So I think this one's on you, my dude.

05:19.600 --> 05:23.000
Have you ever thought about going into the force?

05:23.000 --> 05:24.720
I think you'd be pretty good at it.

05:24.720 --> 05:25.720
Which one?

05:25.720 --> 05:28.800
The one that I'm on in the police force.

05:28.800 --> 05:30.960
You think that I would be a good police officer?

05:30.960 --> 05:37.400
I actually thinking about it now, I am going on a hit for you right now.

05:37.400 --> 05:38.400
Maybe not.

05:38.400 --> 05:40.520
So maybe I wouldn't be a great police officer.

05:40.520 --> 05:43.120
Maybe I'd be about as good of a police officer as you are, Keith.

05:43.120 --> 05:45.840
Oh, you'd be a much better police officer than me.

05:45.840 --> 05:46.840
Anyway.

05:46.840 --> 05:47.840
Um, okay.

05:47.840 --> 05:49.640
Just show me the route that I need to take.

05:49.640 --> 05:50.640
Okay.

05:50.640 --> 05:56.360
And she writes it out, kind of like shows you on her palm where the two houses are that

05:56.360 --> 06:01.960
are on the property and then, uh, which one is Ferguson's and how you need to get up into

06:01.960 --> 06:07.280
his room and like where to hide, basically like written on her hand.

06:07.280 --> 06:08.280
It's written on her hand.

06:08.280 --> 06:14.160
I put my hand up to her hand and my slightly sweaty palm is hold it on a little bit and

06:14.160 --> 06:15.160
then take it off.

06:15.160 --> 06:18.720
And now it's just on my hand, but tattoo style first.

06:18.720 --> 06:19.720
Yeah.

06:19.720 --> 06:20.720
Yeah.

06:20.720 --> 06:23.920
And she is super grossed out the entire time your hand is touching your hand.

06:23.920 --> 06:25.120
She's like, I hate this.

06:25.120 --> 06:26.120
I hate this.

06:26.120 --> 06:27.120
I'm taking a picture.

06:27.120 --> 06:32.560
This is so, why didn't you just take a picture evidence I'm a cop.

06:32.560 --> 06:33.560
I'm a cop.

06:33.560 --> 06:42.480
Uh, so you open up this hatch as she walks back the way you guys came and she cracks

06:42.480 --> 06:46.440
up in this hatch for you and looking out, you're into the world.

06:46.440 --> 06:48.600
It's this beautiful, nice little place.

06:48.600 --> 06:56.560
Uh, Ferguson beans and his wife, Stacy live in two separate houses, right on the County

06:56.560 --> 06:59.760
line between contention and the city.

06:59.760 --> 07:05.040
They both own one of the homes and they use a weird archaic marriage law.

07:05.040 --> 07:08.560
So they can both vote in both counties.

07:08.560 --> 07:14.800
Fergie often brags about this to people over at his home, his home, his home is modern

07:14.800 --> 07:20.280
with lots of sharp lines, glass walls and geometrical patterns.

07:20.280 --> 07:25.600
And Stacy's home is an old Victorian with a wraparound porch and a turret reaching into

07:25.600 --> 07:27.360
the sky from one corner.

07:27.360 --> 07:31.200
And based on the map, are they like right next to each other, right next to each other.

07:31.200 --> 07:37.080
And there's almost a line like in the grass where you can see the, like the County line

07:37.080 --> 07:43.080
that Ferguson likes to joke about what a fucking dickhead.

07:43.080 --> 07:49.040
And uh, as you can see from your hand, your backwards hand map, uh, you've got a direct

07:49.040 --> 07:55.120
route into the back of Ferguson's home, uh, where you won't be seen by security.

07:55.120 --> 07:56.120
Okay.

07:56.120 --> 08:00.120
Um, I guess I stealthily sneak the path that she told me to do.

08:00.120 --> 08:01.120
Yeah, absolutely.

08:01.120 --> 08:03.800
So you can, I mean, you're just walking, there's like nobody here.

08:03.800 --> 08:04.800
It's super dead.

08:04.800 --> 08:09.360
You can maybe see there's like one or two lights on in the other home, the Victorian

08:09.360 --> 08:10.840
home, Stacy's house.

08:10.840 --> 08:15.180
Uh, but there are no lights on inside Fergie's Fergie's home.

08:15.180 --> 08:17.960
And I'm, she told me to go into his house, his house.

08:17.960 --> 08:18.960
Yeah.

08:18.960 --> 08:19.960
They actually live in separate houses.

08:19.960 --> 08:20.960
Yeah.

08:20.960 --> 08:25.240
Cause I'll just go down the path and go into his unlit home.

08:25.240 --> 08:26.240
Okay.

08:26.240 --> 08:34.600
As you actually walk up to the door, it opens for you and immediately like, like what kind

08:34.600 --> 08:35.600
of door is it?

08:35.600 --> 08:40.700
Is it like a sliding like a, no, it's like a, it's like a normal door, but when it opens,

08:40.700 --> 08:43.840
it's like, welcome home Ferguson.

08:43.840 --> 08:46.000
This like voice comes over the top.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
I pause.

08:47.000 --> 08:50.740
Do I hear any, anything else?

08:50.740 --> 08:51.740
Nope.

08:51.740 --> 08:54.580
I go into the home, I guess.

08:54.580 --> 08:55.580
Yeah.

08:55.580 --> 08:57.860
Walking through his house, everything is automated.

08:57.860 --> 09:00.700
Like everything in this house, he's got like a smart home.

09:00.700 --> 09:04.100
So like everything is super automated.

09:04.100 --> 09:06.440
The like, everything looks super nice.

09:06.440 --> 09:07.940
Everything's really minimalistic.

09:07.940 --> 09:08.940
Okay.

09:09.180 --> 09:10.180
I realize that everything's automated.

09:10.180 --> 09:14.900
I want to go like outside and try to find the breaker or something for the house and

09:14.900 --> 09:16.860
just like turn all the, you know, power off.

09:16.860 --> 09:17.860
So yeah.

09:17.860 --> 09:18.860
Yeah.

09:18.860 --> 09:19.860
You can do that.

09:19.860 --> 09:20.860
All right.

09:20.860 --> 09:21.860
Easily.

09:21.860 --> 09:22.860
I do that.

09:22.860 --> 09:23.860
And then I go back to that door and walk in.

09:23.860 --> 09:24.860
Okay.

09:24.860 --> 09:27.020
I assume that you left it like cracked so that you could get back in.

09:27.020 --> 09:28.020
Right.

09:28.020 --> 09:29.020
Yeah.

09:29.020 --> 09:31.300
You go in and everything's off.

09:31.300 --> 09:32.300
Cool.

09:32.300 --> 09:34.100
Completely dark inside.

09:34.100 --> 09:36.820
And where did she tell me he would be?

09:36.820 --> 09:41.260
She told you that the best spot would be upstairs.

09:41.260 --> 09:46.140
Just go upstairs and get into his room and hide in the closet.

09:46.140 --> 09:51.240
And he's going to be drunk or high or both when he comes home and he'll just pass the

09:51.240 --> 09:55.660
fuck out in bed and just put a bullet in him and leave as soon as you can.

09:55.660 --> 09:56.660
Okay.

09:56.660 --> 09:58.500
I don't think I want to shoot him.

09:58.500 --> 10:01.940
I'm going to grab, stabbing him is seems pretty hard.

10:01.940 --> 10:02.940
It's really intimate.

10:02.940 --> 10:03.940
Yeah.

10:03.940 --> 10:04.940
I don't want to do that either.

10:07.340 --> 10:08.340
Maybe.

10:08.340 --> 10:09.340
Do you want to be inside Ferguson?

10:09.340 --> 10:11.340
Do I want to be inside Ferguson?

10:11.340 --> 10:12.340
Yeah.

10:12.340 --> 10:13.340
If you're going to stab him.

10:13.340 --> 10:14.340
No.

10:14.340 --> 10:15.340
Uh, let's see.

10:15.340 --> 10:19.540
Does he have some sort of like chemicals or something like if he's going to be drunk and

10:19.540 --> 10:22.860
pass out, I could just like suffocate him or something.

10:22.860 --> 10:23.860
Yeah, absolutely.

10:23.860 --> 10:24.860
Uh, roll.

10:24.860 --> 10:27.600
Um, what did, what is your search?

10:27.600 --> 10:29.220
You're not like under duress, I guess.

10:29.220 --> 10:33.740
I mean, you'd be, you'd be stressed out, but with a 40 you can for sure find it.

10:33.740 --> 10:35.980
It's a 12.

10:35.980 --> 10:37.300
Hell yeah.

10:37.300 --> 10:41.940
So going through, you actually find, um, what do you want to find?

10:41.940 --> 10:43.660
I want to, uh, I don't know.

10:43.660 --> 10:44.660
Like chloroform.

10:44.660 --> 10:45.660
Yeah.

10:45.660 --> 10:52.440
I'm like, that's easy, but no, that's who, why would he have that now?

10:52.440 --> 10:53.440
I don't know.

10:53.440 --> 10:55.420
What do you mix to make mustard gas?

10:55.420 --> 10:56.940
They did it in King of the Hill once.

10:56.940 --> 10:57.940
I'm on a list now.

10:57.940 --> 11:00.460
I just Googled mustard gas ingredients.

11:00.460 --> 11:04.260
I did mustard gas mixture.

11:04.540 --> 11:11.940
Apparently you just need garlic, onions and mustard.

11:11.940 --> 11:12.940
Bleach and ammonia.

11:12.940 --> 11:13.940
Okay.

11:13.940 --> 11:14.940
Yeah.

11:14.940 --> 11:15.940
He's definitely got those things.

11:15.940 --> 11:16.940
Cool.

11:16.940 --> 11:17.940
Yeah.

11:17.940 --> 11:18.940
I do that.

11:18.940 --> 11:19.940
Um, and I get like a towel.

11:19.940 --> 11:20.940
Towel.

11:20.940 --> 11:21.940
Yeah.

11:21.940 --> 11:22.940
And I'm going to get the bleach and ammonia.

11:22.940 --> 11:26.420
I'm not going to mix it together until he's there because I don't want to kill myself

11:26.420 --> 11:29.700
because I'm pretty sure it's like pretty easy to do.

11:29.700 --> 11:30.700
Okie doke.

11:30.700 --> 11:34.220
And I take those upstairs to his room and hide in the closet.

11:34.220 --> 11:35.220
All right.

11:35.220 --> 11:43.340
So when you walk into Ferguson's room, uh, the lights are off, but there are candles

11:43.340 --> 11:44.340
lit.

11:44.340 --> 11:52.020
Uh, one candle on either side of the bed and by the candle light, you can see a woman in

11:52.020 --> 11:58.500
bed wear laying on top of the sheets, but you know that this woman is not Stacy.

11:58.500 --> 12:03.900
And this is an older woman, probably at least a generation older than you and Fergie.

12:03.900 --> 12:13.700
And when she sees you, uh, uh, you're not, you're, you're not, uh, you're not, you're

12:13.700 --> 12:14.700
not Fergie.

12:14.700 --> 12:15.700
Who are you?

12:15.700 --> 12:16.700
What?

12:16.700 --> 12:17.700
I am.

12:17.700 --> 12:18.700
I'm not.

12:18.700 --> 12:19.700
I'm contention PD.

12:19.700 --> 12:20.940
Oh, okay.

12:20.940 --> 12:21.940
Is everything okay?

12:21.940 --> 12:22.940
Is Ferguson okay?

12:22.940 --> 12:28.860
Well, I got a call that some, something mysterious was happening in his house.

12:28.860 --> 12:31.340
Somebody broke in or something.

12:31.340 --> 12:32.340
What are you doing here?

12:32.340 --> 12:33.780
Did you break into the house?

12:33.780 --> 12:36.100
No, no, I'm here to meet Ferguson.

12:36.100 --> 12:37.980
I'm you're not his wife.

12:37.980 --> 12:40.900
No, I'm, I'm not.

12:40.900 --> 12:41.900
Who are you?

12:41.900 --> 12:42.900
I'm Joan.

12:42.900 --> 12:43.900
Joan.

12:43.900 --> 12:44.900
What?

12:44.900 --> 12:45.900
Joan Robin.

12:45.900 --> 12:46.900
Are you his mistress?

12:46.900 --> 12:53.000
Uh, no, it's more of a, I was told I'm okay.

12:53.000 --> 13:03.780
My boy Bruce is partners with Ferguson and he told me, this is embarrassing, but he told

13:03.780 --> 13:08.700
me he would pay me a million dollars to wait for him and sleep with him.

13:08.700 --> 13:13.180
That way he could, you know, he could rib his business partner about sleeping with his

13:13.180 --> 13:17.220
mother and a million dollars is a million dollars, right?

13:17.220 --> 13:18.980
I completely understand.

13:18.980 --> 13:20.380
It's a good round number.

13:20.380 --> 13:22.100
It can be used for many purposes.

13:22.100 --> 13:23.940
I think you've got two options here.

13:23.940 --> 13:24.940
The best option.

13:24.940 --> 13:27.540
I think it's best that you leave right now.

13:27.540 --> 13:28.900
What's the second option?

13:28.900 --> 13:34.700
I give you my gun and when Ferguson walks in the door, you shoot him.

13:34.700 --> 13:35.700
Wait, what?

13:35.700 --> 13:36.700
You heard me.

13:36.700 --> 13:37.700
Why?

13:37.700 --> 13:41.500
You won't get a million dollars, but I can promise you a little money if you'll do it.

13:41.500 --> 13:43.540
I can't tell you all the details.

13:43.540 --> 13:46.780
The less, you know, the better, but go ahead and roll persuade.

13:46.780 --> 13:48.220
What's your persuade skill?

13:48.220 --> 13:49.220
70.

13:49.220 --> 13:55.140
Oh, you did it's a 24.

13:55.140 --> 14:02.720
She looks at you and she says, Hmm, you know, no one knows that I was going to be here tonight.

14:02.720 --> 14:10.020
And if Ferguson is out of the picture, my son would take complete control of the company.

14:10.020 --> 14:12.740
It sounds like it would benefit you quite a bit.

14:12.740 --> 14:15.500
How much extra are we talking on top here?

14:15.500 --> 14:16.500
500?

14:16.500 --> 14:18.420
Yeah, I'll give you half a mil.

14:18.420 --> 14:19.820
Do you have a gun?

14:19.820 --> 14:21.420
I do.

14:21.420 --> 14:24.740
Is it your like police officers thought pistol?

14:24.740 --> 14:27.900
It is, but uh, it's your service pistol.

14:27.900 --> 14:28.900
Shit.

14:28.900 --> 14:31.980
I'm not a, I never claimed to be a great police officer.

14:31.980 --> 14:32.980
Okay.

14:32.980 --> 14:33.980
You know what?

14:33.980 --> 14:39.100
I'm going to go ahead and roll, roll law for me real quick and we'll see if you were smart

14:39.100 --> 14:42.060
enough to bring a different gun.

14:42.060 --> 14:43.060
I wasn't.

14:43.060 --> 14:44.060
Okay.

14:44.060 --> 14:45.060
Yeah.

14:45.060 --> 14:46.540
You've got your service pistol.

14:46.540 --> 14:50.340
Let me search the house to see if he's got a weapon again.

14:50.340 --> 14:51.340
Yeah.

14:51.340 --> 14:54.780
Your search roll from earlier, we'll have it, you know, go over and you can definitely

14:54.780 --> 14:55.780
find it.

14:55.780 --> 14:56.780
Okay.

14:56.780 --> 14:57.780
So I find his like revolver.

14:57.780 --> 14:58.780
Okay.

14:58.780 --> 15:00.580
You give it to her.

15:00.580 --> 15:01.580
Here's the deal.

15:01.580 --> 15:05.900
I'm going to wait in the closet so that you don't get any funny ideas and I've got my

15:05.900 --> 15:07.340
service pistol on me.

15:07.340 --> 15:12.860
I trust you to do this, but I'll be here just, you know, in case anything bad happens more

15:12.860 --> 15:14.660
for your safety than anything.

15:14.660 --> 15:17.460
And then I opened the closet, give her a wink.

15:17.460 --> 15:23.340
As you're about to walk into the closet, as you give her a wink, you both hear a car pull

15:23.340 --> 15:25.720
up to the house.

15:25.720 --> 15:32.280
And if you go to the window and look, you would see a white 15 passenger van with the

15:32.280 --> 15:38.740
words Jesus Christ ministries in all caps painted on the side.

15:38.740 --> 15:46.100
It pulls in to this beautiful, pristine circle drive in front of the house and the van is

15:46.100 --> 15:52.560
pulling a white trailer that also says Jesus Christ ministries in all caps, a big trailer

15:52.560 --> 15:54.420
on the back of the van.

15:54.420 --> 15:57.460
This beautiful man gets out of the passenger side of the van.

15:57.460 --> 16:01.500
He has perfect hair, perfect teeth, perfect jawline.

16:01.500 --> 16:06.220
He's wearing the fuck out of a bright white suit with a red Rose pinned perfectly to his

16:06.220 --> 16:07.220
lapel.

16:07.220 --> 16:10.380
It is your brother Ferguson beans.

16:11.020 --> 16:18.720
He clicks a button on his keys and as he walks toward his home, the ground around the van

16:18.720 --> 16:25.740
and trailer begins to move and shift and the entire vehicular ensemble is transported below

16:25.740 --> 16:32.760
ground on some crazy futuristic elevators of sorts as the driveway closes back up with

16:32.760 --> 16:36.740
no evidence the van or trailer ever sat there.

16:36.740 --> 16:38.260
That's pretty cool.

16:38.260 --> 16:41.340
Thank you.

16:41.340 --> 16:44.500
And then you, uh, go back in the room and hop in the closet.

16:44.500 --> 16:45.500
I hop in the closet.

16:45.500 --> 16:47.380
I tell her, you know what to do?

16:47.380 --> 16:48.540
Just however you see fit.

16:48.540 --> 16:51.980
I don't know if you want to do it just as soon as he walks in or if you want to let

16:51.980 --> 16:55.940
him get in the room, but just do it and you know, we'll figure it out.

16:55.940 --> 16:58.700
Uh, I'll help you out once the deed is done.

16:58.700 --> 16:59.700
Okay.

16:59.700 --> 17:07.500
I also want to bring the ammonia and bleach into the closet.

17:07.500 --> 17:14.180
Keith, you are standing in the closet, holding these things, looking around.

17:14.180 --> 17:22.700
It's pitch black and you hear the door open and shut and then you hear your brother holler

17:22.700 --> 17:23.700
upstairs.

17:23.700 --> 17:26.860
Joan, is the power out?

17:26.860 --> 17:31.020
You hear a very scared Joan Robin calling back.

17:31.020 --> 17:33.500
Uh, yes, I don't know what it was.

17:33.500 --> 17:35.020
Must've been the storm.

17:35.020 --> 17:36.020
Sure.

17:36.020 --> 17:37.020
Why not?

17:37.540 --> 17:41.740
Let's set the mood, right?

17:41.740 --> 17:42.740
You can hear it.

17:42.740 --> 17:43.740
It's pouring.

17:43.740 --> 17:44.740
Yeah.

17:44.740 --> 17:45.740
Oh, I don't know.

17:45.740 --> 17:49.220
And you're in, in your, your, your, your feet are wet or whatever.

17:49.220 --> 17:50.220
I guess.

17:50.220 --> 17:51.220
I don't know.

17:51.220 --> 17:52.860
Your feet are wet from the wet grass.

17:52.860 --> 17:53.860
Spooky.

17:53.860 --> 17:54.860
Yeah.

17:54.860 --> 17:55.860
That's so scary.

17:55.860 --> 17:57.540
This is a horror podcast.

17:57.540 --> 17:58.540
Remember?

17:58.540 --> 18:04.780
Uh, your feet are way ASMR podcast.

18:04.780 --> 18:15.860
And, um, as Keith walk, as, uh, okay, so, uh, Ferguson walks, you can hear him coming

18:15.860 --> 18:22.140
up the, coming up the stairs and, um, the door swings open and you hear a shot and you

18:22.140 --> 18:27.700
hear a scream and you hear another shot and you hear a different scream and you hear another

18:27.700 --> 18:32.060
shot and another shot and another shot.

18:32.060 --> 18:34.060
And then you just hear crying.

18:34.060 --> 18:35.700
Is it a female crying?

18:35.700 --> 18:40.420
It sounds like Joan crying.

18:40.420 --> 18:41.420
I opened the door.

18:41.420 --> 18:47.700
When you opened the door, she immediately, uh, swings the pistol in your direction and

18:47.700 --> 18:53.180
then like, uh, puts it on, drops it on the ground and is just frantic and she's freaking

18:53.180 --> 18:59.700
out and you see your older brother in this beautiful white suit, Rose on his lapel looking

18:59.700 --> 19:00.880
fresh as hell.

19:00.880 --> 19:08.020
But the Rose is not the only red part of his outfit now as he is just completely riddled

19:08.020 --> 19:13.100
with holes from his own gun.

19:13.100 --> 19:22.700
She runs to you and she wraps her arms around you and she's like, I didn't, I didn't think

19:22.700 --> 19:26.700
it would, I didn't, I need you to roll a sanity check.

19:26.700 --> 19:27.700
Yeah.

19:27.700 --> 19:28.700
Yeah.

19:28.700 --> 19:31.300
I rolled a 45 and my current sanity is 24.

19:31.300 --> 19:32.300
Okay.

19:32.300 --> 19:38.420
So for convincing a stranger to kill your brother and then seeing your older brother's

19:38.420 --> 19:45.180
dead body, uh, on a failure, I'm going to go ahead and have you roll a D six, three.

19:45.180 --> 19:46.720
All right.

19:46.720 --> 19:47.720
Lose three sanity.

19:47.720 --> 19:48.720
Where are you at?

19:48.720 --> 19:49.720
21.

19:49.720 --> 19:50.720
Bringing point is 20.

19:50.720 --> 19:51.720
Oh boy.

19:51.720 --> 19:52.720
Yeah.

19:52.720 --> 19:55.900
So you are kind of losing it, right?

19:55.900 --> 19:56.900
You just start crying.

19:57.100 --> 20:01.300
I think probably, you know, you guys are just crying in each other's arms.

20:01.300 --> 20:05.420
I cry for, you know, a couple of minutes and then I kind of snapped back to it.

20:05.420 --> 20:11.340
I'm like, Hey, okay, just take a deep breath, lay back, lay on the bed and then I'm going

20:11.340 --> 20:15.180
to think of how to clean all this up.

20:15.180 --> 20:19.280
Uh, I think I saw some cleaning stuff in the, in the closet while I was in there.

20:19.280 --> 20:22.500
Just give me a second and we can clean this up and we'll figure out what to do with the

20:22.500 --> 20:23.500
body.

20:23.500 --> 20:24.500
Okay.

20:24.500 --> 20:25.500
Okay.

20:25.500 --> 20:26.500
Okay.

20:27.100 --> 20:31.220
She just kind of like sits at the end of the bed and with her head in her hands.

20:31.220 --> 20:32.220
Okay.

20:32.220 --> 20:33.220
I go back into the closet.

20:33.220 --> 20:35.260
I get the bleach and ammonia.

20:35.260 --> 20:39.580
Maybe I brought like a little cup with me or something to mix it up, pour them in there.

20:39.580 --> 20:45.860
I'm like, put my shirt up over my face.

20:45.860 --> 20:46.860
Great ventilation.

20:46.860 --> 20:47.860
Yeah.

20:47.860 --> 20:50.620
Um, and then I was probably gonna hurt my hands, but whatever.

20:50.820 --> 20:56.180
I get the rag and I put it in the mixture and I bring it out and walk over to Joan.

20:56.180 --> 20:57.180
Yeah.

20:57.180 --> 21:00.180
This seems like a great thing to clean blood up with.

21:00.180 --> 21:02.100
Look at me real quick.

21:02.100 --> 21:04.100
Yeah.

21:04.100 --> 21:07.740
She's not in any a state of mind to think about anything.

21:07.740 --> 21:13.380
So she just kind of looks up at you and I take my right hand with the mixture.

21:13.380 --> 21:19.620
I put it up on her face, grab the back of her head, like with my arm and just hold it

21:19.620 --> 21:20.620
there.

21:20.620 --> 21:21.620
Uh, okay.

21:21.620 --> 21:22.900
Let's do a strength contest.

21:22.900 --> 21:26.660
Her strength is 45.

21:26.660 --> 21:27.660
What is yours?

21:27.660 --> 21:28.660
55.

21:28.660 --> 21:29.660
All right.

21:29.660 --> 21:36.660
So whoever goes highest without going over shitting ass, shitting ass, whatever that

21:36.660 --> 21:37.660
means.

21:37.660 --> 21:38.660
Well, I know what it means.

21:38.660 --> 21:39.660
It means a ass that poops.

21:39.660 --> 21:40.660
Yeah.

21:40.660 --> 21:41.660
Not a good one.

21:41.660 --> 21:42.660
It's a, but the poops.

21:42.660 --> 21:43.660
Yeah.

21:43.660 --> 21:46.900
So I missed, you missed as this is happening.

21:46.900 --> 21:53.580
She fights you and she can get her hand in between her mouth and nose and the towel that

21:53.580 --> 21:54.580
you're using.

21:54.580 --> 21:56.440
And she starts yelling.

21:56.440 --> 22:04.460
She's like, why, why I did what you asked to go ahead and roll again.

22:04.460 --> 22:05.460
What'd you get?

22:05.460 --> 22:06.460
21.

22:06.460 --> 22:07.460
I got 24.

22:07.460 --> 22:08.460
Oh yeah.

22:08.460 --> 22:09.460
Attaboy.

22:09.460 --> 22:10.460
Describe what happens.

22:10.460 --> 22:13.660
Why did we just cheer you killing an innocent woman?

22:13.660 --> 22:14.660
Well I guess not.

22:14.660 --> 22:15.660
She's a murderer.

22:15.660 --> 22:16.660
Well, are you?

22:16.660 --> 22:20.900
I don't know at this point anymore.

22:20.900 --> 22:21.900
Okay.

22:21.900 --> 22:24.860
So I ripped the towel off her face.

22:24.860 --> 22:26.580
I'm like, Oh my God, I'm sorry.

22:26.580 --> 22:31.900
I just, I saw you kill my, or I saw my dead brother and I just started to freak out.

22:31.900 --> 22:37.700
And then she puts her hand down and looks at me and I put it on her face and I hold

22:37.700 --> 22:44.860
her down, like get on like on top of her on the bed and I hold it over her face until

22:45.060 --> 22:46.620
she stops fighting back.

22:46.620 --> 22:55.980
She's just screaming and squirming, but you hold down until she goes limp, roll sanity.

22:55.980 --> 22:56.980
I do not pass.

22:56.980 --> 22:57.980
Yeah.

22:57.980 --> 23:02.420
So you just killed a woman covering up the murder that you made her do.

23:02.420 --> 23:03.420
Right.

23:03.420 --> 23:05.140
But also I do want to do one last thing.

23:05.140 --> 23:06.220
Can I do that?

23:06.220 --> 23:10.740
I want to, you know, she's on the bed, passed out or whatever.

23:10.740 --> 23:15.100
I want to take like my, I think I have like a handkerchief or something.

23:15.100 --> 23:20.060
I want to take the gun, put it in her hand and put it up to her head and shoot so that

23:20.060 --> 23:21.500
it looks like she killed herself.

23:21.500 --> 23:22.500
Okay.

23:22.500 --> 23:29.620
I'm going to say that you're just in this weird state of like shock and determination

23:29.620 --> 23:35.460
while you carry out this ice fucking cold task.

23:35.460 --> 23:44.020
And she took his gun, shot him five times and then turned the gun on herself.

23:44.020 --> 23:46.300
And that's what you've made it look like.

23:46.300 --> 23:47.780
Yeah.

23:47.780 --> 23:49.900
I need you to roll.

23:49.900 --> 23:54.780
Let's just go D4 honestly, cause it's not as bad as, uh, you know, there's no tie there

23:54.780 --> 23:55.780
I guess.

23:55.780 --> 23:56.780
That's a three again.

23:56.780 --> 23:57.780
All right.

23:57.780 --> 23:58.980
Lose three sanity down to 18.

23:58.980 --> 24:01.300
That is past my breaking point as well.

24:01.300 --> 24:02.300
All right.

24:02.300 --> 24:03.300
And what's your power?

24:03.300 --> 24:04.300
10.

24:04.300 --> 24:05.300
Okay.

24:06.140 --> 24:07.140
I'm doing crazy.

24:07.140 --> 24:08.140
Yes you are.

24:08.140 --> 24:09.140
For good reason.

24:09.140 --> 24:10.140
I'd say.

24:10.140 --> 24:11.140
Yeah.

24:11.140 --> 24:12.140
But it was all for the money.

24:12.140 --> 24:13.140
I did it all for the money.

24:13.140 --> 24:14.740
All for the nookie.

24:14.740 --> 24:17.740
So as you complete this task, you're freaking out.

24:17.740 --> 24:20.780
You've just lost six sanity within five minutes.

24:20.780 --> 24:25.060
So you're losing your goddamn mind.

24:25.060 --> 24:32.980
However, as you're walking away, you see that Ferguson is wearing that watch that you remember

24:32.980 --> 24:39.380
from so long ago, your father giving him, I take my hanky and I take that watch off

24:39.380 --> 24:40.380
of him.

24:40.380 --> 24:41.380
Where do you put it?

24:41.380 --> 24:43.820
On is probably not a good answer in my pocket.

24:43.820 --> 24:45.840
So I wrap it up in the handkerchief, put it in my pocket.

24:45.840 --> 24:51.300
When you take the watch off of Ferguson with this handkerchief, you see that the face of

24:51.300 --> 24:52.880
the watch is blank.

24:52.880 --> 24:56.040
There's nothing on it, which is odd for a watch.

24:56.040 --> 25:01.380
And when you slip it into your pocket, it feels like your consciousness is changing

25:01.380 --> 25:06.940
the channel and you begin to phase out of your reality and you seem to be somewhere

25:06.940 --> 25:08.420
else entirely.

25:08.420 --> 25:14.780
You feel wet grass and dirt on your fingers and you were looking at a door in the ground

25:14.780 --> 25:21.960
like a sealed metal door that was mostly buried was.

25:21.960 --> 25:25.460
And on the door is an inscription, three lines.

25:25.460 --> 25:39.120
It says, here lies the beans, scientists beyond measure, saviors of the world.

25:39.120 --> 25:40.120
Where do you want to end up?

25:40.120 --> 25:41.120
What do you mean?

25:41.120 --> 25:44.620
Like where would you go after all of this?

25:44.620 --> 25:48.700
I do want to do like a quick, obviously I want to put like the chemicals and shit back

25:48.700 --> 25:51.260
where I found them, wipe them down.

25:51.260 --> 25:56.220
Anything that I touched, I want to wipe down so that I can't be associated back to being

25:56.220 --> 25:57.220
here.

25:57.220 --> 25:58.220
Sure.

25:58.220 --> 25:59.220
I'm going to leave the bodies and shit where they are.

25:59.220 --> 26:02.020
Cause you know, I guess I'll just walk back to that tunnel.

26:02.020 --> 26:03.020
Okay.

26:03.020 --> 26:06.220
Do I have her phone number or should I, I don't really know where I am.

26:06.220 --> 26:12.100
So I guess go back to that tunnel and then find my way back to, um, I guess my hotel

26:12.100 --> 26:13.100
motel.

26:13.100 --> 26:14.100
Hotel motel.

26:14.100 --> 26:15.100
Okay.

26:15.940 --> 26:21.700
Basically what we see as the audience is once you put that watch in your pocket, you're

26:21.700 --> 26:28.720
basically somewhere else in your eyes as you begin cleaning up, making sure that the scene

26:28.720 --> 26:33.980
of the crime looks exactly how it should and that your fingerprints are gone and that any

26:33.980 --> 26:37.620
idea that there was a third person there is gone.

26:37.620 --> 26:41.420
And we see you get into the tunnel and walking through the tunnel and your eyes are still

26:41.420 --> 26:47.580
just, you know, kind of glazed over as you, um, not only have lost so much sanity from

26:47.580 --> 26:53.960
doing and seeing what you just did and saw, but also it's almost like you are seeing that

26:53.960 --> 26:58.820
feeling of being at this place with this door that's buried in the ground.

26:58.820 --> 27:04.280
The whole time you're doing that stuff, you're just like halfway there, halfway here, and

27:04.280 --> 27:10.040
then cut to you laying in bed at hotel motel, but you still have that watch in your pocket

27:10.040 --> 27:11.040
in the handkerchief.

27:11.040 --> 27:13.240
Do I have like a safe in this hotel motel?

27:13.240 --> 27:14.240
Yeah.

27:14.240 --> 27:16.640
Still wrapped in the handkerchief, stick that in the safe.

27:16.640 --> 27:18.640
And as the safe door closes...

27:18.640 --> 27:20.240
Do I have the same look in my eyes?

27:20.240 --> 27:21.240
No.

27:21.240 --> 27:22.240
You're back.

27:22.240 --> 27:23.240
I'm back.

27:32.240 --> 27:39.280
John, you just successfully made 5 million dollars by selling cocaine to a random, handsome

27:39.280 --> 27:46.420
stranger named the Duke, paid him a grand to tell you Marvin Glass buys from him in

27:46.420 --> 27:53.000
bulk, and paid 8 of your cousins 10 grand and a 24 pack of keystone light, to which

27:53.000 --> 27:57.880
they each took a petty more sky shot and headed off into the night.

27:57.880 --> 28:05.160
Drew walks up and says, John, I want to, I want to thank you, and kind of sits you down.

28:05.160 --> 28:13.200
He grabs his, uh, his briefcase and he says, I thank you for making all of this money with

28:13.200 --> 28:14.200
me.

28:14.200 --> 28:15.200
This is amazing.

28:15.200 --> 28:19.320
I thank you for showing me how to shoot a gun.

28:19.320 --> 28:22.580
Yeah, actually about that, that's what I wanted to bring up.

28:22.580 --> 28:27.080
And I point my gun at him and I'm like, can you give me that gun back now?

28:27.080 --> 28:28.080
Yeah.

28:28.080 --> 28:30.280
Let's pass it over real slow.

28:30.280 --> 28:34.280
He passes it over and he's like, oh, that's okay.

28:34.280 --> 28:35.280
Sorry, man.

28:35.280 --> 28:39.000
Uh, I'm a man of means now and I can't afford to take any kind of risks.

28:39.000 --> 28:40.000
No, that's fine.

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
That's fine.

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
Mostly you are too, dude.

28:42.000 --> 28:46.480
You know, that's how you got to start looking at the world with suspicion and hate and,

28:46.480 --> 28:50.600
and fear for people who aren't as good as you because they're not as rich.

28:50.600 --> 28:52.800
Oh, that's what the rich man gets to do.

28:52.800 --> 28:55.480
Oh, well then can I have that gun back?

28:55.480 --> 28:59.040
No, buddy, you gotta have a gun to make that one work.

28:59.040 --> 29:00.040
Okay.

29:00.040 --> 29:01.040
All right.

29:01.040 --> 29:02.760
Well, mostly I wanted to thank you for your friendship.

29:02.760 --> 29:03.760
You too, man.

29:03.760 --> 29:04.760
You know what, Drew?

29:04.760 --> 29:06.880
I think you are my best friend on the force.

29:06.880 --> 29:07.880
Yeah.

29:07.880 --> 29:09.680
Case an idiot and Clark's real uptight.

29:09.680 --> 29:10.680
Yeah.

29:10.680 --> 29:11.680
Well, you're my best friend in life.

29:11.680 --> 29:12.680
So.

29:12.680 --> 29:13.680
Yeah.

29:13.680 --> 29:14.680
Hey, hey.

29:14.680 --> 29:15.680
Cool, man.

29:15.680 --> 29:16.680
But, uh, I am gonna leave.

29:16.680 --> 29:17.680
That's cool.

29:17.680 --> 29:18.680
Yeah.

29:18.680 --> 29:19.680
Get the fuck out of here, man.

29:19.680 --> 29:20.680
And I think I'm gonna bail.

29:20.680 --> 29:21.680
I think I'm out.

29:21.680 --> 29:22.680
You're out?

29:22.680 --> 29:23.680
Yeah.

29:23.680 --> 29:30.520
I think I'm gonna get a little, uh, a little spot, you know, and, and maybe north, I don't

29:30.520 --> 29:31.520
know, maybe south.

29:31.520 --> 29:32.520
All right.

29:32.520 --> 29:39.400
But Drew, I mean, we're out when it's over, but you're the fucking glue that keeps our

29:39.400 --> 29:40.880
sticky paper together.

29:40.880 --> 29:44.420
And our sticky paper is the, the, the fucking Contention PD.

29:44.420 --> 29:48.140
You're the goddamn peanut butter to our jelly, man.

29:48.140 --> 29:54.320
And I'm the jelly in Clark and, uh, Clark, Clark and Keith are the pieces of bread.

29:54.320 --> 29:57.440
Like, we need you, Drew.

29:57.440 --> 29:58.440
Contention needs you.

29:58.440 --> 30:00.680
We gotta save this fucking town, man.

30:00.680 --> 30:04.720
And then we can go to Florida or wherever else people go.

30:04.720 --> 30:07.760
Mexico, I guess.

30:07.760 --> 30:11.760
Well, maybe you're right.

30:11.760 --> 30:14.860
I'll see you around, John.

30:14.860 --> 30:22.640
And he, uh, takes his briefcase and he gets into his car, heads down the long, long driveway

30:22.640 --> 30:24.520
that you have out to your county road.

30:24.520 --> 30:26.560
What do you want to do?

30:26.560 --> 30:27.560
You're alone at home.

30:27.560 --> 30:30.200
Is there anything you want to take care of before you call tonight?

30:30.240 --> 30:32.080
Yeah, what's my willpower at?

30:32.080 --> 30:33.080
How tired am I?

30:33.080 --> 30:34.080
I did a bump, right?

30:34.080 --> 30:35.280
I think so, yeah.

30:35.280 --> 30:37.720
Your willpower should be at 12.

30:37.720 --> 30:38.720
Okay.

30:38.720 --> 30:40.920
I want to kill Keith Vigna.

30:40.920 --> 30:44.840
All right, let's do this.

30:44.840 --> 30:45.840
What do you do?

30:45.840 --> 30:46.840
How do you prep?

30:46.840 --> 30:51.760
No, honestly, I think like what I would do is just like call Keith and leave some real

30:51.760 --> 30:56.000
drunk angry voicemails as I just pounded fucking keystones.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.080
Do you want to leave a voicemail for Keith Vigna?

30:58.080 --> 30:59.640
Yeah, I do.

30:59.960 --> 31:00.960
Is it ringing?

31:00.960 --> 31:01.960
Yeah.

31:01.960 --> 31:02.960
Is it ringing?

31:02.960 --> 31:03.960
Yeah.

31:03.960 --> 31:04.960
What's his voicemail sound like?

31:04.960 --> 31:05.960
Okay.

31:05.960 --> 31:06.960
Yeah.

31:06.960 --> 31:07.960
Bring, bring, bring, bring.

31:07.960 --> 31:16.520
Hey, I'm a fucking idiot.

31:16.520 --> 31:18.440
Leave your number at the beep.

31:18.440 --> 31:19.440
Beep.

31:19.440 --> 31:23.000
Keith, it's John Lee Pettymore.

31:23.000 --> 31:27.560
I got $5 million now, motherfucker, and I'm going to kick your ass.

31:28.560 --> 31:30.800
Stupid piece of shit.

31:30.800 --> 31:33.800
Messing with my smoky DVDs, you goddamn bandit.

31:33.800 --> 31:36.080
I'm the richest man in the world.

31:36.080 --> 31:40.560
I'm going to stick a boot up your ass and then I'm going to fucking marry the turd that

31:40.560 --> 31:42.640
comes out of that ass.

31:42.640 --> 31:43.640
Let's delete all this.

31:43.640 --> 31:46.400
No, I think that is gold.

31:46.400 --> 31:52.320
I'm going to keep yelling about $5 million and then something about a turd coming out

31:52.320 --> 31:54.320
of his ass.

31:54.320 --> 31:58.760
So I'm pretty, I'm pretty tired from the events of this evening.

31:58.760 --> 32:01.960
So I slam three more celebratory Keystone lights.

32:01.960 --> 32:06.480
I do another line just to get me, you know, put a little pep in my step while I brush

32:06.480 --> 32:08.680
my teeth and stuff.

32:08.680 --> 32:15.760
And I send Keith Vigna a text message that just says, I know, love it.

32:15.760 --> 32:19.840
I kind of spent some time, as I'm a wealthy man now, I have a fortune to protect.

32:19.840 --> 32:25.000
So I am a little bit nervous about all these, these monsters and ghouls and entities that

32:25.000 --> 32:27.720
have descended upon my town.

32:27.720 --> 32:31.160
Got a lot more stake in this place now.

32:31.160 --> 32:33.160
I don't like it.

32:33.160 --> 32:36.000
Now you got to protect your town now.

32:36.000 --> 32:37.000
You could own this town.

32:37.000 --> 32:44.240
Who knew that with such fabulous wealth would come such immense responsibility.

32:44.240 --> 32:49.680
Now that was not the idea of wealth as it was advertised to me, John Lee Pettymore.

32:49.720 --> 32:54.600
A rich man has no troubles friend.

32:54.600 --> 32:59.240
Certainly not supposed to be beset by goddamn supernatural horrors.

32:59.240 --> 33:00.240
Caught at night?

33:00.240 --> 33:01.240
Yeah.

33:01.240 --> 33:08.040
John's gonna sweep up his smokey DVDs and put one in director's cut, fall asleep, smoking

33:08.040 --> 33:14.960
a joint on his couch, dreaming of his millions, but also of terrible monsters.

33:14.960 --> 33:21.160
So John is asleep on the couch with the butt of a joint in his mouth, lit in this cluttered

33:21.160 --> 33:25.680
mess of a living room by the DVD menu screen of Smokey and the Bandit.

33:25.680 --> 33:31.460
The night sky is beginning to turn bright, but the sun has yet to peak over the horizon.

33:31.460 --> 33:36.160
It is early on this cold December morning and the air smells crispy.

33:36.160 --> 33:41.640
A thin layer of fog hangs just above the dewy grass on John Lee Pettymore's property.

33:41.920 --> 33:46.040
John, you wake up abruptly to the sound of two gunshots.

33:46.040 --> 33:47.040
What do you do?

33:47.040 --> 33:48.580
I scramble for my pistol.

33:48.580 --> 33:51.200
You scramble it for your pistol, find it.

33:51.200 --> 33:54.480
And I get, you know, behind some cover, but I peek out a window.

33:54.480 --> 33:56.420
I try to look for where the shots are coming from.

33:56.420 --> 34:02.320
When you peek out of a window, you can see that outside of your house is a woman holding

34:02.320 --> 34:06.320
hostage, the Pettymore cousins and Drew Andrews.

34:06.320 --> 34:10.000
She is wearing jeans with a white shirt and a leather jacket.

34:10.000 --> 34:15.580
She is gaunt with crazy hair and enormous thick glasses that make her already large

34:15.580 --> 34:17.740
eyes look even bigger.

34:17.740 --> 34:24.300
Six Pettymore boys and Drew are on their knees with their hands behind their backs.

34:24.300 --> 34:29.320
Their mouths are duct taped and most are bleeding from some part of their body.

34:29.320 --> 34:34.040
This is even more apparent as all seven of them have been stripped of their shirts.

34:34.080 --> 34:40.920
The other two Pettymore cousins are also bound and shirtless, but they are face down about

34:40.920 --> 34:45.720
twenty feet away from the group, and each has a puddle of blood growing from where their

34:45.720 --> 34:47.240
heads landed.

34:47.240 --> 34:51.240
This woman has a pistol nuzzled into the back of Drew's head.

34:51.240 --> 34:59.640
Officer Pettymore, your presence is requested please.

34:59.640 --> 35:03.760
So John Lee Pettymore IV nearly shits himself.

35:03.760 --> 35:12.880
But he mutters, mo money mo problems, and then he scrambles to the door and he cracks

35:12.880 --> 35:13.880
it open.

35:13.880 --> 35:15.400
I know her, right?

35:15.400 --> 35:19.400
You recognize her immediately as the woman you had the interaction with in the hotel

35:19.400 --> 35:20.400
motel.

35:20.400 --> 35:24.600
So I crack open the door and I shout, I'm here, what do you want?

35:24.600 --> 35:29.620
Drop your gun, or I'll send your friend's brains through his toothy mouth.

35:29.620 --> 35:34.540
It's drop, I drop my, I set it outside where she can see.

35:34.540 --> 35:35.540
It's drop.

35:35.540 --> 35:36.860
Come on out with your hands up.

35:36.860 --> 35:37.860
I come out.

35:37.860 --> 35:41.100
Alright, here's the deal John.

35:41.100 --> 35:42.500
You know who I work for.

35:42.500 --> 35:43.500
Yeah.

35:43.500 --> 35:44.900
Do you know what he wants?

35:44.900 --> 35:46.860
He wants the gun John.

35:46.860 --> 35:47.860
Oh.

35:47.860 --> 35:50.340
He wants the gun?

35:50.340 --> 35:51.340
Not your gun.

35:51.340 --> 35:52.340
No, I know.

35:52.340 --> 35:54.240
He wants the other gun.

35:54.240 --> 35:55.860
You killed two Pettymores.

35:55.860 --> 35:57.980
Well they tried to run away from me.

35:57.980 --> 36:00.100
I don't like it when people run away.

36:00.100 --> 36:04.820
Well that was foolish of them considering the circumstances.

36:04.820 --> 36:11.860
I still probably hate you forever, but I see what you done and why you did it.

36:11.860 --> 36:18.660
Listen, your boss can have that gun when this is all said and done, but I don't particularly

36:18.660 --> 36:21.740
think that's what he needs.

36:21.740 --> 36:23.980
Now he wants to get his boys back, right?

36:23.980 --> 36:25.540
Well yeah, I mean.

36:25.540 --> 36:29.060
Or in another way of speaking, he wants to get his boys back, right?

36:29.060 --> 36:30.060
Yeah.

36:30.060 --> 36:31.060
Yeah.

36:31.060 --> 36:35.060
Well I want to get my town back right, and I think maybe we can help each other in that

36:35.060 --> 36:36.060
regard.

36:36.060 --> 36:41.460
I think we kind of want the same thing, so what do you need?

36:41.460 --> 36:45.380
You can have that gun, but I don't think that's really...

36:45.380 --> 36:46.380
Let's talk about...

36:46.380 --> 36:49.500
You can have that gun, but I think you might find some...

36:49.500 --> 36:50.500
What do you need?

36:50.500 --> 36:54.820
John, I am middle management at best.

36:54.820 --> 36:57.620
I was sent here to collect the gun.

36:57.620 --> 37:03.300
If you don't have it, then I'm supposed to bring something back as collateral, you know,

37:03.300 --> 37:05.060
until you bring it.

37:05.060 --> 37:06.060
So uh...

37:06.060 --> 37:07.060
Alright.

37:07.060 --> 37:08.060
Hey, wait.

37:08.060 --> 37:09.060
I don't have the gun.

37:09.060 --> 37:10.420
I mean it's down at the station.

37:10.420 --> 37:12.820
But why don't you bring me as collateral?

37:12.820 --> 37:13.820
What?

37:13.820 --> 37:14.820
Bring me to your boss.

37:14.820 --> 37:16.580
I'd like to talk to him.

37:16.580 --> 37:17.580
Uh, wait.

37:17.580 --> 37:19.340
The gun is just at the station?

37:19.340 --> 37:20.340
No.

37:20.340 --> 37:22.540
That's what you just said.

37:22.540 --> 37:26.340
Yeah, to trick your dumb ass.

37:26.340 --> 37:34.820
I don't typically roll, but I'm going to go ahead and roll real quick.

37:34.820 --> 37:38.260
This is all my own doing.

37:38.260 --> 37:40.140
Yeah, okay.

37:40.140 --> 37:46.300
You're not going to tell me what the result of that roll is?

37:46.300 --> 37:50.700
We're going to need that gun then, if you have it.

37:50.700 --> 37:51.700
That's all we want.

37:51.700 --> 37:52.700
We don't need you.

37:52.700 --> 37:53.700
We just want the gun.

37:53.700 --> 37:54.700
He wants the gun.

37:54.700 --> 37:55.700
I'm going to bring him the gun.

37:55.700 --> 38:03.000
If not, I'll go ahead and, you know, if you can bring the gun, then that would be great.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.100
If you could go get it now, that'd be better.

38:05.100 --> 38:07.380
For me personally, I don't like being here.

38:07.380 --> 38:09.340
I'd rather go back to the city.

38:09.340 --> 38:10.340
So...

38:10.340 --> 38:11.340
Alright, alright.

38:11.340 --> 38:13.980
Can I deliver the gun to him?

38:13.980 --> 38:14.980
Or I...

38:14.980 --> 38:15.980
Yes.

38:15.980 --> 38:16.980
Can I come with you?

38:16.980 --> 38:17.980
Sure.

38:17.980 --> 38:18.980
Alright.

38:18.980 --> 38:20.980
That's what I want to do.

38:21.620 --> 38:23.620
Jesus Christ, was it so hard?

38:23.620 --> 38:25.100
Let's go get the gun.

38:25.100 --> 38:27.820
Lady, you killed two of my cousins.

38:27.820 --> 38:30.820
Well, they tried to run away from me when I had a gun.

38:30.820 --> 38:36.060
Like I said, I understand, but I'm still pissed at you.

38:36.060 --> 38:37.860
Were they your favorite cousins?

38:37.860 --> 38:39.060
I mean, how many do you have?

38:39.060 --> 38:40.380
Yes, Edward was.

38:40.380 --> 38:44.260
Well, my third favorite, anyway.

38:44.260 --> 38:47.980
Did the other Patty Moore's kind of look up and they're like, what?

38:47.980 --> 38:55.060
And I wink at Jonathan like, you know me, you're my number one.

38:55.060 --> 38:57.580
He smiles through tears.

38:57.580 --> 39:03.020
Edward was his brother.

39:03.020 --> 39:04.500
Sad day for the Patty Moore's.

39:04.500 --> 39:06.500
We're all like brothers, so it's fun.

39:06.500 --> 39:08.100
So let's go to the station.

39:08.100 --> 39:09.260
Yeah, we'll get the gun.

39:09.260 --> 39:10.260
Right now.

39:10.260 --> 39:12.580
If you can introduce me to your boss, I'll get you that gun.

39:12.580 --> 39:14.060
Alright, let's go to the station.

39:14.060 --> 39:15.060
Alright.

39:15.140 --> 39:20.460
I think how this is going to work is she's not going to want to ever leave herself vulnerable

39:20.460 --> 39:24.100
to you because she just killed two of your cousins.

39:24.100 --> 39:28.500
So first she's going to let the cousins all go.

39:28.500 --> 39:29.940
She's going to keep a gun on Drew.

39:29.940 --> 39:36.980
Hey, boys, there's another 24 pack and 10K in this for y'all because of what you suffered.

39:36.980 --> 39:37.980
And I bet they could split.

39:37.980 --> 39:44.620
Yeah, well, I figured you'd divide Edward and Aloysius's share.

39:44.620 --> 39:45.620
Yep.

39:45.620 --> 39:48.900
Love that that's the name you just pull out.

39:48.900 --> 39:50.980
That's a, oh brother, we're at that reference.

39:50.980 --> 39:52.500
It's the name he pulls out.

39:52.500 --> 39:53.500
Perfect.

39:53.500 --> 39:54.500
One of them.

39:54.500 --> 40:00.340
Well, this campaign is turning into a bit of an odyssey.

40:00.340 --> 40:07.140
So she's going to go ahead and have you and Drew drive in Drew's Mini Cooper.

40:07.140 --> 40:10.760
And she's going to sit in the backseat with a gun pointed at both of you as you guys go

40:10.760 --> 40:12.220
down to the station.

40:12.220 --> 40:18.460
Lady, you might get that gun, but nobody fucks with the petty moors and lives to talk

40:18.460 --> 40:19.460
about it.

40:19.460 --> 40:22.140
What you've done today was unforgivable.

40:22.140 --> 40:26.260
And there are many of us living in these Hills.

40:26.260 --> 40:27.260
We're coming for you.

40:27.260 --> 40:32.540
Even if I fall today, the petty moors are coming for you.

40:32.540 --> 40:33.540
Okay.

40:33.540 --> 40:34.620
That's fine.

40:34.620 --> 40:38.140
And she pushes you forward.

40:42.220 --> 40:51.620
All right.

40:51.620 --> 41:01.020
So Clark, you are in this stone room, circular stone room with a stone table light shining

41:01.020 --> 41:04.340
down one man sitting across from you.

41:04.340 --> 41:07.420
He's holding this big fucker.

41:07.420 --> 41:13.140
And then he immediately puts it down in this like container in between his legs and puts

41:13.140 --> 41:14.780
the lid on it.

41:14.780 --> 41:16.580
And he sits back down.

41:16.580 --> 41:18.020
So what do you think?

41:18.020 --> 41:19.020
Can you repeat all that?

41:19.020 --> 41:20.020
Yeah, sure.

41:20.020 --> 41:27.260
So when I was, when I was a young boy, no, no, Clark is probably still silent and staring

41:27.260 --> 41:28.260
at this lug.

41:28.260 --> 41:29.500
Who are you?

41:29.500 --> 41:31.940
Oh, my name is Leon Simpson.

41:31.940 --> 41:32.940
Where am I?

41:32.940 --> 41:34.620
You are in the lair.

41:34.620 --> 41:38.740
Well, layer is kind of a dark word, but it is technically a layer, I suppose, of the

41:38.740 --> 41:43.860
circle of knowledge, which I believe I just inducted you into.

41:43.860 --> 41:49.320
We have a first task for you as a new member of the circle of knowledge.

41:49.320 --> 41:55.460
And he reaches into his pocket and he pulls out the small little plastic container and

41:55.460 --> 42:00.340
he slides it toward you, takes a gun out of his pocket.

42:00.340 --> 42:02.180
And it's not a normal gun.

42:02.180 --> 42:06.120
It's a tranquilizer kind of thing in the little package that he's sliding across the table

42:06.120 --> 42:07.120
toward you.

42:07.120 --> 42:11.060
It's clear on top and there are a couple needles in there.

42:11.060 --> 42:19.940
Okay, so Clark, these are filled with a very particular toxin that will make anyone obey

42:19.940 --> 42:22.880
your will for some time.

42:22.880 --> 42:27.540
And what we're going to need you to do is, well, I don't know if you're aware of this,

42:27.540 --> 42:32.300
but the government isn't too happy with the situation over there in contention.

42:32.300 --> 42:35.540
And we're going to need you to kind of get that under control.

42:35.540 --> 42:39.380
That way we can take back control of your town.

42:39.380 --> 42:42.860
So I'm going to need you to go back to contention.

42:42.860 --> 42:48.140
There should be one FBI agent who is coming in the morning to take over all of the police

42:48.140 --> 42:50.180
work in the town of contention.

42:50.180 --> 42:54.900
I don't see any way that they're going to keep you all on based off of literally everything

42:54.900 --> 42:55.900
that you've done.

42:55.900 --> 42:57.860
They're watching you.

42:57.860 --> 43:02.820
And that's one of the reasons that we're bringing you on is that literally no one will believe

43:02.820 --> 43:05.060
a word you say at this point, honestly.

43:05.060 --> 43:09.660
You have absolutely no credit to your name.

43:09.660 --> 43:12.720
And that's going to really turn out in our favor, I think.

43:12.720 --> 43:17.260
So what you're going to do is you're going to load those needles into that gun.

43:17.260 --> 43:22.220
They shoot out this little microscopic needle that has this toxin in it.

43:22.220 --> 43:29.060
And I need you to make sure that the FBI agent doesn't see anything funny going around in

43:29.060 --> 43:30.060
contention.

43:30.060 --> 43:33.820
Now, Clark, I'm going to ask you this one time.

43:33.820 --> 43:34.820
We're brothers now.

43:34.820 --> 43:39.220
I know you just met me and you just figured out my name, Leon Simpson.

43:39.220 --> 43:43.700
Very good name, but I'm going to need you to trust me.

43:43.700 --> 43:45.740
What's been going on in contention?

43:45.740 --> 43:51.220
Well, Leon, a lot of stuff's been happening.

43:51.220 --> 43:52.220
Tell me all about it.

43:52.220 --> 43:58.780
There's been some black goo and people disappearing in flashes of light.

43:58.780 --> 44:02.700
And I've been seeing things that aren't there sometimes.

44:02.700 --> 44:07.460
And then there were FBI agents that came and they had a black bag and they told us that

44:07.460 --> 44:11.620
we were going to have to put stuff in it to neutralize it or something.

44:11.620 --> 44:18.660
And there was these photos from a camera with tubes and a radio that made a man a cat and

44:18.660 --> 44:19.660
a cat a man.

44:19.660 --> 44:21.300
So, I mean, some stuff's been happening.

44:21.300 --> 44:24.500
It made a cat a man and a man a cat?

44:24.500 --> 44:25.500
Mm-hmm.

44:25.500 --> 44:26.500
What?

44:26.500 --> 44:27.500
The man is a cat now?

44:27.500 --> 44:29.060
He's a cat man?

44:29.060 --> 44:30.060
Yeah.

44:30.060 --> 44:31.060
Yeah.

44:31.060 --> 44:32.060
Okay.

44:32.060 --> 44:33.800
What is this ooze, though, that you speak of?

44:33.800 --> 44:35.500
Do you see it everywhere or?

44:35.500 --> 44:36.500
Leon, how come?

44:36.500 --> 44:37.500
How come?

44:37.500 --> 44:40.380
It seems like you know a lot about a lot of stuff, but you don't know anything about any

44:40.380 --> 44:41.380
of this.

44:41.380 --> 44:45.260
Clark, I know so much more than you could ever imagine.

44:45.260 --> 44:47.080
So this is a test.

44:47.080 --> 44:48.180
It's a bit of a test.

44:48.180 --> 44:52.900
The black goo, there was a guy who was vacuuming it.

44:52.900 --> 44:53.900
Okay.

44:53.900 --> 45:00.060
Oh, and it made some, between you and I, a couple kids disappeared in it.

45:00.060 --> 45:01.060
Whoa.

45:01.060 --> 45:02.380
Haven't told anybody that.

45:02.380 --> 45:03.380
Whoa.

45:03.380 --> 45:04.380
Yeah.

45:04.380 --> 45:05.700
Who was this guy who was vacuuming it?

45:05.700 --> 45:07.740
His name was James.

45:07.740 --> 45:10.060
James, the mononym James?

45:10.060 --> 45:11.140
Yeah, you know him.

45:11.140 --> 45:12.220
I do.

45:12.220 --> 45:15.820
Are you from contention, Leon?

45:15.820 --> 45:16.940
Is he still around?

45:16.940 --> 45:17.940
Did you talk to him?

45:17.940 --> 45:22.060
No, James is not, he's no longer with us.

45:22.060 --> 45:24.100
He was in a house that blew up.

45:24.100 --> 45:27.780
Did anyone else, wait, a house that blew up?

45:27.780 --> 45:30.060
Yeah, there was a house that blew up.

45:30.060 --> 45:34.380
It was, our chief Maggie Cook was in, it was her house.

45:34.380 --> 45:35.380
Okay.

45:35.380 --> 45:37.100
There were some other people in there.

45:37.100 --> 45:38.100
Who was in there?

45:38.100 --> 45:40.100
It was Maggie, and it was James.

45:40.100 --> 45:41.180
Maggie is dead?

45:41.180 --> 45:46.940
Maggie was dead before the house blew up, and so was James, probably.

45:46.940 --> 45:49.100
I think the house blew up because it was booby trapped.

45:49.100 --> 45:50.100
Booby trapped?

45:50.100 --> 45:51.100
Yeah.

45:51.100 --> 45:56.260
One of my partners was in there, and I think he slipped or something, and he heard a click,

45:56.260 --> 45:57.260
and then...

45:57.260 --> 45:58.260
Is he dead too?

45:58.260 --> 45:59.260
No, he got out of there.

45:59.260 --> 46:02.060
He rescued my dispatcher also.

46:02.060 --> 46:03.060
Dispatcher?

46:03.060 --> 46:04.060
His name is Drew.

46:04.060 --> 46:07.780
Drew was over there because he got a call from Harold Dorsey.

46:07.780 --> 46:10.180
Is this Harold Dorsey still with us, or?

46:10.180 --> 46:12.420
No, I think he's dead too.

46:12.420 --> 46:13.420
My goodness.

46:13.420 --> 46:14.420
Okay.

46:14.420 --> 46:18.020
Well, that's crazy.

46:18.020 --> 46:20.180
I mean, do you guys know who did it?

46:20.180 --> 46:24.380
Well, when you say who did it, there's a lot of its that it could be that you're asking,

46:24.380 --> 46:29.580
but you know, I'll tell you what, no is the answer to all of them.

46:29.580 --> 46:30.580
Okay.

46:30.580 --> 46:35.500
Well, that's the kind of police work that we've come to expect from you all in contention,

46:35.500 --> 46:36.500
honestly.

46:36.500 --> 46:40.060
Well, I mean, if you had a lost dog, oh fuck, I fucked that up too.

46:40.060 --> 46:47.540
If you needed to cross the road at a crosswalk, we could help you with that.

46:47.540 --> 46:48.540
Wow.

46:48.540 --> 46:49.540
Okay.

46:49.540 --> 46:52.220
Well, this is going to be a bit more intensive than that.

46:52.220 --> 46:56.620
This shooting an FBI agent with the needles and then telling him what to do, but basically

46:56.620 --> 47:00.020
we're going to need you to keep them away from any of the strangeness, any of the goo

47:00.020 --> 47:05.880
that you've seen or ooze or whatever you're calling it, and that would just be great.

47:05.920 --> 47:12.800
You have 24 hours and then I need you to report back and we can make sure that you will be

47:12.800 --> 47:13.800
okay.

47:13.800 --> 47:17.160
24 hours for me to tranq the FBI agent and get them off the trail.

47:17.160 --> 47:18.160
Exactly.

47:18.160 --> 47:21.360
Is there a way I can get in contact with you before that 24 hours is up if I need to?

47:21.360 --> 47:22.360
Yeah, absolutely.

47:22.360 --> 47:29.400
And he slides a business card across and it says Leon Simpson and then it has his number

47:29.400 --> 47:30.400
and that's it.

47:30.400 --> 47:31.400
Nice.

47:31.400 --> 47:36.680
Leon, that thing in that jar there, what is it?

47:36.680 --> 47:38.680
Oh, it's a xenonimatode.

47:38.680 --> 47:47.840
Currently we believe it is a vector from either another time, another place, or another reality.

47:47.840 --> 47:55.320
We're not quite positive, however, it is the thing that Paul Simon found that has connected

47:55.320 --> 48:02.880
the dots of the knowledge of the overseer, which you will attain one day within our elite

48:02.880 --> 48:05.880
group, however that is for another time.

48:05.880 --> 48:12.520
Basically these creatures, they have certain abilities that we have found a way to exploit

48:12.520 --> 48:14.480
and so we need them.

48:14.480 --> 48:17.960
We keep them around for a very specific purpose.

48:17.960 --> 48:20.400
Actually you know what, follow me.

48:20.400 --> 48:26.960
And he opens up the one door in this room and it opens into another stone room.

48:26.960 --> 48:28.680
This one much larger.

48:28.680 --> 48:34.280
This circular room is 20 yards across and has a domed ceiling.

48:34.280 --> 48:40.080
The walls are stone and there are a handful of torches mounted to light the room.

48:40.080 --> 48:47.840
There are six large slabs of stone, each with a couple of people laying on them, circling

48:47.840 --> 48:52.600
a single unoccupied stone slab in the center of the space.

48:52.600 --> 48:59.320
Each person laying down has one of those giant fucked up worm things attached to them and

48:59.320 --> 49:04.800
many of them seem to have dead skin covering one or multiple limbs.

49:04.800 --> 49:10.800
And there is a woman in electric blue slacks and a bright yellow cardigan walking deliberately

49:10.800 --> 49:17.360
around to each slab, checking on each group and checking her watch.

49:17.360 --> 49:20.620
And her back is turned to you.

49:20.620 --> 49:23.120
When you walk into this room you're just kind of taking it all in.

49:23.120 --> 49:28.160
This is a legitimately horrifying sight I would imagine.

49:28.160 --> 49:34.860
Leon kind of grabs your shoulder and looks you in the eyes and he's like, this is the

49:34.860 --> 49:40.760
chamber of the circle of knowledge and here is where we do our most important work.

49:40.760 --> 49:46.960
You see, these brave men and women, and he motions to the people laying on the slabs

49:46.960 --> 49:50.280
who all look very down on their luck.

49:50.280 --> 49:53.040
One might call them homeless looking.

49:53.040 --> 50:01.200
And he says, these fine individuals have dedicated their lives to the survival of humanity.

50:01.200 --> 50:03.920
Have they done it willingly?

50:03.920 --> 50:09.440
That's not necessarily the most important idea to have right now.

50:09.440 --> 50:17.840
But yes, in many cases we have become a much, much better organization within the past couple

50:17.840 --> 50:25.000
of years and have begun to explain to people why they're dedicating their lives before

50:25.000 --> 50:27.920
we make them.

50:27.920 --> 50:32.400
Obviously not you necessarily, but we're also not asking you to, you know, give up your

50:32.400 --> 50:35.700
skin or limbs for the cause.

50:35.700 --> 50:38.600
We want you to be one of us.

50:38.600 --> 50:43.720
And he kind of points at him and the woman in the electric blue slacks and bright yellow

50:43.720 --> 50:50.640
cardigan who is standing on the far side of the room with a notebook, taking notes.

50:50.640 --> 50:55.240
Let's get you going because the timer's already started and I'd hate for the 24 hours to go

50:55.240 --> 50:58.920
up and you know, we really like you around, we'd hate to lose you.

50:58.920 --> 51:08.040
So as he walks you out of the room, you hear the woman say, bye Leon, and you turn back

51:08.040 --> 51:12.080
and look and you recognize this woman.

51:12.080 --> 51:20.720
She is cold and vacant with a big smile on her face and her hair is covering one of her

51:20.720 --> 51:21.920
eyes.

51:21.920 --> 51:25.440
And she says, bye Clark.

51:25.440 --> 51:28.400
You feel a little pinch in your neck.

51:28.400 --> 51:31.240
As I feel that pinch, I'm turning around and running toward.

51:31.240 --> 51:42.000
You're running toward her and she begins laughing as you slowly crumble to the ground.

51:42.000 --> 51:48.240
Clark you come to in the back of a cab, trees lined both sides of the narrow gravel road

51:48.240 --> 51:49.840
you were bouncing down.

51:49.840 --> 51:55.040
Looking back, you see the gravel path leads to an opening where just enough plant life

51:55.040 --> 52:00.420
has been removed to open up space for a parking lot and a massive brick building with two

52:00.420 --> 52:07.540
enormous smokestacks reaching up into the canopy of trees encircling this property.

52:07.540 --> 52:17.100
There is a sign that reads, the mill on the other side of the city.

52:17.100 --> 52:21.780
Of course Clark, thanks.

52:30.420 --> 52:59.060
How am I the only one trying to pull over How can you have enough drowning out of the

52:59.060 --> 53:00.060
dark?

53:00.060 --> 53:20.740
Hello there dear listener.

53:20.740 --> 53:27.620
It is I, your narrative Sherpa, Wolf the dog, standing self assured on this massive mountain

53:27.620 --> 53:28.940
of information.

53:28.940 --> 53:34.260
If you're a bit hazy on all the details of the story so far, fear not.

53:34.260 --> 53:41.980
Go check out episode 96 for a recap of episodes 1-23 and know that you are not alone.

53:41.980 --> 53:47.420
Much love, yours both truly and falsely, Wolf the dog.
