0	5680	Hello my patients, it's your doctor, Wolf the Dog, and I'm here to check the charts
5680	13260	so I can diagnose what the fuck is plaguing Contention here on 694.2 PTBP, Contention's
13260	15160	only radio show.
15160	18780	Y'all I'm scrubbed up and ready to go.
18780	25180	This week's Howlin' with Wolf comes from at bfevans19 on Twitter and Reddit who blessed
25180	32460	us with a glowing 5 star review on Apple Podcasts, quote, and now Wolf has a special
32460	47180	announcement for all you agents in the field out there, 42, 65, 20, 73, 75, 72, 65, 20,
47180	73220	74, 6F, 20, 64, 72, 69, 6E, 6B, 20, 79, 6F, 75, 72, 24, F, 76, 61, 6C, 74, 69, 6E, 65,
73220	76420	end transmission, end quote.
76420	85180	My producer has a note here, apparently Reddit user KRUCZ36 has made a subreddit for pretending
85180	90500	to be people located at r slash pretending to be people.
90500	95260	The first person to decode the message and post it in the subreddit will receive the
95260	100860	pride that comes with being the best agent in the field and also the ability to write
100860	106340	up their own Howlin' with Wolf announcement to be read by your personal physician, Dr.
106340	107340	Wolf.
107340	115280	And as always, if you want to see behind the scenes of 694.2 PTBP, follow along at pretending
115280	117900	pod on Instagram and Twitter.
117900	122860	There's a Facebook, sure, but Zuckerberg is a fuck face.
122860	124500	Now back to reality.
124500	126440	Oh, there goes gravity.
126440	128460	It's time for the news.
128460	133940	After officers Bishop and Vigna had the most uncomfortable dinner since the last supper,
133940	136700	some real plot heavy shit went down.
136700	140820	Keith Vigna was approached by his niece, Francis Beans.
140820	145980	Upon accepting her proposal, the two are driving East away from contention.
145980	153660	John Lee Pettymore and Drew Andrews bonded over shared fortune after a smooth transaction.
153660	158840	Clark Bishop saw an impossibility out of his window and then woke up in an unfamiliar
158840	161860	place with an unfamiliar face.
161860	166900	Strap on your restraints and bite down hard because this is going to be a fucking wild
166900	167900	ride.
167900	193340	Keith, you are in the car of your niece, Francis Beans.
193340	195480	It is a Chrysler Sebring.
195480	201560	She has offered you $1 million to kill her father, your brother, Ferguson Beans.
201560	207880	She tells you she is going to take the secret way to avoid security and begins driving on
207880	213620	a narrow path through the woods, trees missing her side mirrors by inches every couple of
213620	214620	feet.
214620	222520	And then she pulls up to a black iron fence seemingly out of place in these thick woods.
222560	228120	Francis grabs a backpack from her back seat and motions for you to follow her as she opens
228120	232360	a hatch in the ground and jumps inside disappearing from view.
232360	234580	I follow her down the hatch.
234580	243120	Down the hatch, you guys are in this like crazy dark underground tunnel that is lit
243120	250760	by these red lights every like 15 feet on the walls of this tunnel.
250760	252400	It's dank down here.
252400	255920	It's like, did I recognize it all like on the way here?
255920	258360	Had I ever been here before?
258360	263560	I think you've maybe been out here once or twice for a reason.
263560	269360	I mean, you and your brother kept in touch kind of, but not really.
269360	271520	So had I been the secret way before?
271520	272520	No, absolutely not.
272520	273520	All right, cool.
273520	274520	So anyway.
274520	280320	So you guys are going through this underground tunnel and when you pop up, it's this, she
280320	287080	tells you right before, she's like, um, we're about to pop up above ground and it is like
287080	293380	this sweet spot where there's no security cameras looking and we'll be able to take
293380	296720	an easy direct route into the house.
296720	297720	You can do that.
297720	303400	I am going to bail and then I will meet up with you later when it's finished.
303400	304400	All right.
304400	305640	Are you sure you can't come with me?
305640	310080	Uh, yeah, I'm pretty fucking sure that it would look a little bit more suspicious if
310080	314920	two of us were coming then maybe just one where we're trying to be stealthy, right?
314920	317400	And avoid people seeing us.
317400	319600	So I think this one's on you, my dude.
319600	323000	Have you ever thought about going into the force?
323000	324720	I think you'd be pretty good at it.
324720	325720	Which one?
325720	328800	The one that I'm on in the police force.
328800	330960	You think that I would be a good police officer?
330960	337400	I actually thinking about it now, I am going on a hit for you right now.
337400	338400	Maybe not.
338400	340520	So maybe I wouldn't be a great police officer.
340520	343120	Maybe I'd be about as good of a police officer as you are, Keith.
343120	345840	Oh, you'd be a much better police officer than me.
345840	346840	Anyway.
346840	347840	Um, okay.
347840	349640	Just show me the route that I need to take.
349640	350640	Okay.
350640	356360	And she writes it out, kind of like shows you on her palm where the two houses are that
356360	361960	are on the property and then, uh, which one is Ferguson's and how you need to get up into
361960	367280	his room and like where to hide, basically like written on her hand.
367280	368280	It's written on her hand.
368280	374160	I put my hand up to her hand and my slightly sweaty palm is hold it on a little bit and
374160	375160	then take it off.
375160	378720	And now it's just on my hand, but tattoo style first.
378720	379720	Yeah.
379720	380720	Yeah.
380720	383920	And she is super grossed out the entire time your hand is touching your hand.
383920	385120	She's like, I hate this.
385120	386120	I hate this.
386120	387120	I'm taking a picture.
387120	392560	This is so, why didn't you just take a picture evidence I'm a cop.
392560	393560	I'm a cop.
393560	402480	Uh, so you open up this hatch as she walks back the way you guys came and she cracks
402480	406440	up in this hatch for you and looking out, you're into the world.
406440	408600	It's this beautiful, nice little place.
408600	416560	Uh, Ferguson beans and his wife, Stacy live in two separate houses, right on the County
416560	419760	line between contention and the city.
419760	425040	They both own one of the homes and they use a weird archaic marriage law.
425040	428560	So they can both vote in both counties.
428560	434800	Fergie often brags about this to people over at his home, his home, his home is modern
434800	440280	with lots of sharp lines, glass walls and geometrical patterns.
440280	445600	And Stacy's home is an old Victorian with a wraparound porch and a turret reaching into
445600	447360	the sky from one corner.
447360	451200	And based on the map, are they like right next to each other, right next to each other.
451200	457080	And there's almost a line like in the grass where you can see the, like the County line
457080	463080	that Ferguson likes to joke about what a fucking dickhead.
463080	469040	And uh, as you can see from your hand, your backwards hand map, uh, you've got a direct
469040	475120	route into the back of Ferguson's home, uh, where you won't be seen by security.
475120	476120	Okay.
476120	480120	Um, I guess I stealthily sneak the path that she told me to do.
480120	481120	Yeah, absolutely.
481120	483800	So you can, I mean, you're just walking, there's like nobody here.
483800	484800	It's super dead.
484800	489360	You can maybe see there's like one or two lights on in the other home, the Victorian
489360	490840	home, Stacy's house.
490840	495180	Uh, but there are no lights on inside Fergie's Fergie's home.
495180	497960	And I'm, she told me to go into his house, his house.
497960	498960	Yeah.
498960	499960	They actually live in separate houses.
499960	500960	Yeah.
500960	505240	Cause I'll just go down the path and go into his unlit home.
505240	506240	Okay.
506240	514600	As you actually walk up to the door, it opens for you and immediately like, like what kind
514600	515600	of door is it?
515600	520700	Is it like a sliding like a, no, it's like a, it's like a normal door, but when it opens,
520700	523840	it's like, welcome home Ferguson.
523840	526000	This like voice comes over the top.
526000	527000	I pause.
527000	530740	Do I hear any, anything else?
530740	531740	Nope.
531740	534580	I go into the home, I guess.
534580	535580	Yeah.
535580	537860	Walking through his house, everything is automated.
537860	540700	Like everything in this house, he's got like a smart home.
540700	544100	So like everything is super automated.
544100	546440	The like, everything looks super nice.
546440	547940	Everything's really minimalistic.
547940	548940	Okay.
549180	550180	I realize that everything's automated.
550180	554900	I want to go like outside and try to find the breaker or something for the house and
554900	556860	just like turn all the, you know, power off.
556860	557860	So yeah.
557860	558860	Yeah.
558860	559860	You can do that.
559860	560860	All right.
560860	561860	Easily.
561860	562860	I do that.
562860	563860	And then I go back to that door and walk in.
563860	564860	Okay.
564860	567020	I assume that you left it like cracked so that you could get back in.
567020	568020	Right.
568020	569020	Yeah.
569020	571300	You go in and everything's off.
571300	572300	Cool.
572300	574100	Completely dark inside.
574100	576820	And where did she tell me he would be?
576820	581260	She told you that the best spot would be upstairs.
581260	586140	Just go upstairs and get into his room and hide in the closet.
586140	591240	And he's going to be drunk or high or both when he comes home and he'll just pass the
591240	595660	fuck out in bed and just put a bullet in him and leave as soon as you can.
595660	596660	Okay.
596660	598500	I don't think I want to shoot him.
598500	601940	I'm going to grab, stabbing him is seems pretty hard.
601940	602940	It's really intimate.
602940	603940	Yeah.
603940	604940	I don't want to do that either.
607340	608340	Maybe.
608340	609340	Do you want to be inside Ferguson?
609340	611340	Do I want to be inside Ferguson?
611340	612340	Yeah.
612340	613340	If you're going to stab him.
613340	614340	No.
614340	615340	Uh, let's see.
615340	619540	Does he have some sort of like chemicals or something like if he's going to be drunk and
619540	622860	pass out, I could just like suffocate him or something.
622860	623860	Yeah, absolutely.
623860	624860	Uh, roll.
624860	627600	Um, what did, what is your search?
627600	629220	You're not like under duress, I guess.
629220	633740	I mean, you'd be, you'd be stressed out, but with a 40 you can for sure find it.
633740	635980	It's a 12.
635980	637300	Hell yeah.
637300	641940	So going through, you actually find, um, what do you want to find?
641940	643660	I want to, uh, I don't know.
643660	644660	Like chloroform.
644660	645660	Yeah.
645660	652440	I'm like, that's easy, but no, that's who, why would he have that now?
652440	653440	I don't know.
653440	655420	What do you mix to make mustard gas?
655420	656940	They did it in King of the Hill once.
656940	657940	I'm on a list now.
657940	660460	I just Googled mustard gas ingredients.
660460	664260	I did mustard gas mixture.
664540	671940	Apparently you just need garlic, onions and mustard.
671940	672940	Bleach and ammonia.
672940	673940	Okay.
673940	674940	Yeah.
674940	675940	He's definitely got those things.
675940	676940	Cool.
676940	677940	Yeah.
677940	678940	I do that.
678940	679940	Um, and I get like a towel.
679940	680940	Towel.
680940	681940	Yeah.
681940	682940	And I'm going to get the bleach and ammonia.
682940	686420	I'm not going to mix it together until he's there because I don't want to kill myself
686420	689700	because I'm pretty sure it's like pretty easy to do.
689700	690700	Okie doke.
690700	694220	And I take those upstairs to his room and hide in the closet.
694220	695220	All right.
695220	703340	So when you walk into Ferguson's room, uh, the lights are off, but there are candles
703340	704340	lit.
704340	712020	Uh, one candle on either side of the bed and by the candle light, you can see a woman in
712020	718500	bed wear laying on top of the sheets, but you know that this woman is not Stacy.
718500	723900	And this is an older woman, probably at least a generation older than you and Fergie.
723900	733700	And when she sees you, uh, uh, you're not, you're, you're not, uh, you're not, you're
733700	734700	not Fergie.
734700	735700	Who are you?
735700	736700	What?
736700	737700	I am.
737700	738700	I'm not.
738700	739700	I'm contention PD.
739700	740940	Oh, okay.
740940	741940	Is everything okay?
741940	742940	Is Ferguson okay?
742940	748860	Well, I got a call that some, something mysterious was happening in his house.
748860	751340	Somebody broke in or something.
751340	752340	What are you doing here?
752340	753780	Did you break into the house?
753780	756100	No, no, I'm here to meet Ferguson.
756100	757980	I'm you're not his wife.
757980	760900	No, I'm, I'm not.
760900	761900	Who are you?
761900	762900	I'm Joan.
762900	763900	Joan.
763900	764900	What?
764900	765900	Joan Robin.
765900	766900	Are you his mistress?
766900	773000	Uh, no, it's more of a, I was told I'm okay.
773000	783780	My boy Bruce is partners with Ferguson and he told me, this is embarrassing, but he told
783780	788700	me he would pay me a million dollars to wait for him and sleep with him.
788700	793180	That way he could, you know, he could rib his business partner about sleeping with his
793180	797220	mother and a million dollars is a million dollars, right?
797220	798980	I completely understand.
798980	800380	It's a good round number.
800380	802100	It can be used for many purposes.
802100	803940	I think you've got two options here.
803940	804940	The best option.
804940	807540	I think it's best that you leave right now.
807540	808900	What's the second option?
808900	814700	I give you my gun and when Ferguson walks in the door, you shoot him.
814700	815700	Wait, what?
815700	816700	You heard me.
816700	817700	Why?
817700	821500	You won't get a million dollars, but I can promise you a little money if you'll do it.
821500	823540	I can't tell you all the details.
823540	826780	The less, you know, the better, but go ahead and roll persuade.
826780	828220	What's your persuade skill?
828220	829220	70.
829220	835140	Oh, you did it's a 24.
835140	842720	She looks at you and she says, Hmm, you know, no one knows that I was going to be here tonight.
842720	850020	And if Ferguson is out of the picture, my son would take complete control of the company.
850020	852740	It sounds like it would benefit you quite a bit.
852740	855500	How much extra are we talking on top here?
855500	856500	500?
856500	858420	Yeah, I'll give you half a mil.
858420	859820	Do you have a gun?
859820	861420	I do.
861420	864740	Is it your like police officers thought pistol?
864740	867900	It is, but uh, it's your service pistol.
867900	868900	Shit.
868900	871980	I'm not a, I never claimed to be a great police officer.
871980	872980	Okay.
872980	873980	You know what?
873980	879100	I'm going to go ahead and roll, roll law for me real quick and we'll see if you were smart
879100	882060	enough to bring a different gun.
882060	883060	I wasn't.
883060	884060	Okay.
884060	885060	Yeah.
885060	886540	You've got your service pistol.
886540	890340	Let me search the house to see if he's got a weapon again.
890340	891340	Yeah.
891340	894780	Your search roll from earlier, we'll have it, you know, go over and you can definitely
894780	895780	find it.
895780	896780	Okay.
896780	897780	So I find his like revolver.
897780	898780	Okay.
898780	900580	You give it to her.
900580	901580	Here's the deal.
901580	905900	I'm going to wait in the closet so that you don't get any funny ideas and I've got my
905900	907340	service pistol on me.
907340	912860	I trust you to do this, but I'll be here just, you know, in case anything bad happens more
912860	914660	for your safety than anything.
914660	917460	And then I opened the closet, give her a wink.
917460	923340	As you're about to walk into the closet, as you give her a wink, you both hear a car pull
923340	925720	up to the house.
925720	932280	And if you go to the window and look, you would see a white 15 passenger van with the
932280	938740	words Jesus Christ ministries in all caps painted on the side.
938740	946100	It pulls in to this beautiful, pristine circle drive in front of the house and the van is
946100	952560	pulling a white trailer that also says Jesus Christ ministries in all caps, a big trailer
952560	954420	on the back of the van.
954420	957460	This beautiful man gets out of the passenger side of the van.
957460	961500	He has perfect hair, perfect teeth, perfect jawline.
961500	966220	He's wearing the fuck out of a bright white suit with a red Rose pinned perfectly to his
966220	967220	lapel.
967220	970380	It is your brother Ferguson beans.
971020	978720	He clicks a button on his keys and as he walks toward his home, the ground around the van
978720	985740	and trailer begins to move and shift and the entire vehicular ensemble is transported below
985740	992760	ground on some crazy futuristic elevators of sorts as the driveway closes back up with
992760	996740	no evidence the van or trailer ever sat there.
996740	998260	That's pretty cool.
998260	1001340	Thank you.
1001340	1004500	And then you, uh, go back in the room and hop in the closet.
1004500	1005500	I hop in the closet.
1005500	1007380	I tell her, you know what to do?
1007380	1008540	Just however you see fit.
1008540	1011980	I don't know if you want to do it just as soon as he walks in or if you want to let
1011980	1015940	him get in the room, but just do it and you know, we'll figure it out.
1015940	1018700	Uh, I'll help you out once the deed is done.
1018700	1019700	Okay.
1019700	1027500	I also want to bring the ammonia and bleach into the closet.
1027500	1034180	Keith, you are standing in the closet, holding these things, looking around.
1034180	1042700	It's pitch black and you hear the door open and shut and then you hear your brother holler
1042700	1043700	upstairs.
1043700	1046860	Joan, is the power out?
1046860	1051020	You hear a very scared Joan Robin calling back.
1051020	1053500	Uh, yes, I don't know what it was.
1053500	1055020	Must've been the storm.
1055020	1056020	Sure.
1056020	1057020	Why not?
1057540	1061740	Let's set the mood, right?
1061740	1062740	You can hear it.
1062740	1063740	It's pouring.
1063740	1064740	Yeah.
1064740	1065740	Oh, I don't know.
1065740	1069220	And you're in, in your, your, your, your feet are wet or whatever.
1069220	1070220	I guess.
1070220	1071220	I don't know.
1071220	1072860	Your feet are wet from the wet grass.
1072860	1073860	Spooky.
1073860	1074860	Yeah.
1074860	1075860	That's so scary.
1075860	1077540	This is a horror podcast.
1077540	1078540	Remember?
1078540	1084780	Uh, your feet are way ASMR podcast.
1084780	1095860	And, um, as Keith walk, as, uh, okay, so, uh, Ferguson walks, you can hear him coming
1095860	1102140	up the, coming up the stairs and, um, the door swings open and you hear a shot and you
1102140	1107700	hear a scream and you hear another shot and you hear a different scream and you hear another
1107700	1112060	shot and another shot and another shot.
1112060	1114060	And then you just hear crying.
1114060	1115700	Is it a female crying?
1115700	1120420	It sounds like Joan crying.
1120420	1121420	I opened the door.
1121420	1127700	When you opened the door, she immediately, uh, swings the pistol in your direction and
1127700	1133180	then like, uh, puts it on, drops it on the ground and is just frantic and she's freaking
1133180	1139700	out and you see your older brother in this beautiful white suit, Rose on his lapel looking
1139700	1140880	fresh as hell.
1140880	1148020	But the Rose is not the only red part of his outfit now as he is just completely riddled
1148020	1153100	with holes from his own gun.
1153100	1162700	She runs to you and she wraps her arms around you and she's like, I didn't, I didn't think
1162700	1166700	it would, I didn't, I need you to roll a sanity check.
1166700	1167700	Yeah.
1167700	1168700	Yeah.
1168700	1171300	I rolled a 45 and my current sanity is 24.
1171300	1172300	Okay.
1172300	1178420	So for convincing a stranger to kill your brother and then seeing your older brother's
1178420	1185180	dead body, uh, on a failure, I'm going to go ahead and have you roll a D six, three.
1185180	1186720	All right.
1186720	1187720	Lose three sanity.
1187720	1188720	Where are you at?
1188720	1189720	21.
1189720	1190720	Bringing point is 20.
1190720	1191720	Oh boy.
1191720	1192720	Yeah.
1192720	1195900	So you are kind of losing it, right?
1195900	1196900	You just start crying.
1197100	1201300	I think probably, you know, you guys are just crying in each other's arms.
1201300	1205420	I cry for, you know, a couple of minutes and then I kind of snapped back to it.
1205420	1211340	I'm like, Hey, okay, just take a deep breath, lay back, lay on the bed and then I'm going
1211340	1215180	to think of how to clean all this up.
1215180	1219280	Uh, I think I saw some cleaning stuff in the, in the closet while I was in there.
1219280	1222500	Just give me a second and we can clean this up and we'll figure out what to do with the
1222500	1223500	body.
1223500	1224500	Okay.
1224500	1225500	Okay.
1225500	1226500	Okay.
1227100	1231220	She just kind of like sits at the end of the bed and with her head in her hands.
1231220	1232220	Okay.
1232220	1233220	I go back into the closet.
1233220	1235260	I get the bleach and ammonia.
1235260	1239580	Maybe I brought like a little cup with me or something to mix it up, pour them in there.
1239580	1245860	I'm like, put my shirt up over my face.
1245860	1246860	Great ventilation.
1246860	1247860	Yeah.
1247860	1250620	Um, and then I was probably gonna hurt my hands, but whatever.
1250820	1256180	I get the rag and I put it in the mixture and I bring it out and walk over to Joan.
1256180	1257180	Yeah.
1257180	1260180	This seems like a great thing to clean blood up with.
1260180	1262100	Look at me real quick.
1262100	1264100	Yeah.
1264100	1267740	She's not in any a state of mind to think about anything.
1267740	1273380	So she just kind of looks up at you and I take my right hand with the mixture.
1273380	1279620	I put it up on her face, grab the back of her head, like with my arm and just hold it
1279620	1280620	there.
1280620	1281620	Uh, okay.
1281620	1282900	Let's do a strength contest.
1282900	1286660	Her strength is 45.
1286660	1287660	What is yours?
1287660	1288660	55.
1288660	1289660	All right.
1289660	1296660	So whoever goes highest without going over shitting ass, shitting ass, whatever that
1296660	1297660	means.
1297660	1298660	Well, I know what it means.
1298660	1299660	It means a ass that poops.
1299660	1300660	Yeah.
1300660	1301660	Not a good one.
1301660	1302660	It's a, but the poops.
1302660	1303660	Yeah.
1303660	1306900	So I missed, you missed as this is happening.
1306900	1313580	She fights you and she can get her hand in between her mouth and nose and the towel that
1313580	1314580	you're using.
1314580	1316440	And she starts yelling.
1316440	1324460	She's like, why, why I did what you asked to go ahead and roll again.
1324460	1325460	What'd you get?
1325460	1326460	21.
1326460	1327460	I got 24.
1327460	1328460	Oh yeah.
1328460	1329460	Attaboy.
1329460	1330460	Describe what happens.
1330460	1333660	Why did we just cheer you killing an innocent woman?
1333660	1334660	Well I guess not.
1334660	1335660	She's a murderer.
1335660	1336660	Well, are you?
1336660	1340900	I don't know at this point anymore.
1340900	1341900	Okay.
1341900	1344860	So I ripped the towel off her face.
1344860	1346580	I'm like, Oh my God, I'm sorry.
1346580	1351900	I just, I saw you kill my, or I saw my dead brother and I just started to freak out.
1351900	1357700	And then she puts her hand down and looks at me and I put it on her face and I hold
1357700	1364860	her down, like get on like on top of her on the bed and I hold it over her face until
1365060	1366620	she stops fighting back.
1366620	1375980	She's just screaming and squirming, but you hold down until she goes limp, roll sanity.
1375980	1376980	I do not pass.
1376980	1377980	Yeah.
1377980	1382420	So you just killed a woman covering up the murder that you made her do.
1382420	1383420	Right.
1383420	1385140	But also I do want to do one last thing.
1385140	1386220	Can I do that?
1386220	1390740	I want to, you know, she's on the bed, passed out or whatever.
1390740	1395100	I want to take like my, I think I have like a handkerchief or something.
1395100	1400060	I want to take the gun, put it in her hand and put it up to her head and shoot so that
1400060	1401500	it looks like she killed herself.
1401500	1402500	Okay.
1402500	1409620	I'm going to say that you're just in this weird state of like shock and determination
1409620	1415460	while you carry out this ice fucking cold task.
1415460	1424020	And she took his gun, shot him five times and then turned the gun on herself.
1424020	1426300	And that's what you've made it look like.
1426300	1427780	Yeah.
1427780	1429900	I need you to roll.
1429900	1434780	Let's just go D4 honestly, cause it's not as bad as, uh, you know, there's no tie there
1434780	1435780	I guess.
1435780	1436780	That's a three again.
1436780	1437780	All right.
1437780	1438980	Lose three sanity down to 18.
1438980	1441300	That is past my breaking point as well.
1441300	1442300	All right.
1442300	1443300	And what's your power?
1443300	1444300	10.
1444300	1445300	Okay.
1446140	1447140	I'm doing crazy.
1447140	1448140	Yes you are.
1448140	1449140	For good reason.
1449140	1450140	I'd say.
1450140	1451140	Yeah.
1451140	1452140	But it was all for the money.
1452140	1453140	I did it all for the money.
1453140	1454740	All for the nookie.
1454740	1457740	So as you complete this task, you're freaking out.
1457740	1460780	You've just lost six sanity within five minutes.
1460780	1465060	So you're losing your goddamn mind.
1465060	1472980	However, as you're walking away, you see that Ferguson is wearing that watch that you remember
1472980	1479380	from so long ago, your father giving him, I take my hanky and I take that watch off
1479380	1480380	of him.
1480380	1481380	Where do you put it?
1481380	1483820	On is probably not a good answer in my pocket.
1483820	1485840	So I wrap it up in the handkerchief, put it in my pocket.
1485840	1491300	When you take the watch off of Ferguson with this handkerchief, you see that the face of
1491300	1492880	the watch is blank.
1492880	1496040	There's nothing on it, which is odd for a watch.
1496040	1501380	And when you slip it into your pocket, it feels like your consciousness is changing
1501380	1506940	the channel and you begin to phase out of your reality and you seem to be somewhere
1506940	1508420	else entirely.
1508420	1514780	You feel wet grass and dirt on your fingers and you were looking at a door in the ground
1514780	1521960	like a sealed metal door that was mostly buried was.
1521960	1525460	And on the door is an inscription, three lines.
1525460	1539120	It says, here lies the beans, scientists beyond measure, saviors of the world.
1539120	1540120	Where do you want to end up?
1540120	1541120	What do you mean?
1541120	1544620	Like where would you go after all of this?
1544620	1548700	I do want to do like a quick, obviously I want to put like the chemicals and shit back
1548700	1551260	where I found them, wipe them down.
1551260	1556220	Anything that I touched, I want to wipe down so that I can't be associated back to being
1556220	1557220	here.
1557220	1558220	Sure.
1558220	1559220	I'm going to leave the bodies and shit where they are.
1559220	1562020	Cause you know, I guess I'll just walk back to that tunnel.
1562020	1563020	Okay.
1563020	1566220	Do I have her phone number or should I, I don't really know where I am.
1566220	1572100	So I guess go back to that tunnel and then find my way back to, um, I guess my hotel
1572100	1573100	motel.
1573100	1574100	Hotel motel.
1574100	1575100	Okay.
1575940	1581700	Basically what we see as the audience is once you put that watch in your pocket, you're
1581700	1588720	basically somewhere else in your eyes as you begin cleaning up, making sure that the scene
1588720	1593980	of the crime looks exactly how it should and that your fingerprints are gone and that any
1593980	1597620	idea that there was a third person there is gone.
1597620	1601420	And we see you get into the tunnel and walking through the tunnel and your eyes are still
1601420	1607580	just, you know, kind of glazed over as you, um, not only have lost so much sanity from
1607580	1613960	doing and seeing what you just did and saw, but also it's almost like you are seeing that
1613960	1618820	feeling of being at this place with this door that's buried in the ground.
1618820	1624280	The whole time you're doing that stuff, you're just like halfway there, halfway here, and
1624280	1630040	then cut to you laying in bed at hotel motel, but you still have that watch in your pocket
1630040	1631040	in the handkerchief.
1631040	1633240	Do I have like a safe in this hotel motel?
1633240	1634240	Yeah.
1634240	1636640	Still wrapped in the handkerchief, stick that in the safe.
1636640	1638640	And as the safe door closes...
1638640	1640240	Do I have the same look in my eyes?
1640240	1641240	No.
1641240	1642240	You're back.
1642240	1643240	I'm back.
1652240	1659280	John, you just successfully made 5 million dollars by selling cocaine to a random, handsome
1659280	1666420	stranger named the Duke, paid him a grand to tell you Marvin Glass buys from him in
1666420	1673000	bulk, and paid 8 of your cousins 10 grand and a 24 pack of keystone light, to which
1673000	1677880	they each took a petty more sky shot and headed off into the night.
1677880	1685160	Drew walks up and says, John, I want to, I want to thank you, and kind of sits you down.
1685160	1693200	He grabs his, uh, his briefcase and he says, I thank you for making all of this money with
1693200	1694200	me.
1694200	1695200	This is amazing.
1695200	1699320	I thank you for showing me how to shoot a gun.
1699320	1702580	Yeah, actually about that, that's what I wanted to bring up.
1702580	1707080	And I point my gun at him and I'm like, can you give me that gun back now?
1707080	1708080	Yeah.
1708080	1710280	Let's pass it over real slow.
1710280	1714280	He passes it over and he's like, oh, that's okay.
1714280	1715280	Sorry, man.
1715280	1719000	Uh, I'm a man of means now and I can't afford to take any kind of risks.
1719000	1720000	No, that's fine.
1720000	1721000	That's fine.
1721000	1722000	Mostly you are too, dude.
1722000	1726480	You know, that's how you got to start looking at the world with suspicion and hate and,
1726480	1730600	and fear for people who aren't as good as you because they're not as rich.
1730600	1732800	Oh, that's what the rich man gets to do.
1732800	1735480	Oh, well then can I have that gun back?
1735480	1739040	No, buddy, you gotta have a gun to make that one work.
1739040	1740040	Okay.
1740040	1741040	All right.
1741040	1742760	Well, mostly I wanted to thank you for your friendship.
1742760	1743760	You too, man.
1743760	1744760	You know what, Drew?
1744760	1746880	I think you are my best friend on the force.
1746880	1747880	Yeah.
1747880	1749680	Case an idiot and Clark's real uptight.
1749680	1750680	Yeah.
1750680	1751680	Well, you're my best friend in life.
1751680	1752680	So.
1752680	1753680	Yeah.
1753680	1754680	Hey, hey.
1754680	1755680	Cool, man.
1755680	1756680	But, uh, I am gonna leave.
1756680	1757680	That's cool.
1757680	1758680	Yeah.
1758680	1759680	Get the fuck out of here, man.
1759680	1760680	And I think I'm gonna bail.
1760680	1761680	I think I'm out.
1761680	1762680	You're out?
1762680	1763680	Yeah.
1763680	1770520	I think I'm gonna get a little, uh, a little spot, you know, and, and maybe north, I don't
1770520	1771520	know, maybe south.
1771520	1772520	All right.
1772520	1779400	But Drew, I mean, we're out when it's over, but you're the fucking glue that keeps our
1779400	1780880	sticky paper together.
1780880	1784420	And our sticky paper is the, the, the fucking Contention PD.
1784420	1788140	You're the goddamn peanut butter to our jelly, man.
1788140	1794320	And I'm the jelly in Clark and, uh, Clark, Clark and Keith are the pieces of bread.
1794320	1797440	Like, we need you, Drew.
1797440	1798440	Contention needs you.
1798440	1800680	We gotta save this fucking town, man.
1800680	1804720	And then we can go to Florida or wherever else people go.
1804720	1807760	Mexico, I guess.
1807760	1811760	Well, maybe you're right.
1811760	1814860	I'll see you around, John.
1814860	1822640	And he, uh, takes his briefcase and he gets into his car, heads down the long, long driveway
1822640	1824520	that you have out to your county road.
1824520	1826560	What do you want to do?
1826560	1827560	You're alone at home.
1827560	1830200	Is there anything you want to take care of before you call tonight?
1830240	1832080	Yeah, what's my willpower at?
1832080	1833080	How tired am I?
1833080	1834080	I did a bump, right?
1834080	1835280	I think so, yeah.
1835280	1837720	Your willpower should be at 12.
1837720	1838720	Okay.
1838720	1840920	I want to kill Keith Vigna.
1840920	1844840	All right, let's do this.
1844840	1845840	What do you do?
1845840	1846840	How do you prep?
1846840	1851760	No, honestly, I think like what I would do is just like call Keith and leave some real
1851760	1856000	drunk angry voicemails as I just pounded fucking keystones.
1856000	1858080	Do you want to leave a voicemail for Keith Vigna?
1858080	1859640	Yeah, I do.
1859960	1860960	Is it ringing?
1860960	1861960	Yeah.
1861960	1862960	Is it ringing?
1862960	1863960	Yeah.
1863960	1864960	What's his voicemail sound like?
1864960	1865960	Okay.
1865960	1866960	Yeah.
1866960	1867960	Bring, bring, bring, bring.
1867960	1876520	Hey, I'm a fucking idiot.
1876520	1878440	Leave your number at the beep.
1878440	1879440	Beep.
1879440	1883000	Keith, it's John Lee Pettymore.
1883000	1887560	I got $5 million now, motherfucker, and I'm going to kick your ass.
1888560	1890800	Stupid piece of shit.
1890800	1893800	Messing with my smoky DVDs, you goddamn bandit.
1893800	1896080	I'm the richest man in the world.
1896080	1900560	I'm going to stick a boot up your ass and then I'm going to fucking marry the turd that
1900560	1902640	comes out of that ass.
1902640	1903640	Let's delete all this.
1903640	1906400	No, I think that is gold.
1906400	1912320	I'm going to keep yelling about $5 million and then something about a turd coming out
1912320	1914320	of his ass.
1914320	1918760	So I'm pretty, I'm pretty tired from the events of this evening.
1918760	1921960	So I slam three more celebratory Keystone lights.
1921960	1926480	I do another line just to get me, you know, put a little pep in my step while I brush
1926480	1928680	my teeth and stuff.
1928680	1935760	And I send Keith Vigna a text message that just says, I know, love it.
1935760	1939840	I kind of spent some time, as I'm a wealthy man now, I have a fortune to protect.
1939840	1945000	So I am a little bit nervous about all these, these monsters and ghouls and entities that
1945000	1947720	have descended upon my town.
1947720	1951160	Got a lot more stake in this place now.
1951160	1953160	I don't like it.
1953160	1956000	Now you got to protect your town now.
1956000	1957000	You could own this town.
1957000	1964240	Who knew that with such fabulous wealth would come such immense responsibility.
1964240	1969680	Now that was not the idea of wealth as it was advertised to me, John Lee Pettymore.
1969720	1974600	A rich man has no troubles friend.
1974600	1979240	Certainly not supposed to be beset by goddamn supernatural horrors.
1979240	1980240	Caught at night?
1980240	1981240	Yeah.
1981240	1988040	John's gonna sweep up his smokey DVDs and put one in director's cut, fall asleep, smoking
1988040	1994960	a joint on his couch, dreaming of his millions, but also of terrible monsters.
1994960	2001160	So John is asleep on the couch with the butt of a joint in his mouth, lit in this cluttered
2001160	2005680	mess of a living room by the DVD menu screen of Smokey and the Bandit.
2005680	2011460	The night sky is beginning to turn bright, but the sun has yet to peak over the horizon.
2011460	2016160	It is early on this cold December morning and the air smells crispy.
2016160	2021640	A thin layer of fog hangs just above the dewy grass on John Lee Pettymore's property.
2021920	2026040	John, you wake up abruptly to the sound of two gunshots.
2026040	2027040	What do you do?
2027040	2028580	I scramble for my pistol.
2028580	2031200	You scramble it for your pistol, find it.
2031200	2034480	And I get, you know, behind some cover, but I peek out a window.
2034480	2036420	I try to look for where the shots are coming from.
2036420	2042320	When you peek out of a window, you can see that outside of your house is a woman holding
2042320	2046320	hostage, the Pettymore cousins and Drew Andrews.
2046320	2050000	She is wearing jeans with a white shirt and a leather jacket.
2050000	2055580	She is gaunt with crazy hair and enormous thick glasses that make her already large
2055580	2057740	eyes look even bigger.
2057740	2064300	Six Pettymore boys and Drew are on their knees with their hands behind their backs.
2064300	2069320	Their mouths are duct taped and most are bleeding from some part of their body.
2069320	2074040	This is even more apparent as all seven of them have been stripped of their shirts.
2074080	2080920	The other two Pettymore cousins are also bound and shirtless, but they are face down about
2080920	2085720	twenty feet away from the group, and each has a puddle of blood growing from where their
2085720	2087240	heads landed.
2087240	2091240	This woman has a pistol nuzzled into the back of Drew's head.
2091240	2099640	Officer Pettymore, your presence is requested please.
2099640	2103760	So John Lee Pettymore IV nearly shits himself.
2103760	2112880	But he mutters, mo money mo problems, and then he scrambles to the door and he cracks
2112880	2113880	it open.
2113880	2115400	I know her, right?
2115400	2119400	You recognize her immediately as the woman you had the interaction with in the hotel
2119400	2120400	motel.
2120400	2124600	So I crack open the door and I shout, I'm here, what do you want?
2124600	2129620	Drop your gun, or I'll send your friend's brains through his toothy mouth.
2129620	2134540	It's drop, I drop my, I set it outside where she can see.
2134540	2135540	It's drop.
2135540	2136860	Come on out with your hands up.
2136860	2137860	I come out.
2137860	2141100	Alright, here's the deal John.
2141100	2142500	You know who I work for.
2142500	2143500	Yeah.
2143500	2144900	Do you know what he wants?
2144900	2146860	He wants the gun John.
2146860	2147860	Oh.
2147860	2150340	He wants the gun?
2150340	2151340	Not your gun.
2151340	2152340	No, I know.
2152340	2154240	He wants the other gun.
2154240	2155860	You killed two Pettymores.
2155860	2157980	Well they tried to run away from me.
2157980	2160100	I don't like it when people run away.
2160100	2164820	Well that was foolish of them considering the circumstances.
2164820	2171860	I still probably hate you forever, but I see what you done and why you did it.
2171860	2178660	Listen, your boss can have that gun when this is all said and done, but I don't particularly
2178660	2181740	think that's what he needs.
2181740	2183980	Now he wants to get his boys back, right?
2183980	2185540	Well yeah, I mean.
2185540	2189060	Or in another way of speaking, he wants to get his boys back, right?
2189060	2190060	Yeah.
2190060	2191060	Yeah.
2191060	2195060	Well I want to get my town back right, and I think maybe we can help each other in that
2195060	2196060	regard.
2196060	2201460	I think we kind of want the same thing, so what do you need?
2201460	2205380	You can have that gun, but I don't think that's really...
2205380	2206380	Let's talk about...
2206380	2209500	You can have that gun, but I think you might find some...
2209500	2210500	What do you need?
2210500	2214820	John, I am middle management at best.
2214820	2217620	I was sent here to collect the gun.
2217620	2223300	If you don't have it, then I'm supposed to bring something back as collateral, you know,
2223300	2225060	until you bring it.
2225060	2226060	So uh...
2226060	2227060	Alright.
2227060	2228060	Hey, wait.
2228060	2229060	I don't have the gun.
2229060	2230420	I mean it's down at the station.
2230420	2232820	But why don't you bring me as collateral?
2232820	2233820	What?
2233820	2234820	Bring me to your boss.
2234820	2236580	I'd like to talk to him.
2236580	2237580	Uh, wait.
2237580	2239340	The gun is just at the station?
2239340	2240340	No.
2240340	2242540	That's what you just said.
2242540	2246340	Yeah, to trick your dumb ass.
2246340	2254820	I don't typically roll, but I'm going to go ahead and roll real quick.
2254820	2258260	This is all my own doing.
2258260	2260140	Yeah, okay.
2260140	2266300	You're not going to tell me what the result of that roll is?
2266300	2270700	We're going to need that gun then, if you have it.
2270700	2271700	That's all we want.
2271700	2272700	We don't need you.
2272700	2273700	We just want the gun.
2273700	2274700	He wants the gun.
2274700	2275700	I'm going to bring him the gun.
2275700	2283000	If not, I'll go ahead and, you know, if you can bring the gun, then that would be great.
2283000	2285100	If you could go get it now, that'd be better.
2285100	2287380	For me personally, I don't like being here.
2287380	2289340	I'd rather go back to the city.
2289340	2290340	So...
2290340	2291340	Alright, alright.
2291340	2293980	Can I deliver the gun to him?
2293980	2294980	Or I...
2294980	2295980	Yes.
2295980	2296980	Can I come with you?
2296980	2297980	Sure.
2297980	2298980	Alright.
2298980	2300980	That's what I want to do.
2301620	2303620	Jesus Christ, was it so hard?
2303620	2305100	Let's go get the gun.
2305100	2307820	Lady, you killed two of my cousins.
2307820	2310820	Well, they tried to run away from me when I had a gun.
2310820	2316060	Like I said, I understand, but I'm still pissed at you.
2316060	2317860	Were they your favorite cousins?
2317860	2319060	I mean, how many do you have?
2319060	2320380	Yes, Edward was.
2320380	2324260	Well, my third favorite, anyway.
2324260	2327980	Did the other Patty Moore's kind of look up and they're like, what?
2327980	2335060	And I wink at Jonathan like, you know me, you're my number one.
2335060	2337580	He smiles through tears.
2337580	2343020	Edward was his brother.
2343020	2344500	Sad day for the Patty Moore's.
2344500	2346500	We're all like brothers, so it's fun.
2346500	2348100	So let's go to the station.
2348100	2349260	Yeah, we'll get the gun.
2349260	2350260	Right now.
2350260	2352580	If you can introduce me to your boss, I'll get you that gun.
2352580	2354060	Alright, let's go to the station.
2354060	2355060	Alright.
2355140	2360460	I think how this is going to work is she's not going to want to ever leave herself vulnerable
2360460	2364100	to you because she just killed two of your cousins.
2364100	2368500	So first she's going to let the cousins all go.
2368500	2369940	She's going to keep a gun on Drew.
2369940	2376980	Hey, boys, there's another 24 pack and 10K in this for y'all because of what you suffered.
2376980	2377980	And I bet they could split.
2377980	2384620	Yeah, well, I figured you'd divide Edward and Aloysius's share.
2384620	2385620	Yep.
2385620	2388900	Love that that's the name you just pull out.
2388900	2390980	That's a, oh brother, we're at that reference.
2390980	2392500	It's the name he pulls out.
2392500	2393500	Perfect.
2393500	2394500	One of them.
2394500	2400340	Well, this campaign is turning into a bit of an odyssey.
2400340	2407140	So she's going to go ahead and have you and Drew drive in Drew's Mini Cooper.
2407140	2410760	And she's going to sit in the backseat with a gun pointed at both of you as you guys go
2410760	2412220	down to the station.
2412220	2418460	Lady, you might get that gun, but nobody fucks with the petty moors and lives to talk
2418460	2419460	about it.
2419460	2422140	What you've done today was unforgivable.
2422140	2426260	And there are many of us living in these Hills.
2426260	2427260	We're coming for you.
2427260	2432540	Even if I fall today, the petty moors are coming for you.
2432540	2433540	Okay.
2433540	2434620	That's fine.
2434620	2438140	And she pushes you forward.
2442220	2451620	All right.
2451620	2461020	So Clark, you are in this stone room, circular stone room with a stone table light shining
2461020	2464340	down one man sitting across from you.
2464340	2467420	He's holding this big fucker.
2467420	2473140	And then he immediately puts it down in this like container in between his legs and puts
2473140	2474780	the lid on it.
2474780	2476580	And he sits back down.
2476580	2478020	So what do you think?
2478020	2479020	Can you repeat all that?
2479020	2480020	Yeah, sure.
2480020	2487260	So when I was, when I was a young boy, no, no, Clark is probably still silent and staring
2487260	2488260	at this lug.
2488260	2489500	Who are you?
2489500	2491940	Oh, my name is Leon Simpson.
2491940	2492940	Where am I?
2492940	2494620	You are in the lair.
2494620	2498740	Well, layer is kind of a dark word, but it is technically a layer, I suppose, of the
2498740	2503860	circle of knowledge, which I believe I just inducted you into.
2503860	2509320	We have a first task for you as a new member of the circle of knowledge.
2509320	2515460	And he reaches into his pocket and he pulls out the small little plastic container and
2515460	2520340	he slides it toward you, takes a gun out of his pocket.
2520340	2522180	And it's not a normal gun.
2522180	2526120	It's a tranquilizer kind of thing in the little package that he's sliding across the table
2526120	2527120	toward you.
2527120	2531060	It's clear on top and there are a couple needles in there.
2531060	2539940	Okay, so Clark, these are filled with a very particular toxin that will make anyone obey
2539940	2542880	your will for some time.
2542880	2547540	And what we're going to need you to do is, well, I don't know if you're aware of this,
2547540	2552300	but the government isn't too happy with the situation over there in contention.
2552300	2555540	And we're going to need you to kind of get that under control.
2555540	2559380	That way we can take back control of your town.
2559380	2562860	So I'm going to need you to go back to contention.
2562860	2568140	There should be one FBI agent who is coming in the morning to take over all of the police
2568140	2570180	work in the town of contention.
2570180	2574900	I don't see any way that they're going to keep you all on based off of literally everything
2574900	2575900	that you've done.
2575900	2577860	They're watching you.
2577860	2582820	And that's one of the reasons that we're bringing you on is that literally no one will believe
2582820	2585060	a word you say at this point, honestly.
2585060	2589660	You have absolutely no credit to your name.
2589660	2592720	And that's going to really turn out in our favor, I think.
2592720	2597260	So what you're going to do is you're going to load those needles into that gun.
2597260	2602220	They shoot out this little microscopic needle that has this toxin in it.
2602220	2609060	And I need you to make sure that the FBI agent doesn't see anything funny going around in
2609060	2610060	contention.
2610060	2613820	Now, Clark, I'm going to ask you this one time.
2613820	2614820	We're brothers now.
2614820	2619220	I know you just met me and you just figured out my name, Leon Simpson.
2619220	2623700	Very good name, but I'm going to need you to trust me.
2623700	2625740	What's been going on in contention?
2625740	2631220	Well, Leon, a lot of stuff's been happening.
2631220	2632220	Tell me all about it.
2632220	2638780	There's been some black goo and people disappearing in flashes of light.
2638780	2642700	And I've been seeing things that aren't there sometimes.
2642700	2647460	And then there were FBI agents that came and they had a black bag and they told us that
2647460	2651620	we were going to have to put stuff in it to neutralize it or something.
2651620	2658660	And there was these photos from a camera with tubes and a radio that made a man a cat and
2658660	2659660	a cat a man.
2659660	2661300	So, I mean, some stuff's been happening.
2661300	2664500	It made a cat a man and a man a cat?
2664500	2665500	Mm-hmm.
2665500	2666500	What?
2666500	2667500	The man is a cat now?
2667500	2669060	He's a cat man?
2669060	2670060	Yeah.
2670060	2671060	Yeah.
2671060	2672060	Okay.
2672060	2673800	What is this ooze, though, that you speak of?
2673800	2675500	Do you see it everywhere or?
2675500	2676500	Leon, how come?
2676500	2677500	How come?
2677500	2680380	It seems like you know a lot about a lot of stuff, but you don't know anything about any
2680380	2681380	of this.
2681380	2685260	Clark, I know so much more than you could ever imagine.
2685260	2687080	So this is a test.
2687080	2688180	It's a bit of a test.
2688180	2692900	The black goo, there was a guy who was vacuuming it.
2692900	2693900	Okay.
2693900	2700060	Oh, and it made some, between you and I, a couple kids disappeared in it.
2700060	2701060	Whoa.
2701060	2702380	Haven't told anybody that.
2702380	2703380	Whoa.
2703380	2704380	Yeah.
2704380	2705700	Who was this guy who was vacuuming it?
2705700	2707740	His name was James.
2707740	2710060	James, the mononym James?
2710060	2711140	Yeah, you know him.
2711140	2712220	I do.
2712220	2715820	Are you from contention, Leon?
2715820	2716940	Is he still around?
2716940	2717940	Did you talk to him?
2717940	2722060	No, James is not, he's no longer with us.
2722060	2724100	He was in a house that blew up.
2724100	2727780	Did anyone else, wait, a house that blew up?
2727780	2730060	Yeah, there was a house that blew up.
2730060	2734380	It was, our chief Maggie Cook was in, it was her house.
2734380	2735380	Okay.
2735380	2737100	There were some other people in there.
2737100	2738100	Who was in there?
2738100	2740100	It was Maggie, and it was James.
2740100	2741180	Maggie is dead?
2741180	2746940	Maggie was dead before the house blew up, and so was James, probably.
2746940	2749100	I think the house blew up because it was booby trapped.
2749100	2750100	Booby trapped?
2750100	2751100	Yeah.
2751100	2756260	One of my partners was in there, and I think he slipped or something, and he heard a click,
2756260	2757260	and then...
2757260	2758260	Is he dead too?
2758260	2759260	No, he got out of there.
2759260	2762060	He rescued my dispatcher also.
2762060	2763060	Dispatcher?
2763060	2764060	His name is Drew.
2764060	2767780	Drew was over there because he got a call from Harold Dorsey.
2767780	2770180	Is this Harold Dorsey still with us, or?
2770180	2772420	No, I think he's dead too.
2772420	2773420	My goodness.
2773420	2774420	Okay.
2774420	2778020	Well, that's crazy.
2778020	2780180	I mean, do you guys know who did it?
2780180	2784380	Well, when you say who did it, there's a lot of its that it could be that you're asking,
2784380	2789580	but you know, I'll tell you what, no is the answer to all of them.
2789580	2790580	Okay.
2790580	2795500	Well, that's the kind of police work that we've come to expect from you all in contention,
2795500	2796500	honestly.
2796500	2800060	Well, I mean, if you had a lost dog, oh fuck, I fucked that up too.
2800060	2807540	If you needed to cross the road at a crosswalk, we could help you with that.
2807540	2808540	Wow.
2808540	2809540	Okay.
2809540	2812220	Well, this is going to be a bit more intensive than that.
2812220	2816620	This shooting an FBI agent with the needles and then telling him what to do, but basically
2816620	2820020	we're going to need you to keep them away from any of the strangeness, any of the goo
2820020	2825880	that you've seen or ooze or whatever you're calling it, and that would just be great.
2825920	2832800	You have 24 hours and then I need you to report back and we can make sure that you will be
2832800	2833800	okay.
2833800	2837160	24 hours for me to tranq the FBI agent and get them off the trail.
2837160	2838160	Exactly.
2838160	2841360	Is there a way I can get in contact with you before that 24 hours is up if I need to?
2841360	2842360	Yeah, absolutely.
2842360	2849400	And he slides a business card across and it says Leon Simpson and then it has his number
2849400	2850400	and that's it.
2850400	2851400	Nice.
2851400	2856680	Leon, that thing in that jar there, what is it?
2856680	2858680	Oh, it's a xenonimatode.
2858680	2867840	Currently we believe it is a vector from either another time, another place, or another reality.
2867840	2875320	We're not quite positive, however, it is the thing that Paul Simon found that has connected
2875320	2882880	the dots of the knowledge of the overseer, which you will attain one day within our elite
2882880	2885880	group, however that is for another time.
2885880	2892520	Basically these creatures, they have certain abilities that we have found a way to exploit
2892520	2894480	and so we need them.
2894480	2897960	We keep them around for a very specific purpose.
2897960	2900400	Actually you know what, follow me.
2900400	2906960	And he opens up the one door in this room and it opens into another stone room.
2906960	2908680	This one much larger.
2908680	2914280	This circular room is 20 yards across and has a domed ceiling.
2914280	2920080	The walls are stone and there are a handful of torches mounted to light the room.
2920080	2927840	There are six large slabs of stone, each with a couple of people laying on them, circling
2927840	2932600	a single unoccupied stone slab in the center of the space.
2932600	2939320	Each person laying down has one of those giant fucked up worm things attached to them and
2939320	2944800	many of them seem to have dead skin covering one or multiple limbs.
2944800	2950800	And there is a woman in electric blue slacks and a bright yellow cardigan walking deliberately
2950800	2957360	around to each slab, checking on each group and checking her watch.
2957360	2960620	And her back is turned to you.
2960620	2963120	When you walk into this room you're just kind of taking it all in.
2963120	2968160	This is a legitimately horrifying sight I would imagine.
2968160	2974860	Leon kind of grabs your shoulder and looks you in the eyes and he's like, this is the
2974860	2980760	chamber of the circle of knowledge and here is where we do our most important work.
2980760	2986960	You see, these brave men and women, and he motions to the people laying on the slabs
2986960	2990280	who all look very down on their luck.
2990280	2993040	One might call them homeless looking.
2993040	3001200	And he says, these fine individuals have dedicated their lives to the survival of humanity.
3001200	3003920	Have they done it willingly?
3003920	3009440	That's not necessarily the most important idea to have right now.
3009440	3017840	But yes, in many cases we have become a much, much better organization within the past couple
3017840	3025000	of years and have begun to explain to people why they're dedicating their lives before
3025000	3027920	we make them.
3027920	3032400	Obviously not you necessarily, but we're also not asking you to, you know, give up your
3032400	3035700	skin or limbs for the cause.
3035700	3038600	We want you to be one of us.
3038600	3043720	And he kind of points at him and the woman in the electric blue slacks and bright yellow
3043720	3050640	cardigan who is standing on the far side of the room with a notebook, taking notes.
3050640	3055240	Let's get you going because the timer's already started and I'd hate for the 24 hours to go
3055240	3058920	up and you know, we really like you around, we'd hate to lose you.
3058920	3068040	So as he walks you out of the room, you hear the woman say, bye Leon, and you turn back
3068040	3072080	and look and you recognize this woman.
3072080	3080720	She is cold and vacant with a big smile on her face and her hair is covering one of her
3080720	3081920	eyes.
3081920	3085440	And she says, bye Clark.
3085440	3088400	You feel a little pinch in your neck.
3088400	3091240	As I feel that pinch, I'm turning around and running toward.
3091240	3102000	You're running toward her and she begins laughing as you slowly crumble to the ground.
3102000	3108240	Clark you come to in the back of a cab, trees lined both sides of the narrow gravel road
3108240	3109840	you were bouncing down.
3109840	3115040	Looking back, you see the gravel path leads to an opening where just enough plant life
3115040	3120420	has been removed to open up space for a parking lot and a massive brick building with two
3120420	3127540	enormous smokestacks reaching up into the canopy of trees encircling this property.
3127540	3137100	There is a sign that reads, the mill on the other side of the city.
3137100	3141780	Of course Clark, thanks.
3150420	3179060	How am I the only one trying to pull over How can you have enough drowning out of the
3179060	3180060	dark?
3180060	3200740	Hello there dear listener.
3200740	3207620	It is I, your narrative Sherpa, Wolf the dog, standing self assured on this massive mountain
3207620	3208940	of information.
3208940	3214260	If you're a bit hazy on all the details of the story so far, fear not.
3214260	3221980	Go check out episode 96 for a recap of episodes 1-23 and know that you are not alone.
3221980	3227420	Much love, yours both truly and falsely, Wolf the dog.
