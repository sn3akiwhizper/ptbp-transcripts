1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,080
Howdy-doody, my spooky-poopies.

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:08,680
It's your turd-blasting, time-traveling, greasy, and parental figure wolf, the dog.

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:14,240
And I'm here to provide sustenance to all of my little baby buddies.

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,920
I'm tootin' at y'all live from 694.2 PTBP,

5
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:26,280
the city's only radio station that also doubles as a crawdaddy bio-farm on the weekends.

6
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:32,440
If we eat only the crawdaddies, what happens to all the crawmommies?

7
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:37,760
Speakin' of weird shit that I'm forced to read that makes people mildly uncomfortable,

8
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,560
this week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Kyle.

9
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,680
Remember, listener, Kyle asked for this.

10
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,280
Kyle writes,

11
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,200
To my darling wife, Steffy.

12
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,600
Hundland, Hundland.

13
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,960
Ow!

14
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,400
Cough, cough, cough.

15
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,480
Hundland, Hundland.

16
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,720
Uh... thanks for that, Kyle.

17
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,840
I hope your wife enjoyed that.

18
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,560
I know I did.

19
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,680
At certain parts, but mostly I didn't.

20
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:13,280
If you wanna write up somethin' for your guttural wolf to how,

21
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,360
tag at PretendingPod on Twitter or Instagram,

22
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,800
tag PretendingToBePeople on Facebook,

23
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:23,040
or write up a five-star review on the podcast app of your choice.

24
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,080
Screenshot them deliciousnesses and send them my way.

25
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,560
If you refuse to post on social media, but you still wanna support the show,

26
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:38,080
give us money in exchange for a whole bunch of bonus episodes,

27
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,880
access to submit NPCs and locations,

28
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,680
behind-the-scenes livestreams,

29
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,080
exclusive T-shirts,

30
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,840
and et cetera, et cetera.

31
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,760
It also helps give Zach the little bits of sausage he needs

32
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:59,160
that keep him goin' as he produces, GMs, and edits this fine show.

33
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,800
Links to all that and Wolfie's merch store are,

34
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,000
you guessed it, in the show notes.

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,360
For those just tunin' in, I'm Wolf the Dog.

36
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,720
You are listening to 694.2 PTBP,

37
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,400
and this is the news.

38
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,840
Last time, we learned about the new field producer, Julius Summers,

39
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,640
and his childhood connection to the City Action News Studios.

40
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,560
And when Julius was a child, crawlin' around gnawin' on marbles that were,

41
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,640
of course, securely fastened to the floor,

42
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:40,640
Well, back then, Cal Colorado was the frothy film of the slot bucket, my babies.

43
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,680
He was on top.

44
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,240
His trusty field camera operator, Beck Wilder,

45
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,600
sided with Julius against Cal Colorado

46
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,600
when the team was asked to follow a lead that Cal balked at.

47
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,840
Let's see if we can top that.

48
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,360
Here's a brand new rock act.

49
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:04,400
It's Alter Girl with My Life is Great and It's All My Fault.

50
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,240
And it's all my fault

51
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:12,840
Cos my life is great

52
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,480
And it's all mine

53
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:27,120
Cos my life is great

54
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,520
And it's all my fault

55
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:42,600
I never record the good jokes.

56
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,800
I swear, that's not what this podcast is about.

57
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,840
I've got a month of Bumble Premium.

58
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,880
Hell yeah, dude. Find somebody in to piss play.

59
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,120
Did they maybe give you the first month free?

60
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:58,480
No, no, no. My phone did this in my pocket while we were at brunch,

61
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,360
looking at the charge.

62
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,480
Cos I was talking to somebody and stuck my phone in my pocket while we were messaging.

63
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,800
Oh no, how much?

64
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,240
30 bucks. Could be worse.

65
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,360
That's still insane for a month.

66
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,600
That is insane for a month.

67
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,480
But I was hoping, oh wow.

68
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,080
You just made me feel fine about this, I guess.

69
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:22,240
No, actually I don't. That's almost an eighth of weed. Fuck that.

70
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,920
I was gonna hit up my person today.

71
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:31,760
And instead I have a month of Bumble Premium.

72
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,080
I guess I'm gonna have to make the most of this.

73
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,680
Yeah dude, go fucking wild on Bumble now.

74
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,080
Fucking unlimited swipes.

75
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,880
What is Bumble?

76
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,160
Bumble's the one where the women message you first.

77
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,360
Oh, okay. Got you.

78
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,880
So you never get like anything live?

79
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,760
No, no. It's all a trick.

80
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,520
I don't think they're real.

81
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:02,320
Yeah, mine was broken, I think.

82
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,560
Welcome to episode three of Pretending to Be People.

83
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,600
I could add weed, y'all.

84
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,800
Instead I might get a life partner.

85
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,320
Fuck me.

86
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,520
How's it going?

87
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,160
Oh, it's fine.

88
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,960
You know, a little miffed.

89
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,440
I've been scrolling through TikTok,

90
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,760
disappointed that Kan hasn't updated in a while.

91
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,840
City Action News, if this is your first time

92
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,880
listening to the podcast.

93
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,960
Also go back and listen to episode one.

94
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,560
If this is your first episode,

95
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,080
this is the perfect time to go back a couple episodes.

96
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,480
We only got three now.

97
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,360
This is the only time where we can say

98
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,480
just go back a couple.

99
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,680
Now is the easiest time to make sure you go back now.

100
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,480
If you're in the next episode listening for the first time

101
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,040
and you go back a couple,

102
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,840
ooh, I'd rather you went back a few.

103
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:03,440
Hey, fair point, but it's not like we're at 10.

104
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,760
It's not like we're at 10.

105
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:09,520
I don't have a fun folksy word for nine.

106
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,360
Say it like Mr. Lemon.

107
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,120
Well, I say you have to go back nine episodes.

108
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,640
Did you like that? Say it like the editor.

109
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,960
Oh, well, you'd have to go back nine episodes.

110
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,280
Was any a little weird? Vivica?

111
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,080
Oh, who was the guy who sounded weird?

112
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,320
Do you mean Jeremy?

113
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,840
Oh, the intern.

114
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,800
Oh yeah, I do.

115
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,640
Yeah.

116
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,160
Oh, speaking of Jeremy,

117
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,280
this episode starts with a shot of Jeremy

118
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,160
standing in the parking lot,

119
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,640
standing in the empty spot where the can van

120
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:44,560
just was holding a hot iced latte

121
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,840
and two energy drinks.

122
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,240
It's about now in the van that Beck remembers that,

123
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,920
oh, damn it, we forgot our drinks.

124
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,000
Damn it.

125
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,880
And he begins sprinting down the road

126
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,640
through traffic holding these three items.

127
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,480
We didn't get very far, did we?

128
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,320
We did not get very far.

129
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,160
We're stuck.

130
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,600
I said that you got pretty much trapped in gridlock

131
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,120
almost immediately.

132
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,200
So let's see the inside of this van.

133
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,720
Hey, does the city suck?

134
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:16,240
Oh, I mean, you're here at what?

135
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,320
Like 6 p.m. in the middle of downtown.

136
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,280
Shit is.

137
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,120
So?

138
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:22,960
Shit's fucked.

139
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,320
Right, and when he says, does the city suck?

140
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,360
That's actually the beginning of the TikTok.

141
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,080
He's asking the person in front of us in their car

142
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,640
that question.

143
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,480
What?

144
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,680
Does the city suck?

145
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,960
I don't think Cal Colorado would ever say those words.

146
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,800
Yeah.

147
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,040
We've only known him for two episodes,

148
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:44,040
but there's no fucking way Cal Colorado's saying that.

149
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,560
But you could try to talk him into it and scene.

150
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,040
Wait, that's at the end.

151
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,240
How do you start one?

152
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,800
Fire.

153
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,640
Fire.

154
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,000
That's why you don't yell fire in a theater

155
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,840
because they'll think it means well.

156
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,360
It's time to start.

157
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,080
Fire!

158
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:06,000
Beck is holding the phone ready to film a TikTok,

159
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,840
but he still doesn't have a clear idea

160
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,000
of what he's looking to the producer for guidance.

161
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,220
Julius is scrambling for ideas

162
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,740
and just kind of looking around

163
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:18,700
and he sees a pizza at Cal's own shop.

164
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,740
And he looks at Cal.

165
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,220
Oh my God.

166
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,060
And he looks back.

167
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:23,900
And he looks back.

168
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:24,740
Oh my God.

169
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,100
Oh my God.

170
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:29,420
Cal is blinking and smiling and here at TikTok,

171
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:30,900
so he's telling you the time.

172
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:36,900
Cal, how do you feel about eating something?

173
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:40,460
I had a sensible lunch and breakfast.

174
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:43,780
I, no, I don't think I could eat right now.

175
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,260
Just a bite or two.

176
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,500
I'm sorry, I don't know if you've noticed,

177
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,740
but I do keep my figure trim.

178
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:51,140
Then let's ask these people some questions.

179
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:53,340
And I just point to like people walking.

180
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,740
Man on the street, I love it.

181
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:58,260
You see a guy who with a massive beanie,

182
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:02,940
it's like way too big and it's drooped over his eyes almost.

183
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:06,780
He's walking like he's sitting down, but he's walking.

184
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:07,800
And-

185
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,740
I'm sorry, Zach, what?

186
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,340
He's walking like he's sitting down,

187
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,000
but he's walking.

188
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,840
So he's ass-

189
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,660
You've seen people, right?

190
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:14,500
Oh man.

191
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,260
His ass is like even with his knees.

192
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,100
Yeah, he's like-

193
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,340
Zach, what do you think walking?

194
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:22,420
He's just like squat walking

195
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:24,980
and kind of like dancing around.

196
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,260
Cal has a microphone in his face.

197
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,580
You, sir, what are you doing?

198
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:28,420
Roll, roll, roll.

199
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,460
Hey, I'm just dancing, I'm dancing.

200
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,360
And he's just kind of doing this weird,

201
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,140
like sitting dance thing, like a silly walk.

202
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,820
And he's just like, you know,

203
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,980
I like to get through the city by dancing.

204
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,180
You see these cars here?

205
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:41,900
They're stuck.

206
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,020
I'm not stuck.

207
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:43,940
I'm free.

208
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:47,140
You're never stuck if you have your legs.

209
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,980
A disturbingly ableist message.

210
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:52,740
From the Cal zone.

211
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,780
From the Cal zone.

212
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:57,420
Hey, Cal, how about instead of that,

213
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:01,700
we try like you try to dance like him with him.

214
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,740
That might be amusing.

215
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,260
He reaches out for your hand.

216
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,500
Oh, a street man.

217
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,840
Okay.

218
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,060
Cal takes his hand, but then yeah,

219
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:11,660
Cal is nailing it.

220
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,220
Cal is like athletic.

221
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,320
Awesome.

222
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,260
Cal watches this guy move and then moves like that.

223
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:23,860
The Cal zone is a thing that you had already coined

224
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,280
in your basketball days.

225
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:32,140
Well, yeah, I mean, I played some D

226
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:35,860
and when they got in the Cal zone, they got slapped down.

227
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,060
Your sign off needs to be,

228
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:40,340
and that's another slam dunk from the Cal zone.

229
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,540
That's some more hot D from the Cal zone.

230
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,020
Oh yeah.

231
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:46,380
That's a wild catchphrase.

232
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,860
Just like my basketball dance.

233
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,940
Beck stops filming and on TikTok,

234
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,860
he's doing, he's maybe adding a filter

235
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,380
and he's putting the text over the top

236
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,860
and it's when you in the Cal zone.

237
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,540
Oh, fuck yeah, dude.

238
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:00,620
That face when.

239
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:01,720
What's the song?

240
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:03,780
Whoop, there it is.

241
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:08,780
Oh, fuck yeah, whoop, there it is, whoop, there it is.

242
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,380
Before I hit send, I give it to Julius.

243
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:18,620
Julius adds, Julius looks at it and looks at Beck

244
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:22,000
like just stoked that it's perfect.

245
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
And he just adds the caption, another fresh hot Cal zone.

246
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,660
Fuck yes.

247
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,620
As soon as it's blasted out,

248
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:35,360
literally the second it posts a TikTok,

249
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,580
you get a notification on your cell phone, Julius

250
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:43,460
and Tife has hearted the message that he sent you.

251
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:44,300
Oh, the-

252
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,660
Make a TikTok, bitch.

253
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,500
Oh, right.

254
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,300
I text him back, like open the news tonight

255
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:52,360
saying that we posted a TikTok or something like that.

256
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,200
Like make-

257
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,220
Open the news tonight, saying that we posted a TikTok,

258
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,180
something like that.

259
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,480
Or something.

260
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,280
Breaking news, a new TikTok is dropped.

261
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:09,740
As you guys are all reconvened, as you were all-

262
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,120
Recalvened.

263
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,020
After you've all recalvened back in the can van.

264
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,160
Jesus.

265
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,180
Can we start the season two over?

266
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,820
I'm not feeling the can van.

267
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:35,480
You see a man running, sprinting in between two lanes

268
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,820
of traffic in the rear view mirror on the can van.

269
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:43,820
And he is holding one hot ice latte and two energy drinks.

270
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,800
And he approaches the van and he's like,

271
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,360
Okay, I got your hot ice latte.

272
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,180
They were not happy about that order, Julius,

273
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,020
but I got it funny.

274
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:04,440
He takes it and he's surprised that it is somehow

275
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,180
both very hot and very cold.

276
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,440
And here are these for you, Beck.

277
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,260
Hell yeah, man.

278
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:12,160
I almost had to go to the backups and he pets the backpack

279
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,200
that he has with him that has a bunch of extra cans

280
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,040
of energy drink.

281
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,940
And a patch with energy drink on it.

282
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:21,560
Cal has Julius's phone and he's just watching the TikTok

283
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,880
like repeatedly with a huge grin on his face.

284
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,000
Awesome.

285
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,240
And he kind of like absentmindedly notices

286
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,640
that the intern has run up and he's like,

287
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,880
and if you could get me a black coffee, please.

288
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,800
Cal, you get a text message at the exact same time

289
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,760
as Julius.

290
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,920
It's a group text between Taif, Cal and Julius.

291
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:50,500
And he says, her name is Kaylee Silver.

292
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,600
Shout out to Distant Egg Song in Houston.

293
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,440
Hey.

294
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,500
For Kaylee Silver, we'll likely meet her soon.

295
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:01,760
Kaylee Silver, it says, specifically asked for Cal

296
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:06,660
because he is a truth above all type of guy.

297
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:11,540
She grew up watching him on TV and she trusts him.

298
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:14,180
So that first thing he likes,

299
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,100
then I grew up watching you on TV.

300
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,100
That gives him pause.

301
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:17,940
Sure.

302
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:18,760
He's heard that.

303
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,900
That can go a lot of ways.

304
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,220
And as you're reading that text,

305
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,940
immediately back is Jeremy.

306
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:27,220
Whew, wowzer.

307
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,460
Yeah, that is a hot black coffee.

308
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:32,700
The quickest coffee run, I time myself, thank you,

309
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,980
that I have ever made.

310
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,180
Thankfully, because, and he points behind him.

311
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,780
The Cal zone plays sold coffee.

312
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,220
I went to the U zone.

313
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:45,060
Oh, thank you, Jeremy.

314
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,520
Cal kind of realizes what he's done.

315
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:49,540
He like realizes they're in the street and not the office

316
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,400
and gives him a big thumbs up.

317
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:55,460
And he thumbs ups back and then sprints off backwards

318
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:56,740
from where he came from.

319
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,940
He sprints backwards.

320
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:04,020
I think we found our first horror mystery.

321
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,620
I said what I said.

322
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:08,860
Yeah, and he's sitting while he does it for five seconds.

323
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:12,540
So we could talk to this weird pervert

324
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:15,500
or we could go find out what's going on

325
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,940
with backwards running, man.

326
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:23,860
Traffic moves at a snail's pace for like 15 minutes.

327
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:27,180
And then eventually it kind of opens up

328
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,140
and you guys get to your destination

329
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:31,580
in a matter of like five minutes.

330
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:35,660
It is a mid-rise, downtown in the city.

331
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,780
And on that piece of paper that you have

332
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:40,680
says apartment 836.

333
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:44,820
I pull the van up and park right in front.

334
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,900
Beck hops out and is already getting some B-roll

335
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,460
of the outside of the building.

336
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:50,580
But he's also bringing everything he's gonna need.

337
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,460
So he's got a tripod under an arm

338
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,340
and his case of camera equipment.

339
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:56,220
What's Cal doing?

340
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:59,020
What's running through his mind?

341
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,740
I was talking to this girl on Bumble

342
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,180
and we've hooked up a couple times

343
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:04,500
and she was like,

344
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,820
hey, this guy just sent me this really weird dick pic

345
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,780
and I don't know if it's like diseased or what.

346
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:12,780
And I was like, well, I kind of want to see that.

347
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,180
And she just sent it to me.

348
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,260
You did not want to see that, no.

349
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,100
Oh man.

350
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,660
Cal has a crazy life.

351
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,940
Yeah, we all make decisions.

352
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,740
I'm not sure I would have made that one.

353
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:29,060
Was that like a play of some sort?

354
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:32,740
Of like just showing off your personality early?

355
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:35,900
No, again, this is a person I've had sex with.

356
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,900
Yeah, like he could have that.

357
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,060
That's what I thought.

358
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:47,620
No, no, no.

359
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:49,860
She was like this dude sent me a dick pic

360
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,540
and it looked really weird.

361
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,820
Is it the dick pic that you sent her?

362
00:16:55,220 --> 00:17:00,220
No, I'm about to send her one to show her a normal dick.

363
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:03,020
Cool, that was a question mark.

364
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:06,660
Did you look at it again, you freak?

365
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:09,380
Oh no, she just sent a description of it.

366
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,460
Hot.

367
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,020
It's got a weird texture.

368
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,940
Sounds like Bumble Premium is worth it.

369
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:14,780
Yeah.

370
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:20,700
She's like doesn't it look like a tongue and it does.

371
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:27,700
Well, that's going to be in season two somewhere.

372
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,620
Doesn't it look like a tongue?

373
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:32,220
And it does.

374
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,380
It won't be a dick though.

375
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,580
You guys want to see this dick?

376
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:35,660
No.

377
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:36,500
Not really.

378
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,340
Good call.

379
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:41,500
I'm sorry, I'm going to pee.

380
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,660
I'm kind of bummed out by my own decisions.

381
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:46,420
Fucking idiot.

382
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,380
Why did I have taste buds?

383
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,620
Did you go to the bathroom to jerk off to that picture?

384
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:05,460
Yes.

385
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,380
That's why it took me 20 seconds.

386
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,460
Fucking pervert.

387
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,860
Where the fuck were we?

388
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:13,420
Well, I was jacking off to that dick pic in your bathroom.

389
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:15,620
Let's start with me getting out of the van doing B-roll

390
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:17,380
and you're asking Cal what he was doing.

391
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:19,300
Yeah, that's what I was doing.

392
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:22,900
I asked Cal what he was doing and then we got into that.

393
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:23,820
Julius, what are you doing

394
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:26,620
as you guys approach this mid-rise?

395
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:29,300
Julius is going to go in and wait for Beck

396
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:32,020
to get some B-roll of him hitting the eight button

397
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:32,940
on the elevator.

398
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,980
Yeah, so people know where she lives.

399
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:42,100
No, just not for this story, but for, you know,

400
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,820
you can always use B-roll.

401
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:44,980
Oh yeah, that's good.

402
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,900
Beck is always, the B-roll doesn't have to be

403
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:47,740
for that story.

404
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:50,020
Like videography is his passion

405
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:53,620
and he knows that he's always filming for stories these days

406
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,700
but he likes to keep a collection of stuff

407
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,140
he could use for art projects.

408
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:02,140
And he's just kind of like elevator button projects.

409
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:05,500
Yeah, that's why Julius was keeping him in mind.

410
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:08,580
He's like, is there anything that could be like a quick shot?

411
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,420
Oh yeah.

412
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,300
You're familiar with his YouTube page.

413
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:14,020
I had to do my research before I worked here.

414
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:17,240
Joe, when you said like you were, Beck is always filming.

415
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:20,580
I definitely pictured a John Wilson how-to situation.

416
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:21,860
It's not funny.

417
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,540
Yeah, well, I mean, he was an inspiration

418
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:27,420
as far as the idea that he's always filming stuff.

419
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,900
He inspired how-to John Wilson.

420
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,300
Who knows how or when he'll use it.

421
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:33,300
Exactly, Beck inspired John Wilson.

422
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:36,180
Beck's like hot underground YouTube,

423
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:40,100
experimental YouTube page inspired John Wilson

424
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,380
to make how-to.

425
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,640
As you guys make it to the front of the building,

426
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:47,100
the doorman sees that your city action news

427
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,340
and opens the door and lets you get in.

428
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,100
Are you sure you don't want us to have like a 10 minute

429
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,220
interaction with the doorman?

430
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,460
Where we try to get in?

431
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,500
Julius, you're in the elevator now,

432
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,900
you're on your way up to the eighth floor of this building.

433
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,920
And when the elevator door opens,

434
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:06,220
you are in a stagnant, stale hallway.

435
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:10,740
It smells like old cigarettes and Chinese food.

436
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,900
It's not a bad smell.

437
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,940
It's kind of comforting if you're me,

438
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,100
but if you're me.

439
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,440
I lived in an apartment building

440
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,660
that smelled exactly like this.

441
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,960
It's not comforting at all to Julius.

442
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,580
It's propulsive even.

443
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:27,620
He grew up with marble floors and privilege.

444
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:31,540
And the carpet in the hallways of this apartment building

445
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:36,540
is only made more timely in its interior design

446
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:40,420
by the wallpaper that lines these hallways.

447
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:43,400
It feels almost suffocating.

448
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:48,400
Apartments 809 to 814 are to the left

449
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:53,460
and then 819 to 836 are to the right.

450
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:58,060
Kaylee Silver in apartment 836 will be to the right.

451
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,180
We go to the right.

452
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,620
How do you knock on the door?

453
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:07,340
Apparently this is an important aspect of season two.

454
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:08,900
So how do you knock on the door?

455
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:12,260
Oh God that scared the shit out of me.

456
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:15,940
I get my TikTok out and hand it over to him

457
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:18,140
and I'm like, get like the surprise on her face

458
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,940
when he knocks at the door.

459
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,360
You hear the heavy breathing coming

460
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,940
from the other side of the door.

461
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,620
Cal makes this big step back.

462
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,540
Shh, is it Cal?

463
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,620
Yes ma'am, this is Cal Colorado.

464
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:37,820
Wow, okay cool.

465
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:41,080
My name is Kaylee Silver.

466
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,340
I'm in a lot of trouble.

467
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,860
Can you help me?

468
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:47,140
Well, I'd love to see what I can do ma'am.

469
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,420
Could you let us in?

470
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:51,740
Unlock, chain unlock, deadbolt unlock.

471
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:52,980
Is she saying all that?

472
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,060
As Kaylee Silver pulls the three of you

473
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:58,940
into apartment 836 and shuts the door,

474
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:01,420
this 20 or 30 something and a choker necklace

475
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:04,540
repositions a towel against the door's threshold

476
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:07,860
and your noses tell your brains to tell you why.

477
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,900
It smells like death in this apartment

478
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:13,780
and there, strewn over the armrest of the couch

479
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:17,700
is a sight that could affect your grip on reality.

480
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:22,260
You see a pair of legs and your mind fills in the rest.

481
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:25,060
I grab my phone back from you

482
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,540
so that you can get your camera out.

483
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:28,100
But there's a little bit of resistance

484
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:31,780
that Beck was getting a shot of it instinctually.

485
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:35,180
I want you guys to picture Seinfeld's apartment for this.

486
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,740
That way we know where everything is.

487
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,980
Are you familiar with the impossible geometry

488
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,100
of Cherry Siderealm?

489
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:44,480
Okay, roll grip.

490
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,980
All right, but for real, I need everyone to roll grip

491
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:53,380
which is your grip on reality.

492
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:56,180
It is directly attached to the score of power.

493
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:58,260
Power times five is gonna be your grip.

494
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,820
We're replacing the word sanity in this campaign.

495
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,260
Because we've found it problematic.

496
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:04,260
And we really like the word grip.

497
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,260
Losing your grip.

498
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,100
It's cool.

499
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,220
Yeah, we like it a lot.

500
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:11,140
Plus maybe if in some instance we have,

501
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,740
I don't know, some kind of situation in the past,

502
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,180
you could really make it old timey.

503
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,220
Oh yeah.

504
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:18,740
Oh, you could make that word anything you want.

505
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:19,860
Almost anything, yeah.

506
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:22,580
We might have an array.

507
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:24,140
It'd be really fun to do one of the 30s.

508
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:24,980
I don't know what you're planning.

509
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:25,820
Foxy.

510
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:30,060
I mean, that's more of a teens, but yeah.

511
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:31,860
You guys can play teens, whatever.

512
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:35,940
So, I need you all to roll grip.

513
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:36,780
I failed.

514
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:37,900
Beck has pretty good grip.

515
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,740
In fact, it's one of his best skills

516
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:41,780
because it's related directly to your power

517
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:42,620
which is my highest.

518
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:43,460
Yeah, exactly.

519
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,940
I rolled a 76 on a 75.

520
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:46,980
Oh.

521
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,340
Oh, fuck, dude.

522
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,720
Damn.

523
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,500
Well, Cal is an old professional

524
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,740
and he rolled 39 on a 60.

525
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:56,780
Yeah, Julius got a 62 on a 60.

526
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:58,820
Beck, you shoot the news.

527
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:00,700
This is not, you're not a police officer.

528
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,460
This is not your job.

529
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:03,660
Why are you here?

530
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:05,100
She shouldn't have called you.

531
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,180
This was just a story.

532
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:08,940
He likes to film interviews and everything was fine

533
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,460
and oh fuck, there's a body.

534
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:12,880
That was not on the docket today.

535
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:18,860
You don't have to look at her.

536
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:19,980
Julius looks.

537
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:20,820
Cal looks.

538
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,300
Beck definitely looks.

539
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,340
You're all gonna have to roll grip again

540
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:26,540
as you see there's a streak of blood

541
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:27,860
on the floor of the apartment

542
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:30,540
where Kaylee Silver clearly dragged the body

543
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:32,620
to then put her on the couch.

544
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:34,300
You notice out of the corner of your eye,

545
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:36,500
Kaylee's wincing as you all look

546
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:39,700
and see the body of another 20 or 30 something

547
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:44,200
but this corpse has been almost completely decapitated

548
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,540
by something sharp enough to get the job done

549
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:49,380
but blunt enough that some of the cuts

550
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:52,180
look more like the skin was ripped apart.

551
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:56,100
As you approach, you notice between the shoulders

552
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,680
where this poor woman's neck and throat should be

553
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,500
with blood caked all around it,

554
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,660
you can see the top of her spinal cord

555
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:07,660
and you can see right down her trachea.

556
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:11,300
Did you pass that grip check?

557
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,780
I did.

558
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:13,780
39.

559
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:15,180
I got a 92.

560
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:18,940
Beck just needed to flip into oh shit, it's real mode.

561
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:20,540
Now he's there.

562
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,380
This isn't the first time

563
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:23,860
he's had to cover terrible things.

564
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:25,100
He's seen bodies before.

565
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,020
Sure, just not unexpectedly.

566
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,620
He just wasn't ready for it.

567
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:29,540
He thought he was, yeah, this was a fluff piece.

568
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:32,660
Same for Cal except he failed this role.

569
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:36,220
He thought he was prepared after seeing the legs.

570
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:38,160
He wasn't prepared for this.

571
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,300
He vomits quietly in the hallway.

572
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:43,460
I'm gonna need you both to roll a D4.

573
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:45,540
Two.

574
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:46,360
Two.

575
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,200
One.

576
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,300
You lose two grip, Julius,

577
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,500
and Cal, you lose one grip.

578
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:54,720
Cal is taken so far back, he is out in the hallway.

579
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,880
I said he vomited quietly.

580
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:00,660
Oh, sorry.

581
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,680
How are you dealing with this, Julius?

582
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:10,620
The legs made him very uncomfortable walking in

583
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:12,260
and seeing a little bit of it.

584
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:16,400
Even worse, he's just frozen there staring at it.

585
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,000
Like, can't look away.

586
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
I think that now that Beck passed,

587
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,180
he's a little more in the moment for a second,

588
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:26,480
and he's suddenly aware that he's standing in a room

589
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,920
with a dead body and a woman saying, I didn't do it,

590
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,360
which sometimes they did did it.

591
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,160
Yeah, sometimes they did his did.

592
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,160
The most likely person to have did it

593
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,560
is the alive person in the room.

594
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,720
He's putting a little bit of distance

595
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,640
between himself and Kaylee,

596
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,960
just in case she's maybe got a knife on her currently,

597
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:43,920
even still.

598
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:47,740
Everybody roll alertness.

599
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:48,580
Fail.

600
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,080
Pass.

601
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:50,920
I failed.

602
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:54,120
Julius, you see that there's a broken beer bottle

603
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,840
under the coffee table

604
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,940
that is absolutely dripping in blood.

605
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,160
And Kaylee walks over to the kitchen

606
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,840
and leans against the countertop

607
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,400
and just turns back to you and is like,

608
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:12,960
okay, I did it, but I had to do it.

609
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,440
I did it, but I had to do it.

610
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,360
You have to trust me.

611
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,400
Julius is immediately looking over at Beck like,

612
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,000
you've got to be getting this, right?

613
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,920
She's already been in a closeup zoom

614
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:25,280
to try and get micro expressions and everything.

615
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:29,040
And she just confessed on camera, but she doesn't care.

616
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,440
Killed them all, of course.

617
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,560
It was self-defense.

618
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:37,400
She was, I don't know how to say this,

619
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,560
but she was trying to tear me apart.

620
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,320
Why?

621
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,960
Get it together, Kaylee.

622
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,360
Kaylee is a young adult.

623
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,680
She's got dirty blonde space buns

624
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:53,760
and she's wearing a pink crop top with neon green ringers

625
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,720
on the sleeves and the collar.

626
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,480
It's one of those happy bunny shirts.

627
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,840
When you say space buns, do you mean Princess Leia buns?

628
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,680
Oh, I guess kind of, but just like buns

629
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,080
that are on the top of her head, like little buns.

630
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:05,920
What makes them space?

631
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,760
Was it Xenon of the 21st century?

632
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,720
Did she have those?

633
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:14,320
You said she's mid thirties, space buns, cool crop top.

634
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,160
Yeah.

635
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,240
What's her deal?

636
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,600
She just killed somebody.

637
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,280
Yeah, but in self-defense.

638
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,760
Yeah, it's like Xenon if those pigtails

639
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,320
were like all wrapped up in buns.

640
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,200
Oh yeah, I thought she had them.

641
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,080
It's one of those happy bunny shirts from like Hot Topic

642
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:32,400
and it says, it's not your fault, I'm blaming you anyway.

643
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,240
Nice.

644
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,280
She did it on purpose.

645
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,540
That's Thomas's take.

646
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,640
She said it was in self-defense.

647
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,840
I promise.

648
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,720
Cal has gathered himself a little bit

649
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,280
and he wants to, I guess,

650
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:49,140
humant that statement or what else would I look at?

651
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,360
I want sincerity in her voice

652
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,960
and then I'm also looking for signs of a physical struggle.

653
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,400
Humant for her, forensics for the scene,

654
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,640
if anybody wants to roll.

655
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,520
Oh, fucking three.

656
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,440
Nice. Nice.

657
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,240
She seems extremely genuine.

658
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,520
I did it, but I had to do, it was self-defense.

659
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,080
I fucking promise you.

660
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:05,920
Who is she?

661
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,560
Who is she?

662
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,120
She's my best friend.

663
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:13,960
Kaylee.

664
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,480
What's her deal?

665
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,400
I'm Kaylee, she's Kaylee.

666
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,080
It's spelled differently, but we're best friends.

667
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,320
We like bonded on that.

668
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Is this what really,

669
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,240
because that's difficult podcasting.

670
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,080
Is it?

671
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,540
When we're talking about Kaylee at any moment,

672
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:29,760
it could be two different people.

673
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,760
One of them is dead.

674
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,760
Yeah, it also sounds like a great situation for farce.

675
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,240
Her name is Carolee.

676
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,560
I did what I did.

677
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,720
In the moment.

678
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,080
I think you're the one that expressed

679
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,720
that you regretted naming an NPC John

680
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,600
and a PC John in the first season.

681
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,400
Okay, but like, are we going to be talking to Kaylee

682
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,360
for another 40 episodes or just right now?

683
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,240
I think it's pretty fun.

684
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,800
Also, Luke had an elegant solution.

685
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,640
Carolee is her name.

686
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,160
Kaylee, K period Lee.

687
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,480
K dot Lee, Carole.

688
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,400
Carole is the daughter of Cal.

689
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,160
Yeah, that's her full name.

690
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,360
If we're going on those rules.

691
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,240
Yeah, her name is Kaylee.

692
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,600
Spelled how?

693
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,440
K-Y-L-E-I-G-H, Kaylee.

694
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,280
Oh no.

695
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,660
And her last name is?

696
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:18,500
Kaylee.

697
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,920
Yeah, I mean, it's gold.

698
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,440
Oh, Kaylee silver, Kaylee gold.

699
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:25,120
We're like, we're destined to be best friends.

700
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:28,440
And for the past, fuck, 12 years,

701
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,880
she's been my ride or die, you know?

702
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,320
And then she comes at me, her eyes went somewhere else.

703
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,720
She was just staring at my gut

704
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,280
and she was trying to tear me apart.

705
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:42,160
She was trying to tear me apart.

706
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:45,360
Sorry, shit, fuck, keep it down, Kaylee.

707
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,640
She was literally trying to get inside me.

708
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,160
How often was it brought up

709
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,360
that gold is better than silver?

710
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,600
She starts crying.

711
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,200
And Cal's like, was better than silver.

712
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,340
I look at back, I'm like, please say you got it,

713
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,840
please say you got it.

714
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,200
And she just nods.

715
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,040
Cal is kind of taking this all in

716
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,400
and there is usable footage,

717
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:19,460
but basically like this segment can't air as is, right?

718
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:22,120
We can't just throw this on the news.

719
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:26,180
Ms. Silver, if I could huddle with my crew for a moment,

720
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:30,960
we wanna discuss the best way to cover your incident here.

721
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,120
Yeah, no, of course I trust you.

722
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,720
Like I said to whoever I talked to on the phone,

723
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,860
I trust you, Cal.

724
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:41,360
I know that you believe in the truth

725
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,520
and I know that you are gonna find it, okay?

726
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,520
You have to.

727
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:49,060
That, like that stabs at Cal

728
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:53,480
and he lingers a moment on her gaze and nods.

729
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:56,080
A cat jumps up onto the countertop and she says,

730
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,480
oh, hey girl, hey girl.

731
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,320
That's Kaylee bronze.

732
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,160
It's girl.

733
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,280
I mean.

734
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,400
Either way, Cal is walking away from,

735
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,720
like he's huddling up.

736
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,560
Yeah, totally.

737
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,360
And Kaylee is just petting the cat

738
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,760
and trying to calm down.

739
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,480
And Julius is a camera off camera.

740
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,960
Against Beck's better judgment,

741
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,560
he doesn't ever like to turn the camera off

742
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:22,320
in a place like this, but he goes ahead and does it.

743
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,360
You've been in a place like this before?

744
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,640
Yeah, Cal kind of leads everybody out in the hallway.

745
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,720
The backs of your brains are fucking on fire.

746
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,300
None of you can think straight.

747
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,040
This is not your job.

748
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,360
This is not normal.

749
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,400
You are not having a normal day.

750
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,000
You have some serious decisions to make

751
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,880
that might have ramifications on the rest of your lives.

752
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,880
We have to call 911.

753
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,680
The police, my dudes, the police are needed here

754
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:51,320
and like fucking yesterday.

755
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,400
I'm glad to hear you both say that.

756
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:56,880
I don't think we can err until the police are notified.

757
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,800
We have to call them immediately.

758
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,520
I'm gonna put you on that, Jesse.

759
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,000
Pfft.

760
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:06,960
Which is what he says.

761
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:07,800
I'm looking around.

762
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:09,920
Fuck yes.

763
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,880
Beck and Julius are looking at each other.

764
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,400
I'm looking for Mr. Lemon.

765
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,520
But yeah, Julius is calling 911.

766
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,080
911, what's your emergency?

767
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,600
There's been a...

768
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,400
Wait, hold on, let me take that again.

769
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,240
911, what's your emergency?

770
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,400
Now, why is everybody in the city caging?

771
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:36,320
911, what's your emergency?

772
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,160
Okay, let me try again.

773
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:40,360
It is city funeral tradition to have a crawfish oil.

774
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,520
Yeah, that's true.

775
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,800
Yeah, but that was like Mardi Gras in St. Louis.

776
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:47,160
Like, I don't talk like that.

777
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,800
911, what's your emergency?

778
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,640
911.

779
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,040
The Calvin story.

780
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,880
On the 911 plan.

781
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,800
911, what's your emergency?

782
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,720
I need to report a murder.

783
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,920
Oh, what?

784
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:13,760
Holy shit!

785
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,640
Literally, she's like, oh, okay.

786
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,640
What's your address?

787
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,960
I tell her the address that is on that piece of paper.

788
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:22,800
Yep.

789
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,640
Oh, that's downtown.

790
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:24,920
Is that an apartment building?

791
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:28,840
Yes, it's on the eighth floor, 836.

792
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:32,400
I didn't do it, but I know who might have.

793
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,240
Cal's like.

794
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:36,120
And they left.

795
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:38,080
They're gone, long gone.

796
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:40,320
Julius is obviously not reading the signals

797
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,280
from his partner as well at all.

798
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,960
And he's like, nevermind, they're in the apartment.

799
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,720
Cal is fierce.

800
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,120
What are you, no.

801
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,600
Hold on, hold on.

802
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:52,080
This is someone who knows more.

803
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:55,000
Hello, Cal, Colorado, City Action News.

804
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:55,920
Oh, hi.

805
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,840
They're, wow.

806
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,680
May I ask who I'm speaking to?

807
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:05,680
Yeah, my name's Jennifer, and I am speechless,

808
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,920
but I need information as soon as possible.

809
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:10,760
Well, Jennifer.

810
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,960
And I'm talking to the right guy.

811
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,000
I'm having a hell of a day.

812
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,520
How's yours going?

813
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:17,880
I, it was fine until now, I suppose.

814
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:20,560
Tell me more about this homicide.

815
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:24,200
Well, we were called to investigate a news story.

816
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,760
You know, that's what I do.

817
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,200
I do know that's what you do.

818
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,440
With those, nope.

819
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,800
It's fine, it's fine.

820
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,080
With those piercing blue eyes of yours.

821
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:33,920
I know.

822
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,800
No, Jennifer, when we got down here, oh, I got Southern.

823
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:41,200
I'm Southern, I see it, rubs off on people.

824
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,680
Sorry, I thought I left this accent

825
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,000
when I got to the city, but.

826
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,400
Oh, no, it comes back so quick, don't it?

827
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:52,000
There is a terribly mutilated body in this apartment.

828
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,200
Now, the young woman here says she did it,

829
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,520
but she says it was in self-defense, an act of necessity.

830
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:02,040
The violence visited upon this corpse might belie that fact,

831
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,240
but we are not the police.

832
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,840
That's why we need you here to look at this.

833
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:10,400
I think I'm going to Obama.

834
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,000
Well, yeah, I mean, take this as high as you can.

835
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:13,840
Take this as high as you can.

836
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,660
Take this as high as you can.

837
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:15,500
Take this as high as you can.

838
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:16,320
Take this as high as you can.

839
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,160
Take this as high as you can.

840
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,000
Take this as high as you can.

841
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,240
Do you know Obama?

842
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,400
Roll the tape, you know Obama.

843
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,480
Well, I don't want to brag,

844
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,880
but I did interview him when he campaigned in the city.

845
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:28,000
There is a picture of you and him hanging in your hallway.

846
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,880
Yeah, one of the many pictures in the hallway

847
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:30,840
is of Cal and Obama.

848
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:33,000
It's not as big as the one that's Cal and Michelle.

849
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:33,840
Sir.

850
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,520
Okay, so I need you to stay on the line with me.

851
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,960
Officers are on their way

852
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,760
and they will be there very shortly.

853
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,920
Was there a murder weapon?

854
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:47,920
There appears to be, again, we're not investigators.

855
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,960
We are journalists.

856
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,240
We listen to the people who have found the facts

857
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,240
and we try to report them as best we can.

858
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:57,440
Now, is there a horribly bloody

859
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,200
broken beer bottle on the floor?

860
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,800
Yes.

861
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:05,360
Is that the device that ripped this woman's neck apart?

862
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,680
I could not say.

863
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:08,320
Wow, okay, thank you.

864
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,480
Have you talked to the woman who said that she did it?

865
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,940
Has she told you anything more

866
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,720
than just the fact that she did it?

867
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,360
Well, she told us she did it

868
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,360
and we immediately called you.

869
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,960
Well, that was a very smart decision.

870
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,080
We felt that literally anything else

871
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:25,200
would be incredibly incriminating

872
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,240
and it might implicate us in her crime.

873
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:30,760
I'm very glad that you are not gonna go to prison, yes.

874
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,760
Well, me too.

875
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,280
That would have been not as fun to role-play,

876
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,120
I don't think.

877
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:39,160
I'm sure we could have come up with something.

878
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:44,080
And role-playing prison would be another cool thing.

879
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:44,920
You're right.

880
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,880
Cal Colorado in prison.

881
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,720
Holy shit.

882
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,960
It might have to happen.

883
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,680
All right, I have word that officers

884
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:56,320
are on their way up the elevator to your location right now.

885
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:59,080
And down the hallway, you hear the elevator.

886
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:06,000
B-roll of cops pouring out of the elevator.

887
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:06,840
Ding.

888
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,680
Bex on it.

889
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,560
Like smoke billowing from a chimney.

890
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,920
These cops bumble out of this fucking elevator.

891
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,680
Don't remind me of my.

892
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:22,000
All right, it's clearly the premium team.

893
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,280
And they approach you.

894
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,600
It's two officers and.

895
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,680
Two officers come pouring out of the elevator.

896
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:38,520
Oh, sorry.

897
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,840
It's six officers.

898
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,320
After they get close enough

899
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,760
that I've got a good shot of them,

900
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,840
I wanna kinda put the camera down tiny bit

901
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,880
and I wanna talk to them before they talk to us

902
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:48,720
and I'm just gonna say,

903
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:52,440
officers, she's not violent currently

904
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:56,000
and she kinda has a rapport with Cal here.

905
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,600
You might let him ease you guys in there.

906
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,040
Ooh, role persuade.

907
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,800
Fuck.

908
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,040
It's a 60 on a 50.

909
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,920
I'm gonna go ahead and use my luck.

910
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:09,760
Ooh.

911
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,960
Cause I wanna film Cal talking to her more.

912
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:12,800
Awesome.

913
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,640
Six, that's a good one.

914
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,840
The first officer, you can tell by the look on his face

915
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:20,080
that he's about to talk down to you

916
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,480
and as he goes to talk,

917
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,320
he's got a frog in his throat

918
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,760
and one of the officers behind him says,

919
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,760
yeah, I think that's probably a good idea.

920
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,200
Cal, dude, she trusts you

921
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,960
and like, I think at the end of the day,

922
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,680
turning herself into the police is the right idea.

923
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,000
I just think you need to make sure

924
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,880
that she's convinced of that

925
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,280
and maybe get to the bottom of why she did this

926
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,280
and he's kinda winking so the cops can't see.

927
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,800
You know, ask her some questions

928
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,920
about what put her in a state of mind to do this

929
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:53,000
and maybe get more about like what was happening

930
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,040
right before they did this.

931
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:58,800
And try to do a dance with her if you can.

932
00:39:58,800 --> 00:39:59,640
Hahaha.

933
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:08,120
Cal has been like nodding, preparing his interview.

934
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:08,960
Yeah.

935
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,720
And then he hears that last part.

936
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,560
Hahaha.

937
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:16,040
And he kinda like, I will do what I can.

938
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:18,000
Julius gets his phone out just in case.

939
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:18,840
Hahaha.

940
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,520
Yeah, Beck is definitely pulling up the camera

941
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:25,120
and gonna just follow him into the room.

942
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:27,520
As you go back in, you see Kaylee is at the kitchen island.

943
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,880
She's hunched over and looking at her phone

944
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:35,880
and she has wide eyes that cannot look away.

945
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:40,500
And she's just staring at the screen.

946
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:43,580
Cal kinda waves his hand in front of her eyes

947
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:45,580
and like snaps.

948
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:47,880
Kaylee?

949
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,000
Miss Silver.

950
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:50,840
I have a furbo.

951
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:53,060
I'm sorry, what?

952
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:56,560
Ger, when I am out at work, I have a furbo.

953
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:59,200
It records motion.

954
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,480
Cal, she's got a camera.

955
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,840
My producer is telling me that's some kind of camera.

956
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:05,000
She holds the phone up to you

957
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,620
and you're looking at footage from inside this apartment.

958
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:12,840
You see Kaylee gold before she became the corpse

959
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:15,000
laid out on the couch.

960
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,560
In this grainy video, she's sitting on that same couch,

961
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,360
petting Ger, shooting the shit.

962
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:24,380
In the kitchen, you see Kaylee Silver

963
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:26,680
before she killed her friend.

964
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,380
She walks through the background

965
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:30,720
and grabs a beer from the fridge.

966
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:34,080
There's no label on the bottle, all is well.

967
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,800
Kaylee gold is laughing.

968
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:39,480
Kaylee Silver cracks her beer open, all is well.

969
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:42,440
Kaylee gold begins telling a story.

970
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:45,080
Kaylee Silver takes a swig.

971
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,780
Something changes.

972
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:50,380
Kaylee gold's neck snaps like she's a dog

973
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:52,780
and Kaylee Silver's a squirrel.

974
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:54,520
Gold's posture gets weird.

975
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:58,380
She lunges, reaching out for Silver's stomach

976
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:01,200
just under the neon crop top.

977
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,060
I need you guys to roll grip.

978
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,560
Pass with an 18.

979
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,600
I pass with a five.

980
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,400
I pass with a 26.

981
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,340
We're still at Missleman.

982
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:13,700
Kaylee Silver cries out.

983
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:17,800
You can see the fear and panic and confusion in her eyes,

984
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:20,940
both on this Furbo footage on her trembling phone

985
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:23,580
as well as on her trembling face.

986
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:26,620
In the video, she shoves her berserk bestie backward

987
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:30,440
out of frame, but when Kaylee gold comes back into view,

988
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:34,060
she's propelled herself horizontally through the air

989
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:36,180
and she spears Kaylee Silver

990
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:39,020
into and over the kitchen counter,

991
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:41,820
out of the Furbo camera's view.

992
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:45,900
You hear screams of anguish and glee

993
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:47,540
and you hear a glass bottle break

994
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:49,840
and a splash of beer hits the fridge.

995
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:55,020
But then you just hear a percussive and visceral

996
00:42:55,020 --> 00:43:00,020
scrunch, scrunch, scrunch, scrunch, scrunch, scrunch.

997
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,620
Then silence.

998
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:09,220
Then a heartbreaking wail.

999
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:13,860
Kaylee Silver stands here, phone out, frozen,

1000
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:17,500
tears filling up as much of the eyes as possible

1001
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:20,340
without yet spilling down her face.

1002
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:22,860
Kaylee, I'm glad you called us.

1003
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:25,380
I'm glad you could trust me.

1004
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:29,220
You're gonna have to go with the police now.

1005
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:31,980
Can you send me that footage before you go?

1006
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:33,580
Cal like glares at you

1007
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:36,300
but doesn't necessarily say anything to stop that.

1008
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:37,740
She hands you the phone.

1009
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,060
I email it to myself.

1010
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:41,260
Beck is just gonna kinda chime in.

1011
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:42,580
He doesn't normally do this.

1012
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:44,740
From behind the camera, he's a silent viewer,

1013
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:48,940
but he's now seen that she's 100% been truthful with us.

1014
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:51,340
You've got the proof right here, you're gonna be fine.

1015
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:52,860
She attacked you.

1016
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:54,580
Just as a little comforting word.

1017
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:56,300
She's looking at the door

1018
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:59,780
and she can sense the cops on the other side of it.

1019
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:01,100
I don't think we closed the door.

1020
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:03,980
Oh, okay, then she can see the six cops

1021
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:06,660
just kinda like peering in, staring.

1022
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:09,340
One of them's got handcuffs in their hands ready to go.

1023
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:11,660
I load up the video that I just sent myself

1024
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:14,300
and like go to show it to one of the cops.

1025
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:17,260
As you do so, the other one walks in.

1026
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:20,900
Ma'am, you have the right to remain silent.

1027
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:23,140
Everything you say can and will be held against you

1028
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:24,140
in a court of law.

1029
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:27,380
As he's like Miranda-ing her, Cal is saying,

1030
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:31,020
Kaylee, the video shows you acted in self-defense.

1031
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:33,780
Just tell them the truth, everything will be fine.

1032
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:34,980
It wasn't normal.

1033
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:35,820
It wasn't.

1034
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:37,340
What the fuck was it?

1035
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:38,620
They'll find out.

1036
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:41,100
Or will find out, please.

1037
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:43,540
And she is walked out the door

1038
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:45,820
and one of the other cops is like,

1039
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:49,100
all right, camera boys, get on out of here.

1040
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:51,180
Can't have you in an active crime scene.

1041
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:54,100
Can I try and use my 30% stealth

1042
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:57,060
to have kind of inched my way further back

1043
00:44:57,660 --> 00:44:59,980
into the apartment to maybe get some wider angles

1044
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:01,020
of everything in the room?

1045
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:02,620
I think you can do that for sure.

1046
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:06,140
One.

1047
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:07,580
Yeah, dude, are you serious?

1048
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:08,860
I rolled a one.

1049
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:13,180
Oh my God, that's amazing.

1050
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:14,940
I don't know if this is the best roll to have that on,

1051
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:15,780
but it's fun.

1052
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:17,460
You can get any shot.

1053
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:19,580
As you're getting a roll around the apartment,

1054
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:23,980
you see that Kaylee Silver is an avid home brewer.

1055
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:24,900
She made the beer.

1056
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:25,940
She made the beer.

1057
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:27,660
Oh, that's dope.

1058
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:29,020
That is super dope.

1059
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:30,780
Which one?

1060
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:31,620
Silver is the brewer?

1061
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:33,460
Silver is the brewer, Silver's apartment.

1062
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:34,700
Gold is the friend.

1063
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:36,820
As soon as Silver drank the beer,

1064
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:39,140
Gold's neck snapped to attention.

1065
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:39,980
Fuck yeah, dude.

1066
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:40,820
Thank you for that.

1067
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:43,420
That's a good nugget on a crit.

1068
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:45,260
That is a good nugget.

1069
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:46,580
Also the kind of shit we would have spent

1070
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:48,460
like five episodes not finding out.

1071
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:52,700
And Zach would be like, why don't you solve my mystery?

1072
00:45:53,980 --> 00:45:55,860
Perfect, perfect impression.

1073
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:59,220
I want to get pregnant with you.

1074
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:03,180
Don't do my normal voice on the show, dude.

1075
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:05,820
I've been working really hard on the podcast voice.

1076
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:09,100
I want to have a baby, Thomas.

1077
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:10,460
I want to have a baby with you.

1078
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:17,860
Julius texts his uncle, just like two thumbs up.

1079
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:18,740
We've got gold.

1080
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:21,860
Fuck.

1081
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:30,340
Hey Joe, should you be like a sleazy news producer?

1082
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:34,860
Cal looks blank.

1083
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:37,740
And he's kind of like looking around the apartment

1084
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:39,140
and just shaking his head.

1085
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:40,780
And he starts to walk out

1086
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:43,420
and he puts his arms around both of you.

1087
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:46,860
Boys, I haven't had a drink in 25 years.

1088
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:48,660
As the elevator doors are about to close,

1089
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:52,260
you hear Kaylee Silver holler out through the hallway.

1090
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:53,620
Help me, Colorado.

1091
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:55,780
You're my only hope.

1092
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:59,460
You see Cal's throat like completely close up at that.

1093
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:00,500
And he gulps.

1094
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:04,420
I'm taking you boys to the foundry.

1095
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:22,940
Ramona is scanning face to face to face

1096
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:24,580
around the table.

1097
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:26,220
What are you guys doing right now?

1098
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:28,220
She licked me.

1099
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:29,420
With that penis tongue?

1100
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:33,020
She was like, so did you zoom in on it?

1101
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:34,580
Oh my God.

1102
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:35,620
Had you?

1103
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:36,660
No.

1104
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:37,940
Did you then?

1105
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:39,580
No.

1106
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:41,100
Will you in the future?

1107
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:41,940
For you?

1108
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:42,780
Yeah.

1109
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:43,620
No, not for me.

1110
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:44,860
Jesus fucking Christ.

1111
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:46,140
I don't want to look at it.

1112
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:47,500
No, please don't.

1113
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:49,900
I was never into like looking at any of those,

1114
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:53,540
like, oh, two girls, one cup, a donkey man.

1115
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:54,820
Like I didn't watch any of that shit.

1116
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:55,660
Luke does.

1117
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:56,500
Donkey man.

1118
00:47:57,580 --> 00:47:58,500
Oh my God.

1119
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,100
It does look like a tongue.

1120
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:02,100
You're right.

1121
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:02,940
I'm bummed out.

1122
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:03,780
I know.

1123
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:10,260
Well.

1124
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:12,140
I say again, can we restart season two?

1125
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:23,580
Cause my life is great, and it's all mine.

1126
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:37,700
Cause my life is great, and it's all mine.

1127
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:51,220
I'm bummed out.
