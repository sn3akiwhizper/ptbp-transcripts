We have survived pirates, shark people and hurricanes raining blood and I wouldn't have wanted to go through it with anyone else. Thanks for a great adventure, love Blythe. You know, that was real sweet, except for that part about shark people and bloody precipitation. That sounds nasty, Wolf the dog kinda nasty.

Officers Bishop and Pettymore headed to the suburbs to chat with Dr. Marie Jacobs when sharpie. Our brave and heroic contingent police officer Keith Vigna was made unconscious by Billy Harrison, the man found tied up in the trunk of Charles Donovan, the drunk who threatened the woman at Forgotten Treasures. Both of these cats have told officers that they are friends of John Peters. Now speaking of cats, Dr. Marie Jacobs seems to be up to no good y'all. Officers Bishop and Pettymore found man sized fecal matter in the litter box and then doctor the sides of the hospital bed that you are in. Billy Harrison, your uniform and your gear are nowhere to be seen. However, the door to this room is now open and a decent amount of the clinic staff is standing around outside it. Some of them are pointing their phones at you. All of them are laughing.
216.92 229.52 speaker2  the room with bolt cutters and breaks the links on your cuffs, leaving you with a pair of nice iron bracelets.
228.24 232.72 speaker1  Are you okay?
230.96 251.04 speaker2  We're not entirely sure. It seems that you may have been unconscious for, for some time. The man that you came in with is no longer here.
250.04 262.64 speaker1  Okay. I want to see if I can see security footage to see where he went off to or how he got away.
257.44 269.60 speaker2  You can go check and she'll take you to go look at the security footage in the clinic and they really just have like a couple cameras in the lobby.
267.40 277.80 speaker1  We were at the clinic and not the hospital, right? Correct.
271.60 308.60 speaker2  The footage shows Billy Harrison in your uniform, just walking out the front door. As you, as you, as you, uh, as you get to the front door, it is rather dark outside. What time did we get here? Early evening. and for him to come to. Is that right?
307.60 328.44 speaker1  I rode here in the ambulance, didn't I? Correct. So I'm going to have to radio the guys to come get me. I think. Okay.
321.88 502.64 speaker2  John had just finished getting handcuffs on Dr. Marie Jacobs when she hollered, and you heard something glumping up the stairs from the basement. down the stairs and you see a man with blood pouring down his face onto his chest from a seemingly broken nose. He is wearing a pair of novelty boxer briefs featuring Pepe Le Pew and a black collar around his neck. And he is on all fours making his way up the stairs at a rapid pace. And yell, stop right there. Same. So, Clark, he is going to jump at you. He is like raising up onto his hind legs. Any visible claws? No claws, just hands. And he is, it looks like he's pouncing on you. All right. Against his unarmed combat. He passed 40 on a something. And so John, you actually see right next to you, this man takes Clark to the ground with his hands on Clark's shoulders. Huh? What the fuck? And it is John's action. Jesus. Correct. She is not doing anything right now because it's your turn. Get off. Fuck man. I don't know what to do in a cat man situation. Uh, I want to try to like kick him off. Okay. Get out of here. Get out of here. trying to grab and like, I'm trying to push him with my leg muscles. Okay. Neither one is great. Ooh. Yeah. He's distracted right now.
498.48 513.48 speaker1  Like wherever I think I'm going to get the most leverage, like center mass, like right Right? Yeah. It's just a solid like rib like.
512.48 535.68 speaker2  Yeah. Right in the ribs. Clark.
534.68 542.80 speaker0  That is correct. Does this guy look like the husband? This is Doug Jacobs. Okay.
541.80 550.32 speaker1  Yes.
549.32 555.72 speaker2  face
553.92 557.72 speaker1  I want to try and cuff him.
556.72 592.00 speaker2  Roll law or dexterity. Oh fun. Okay. You reach out and throw a cuff on the hand that has reached out for your face and you can pretty easily get his other hand cuffed as well. Nice. Okay. So you just kind of do a maneuver and roll over on him and handcuff him. So now you are on top of him and he is face down on the ground and he's just kind of laying there. He's not worried about it. He seems domesticated. Clark.
588.48 612.80 speaker1  Dr. Jacobs, do you want to tell us what the hell is going on here? Why is your husband a cat man named Salem? Do you want to describe the process? Oh, 95. All right.
611.80 621.92 speaker2  You both lose one. I'm at 42 now. I'm at 43.
618.64 658.86 speaker1  Hey, Salem, Doug, can you hear me? In English? He doesn't speak English. How did he become a cat? You can't have cat golems. It's not a golem. It's... Listen, lady, whatever the hell this is, you can't have, okay? I didn't ask for this. This belongs in a science lab or something.
652.98 661.06 speaker2  You can't just take away my cat because he happens to be taking the place inside the
658.86 732.56 speaker1  body of my husband. Oh. It's a regular old Salem in the body thing. It's a freaky Friday? Did your husband get freaky Friday-ed? How did your husband get freaky Friday-ed? I'm not positive, but it happened when I got the radio. You didn't think this was something you needed to tell anybody? I think we needed that. I think we can all understand that a little bit. Is your husband in Salem?
730.64 751.96 speaker2  I was fine to be rid of him. If he wants to wander the streets as a kitty cat, that is totally fine by me. I don't think this concerns the police, honestly.
748.52 780.28 speaker1  There's a lot that feels illegal here, but you're right, I can't exactly put my finger You've been checking your P's and Q's here?
779.28 810.38 speaker2  Yes! because he's a giant man now. I mean he's a regular, he's a tall man, he's not, you know, giant per se, but...
809.26 821.06 speaker1  This is not your cat.
817.34 824.38 speaker2  On this matter, if you could just leave me be, I don't see an issue here.
823.14 835.16 speaker3  Me and you, yeah. Charlie guy took it.
830.54 848.26 speaker1  Right, and the lead we have on him is falling up on his hotel room, where maybe all this stuff might be waiting for us. what's in it for me? I don't, Clark wouldn't though, right? Probably?
847.26 866.46 speaker3  No. Yeah. But Clark is also a little insane and doesn't know, like, we real quick were happy with the Freaky Friday explanation, which I'm cool with, but so I don't know where to take him from here.
862.50 896.86 speaker1  He might just in the moment like, uh-huh, yeah, okay. Yeah. We've got to secure this cat man somehow. Thanks. Salem in for further questioning. Just Salem?
895.86 897.86 speaker2  Salem?
896.86 926.36 speaker1  In Doug's body. In fact, most of our laws are about the harming of those vessels. This seems like harm.
922.30 941.14 speaker3  Do we, I don't know if we need to take them like taking them in would be handy for us if we need to ask him or anything, anything more, but also just, I think it would be hilarious. Yeah. Doctor, uh, I'm afraid we're going to have to take you down to the station for 24 hours,
939.88 950.66 speaker2  Put this on the books. Who's going to believe you? You're all going to be fired immediately.
949.66 982.74 speaker1  right now. We don't have a whole lot of supervision at the moment, so I think for 48 hours we can, uh, get some more out of you. Well, I think that's genuinely horrifying. I think your cat husband is genuinely horrifying. He's also that.
981.74 985.34 speaker2  Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa. Oh, sorry, sorry.
983.74 1000.86 speaker1  This is his favorite toy.
997.66 1026.02 speaker2  kind of thing that Salem immediately perks up at. I go and grab it. He's on the ground and he's handcuffed behind his back, but he is shuffling kind of over to you and nipping with his mouth at the end of the cat toy. That's real unsettling. mouth.
1025.02 1055.98 speaker3  Yeah. Come on. Follow me. Meow.
1049.86 1073.10 speaker2  She's laughing to herself the entire time she walks to the cruiser. And once you guys get out to the cruiser, you get a call from Keith Vigna on your cell
1063.72 1079.10 speaker1  phone. Welcome back everybody. Do we start? He didn't say one.
1078.10 1083.10 speaker3  Start over.
1082.10 1093.26 speaker1  Welcome back everybody. Did he? He didn't say it. We got to start over.
1092.26 1094.26 speaker3  I'm not getting it.
1093.26 1103.92 speaker1  No, I'm not getting that one. There's a short in my. Not getting that go.
1098.26 1105.92 speaker2  So Clark, you receive a call on your cell phone from a number that comes up as the contention
1104.92 1115.70 speaker3  Officer Bishop. Hey, it's Keith. Hey Keith.
1112.22 1118.74 speaker1  Our imitating life.
1115.70 1136.06 speaker3  I got a couple of perps in my car. I'll send John your way. Who's the perps. Uh, congratulations. You'll uh, cool.
1132.42 1138.06 speaker1  let John see me when he gets here, send him over my way.
1137.06 1149.38 speaker3  That's what I'll do. Okay. Have a great one. Bye. I click. Uh, Hey John. It sounds like Keith fucked up again. Yeah.
1145.82 1154.06 speaker1  He's just becoming less and less effective as he loses motility.
1150.80 1169.20 speaker3  I'm going to take these guys back to the station and uh, I'll meet you guys there. Right on.
1166.66 1175.88 speaker2  The sun is very down by now. It is a late evening. Yes, I can. You can walk now.
1174.88 1177.88 speaker1  Okay, cool.
1176.88 1190.48 speaker2  You're just a little hobbled. Gotcha. Luke, do you want to describe what John sees when he pulls up?
1188.44 1300.08 speaker1  they're handcuffs and I had to cut the chain. So the chains are just kind of flopping down on either side and uh, I have no shoes or One woman and one undetermined. It's a little breezy in this gown. The guy that we took to the, to the clinic. Yeah. Okay. Something was up there and then he, I was kind of catching onto something and so he, I don't really, it was kind of a blur, but next thing I know, you know, people are taking Did he cuff you with your own handcuffs? He did. Vigna. Shoot.
1294.84 1304.54 speaker3  Let's just get back to the police department so I can get into a change of clothes.
1303.54 1326.04 speaker1  Cat man? He just thought it and in fact didn't thought it. So. Okay. We followed up on Dr. Marie Jacobs and that radio Freaky Friday'd her husband and her
1325.04 1329.68 speaker3  According to her.
1326.04 1356.42 speaker1  Her husband is in her cat's body and her cat is in her husband's body? You are grasping it right away. Cool. So as soon as we get you all- Wait, so do you arrest them? We arrested the husband's body and the cat and Dr. Marie Jacobs. He meows. He's a friendly little bugger though.
1354.98 1410.56 speaker3  This'll be a sight to see. to get together some blankies and, uh, make, it's like a cat bed, but for like a human size cat in one of the cells for me. So I'm using the toy, but I'm also hoping that she is taking up the rear. She is. Yeah. No, they're gonna, yeah. She's going to play ball.
1406.96 1417.88 speaker2  one open cell inside it is a blanket palette. The other cells are filled with stuff that you guys took from the storage units.
1416.88 1431.98 speaker3  Right. I'm going to lead them both into the cell.
1430.98 1436.18 speaker2  No one.
1433.98 1445.50 speaker3  Drew, you believe me that this is a cat man?
1444.14 1448.50 speaker1  Another late night. Um, yep.
1447.50 1450.50 speaker2  You said cat man. Yeah.
1449.50 1489.78 speaker3  That's you believe me. Drew, you believe me? Yes. Excuse me. So we at least got something going here. We're going to figure things out, but, uh, for now I just want you guys to rest in here. Can we get, can I borrow that? Uh, Drew, uh, we got hers. Doug is a cat man. too. You should check them up.
1488.78 1516.18 speaker2  Sounds good. I'll, I'll start putting it in the system. So John and Keith arrive at the station.
1514.34 1521.18 speaker1  put it on with my gown on. I'm not even taking my gown off. I'm just putting it on over my gown.
1520.18 1528.58 speaker3  Keith.
1527.58 1564.16 speaker1  set of handcuffs? Yes, but I lost the key to them. Soldier boy handcuffed him up and stole his gun. Oh, he's also out there with his uniform, so we should probably get on that. That's nice. Keith. I don't think the other, you could have stopped it from happening either.
1562.86 1588.34 speaker3  We can spin this. we're having the conversation. I'm going in and finding the keys for the cuffs. Yeah. So while I'm uncuffing him. So before he got the jump on you, did you get a chance to talk to him, glean anything from him?
1587.34 1596.38 speaker1  Yeah. Hold on.
1595.38 1603.42 speaker3  Yeah. He hit me in the head pretty hard.
1600.86 1629.26 speaker1  about him being friends with John Peters. He told me they played video games together, but I don't know why he was like peeking around hadn't talked in a while. And as soon as I showed any kind of a, like that I wasn't believing him, he, that's when it kind of turns into a blur.
1628.26 1633.70 speaker3  to find his keys. So people keep trying to say that they're his friend and then get weird.
1632.70 1641.94 speaker1  Yeah, that's true.
1639.10 1710.94 speaker2  Hey, um, can I talk to you real quick in the back room? Sure. gore everywhere. Now I, I asked her if it, if it looked like a deer and she said no, but I convinced her that it was just, uh, that we'd heard like a deer accidentally fell off a water slide. Did you guys, what's going on, John?
1708.82 1718.86 speaker1  Uh, so we had to shoot her. Clark just, you know, right between the eyes.
1717.86 1752.78 speaker2  The what now? John, I found all the cocaine in the lockup. cocaine Dean. Do you know how much there is? How much it costs? Oh, don't you worry about that one. Okay.
1751.78 1774.78 speaker1  I'm going to level with you. We don't know what it is, but we've got it under control. We're working towards it. I feel like we're about to break this thing. You know what would help a whole lot though? What? If we had Maggie around. Don't worry about these reports, man. Just focus on finding the chief.
1773.78 1798.90 speaker2  I will. Um, you wouldn't, John, you, you wouldn't be interested in unloading that cocaine, would
1797.90 1803.78 speaker1  No.
1801.02 1831.10 speaker2  That's millions of dollars worth of cocaine. In fact, that's $10 million worth of cocaine.
1830.10 1833.10 speaker1  Let's sell this cocaine.
1832.10 1852.10 speaker2  Holy shit. We already have a buyer set up in the city and he's going to pay us $10 million. If we get Keith and Clark in on it too, they can help out and that's two and a half million dollars each. That's $3.3 million each, but that's going to be hard.
1848.42 1865.90 speaker4  I don't know if we need to get Keith in on this. That's $5 million each. You and me, buddy.
1863.66 1894.54 speaker2  back from him on where to meet. And he's got a glint in his eye of like pure ecstasy. And he's just like giggling. He's very happy. And then he's like, also, I fixed the four wheeler. Hell yeah, buddy. Okay. Okay.
1893.54 1902.46 speaker4  Okay.
1901.46 1906.46 speaker1  So don't. Okay.
1905.46 1927.34 speaker4  Okay. Oh boy. Okay. Cool. Yeah. Okay. Bye. And he walks back out into the room.
1926.34 1929.34 speaker2  Hell yeah.
1928.34 1949.66 speaker1  Okay.
1947.74 1955.14 speaker3  How long ago did this all happen? Two hours ago.
1953.50 1964.32 speaker1  I looked at the security footage. The only shot they got out of him was like him leaving the lobby, basically dressed as me.
1960.74 1969.66 speaker3  Hey drew, in the last hour or two, you get any calls about us working on something you had heard from us about?
1966.74 1976.54 speaker1  Let me double check that my car is still parked out front. It is. Cool. So yeah, he didn't steal my car though. So we got that going for us.
1974.54 2015.24 speaker3  So why did you arrest them? At the very least it seemed like things weren't right. So on a hunch. He's got this real bad bloody nose. So we, I mean, at the very least he's hurt. Did she punch him or she says, so yeah, here's the, so she had the radio, right? So back at the treasured place. So she was the one who bought the radio. So we went to see if she had the radio. She said, no, somebody had taken it. We said, who? And she described a tall, angry surly man had come and taken it. Did that ring any bells? We think it's Charles.
2013.58 2024.66 speaker1  We think you rung his bell earlier today. Yeah. Okay.
2023.66 2064.78 speaker3  We've not been there yet. So that's kind of our biggest lead. When he came in, he punched Salem Doug cap man. That should be our next step for the mystery, but we should probably find there's somebody
2063.78 2077.54 speaker1  Ooh. I like that. So we know he was looking for John Peters, I think. So maybe we should say that John Peters is somewhere and then he won't be there, but
2076.54 2088.56 speaker4  Yeah.
2087.56 2097.82 speaker3  That's true. So this guy might be out for vengeance. He might be at the hotel already. Did you tell him that you killed Charles?
2096.82 2098.82 speaker1  place.
2097.82 2106.32 speaker4  Okay. Wonder where Charles first ran into this guy. You know, where did he abduct him?
2103.20 2122.60 speaker1  I think when I asked him, I think I might've suffered a concussion too. Just don't let me go to sleep.
2121.60 2129.36 speaker3  Much better. We can probably take three cars then.
2128.36 2135.68 speaker1  I can drive.
2134.68 2143.36 speaker2  John Peters house.
2140.60 2155.32 speaker1  kind of confronted him on it and that's what started the violence.
2151.94 2159.42 speaker3  Did he say why he was snooping, why he was looking around the windows?
2155.32 2178.56 speaker1  He said that John Peters is his friend and they play video games together and he hadn't heard from him in a while, so he went over to check it out, but that's kind of when his How old is John Peters? And Billy, Billy Harrison is probably around that same age, right? I think his ID said he was 31.
2177.56 2191.04 speaker4  Yeah. It makes sense that those guys would play video games together.
2190.04 2199.36 speaker3  Yeah. Can you remember any specifics about how his story started falling apart? Do you remember where you caught him?
2195.56 2237.24 speaker1  Well, they had grown up together, I think, and then for a long time had just been playing video games together and they weren't like super close friends. So it was just strange that he would feel the need to go to his house, especially when all of this crazy stuff is going on. And then it was, it made me even more suspicious when he attacked me. This fella.
2236.24 2252.62 speaker2  Holiday. you'll all lose some willpower.
2250.04 2279.96 speaker1  I feel like we should go now though because it's while it's fresh. Just depends on what he's doing. If he's doing crime or if he's, yeah, what if he's out there just doing our jobs? Did we ever figure out where he was, what country he was a soldier for? He might be an Al-Qaeda. You got your ass kicked by a Canadian soldier.
2278.96 2283.86 speaker4  He's a Mountie.
2282.86 2292.58 speaker3  How much? Just to get that back. I can't remember mechanically. You regain it when you sleep? Okay.
2291.58 2349.26 speaker2  Okay, cool. How much are we going to lose if we stay up? your shit together when going through a mental disorder or staying up late or trying to resist interrogation or anything of that nature. It'll also maybe come in handy when spells are introduced. If they are willpower is also used for that.
2344.14 2371.06 speaker1  As a, as your character, would you trust Keith to go out looking for the guy that bested him last time? Where else would you want to check out then?
2370.06 2388.18 speaker3  I like that. Cool. Uh, we do want to take all separate routes. Oh cool.
2384.66 2392.18 speaker2  Let's go ahead and get a luck roll from each of you first. Pass.
2391.18 2398.38 speaker3  Uh, pass.
2397.38 2400.38 speaker1  Luck.
2399.38 2405.86 speaker4  That's a lucky night.
2404.86 2422.42 speaker2  Fail. Crit fail. We all.
2421.34 2431.46 speaker4  Hot.
2428.38 2445.42 speaker2  It's midnight and there are a couple cars.
2444.14 2454.06 speaker4  Another night at hotel motel.
2453.06 2457.30 speaker2  cars there.
2455.06 2469.20 speaker1  Do we have a room number and the keys to the room? You have your keys to your room and to Charles's. What's his room number? What's your room number? One Oh eight.
2468.20 2477.14 speaker2  What do you guys think? Do you think that the room number would be on the key?
2476.14 2483.62 speaker1  Then yeah.
2482.40 2486.94 speaker2  Welcome to my home guys.
2485.22 2489.82 speaker1  I thought you would never come visit me. It's just temporary. How am I the only one trying to pull over How can you heaven knows how
