00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,300
Welcome. Please enter my future listeners.

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:15,900
It's your new obsession, Wolf the Dog, and I'm crawling deeper and deeper into your ear holes from 694.2 PTBP,

3
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:23,900
the newest, best, and only radio station in a very real town called Contention.

4
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:27,400
Tune in to our hit show, Pretended to be People,

5
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,700
to hear three bumbling police officers.

6
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:31,800
Keith Vigna,

7
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,300
I'm not a bad cop, I'm just a bad cop.

8
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,400
John Lee Pettymore IV,

9
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,300
I fire my pistol into the air.

10
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,000
and Clark Bishop,

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,200
Can we call the president?

12
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:51,400
as they struggle against their own incompetence in a futile attempt to save their small town from an ineffable threat.

13
00:00:51,400 --> 00:01:04,500
The limp bodies, after sliding into a pool of their own blood, are picked up and slammed into the ground repeatedly and at an absurd rate by some unseen force.

14
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:10,300
And then, as if they were never there at all, both bodies are gone.

15
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:14,300
All while navigating some unique citizens.

16
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,800
A cold chill runs down Clark's spine.

17
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,400
It's a fucking cat man!

18
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,600
Surreal horror.

19
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,800
It was somebody who knew I watched Wheel of Fortune every night.

20
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,700
And gruesome crime scenes.

21
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,900
The skin on her back was branded with the phrase,

22
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,600
This is a fool.

23
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,600
And the cause of death was blunt trauma.

24
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,800
Hell yeah, dude.

25
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:46,500
Keep in mind, Pretending to be People is available wherever you listen to podcasts.

26
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,100
So come on down to Contention.

27
00:01:49,100 --> 00:02:00,700
Join your new grown-ass man-pet-friend-narrator DJ Wolf the Dog in this greasy dumpster filled with deliciously wet nibbles.

28
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:04,200
And enjoy Pretending to be People.

29
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:24,000
Thanks for watching!
