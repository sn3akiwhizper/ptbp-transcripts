00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,720
Welcome one and all to Contentions most exciting local news radio show, ran by yours truly,

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,520
Wolf the Dog.

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:11,120
Now let's jump right into some news.

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,300
Now I heard the officers went to Chief Maggie Cook's house, and boy wouldn't you know it,

5
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:16,300
she wasn't there.

6
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:20,680
And then they went on over to everybody's favorite bar, Klinker's.

7
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:25,560
You know, the one with the daycare in the back, serving up all the gourmet treats such

8
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:31,000
as hot dogs on white bread, ya boy Wolf's favorite meal.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,480
Julie Maxwell had a restraining order put out against Leo Piston back 15 years ago for

10
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,000
killing her sister Ashley.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,360
Now that is some messed up shit.

12
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,720
And John found the Chief's blue notebook, but where was the red and yellow notebooks?

13
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:48,800
And wouldn't you know it that some idiot at City Hospital fucked up and put Julie Maxwell

14
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,920
in the morgue.

15
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,600
She woke up from a coma and started bloody screaming.

16
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:59,520
Remember to tell your friends to tune in to 694.2 PTBP for all the hard hitting news

17
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,520
and best variety of music in Contention.

18
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:09,360
And we got a world premiere of a new song for y'all today, it's Kudzu with no backbone.

19
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,960
County called back about the junkyard body.

20
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:33,880
Drew looks nervous as he hands you the note, and the note says that body had been dead

21
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,440
for years.

22
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:44,000
The internal organs seem to have not functioned in roughly two centuries, but the skin and

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,700
hair looks to have died on December 1st.

24
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:52,520
They've never seen anything like this down at County, so go ahead and roll sand for me.

25
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,520
Wowza.

26
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,520
10.

27
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,520
Oh nice.

28
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,520
60.

29
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,520
I mean I assume you have far more than 10 sanity.

30
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,280
I'm feeling real good about hearing that crazy shit.

31
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,280
Yeah.

32
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,560
You immediately play that off in your mind, you rationalize it as either they don't know

33
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,560
what they're doing.

34
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,560
They messed something up.

35
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,560
They messed something up clearly.

36
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,320
You got some time to kill before the Piston Brothers come out.

37
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:20,280
Clark definitely wants to look at the file on the Ashley case when she was hit by the

38
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,280
car.

39
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,280
Oh the Ashley Maxwell.

40
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,280
Yeah.

41
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,480
Okay, so diving into the old file on the death of Ashley Maxwell, you'd find out that she

42
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:34,540
was on her way to Splashylvania, the town's weird vampire themed water park to meet up

43
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:35,540
with some friends.

44
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:41,920
Clark would remember that Splashylvania used to bring in snow machines in the winter months

45
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:47,360
and let the townspeople sled down the water slides that use sleds and go down.

46
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,700
This was very obviously a fucking awesome but terrible idea.

47
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:57,180
And after more than a few broken bones, the water park has only been open in the summer

48
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,360
months for the past decade or so.

49
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,760
So Ashley never showed up to the winterized water park that day on December 1st, so long

50
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,760
ago.

51
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,000
So her sister Julie went looking for her.

52
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,160
Julie found Ashley's body face down in a watery ditch on the side of the road.

53
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:20,360
She also saw the beat up truck that her former classmate Leo Piston drove around town.

54
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,880
It was heading toward the Piston pig farm.

55
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:30,280
The autopsy showed that Ashley had a severe concussion but actually died from drowning.

56
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:36,780
Leo Piston eventually broke down in a testimony and admitted that he had gotten out of his

57
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:42,660
truck to ask Ashley a question and he must have scared her because she sprayed him with

58
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:48,860
pepper spray and in his flailing about he accidentally hit her in the head and he immediately

59
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:51,620
drove home to get water on his eyes.

60
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:57,940
The Maxwell family, Ashley's family, was fervent in their disbelief of this story but the judge

61
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:02,480
was easy and gave him one year of juvenile detention.

62
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,860
So that's basically what you would learn from that file.

63
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,440
And what time of day was all that?

64
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:11,660
Right after school, basically on December 1st, so her and her friends and her sister

65
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:17,540
and her friends, they were all meeting up to go do the like sledding at Splashylvania.

66
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,540
But she never made it.

67
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:19,540
Sad.

68
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:22,960
Who was the officer or detective on that case?

69
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:28,300
I think the chief would have taken lead for sure on the, yeah, dead teenager.

70
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,300
I dig it.

71
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:33,780
So that one, that probably took you a while to go through, find all that info.

72
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,300
And yeah, Clark was just doing that to refresh himself.

73
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,300
For sure.

74
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,300
Yeah.

75
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,300
For sure.

76
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:44,620
This is the first block when an awkwardly tall, skinny man with gin blossoms and bad

77
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:48,500
teeth walks into the police station and he is visibly distraught.

78
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,860
This is not George Piston.

79
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:55,140
He walks right past Drew and stumbles a bit into your desk.

80
00:04:55,140 --> 00:05:01,100
You can smell the alcohol in his breath as he mumbles, my friend is gone and you haven't

81
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,500
done anything about it.

82
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,740
Where is this missing person's whatever?

83
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,820
Why aren't you looking for him right now?

84
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:07,820
Do I recognize him?

85
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,060
You've never seen this guy before.

86
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,060
Whoa, buddy.

87
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,340
Hey, what are you doing?

88
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,340
What's going on here?

89
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:16,740
My friend is gone and you're not doing anything about it.

90
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:20,020
I'm standing up and trying to get him to sit down in my chair.

91
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,900
Just he just seems wobbly.

92
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,100
And so, yeah, you can, you can get him down.

93
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,100
Yeah.

94
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,820
Hey, uh, but what's, what's going on?

95
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:27,940
You're you're, you're talking gibberish.

96
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:28,940
Yeah, you're fine.

97
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:33,500
He stands up and he comes around to your side of the desk and starts like messing through

98
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,500
your papers.

99
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,500
Hey, whoa, sir.

100
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,260
Hey, I need you to sit down.

101
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:39,220
You got to do your fucking job, man.

102
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,220
All right.

103
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,980
I'll listen to you, but you got to sit down first.

104
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:42,980
All right.

105
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:43,980
All right.

106
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:44,980
All right.

107
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:45,980
What's your name?

108
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:46,980
Officer Bishop.

109
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:47,980
Officer.

110
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:54,140
I just, my friend John Peters is gone and I went by his house earlier and the lock was

111
00:05:54,140 --> 00:06:01,020
busted and there was a mess inside and he hasn't been online in like a couple of days

112
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,540
and that's not like John.

113
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:10,420
And so I need to, I need to know why you're just sitting here when he's fucking gone.

114
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:13,020
We, we, uh, we've actually been alerted to that case.

115
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,300
We've, we've been working on it.

116
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,740
Uh, when was the last time you saw him?

117
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:19,220
I haven't seen him in like forever, honestly.

118
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:27,440
We just like, you know, he's just an old friend from the days and we used to know each other.

119
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:39,940
So I, I just, I, he like starts crying and then he like stands up and just walks to the

120
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:42,840
back of the police station basically.

121
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:46,120
And he just is like looking around at different stuff.

122
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:49,020
Hey, hey bud, come up, come back over here.

123
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,280
What's your name?

124
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,280
Your name?

125
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,040
Your, your officer Bishop.

126
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,040
Yep.

127
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,040
You got that right.

128
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,040
Now what's, what's yours?

129
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,040
I'm Charles.

130
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,600
Hey Charles, come, come on back here.

131
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,360
That's let's get to the bottom of this right now.

132
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:11,040
That's someone, someone fucking, I took my friend I think, and you need to find him.

133
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,320
Why do you think somebody took him?

134
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:16,520
Because his shit is broke and somebody clearly busted into shit.

135
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,520
Yeah.

136
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,440
Do you have a reason to think that somebody would want to do that?

137
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:25,360
Well, his fucking keys are gone and his shit was broke and so his car's fucking gone and

138
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,160
like I know John and he wouldn't do that.

139
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:34,040
So do you know anybody who would want to do that to him with somebody who fucking know

140
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,040
I, John's a chilled ass dude.

141
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:40,960
I, there's no reason that anybody would want to be taking him.

142
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,960
All right.

143
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,960
We came to that conclusion as well.

144
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,960
Do you have this stuff?

145
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,960
What did you find?

146
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,960
We didn't find a whole lot there.

147
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,880
We are under the assumption at this point that he left in a hurry.

148
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:57,440
But fucking, yeah, I, someone left in a hurry probably with him cause he wouldn't do that.

149
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,480
Do you have his, do you have his keys?

150
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,480
Yeah.

151
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,480
Yeah.

152
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,480
But we, we, we've got his keys.

153
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,840
Let me see his fucking keys.

154
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,000
Why do you want to see his keys?

155
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:13,640
Cause I don't, I don't necessarily trust you if you're like yanking me around.

156
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:17,080
I mean I'm an officer of the law, you can trust me, but just to get this over with,

157
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,080
sure.

158
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,280
Okay.

159
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,280
Cool.

160
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,880
I pull them out of my desk and I'm holding them way far away from him and literally showing

161
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,880
him.

162
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,880
Okay.

163
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:31,360
He like puts both of his hands like on the desk and leans in and boy howdy does his breath

164
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:38,560
just reek of booze and he is staring very intently.

165
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,800
He holds his hand out and he gets kind of sad and he's like, can I see him?

166
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,120
Oh no, you can, you can see him.

167
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,120
You can't touch him.

168
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,440
Can I see him with my, with my hand?

169
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,800
I'm sorry, sir.

170
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,320
Uh, have you had something to drink tonight?

171
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,320
Yeah.

172
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,520
How'd you get here?

173
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,120
I got a car.

174
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,120
Did you drive here?

175
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,120
Nah.

176
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,480
If I went outside, would I see a car that wasn't here earlier?

177
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:13,160
No, I'm, I mean, I, I walked and he leans back, I, uh, I'm putting the keys back in

178
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:19,480
the desk while that exchange is occurring and just, just give it to me straight officer.

179
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:27,760
Sir, we, uh, we don't know where your friend is right now, but I can promise you that we

180
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:34,240
hear a sound from the parking lot of the police station, like abrupt thunder or a small explosion.

181
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:40,240
Charles, the guy standing in front of you immediately pulls a gun and runs outside.

182
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,240
What do you do?

183
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,240
Holy shit.

184
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,320
Sir, wait, no.

185
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,320
He's fucking.

186
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,320
Stop.

187
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,320
Okay.

188
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,320
If he's already outside, I'm running after him.

189
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,320
Okay.

190
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:53,800
As you, as you run out the door of the police station, you see the older piston brothers

191
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,640
truck has been T-boned on its driver's side.

192
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:03,600
A large black SUV is reversing onto the street and begins to drive east.

193
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,600
Roll alertness.

194
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,600
Holy shit.

195
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,600
Uh, 95 on a 70.

196
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,600
Okay.

197
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,960
I didn't see any of that.

198
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:21,240
You see Leo piston in the driver's seat of this black SUV and you fail to note the license

199
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,040
plate as it begins to drive away.

200
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:30,000
Charles runs to a car that is parked in the parking lot and gets behind the wheel.

201
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
What do you do?

202
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I'm yelling.

203
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
No stop.

204
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Gun is probably drawn.

205
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Yeah.

206
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Gun is drawn on him.

207
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Okay.

208
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Stop.

209
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,840
I'm probably getting around to his driver's side if he's already getting in the car.

210
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,080
Oh yeah.

211
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,080
He's getting in.

212
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,800
Uh, go ahead and roll athletics to get.

213
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,800
So real fast.

214
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,800
Yeah.

215
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:52,080
The black SUV t-bone t-bone what car George pistons truck, which was sitting in the parking

216
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,080
lot.

217
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,080
Any sign of George?

218
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,080
Yeah.

219
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,080
George is in his truck.

220
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,080
He's been smashed.

221
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,080
You can kind of see him.

222
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,880
He's behind the wheel of his own truck.

223
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:05,760
So Leo, his brother smashed him in the black SUV driving in the black SUV.

224
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,760
Uh, okay.

225
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,960
So you wanted me to draw a, do athletics.

226
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,960
Yes.

227
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:13,280
Uh, 61 on a 30.

228
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,280
Okay.

229
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:20,480
So as you run up to the car that this new fella Charles is in, he backs up and he's

230
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,200
got enough time to get onto the road before you can really get to him.

231
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,200
What do you do?

232
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,600
He's, he's on the road in his car.

233
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,920
He is pulling out of the police station parking lot onto the road.

234
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,920
Fuck.

235
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:37,000
I am running over to my cruiser and getting on the radio.

236
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,560
We got a situation down here guys.

237
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,560
Come on.

238
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,560
Uh, Oh shit.

239
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,560
Uh, fuck.

240
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,440
Uh, we got a, we got a, uh, a wreck in the parking lot.

241
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,600
There's a, uh, a guy's just taken off gun in hand.

242
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,880
Leo's in a, in a black SUV.

243
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,600
I didn't catch the damn plate.

244
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,880
I need, I need some help down here guys.

245
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,880
Perfect.

246
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:58,840
Ooh, it's going down.

247
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,840
Everything's happening.

248
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,840
It's all happening.

249
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,840
Nice.

250
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,840
Cool.

251
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,840
Okay.

252
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:10,440
So if you'll remember, Keith was at the piston pig farm and you had just climbed over the

253
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,440
fence.

254
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:18,480
Keith, as you walk up on the massive piston pig farm, you see a large farmhouse, a small

255
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:24,600
farmhouse, a barn, a warehouse, and acres and acres of land.

256
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:31,880
Leo's old rusty farm truck sits next to the small farmhouse and there is a large SUV next

257
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,920
to the large farmhouse.

258
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:39,760
Sitting next to the large warehouse is a line of old school buses, most of which are broken

259
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:44,760
down and have plants and tall grasses growing up in and around them.

260
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:49,000
Go ahead and roll luck for me.

261
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,880
That's a 19 on a 60, 19 on a 60.

262
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,880
That's a pass.

263
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,880
All right, cool.

264
00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:01,660
So as you approach, as you're walking up to the pig farm, you feel warmth running under

265
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,260
your left foot.

266
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:09,540
As you realize you hear the sound of a gunshot, you look down and see some blood pooling underneath

267
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,540
your shoe.

268
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,980
Take one point of damage and roll sand.

269
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,620
I failed my sanity check.

270
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:19,520
Okay, so go ahead and lose one sanity as well as one hit point.

271
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,520
What do you do?

272
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,520
So I'm bleeding.

273
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,540
I want to see where exactly did I get hit?

274
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,540
Right in the foot.

275
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:26,540
Right in the foot.

276
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:27,660
Do I know where the gunshot came from?

277
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:28,980
Like which direction?

278
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:33,060
Go ahead and roll search.

279
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,060
Don't pass.

280
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,060
Okay.

281
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:40,100
You're looking around and you hear, you're doing a trespassing there, sir.

282
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,780
I didn't mean to hit you.

283
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,500
Just meant to scare you a bit.

284
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,020
And it's coming from the large farmhouse.

285
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:52,160
And as you look up to see where this voice is coming from, you see a woman in the window

286
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,540
of the large farmhouse and she's like holding a rifle.

287
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:58,900
I'm going to like hold my badge up and hold my gun up.

288
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:02,220
Officer Vigna, I need you to put your weapon down right now.

289
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,220
Oh shit.

290
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,560
Keith, is that you?

291
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,560
It's me.

292
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,460
Little Keith Vigna.

293
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:09,460
Holy shit.

294
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:10,460
Yeah.

295
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,580
Do you have a first aid kit in there?

296
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:12,780
You shot me in the foot.

297
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:13,780
I am.

298
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:14,780
God damn it.

299
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:19,540
She comes running out and she's holding a, she's holding a first aid kit.

300
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:23,080
And as she runs up to you, she's like, Oh fuck officer.

301
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,220
I am so fucking sorry.

302
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,900
Get that shoe off for me real quick.

303
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,500
I kicked that shoe off.

304
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,500
Okay.

305
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,260
And so also can we do this inside?

306
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:33,540
Oh yeah, absolutely.

307
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:38,660
So she'll take you like you can put your arm around her and she'll walk you into the large

308
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,660
farmhouse.

309
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,660
Okay, great.

310
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:46,920
So she sits you down on a, on an old chair, slides an ottoman over and as you're in here,

311
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,820
you would see this place is, yeah, I want to do like a quick look around.

312
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,740
It's actually kind of nice in here.

313
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,420
It's not too dirty.

314
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:58,460
There's some stuff about, it's not super tidy, but it's not like overly messy.

315
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:01,860
And it's not overly gross in any sort of way.

316
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:06,700
So she'll get your foot up on that ottoman and begin wrapping it.

317
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:12,140
And she says, seriously, officer, I shit, I did not mean to actually hit you.

318
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:15,940
I was just, I didn't even recognize you and I didn't see the uniform.

319
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,300
I was just really worried.

320
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:21,100
I, you know, with all, I don't, I don't know, you know, you got to protect your property

321
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,100
and whatnot.

322
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:28,600
I understand, but I need you to understand what you did is a high crime here.

323
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,600
High crime?

324
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,600
High crime.

325
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,600
High crime?

326
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,600
Oh Jesus.

327
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,780
But you know, I, I came without warning.

328
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:37,660
So you know, I think I get what I get at this point.

329
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:41,700
The Maggie, Maggie cook sent me to look or have a look around here.

330
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,580
Oh, why is that officer?

331
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:47,900
Oh, you know, just, it's part of a part of the investigation.

332
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:51,100
You're not in trouble or anything, but this has to do with the body at the junkyard.

333
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:55,820
I didn't say that, but well, I mean, George, George is headed out with Leo down to the

334
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:56,820
police station.

335
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:01,980
So I would assume that you stayed behind to what now?

336
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:09,780
Well, just to make sure nothing, there was no trouble you trying to live up to that family

337
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:10,780
name of yours.

338
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:15,700
I guess I knew that I didn't think anyone was home, so I was just going to do a quick

339
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,860
search of the perimeter, make sure nothing was up and I was going to get, get back to

340
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:19,860
the station.

341
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:22,340
Did you have a, did you have a warrant for that?

342
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:28,460
Yeah, but, uh, I've dropped it as soon as you shot me cause it scared me so bad.

343
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:36,420
Uh, you're going to roll persuade against her human.

344
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,620
That's a 50 on a 70 for me.

345
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:39,620
Okay.

346
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:40,620
And she failed.

347
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:46,880
So, uh, and for the listeners, human is human intelligence and it would be like deciphering

348
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,360
human emotions through action and voice.

349
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,960
She uh, she buys it.

350
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,360
Oh, oh shoot.

351
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,360
Okay.

352
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,360
Uh, well fuck.

353
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,360
I am.

354
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,360
Oh boy.

355
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,360
Okay.

356
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:05,680
Well, you know, Keith, I knew your parents and you know, I, I, I'd really appreciate

357
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,120
you letting this one slide.

358
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,720
I think, I think we, I think we're on the same page here.

359
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:13,480
You know, I think if you just, if you put on a cup of coffee for me and let me just

360
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,200
take a look around, we'll forget that this ever happened.

361
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,200
Sounds good.

362
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:22,520
Uh, so she goes back and as she's walking back to the kitchen to put on a pot of coffee,

363
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,880
her phone starts doing the alarm.

364
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:33,520
That's like the, that, that annoying alarm from the atomic meltdown.

365
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:38,240
And she hollers from the other room, Hey, um, I've, I've actually got some, some coffee

366
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,240
back here.

367
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,240
That's ready to go.

368
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,240
Do you like iced coffee?

369
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,880
Not really, but I'll drink it.

370
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,880
I guess.

371
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,880
Okay.

372
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,880
That's, that's perfect.

373
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:50,280
I'll be back fairly quick with a plastic cup with iced coffee in it.

374
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:54,320
That's so you can take it to go and kind of looked at you.

375
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,840
Well, uh, that's awful nice of you, but I will be sticking around for a minute, uh,

376
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,280
to take, take a little peek around.

377
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:04,520
If you got something to do, feel free to go do that and I'll lock up behind you, but I'll

378
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,520
be here for a minute.

379
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,640
Oh, okay.

380
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:11,040
And I glanced down at my foot and then glanced back.

381
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,040
Yeah.

382
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:17,320
And she's like, uh, okay, uh, I'm, I'm gonna be right back then.

383
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,320
Okay.

384
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,320
Take your time.

385
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,320
She, uh, pops out the back door.

386
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,320
Okay.

387
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,320
Fuck yeah.

388
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,320
Free range.

389
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,320
I think I'm going to just do some snooping in this main house real quick.

390
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,320
Okay.

391
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,320
What are you looking for?

392
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,320
I don't know.

393
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:34,880
Particularly like anything that just doesn't seem like the pistons would have like, I know

394
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,580
in my mind who these people probably are, right.

395
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:42,300
Anything that pops out, out of the ordinary, I'm going to be digging through, not digging

396
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:45,620
through drawers, but open drawers up, looking through that and just kind of searching this

397
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,260
main house at first.

398
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,260
Gotcha.

399
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,260
Okay.

400
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,300
So this main house is like I said before, it's, it's fairly well kept.

401
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:55,100
It's pretty clear after snooping around for a while that this is where Kathy and George

402
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,100
live.

403
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,220
And they have an extra bedroom.

404
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:02,440
That's a guest bedroom that is completely neat and unused.

405
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:08,560
There's another room in the farmhouse as well that it is filled with Mary Kay stuff.

406
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,560
Okay.

407
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,560
Yeah.

408
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,640
And you would know Kathy, which is this woman, Kathy Piston.

409
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,640
She's a Mary Kay.

410
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,640
That's her side hustle.

411
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,640
Yeah, absolutely.

412
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:23,920
And she's like very into it and wears kind of an absurd amount of makeup for a pig farmer.

413
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,920
Right.

414
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,920
Okay.

415
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:30,480
So if I don't find anything of interest in there, I'm going to go over to the small farmhouse,

416
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,800
which I assume is Leo's.

417
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

418
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:38,400
It's where his, uh, his old beat up truck is parked as you, uh, go ahead and roll alertness

419
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:43,120
for me 92 on a 60 nice.

420
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:53,440
As you are going to the small farmhouse, you see the door on the big warehouse shut.

421
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:58,200
There's no one standing around there and you just see the door shut and you walk into the

422
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,900
small farmhouse.

423
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:03,380
This is Leo's place and it is quite different.

424
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,140
It is a shithole.

425
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,140
Filthy.

426
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,140
It's gross.

427
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:13,340
He works with the pigs all day and he does not take off his shoes when he gets home.

428
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,340
Gotcha.

429
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:18,300
So there's pig shit inside this place like casually look around.

430
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:21,100
I'm not going to investigate too bad in here cause I don't want to be in here.

431
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,100
Yeah.

432
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,100
It smells fucking awful.

433
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,060
There's like rancid food in the kitchen.

434
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:26,380
Is it just one story?

435
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:28,100
It is one bedroom.

436
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,620
The bathroom and the kitchen are like one thing together.

437
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:34,820
I'm going to glance around real quick and see if I find anything.

438
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,180
Go ahead and roll search for me.

439
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,180
Nope.

440
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,380
46 on a 40.

441
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:39,380
Pig shit.

442
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,380
Pig shit for days.

443
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,140
I get out of there like ASAP and then I want to go.

444
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:50,120
You said there's the warehouse and then a, like a shed or, uh, there's a barn and a warehouse.

445
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,120
That's it.

446
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,120
Yeah.

447
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,120
Yeah.

448
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,900
Um, since I saw the warehouse door closed, I'm going to go to the barn first and leave

449
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,900
the warehouse to be my last place.

450
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:57,900
Okay.

451
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:02,980
So you would go and open up the barn door.

452
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:05,880
It's two big swinging doors right in front of it.

453
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:11,100
And inside is just bales of hay, a couple of horses.

454
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,100
This is like the stables basically.

455
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,100
I'm going to go pet one of the horses.

456
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,100
Cool.

457
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,100
It's chill.

458
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,100
Cool.

459
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,380
Uh, I want to glance around, kind of poke around a little bit.

460
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:22,460
See if there's any, this seems like a good place to hide something.

461
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:23,460
So sure.

462
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:24,460
Sure.

463
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:25,460
Sure.

464
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:26,460
Go ahead and roll search for me again.

465
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,460
Shit.

466
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
75 on 40.

467
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,520
Killing it.

468
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,980
I'm doing some Vigna style police work.

469
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:35,800
This is some Vigna police work.

470
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:39,500
You look around and there seems to be nothing out of place.

471
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,940
This is a normal barn.

472
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:44,700
Wait, did you say the warehouse has the, the buses by it?

473
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,700
Yes.

474
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:50,180
I want to go sneak into one of the buses and post up and see if I see anybody coming out

475
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,180
of the warehouse.

476
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:53,180
Okay, cool.

477
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:54,180
Okay.

478
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:58,300
Where are you going in inside this bus and which bus are you going to?

479
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:02,460
I'm going to the bus that's closest to the door that I saw close.

480
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:03,460
Okay.

481
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:06,700
And I'm going to just get in there to where like I can just pop down if I see somebody

482
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,700
and hide.

483
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,700
Okay.

484
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:09,700
Sounds good.

485
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:14,540
You're kind of looking out the window, uh, in one of the back seats of the bus and you're

486
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:20,060
looking at that door and the door opens and Kathy pops her head out and is scanning.

487
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,060
You roll luck.

488
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:22,060
Oh.

489
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:24,940
49 on a 60.

490
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:25,940
Okay.

491
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:30,740
So she kind of scans over to where you're at and you pop your head down just in time.

492
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:38,660
And then as you pop your head back up, she comes out the door with a line of people.

493
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:46,660
So many fucking people start piling out of this warehouse and she gets on the bus.

494
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:47,660
My bus?

495
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,460
The bus that you're in the back of.

496
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:51,400
And she sits in the driver's seat.

497
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,040
And I'm immediately, I'm popping down behind that back seat.

498
00:22:55,040 --> 00:23:01,060
The bus begins filling up with people and you hear voices and it's all muffled and they're

499
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:03,280
all chitter chattering together.

500
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:07,540
And it starts to smell really bad on this bus.

501
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:10,880
And it's not that pig smell from Leo's farmhouse.

502
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,360
It's a different kind of smell.

503
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:20,360
It's the, it's the odor of the homeless population who is now residing on this school bus.

504
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:26,600
There are as many people as can fit on a normal sized yellow school bus plus some.

505
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,600
Are you looking up how many people can fit on a school bus?

506
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,800
God, how many rows are there in a school bus?

507
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,800
Okay.

508
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,800
How many people does a school bus?

509
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,800
It's 72 passengers.

510
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,800
Okay.

511
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:41,520
So there are a hundred people on this school bus and they are not paying any attention

512
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,600
to you, but they are so close to you.

513
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:48,640
You're like crouched behind this back seat and they are smashed.

514
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:55,240
Three people per bench and then everyone like standing throughout the entire row and

515
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,720
the bus begins to move.

516
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,720
What do you do?

517
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,720
Fuck.

518
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:04,160
I'm so fucking glad this is happening.

519
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:12,040
I, um, well shit, I'm going to open up the back door and I hope to God the alarm doesn't

520
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,040
go off.

521
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,600
The emergency door in the back.

522
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,600
Fuck yeah.

523
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,600
Okay.

524
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:27,160
Roll luck for me cause we're just going to see, so yeah, so you, okay, here's what happens.

525
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:34,120
You reach over and you grab the, the handle of the door in the back and as you open it,

526
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:38,160
the door immediately opens and alarm starts sounding.

527
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:43,760
It's going and you fall out the back of the door.

528
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:48,320
Go ahead and roll athletics to see how well you take this fall.

529
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,520
I got a fucking 99.

530
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:56,200
Hell yeah dude.

531
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,520
Um, okay.

532
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,520
Okay.

533
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,520
A critical fail.

534
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,520
It's a critical fail.

535
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:09,640
Uh, so you're going to roll a, we're going to double a d four cause I was going to make

536
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,360
it a d four for falling out.

537
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:16,400
Double a d four, two, like one times two, one times two.

538
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:22,240
Uh, you take two damage, you fall and you fall on the exact same foot that got shot

539
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,660
earlier and your ankle rolls.

540
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:29,840
And so now it is like almost impossible to use that foot and put weight on it.

541
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:36,120
But as you fall out, the door slams back closed and you hear the alarm stop ringing as it

542
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:43,100
slams shut and the bus peels out on the County road and drives away, leaving you sitting

543
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:49,480
in the middle of the road, which is not actually the main drive that you were on earlier.

544
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:52,560
It's this back way that you didn't even notice before.

545
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:57,480
So you were actually probably half a mile from the warehouse, which is on the far south

546
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,920
part of the property.

547
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,920
What's my movement speed at this point.

548
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:05,040
If I wanted to go back to that warehouse, you can hop on one foot.

549
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:10,880
Well, I mean, I'm on the opposite side of where my car is anyway, so I'm gonna hop back

550
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,280
to that warehouse.

551
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,280
Okay.

552
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:20,400
You hop and you're not like the most elegant man on earth.

553
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:27,000
And so you multiple times fall over on your way there, but you make it to the warehouse.

554
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
What do you want to do?

555
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,480
I want to see what's in this.

556
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,080
Oh God.

557
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,280
So you open up the door and

558
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,320
Flashlight on.

559
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,320
Flashlight on.

560
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:41,040
It's dark in there, but there's a lot of windows on the top of the building and probably some

561
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,360
like sunroofing.

562
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,700
This is where all the pigs are.

563
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,320
It's an indoor operation.

564
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:49,800
And so inside the warehouse is this massive pig farming operation.

565
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:53,880
There are hundreds of pigs separated into different sections of the warehouse and what

566
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:58,780
looks to be an irrigation system running just above the head of an average man that sprays

567
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:02,080
cool water down into the pins every once in a while.

568
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,080
Only pigs in here, right?

569
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,080
Yeah.

570
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,480
There's just a bunch of pigs and it smells like pig shit.

571
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,000
Are there any sleeping bags or anything like that or were these people, do I think these

572
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,320
homeless people were there just like for a short amount of time or do you have absolutely

573
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:19,440
no idea how that many people fit in here with all these pigs?

574
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:23,400
Because the rows in between the pig pins are very thin.

575
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,920
Well, not very thin, but like one person, right?

576
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:29,200
Two people, not, you know?

577
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,200
Yeah.

578
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,200
Okay.

579
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:35,200
They would have had to just been standing there for that many people to be in there.

580
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,360
I want to do a search roll just to see if I...

581
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,800
Go ahead and roll a search.

582
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,800
No.

583
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,800
80.

584
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,800
80?

585
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,800
Okay.

586
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,800
So you hop around.

587
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,480
You can use the pins at this point to get around easier.

588
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,480
You don't find anything.

589
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,480
Okay.

590
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,480
I'm going to hop back to...

591
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,480
Oh, hey.

592
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:55,040
Quick reminder, you can burn luck to make any of these rolls a success.

593
00:27:55,040 --> 00:28:00,400
We haven't done that yet in this campaign so far because we've never actually used this

594
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,200
luck mechanic in our home games before.

595
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,720
And so we all keep forgetting about it, but yeah, you can always spend luck.

596
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,520
Wish I would have known about that five minutes ago.

597
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,520
When a lot of bad stuff happened.

598
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,200
Yeah, I forgot about it too.

599
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,160
Well, I guess I'm going to hop back.

600
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,760
I want to hop back to the house real quick.

601
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:19,760
Okay.

602
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:25,320
As you're hopping back to the house, you get a call on your radio, which is attached to

603
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,060
you on your person.

604
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,600
And it is Clark.

605
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,160
We got a situation down here, guys.

606
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,920
Oh, shit.

607
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:32,920
Fuck.

608
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,080
We got a wreck in the parking lot.

609
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:38,120
There's a guy who's just taken off gun in hand.

610
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,480
Leo's in a black SUV.

611
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,160
I didn't catch the damn plate.

612
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,160
I need some help down here, guys.

613
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:54,240
Okay, so you are heading to the hospital in the city to meet Julie Maxwell?

614
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,240
Yes.

615
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:59,520
John Lee Pettymore arrives at the hospital in the city, and as you are walking through

616
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:04,680
the parking lot to the entrance of the large building, a man jumps out at you from in between

617
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,680
two parked cars.

618
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,680
I immediately draw him again and fire.

619
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,680
Roll firearms.

620
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,680
Oh, we're doing this.

621
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,680
No, he's not involved in this.

622
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:25,680
I don't want to do the paperwork.

623
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:29,840
Okay, but you would probably get a hand on the gun real quick.

624
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,840
Yeah, I reached for the handle of my pistol.

625
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:38,840
He's this like weird hunched dude wearing an old tattered robe with a hood that's covering

626
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:42,840
his face, and he says, Oogie boogie there, my friend.

627
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:45,680
I know what you are.

628
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:48,960
I know where you're from.

629
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:54,320
He cackles and he whispers, Say hello to me, would ya?

630
00:29:54,960 --> 00:30:00,960
As he hands you a folded up piece of paper, and he runs away into the darkness.

631
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,960
Oh, there's a lot on this paper.

632
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,960
Oh, shit.

633
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,960
I immediately radio into the station that we're dealing with some kind of robot.

634
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:23,960
The note he handed me is just a bunch of binary, looks to be maybe 20 or 30 words, all in binary,

635
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,600
and then just in English.

636
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:34,600
You know, as if my day wasn't already busy enough, I'm going to radio this in.

637
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:40,600
I'm going to take a picture of this with my phone, send it to Randy and Andy.

638
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,600
Drew.

639
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,600
To Drew.

640
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:47,600
And ask one of them to try to get a translation on that, and while I'm calling them, I also,

641
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:53,600
I don't know if anybody else has done this yet, but those keys we found marked with G10

642
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,240
through 12 or whatever it was.

643
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:01,240
I want to get one of them just so we're doing the legwork of checking out local mini storages.

644
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:05,240
Right, so those keys are in Clark Bishop's desk.

645
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:11,240
Vigna threw them to him earlier when you guys were in the station, and Clark has them in

646
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,240
his desk.

647
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,240
Yeah, you can send that message on to Drew.

648
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,600
Literally, I just need somebody doing the groundwork of like, hey, where is the storage

649
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,600
within nearby that has G units?

650
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,600
You could ask Tim to do it.

651
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,600
G unit.

652
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,600
Yeah.

653
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,600
I'd do that.

654
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,600
Okay, cool.

655
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,600
So.

656
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,600
Real quick.

657
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,600
Who's Tim?

658
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:35,600
Oh, Tim, the guy who works at the police station who does like everything.

659
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,600
Ray?

660
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,600
No.

661
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,600
I just called him Randy, but I definitely thought we went with Ray.

662
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:44,600
It's weird because you think his name is Ray, but.

663
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,600
No, you're pretty sure it's Tim.

664
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,600
I always liked Tim.

665
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,600
I asked him to do that.

666
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,600
Yeah, sounds good.

667
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:57,240
Okay, so as you walk into the large hospital, you see a desk with a woman sitting behind

668
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:01,200
it next to a large Christmas tree and a life-size nativity scene.

669
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,200
What do you want to do?

670
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,200
I'd like to see Julie Maxwell, please.

671
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,600
Yeah, she lets you know that Julie Maxwell is in room 1030.

672
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:12,600
I take the stairs because, you know, you don't want to be a lard ass.

673
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:20,480
All right, so John Lee Pettymore, as you walk into room 1030, you see two beds, and one

674
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:25,080
is an old man with mutton chops and large, thick eyebrows.

675
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:28,480
I immediately hold out my hand and say, hello, Julie.

676
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,160
Oh, what?

677
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,080
The other bed is empty.

678
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,960
My name's Doug.

679
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:34,960
My apologies, sir.

680
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,080
Have you seen a young woman?

681
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:40,280
No, there was a- Any woman?

682
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:43,440
There's like a middle-aged- Yeah, that sounds about right, giving her

683
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,720
past and backstory.

684
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,960
She was crazy.

685
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:46,960
She was in here.

686
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,400
I didn't like her one bit.

687
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,600
I'm glad she's gone.

688
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,600
Where is she now?

689
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:54,200
She just got up, I don't know, about half an hour ago and left.

690
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,440
Thank you for your time, Doug.

691
00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:03,200
I immediately head to security or wherever this place keeps their cameras and ask them

692
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,080
to find out where Julie went.

693
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:09,280
This would take a little time, but you would find out after looking through the cameras,

694
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:16,320
you would see that she walked out the front door half an hour ago, gown open, just heading

695
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,640
out into the world.

696
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:28,040
Okay, I call the city PD and ask if anybody has brought in a gown-wearing crazy woman

697
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,720
matching her description.

698
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:32,280
Not today.

699
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:35,360
The city's pretty rough and tumble.

700
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,600
It's no place to raise a family.

701
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,600
Absolutely not.

702
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:43,320
I kind of explained what's going on and the pretty serious ... This is not just some random

703
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:47,200
... This is a very important suspect in a murder case.

704
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:54,840
So if I explain that, do I get any assistance or offers for a squad car to go look for or

705
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,840
something?

706
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,840
They're busy.

707
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:57,840
You're a small-town cop.

708
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:58,840
They don't give a fuck.

709
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:02,640
If it's a murder case and we get a hold of her, then we'll let you know.

710
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,640
Okay.

711
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,640
Well, you have been no help.

712
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,640
Thank you very much.

713
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,640
Perfect.

714
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,640
I hope no one else dies.

715
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:17,120
How'd you feel if your whole family's faces were smashed or ripped?

716
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:22,160
Okay, so I'm going to take off in my cruiser in the direction that she left and try to

717
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:25,360
look for her, but I also have some other things I want to do while I'm in the city.

718
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:31,840
I'd like to see how close I am to a camera store and how close I am to a dirty dog grooming.

719
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:39,540
You're pretty close to a dirty dog grooming and there are five dirty dog grooming salons

720
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:45,360
in the city and you are also probably pretty near a camera shop.

721
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:50,640
Does John Peter's dirty dog loyalty card mention a specific location?

722
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:51,640
No.

723
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,520
Okay, so I'm going to head to the camera shop.

724
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,800
You get a call.

725
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:59,440
It is someone from the city police station.

726
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:04,440
Yeah, I think we actually clocked your suspect in a gown.

727
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:10,040
She seems to have just stolen a black SUV and is heading west on the highway.

728
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,040
All right.

729
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:15,200
Immediately, I think him and I kick my cruiser, like throw on my lights.

730
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,200
I don't give a shit about jurisdiction.

731
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,200
Hell yeah.

732
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:23,400
I'm going to chase her.

733
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,560
Yeah, I'm going to chase her down.

734
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,560
Sounds good.

735
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,560
She's heading for contention.

736
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:31,960
She's heading for contention, the officer says.

737
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,960
I know.

738
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,760
I'm from there.

739
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,960
You are going to roll drive for me.

740
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:46,880
36 on a more than that, on a 50, no, 70.

741
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,880
Okay, nice.

742
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:53,200
So you speed back into town and you don't catch up with her on the highway because it

743
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,360
seems she got a pretty good head start on you.

744
00:35:55,360 --> 00:36:01,040
Blind with anger and a thirst for justice and answers.

745
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,680
The truth, really.

746
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:09,920
John Lee Pettymore completely spaces the fourth, completely spaces that he should, he should

747
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,360
definitely tell the town that this lady is coming.

748
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:18,320
You were just eyes red, just fucking flying down the highway.

749
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,800
You roll into contention.

750
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:24,440
You drive straight down the main road, right down to the police station.

751
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:32,200
And as you get there, I need you to roll me an alertness check.

752
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,200
My luckier dice.

753
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,200
14.

754
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,080
Hell yeah.

755
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:47,720
As you're driving down this main drag and pulling up to the police department, you see,

756
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:51,720
well first your radio goes off and it's Clark Bishop.

757
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,280
We got a situation down here guys.

758
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,280
Come on.

759
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,280
Uh, oh shit.

760
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,280
Uh, fuck.

761
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,160
Uh, we got a, we got a, uh, a wreck in the parking lot.

762
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:01,240
There's a, uh, a guy's just taken off gun in hand.

763
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,520
Leo's in a, in a black SUV.

764
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,320
I didn't catch the damn plate.

765
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,320
I need, I need some help down here guys.

766
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:12,040
You actually see this black SUV driving east from the police station.

767
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:19,080
You see Leo piston in the driver's seat of this SUV with a horrified look on his face.

768
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:24,240
And you see the barrel of a pistol pressed firmly against the back of Leo piston's head.

769
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,240
Go ahead and roll sanity for me.

770
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,240
Okay.

771
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,440
I passed 54 and a 59.

772
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,440
Okay.

773
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,440
So you lose no sanity.

774
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,200
You were like ready to go.

775
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,200
I'd peel out after him.

776
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,200
Fuck yeah.

777
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:53,080
I'm the only one trying to fool.

778
00:37:53,080 --> 00:38:16,960
How can you have enough drowning out all the notes.
